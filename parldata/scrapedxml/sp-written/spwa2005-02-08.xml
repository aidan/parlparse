  <p>A debate on the parties&rsquo; pleadings will take place on 27 to 30 September 2005. The issue of liability and quantum of damages will be determined by the court if the parties are unable to reach agreement on these issues. It would, of course, be possible for the parties to reach an out of court settlement and the Scottish Executive would give careful consideration to any proposals for settlement put forward by the defenders or third parties.</p>

  <p>We are committed to developing Scotland as a production centre for film, TV and new media and as a location for film-making; to encouraging and promoting wider creative industries, and to supporting the promotion of Scottish films and TV programmes overseas.</p>

  <p>Our support for the film and TV production industries, and to the wider creative industries, is channelled through Scottish Screen, Scottish Enterprise, and the Scottish Arts Council, who deliver a variety of funding schemes and infrastructure development.</p>

  <p>Although broadcasting itself is a reserved matter, we established the Screen Industries Summit Group (SISG) in 2003 to help orient the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s strategy for Scotland&rsquo;s film and television industry. SISG brings together representatives from across the screen industries including Scottish Screen, the BBC, Scottish Media Group (SMG), and the Producers Alliance for Cinema and Television (PACT). SISG was established to report to Scottish ministers. It has acted as a high-level task group to make recommendations on the key actions needed to ensure growth and sustainability for the screen industries in Scotland. SISG identified the increase in network commissioning and production in Scotland from its current 3% level to a target level of 9% within five years as the key action point for the future growth and sustainability of the screen industries in Scotland. We fully support this recommendation and we are working with SISG to encourage the broadcasters to increase production in Scotland.</p>

  <p>We regularly engage with Ofcom to support the interests of the Scottish television industry. In addition, we are working with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport in order to ensure that proper account is taken by the UK Government of Scottish interests in the BBC Charter Review.</p>

  <p>The Review of the Children&rsquo;s Hearings system has identified the need to put robust monitoring and evaluation procedures in place, including procedures to evaluate the outcomes of different disposals. The Scottish Executive will therefore be considering with local partner agencies how we can best deliver monitoring and evaluation procedures. Consideration will be assisted by Scottish Executive commissioned research intended to inform decision-making about the most effective use of secure accommodation. The research aims to provide a clearer understanding of the purpose and effectiveness of secure care in meeting the needs of young people, their families and communities. The project&rsquo;s two interim reports will be published on the Scottish Executive website within the next few weeks.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&rsquo;s main concern is that decisions made by Children&rsquo;s Hearings result in positive outcomes for the child. Children&rsquo;s Hearings need a range of disposals to meet the needs of individual children. Different disposals require different resources. Each disposal must be right for the child.</p>

  <p>East Dunbartonshire Council is required to initiate, facilitate and maintain a process of community planning, in which all relevant public, private, voluntary and community bodies in the area should participate. This duty is established under section 15 of the Local Government in Scotland Act (2003) (&quot;the Act&quot;).</p>

  <p>Effective and genuine engagement of communities is at the heart of community planning. It must involve consultation, co-operation and participation. The local authority is responsible for facilitating this process. The Executive supports local authorities and their partners across the public sector in meeting their statutory duties in relation to community planning, in accordance with Ministers&rsquo; statutory duty to promote and encourage the process of community planning.</p>

  <p>Local authorities, as facilitators of the community planning process, are required to report regularly to their communities on community planning in their area. Reports should be geared towards the needs of the local community. Although such reports are not required to be submitted to the Scottish Executive, reports must demonstrate clearly how the local authority has implemented its duties under section 15 of the Act, including reporting on the means of consulting community bodies (and other public bodies) and a summary of the outcomes of such consultation.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Accounts Commission for Scotland is required to audit councils&rsquo; achievements in relation to their statutory duties under the Act &ndash; including those in relation to community planning &ndash; by means of cyclical Best Value audits.</p>

  <p>Further details are available as part of the community planning statutory guidance: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library5/localgov/cpsg-00.asp" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/library5/localgov/cpsg-00.asp</a>.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Includes acute hospitals, mental illness hospitals and psychiatric units (excludes maternity hospitals).</p>

  <p>2. Information on hospital discharges relates to episodes of in-patient or day case care rather than individual patients. Transfer cases have been included. The same patient may account for several hospital admissions during the course of a year (or across years) and will be counted each time in the table.</p>

  <p>This is an operational matter for the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA).</p>

  <p>Results of its monitoring programme are published in the joint report with the Food Standards Agency, Radioactivity in Food and the Environment (RIFE). A copy is available in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 34135). The RIFE report makes reference to particles found and recovered at the end of the discharge pipeline on the Chapelcross site. Most recently, RIFE 9 reports on page 101 that 21 of these particles were found in 2003. The report explains that the particles have been removed and gives details of the activities planned to tackle the cause of this problem. Monitoring will continue.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive asked SEPA for details of the radioactivity limits of the 21 lime scale particles. This information is shown in the following table. The activity in the particles is predominately due to Caesium 137. The dose rate given is a contact beta gamma dose rate.</p>

  <p>The European Commission&rsquo;s Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) evaluated the safety of emamectin in January 1999. It set an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of 1&micro;g/kg bodyweight/day. The ADI is defined as &quot;an estimate of the amount of a substance, expressed on a bodyweight basis that can be ingested over a lifetime without appreciable health risk&quot;.</p>

  <p>The CVMP also set a Maximum Residue Limit (MRL) for emamectin in salmon (muscle and skin in natural proportions) of 100&micro;g/kg. The MRL is defined as the maximum concentration of a residue that is legally permitted or acceptable in or on a food. As long as a food contains residues of emamectin either at or below, the MRL, the ADI will not be exceeded.</p>

  <p>A person eating a standard 300g portion of salmon containing residues of emamectin at the MRL would ingest approximately 30&micro;g of emamectin &ndash; an amount smaller than the ADI.</p>

  <p>No. There was no need for the Scottish Executive to respond to the consultation carried out by the Food Standards Agency on the CODEX Committee proposals.</p>

  <p>The Food Standards Agency is representing the United Kingdom in negotiating those CODEX proposals on radionuclides in foods and its consultation document made clear what were the concerns to the UK and to the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>Any bids for specific football events are a matter for the Scottish Football Association (SFA) in the first instance. However, the Executive approached the Federation Internationale De Football Association (FIFA) in December 2004 about the possibility of Scotland hosting a future FIFA Club World Championship. FIFA originally responded positively, indicating that they would invite their member associations, including the SFA, to bid for the 2007 Championship in due course. Whilst we understand that FIFA has more recently indicated that a European host for the 2007 event would not now be considered, not least due to the amount of club football already played in Europe, that does not rule out a bid to host the Championship post 2007.</p>

  <p>The Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) recently wrote to its members associations inviting expressions of interest in making a bid to host the European Football Championships in 2012. The SFA has however concluded that its main priority over the next 10 years is &quot;Many Players One Goal&quot;, the Action Plan for Scottish youth football. Separately, however, the SFA has bid to UEFA to host future UEFA Champions League Finals and UEFA Cup Finals at Hampden Park.</p>

  <p>The Executive has provided extensive guidance and support to all Scottish public authorities including the provision of a fully adaptable training package. It has not provided specific additional resources to local authorities as records management and the provision of information are already part of the general responsibilities of any local authority.</p>

  <p>It is the responsibility of each Scottish public authority to ensure that their staff are trained appropriately. However, the Scottish Executive has provided an adaptable learning package which was made available to the entire Scottish public sector at no charge and has also issued extensive guidance. Its Freedom of Information Unit has assisted the Office of the Scottish Information Commissioner in a series of regional seminars and has provided an extensive series of workshops and seminars on request.</p>

  <p>Action on health inequalities is central to our health improvement strategy and we have set ambitious targets in <em>Building a Better Scotland</em> , and <em>Closing the Opportunity</em> <em>Gap</em> , to increase the rate of health improvement for the most deprived communities by 15% by 2008, measured across a range of key indicators.</p>

  <p>NHSScotland has a key role to play in this and we are preparing guidance to support NHS boards in stepping up the rate of change. Community Health Partnerships, which will have tackling health inequalities as a central aim, offer a new opportunity for focused action at local level to make a difference. &pound;15 million invested in Unmet Needs projects is helping to improve access to health care for those in Scotland&rsquo;s most deprived communities and will inform and underpin future practice throughout NHS Scotland. The &pound;1 million per annum support for the Glasgow Centre for Population Health will help create solutions and provide leadership for action to improve health and tackle health inequalities in Glasgow and the West of Scotland, and more widely. Our decision to improve public health through the banning of smoking in public places presents the greatest opportunity in decades to reduce health inequalities and will make a major contribution, given the greatest burden of smoking and ill-health is amongst Scotland&rsquo;s most deprived communities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive uses 23 indicators to monitor trends in health inequalities in Scotland. These indicators were set out in <em>Improving Health in Scotland &ndash; The Challenge (2003)</em> and are listed below for information:</p>

  <p>Trends on Health Inequalities within Scotland for all these indicators were published in March 2004, in a Scottish Executive report entitled: <em>Inequalities in Health &ndash; Report of the Measuring Inequalities Working Group</em>. A copy of this report is available at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library5/health/hirnov03.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library5/health/hirnov03.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p>Health Inequalities in Scotland are measured by comparing outcomes of the 20% most deprived postcode sector areas with the 20% most affluent, defined by the Carstairs Index of Deprivation. (Work is underway to convert the health inequalities measure to the new Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation).</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive uses five indicators to monitor trends of health inequalities within NHS boards. This is done by comparing outcomes of the 20% most deprived postcode sector areas within each NHS board with the 20% most affluent. The five indicators used for this purpose are listed below:</p>

  <p><table border="border">
<tr>
<td width="22%" valign="top"><p>Population Group</p></td>

<p>5. Life expectancy at birth</p></td>

  <p>Recent data and trends for each of these indicators, by NHS board, is available via the NHS Performance Assessment Framework (PAF) system, under section 1.14, at:</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will list the recommendations made by the expert group chaired by Lord Ross on the provision of support to patients who have suffered harm as a result of NHS treatment, including blood-borne infections acquired from contaminated blood products, and what action it has taken in respect of each recommendation.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-02-08.27.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80057" speakername="Mr Andy Kerr" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa0208.htm#14">

  <p>The recommendations of the expert group and details of the actions taken in response to each are as follows:</p>

  <p>Recommendation 1</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive should agree to make compensation payments as a matter of urgency to all people who can demonstrate, on the balance of probabilities, that they received blood, blood products or tissue from the NHS in Scotland before the dates when they were made HCV-safe and who were subsequently found to be infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV).</p>

  <p>A UK ex-gratia payment scheme has been established. The Skipton Fund, which administers the scheme and started operations on 5 July 2004, has to date settled over 400 Scottish claims amounting to around &pound;8.5 million. Details of the scheme are available at <a href="http://www.skiptonfund.org" target="_blank">www.skiptonfund.org</a>.</p>

  <p>Recommendation 2</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive should consider how it could fund and develop other mechanisms for supporting people who suffer from HCV including services delivered by voluntary organisations. In particular, additional support in the following areas should be considered:</p>

  <p>(a) Access to understandable information on HCV</p>

  <p>(b) Counselling Services</p>

  <p>(c) Access to information on benefits available</p>

  <p>(d) Advice and assistance in securing appropriate and adequate assurance and insurance</p>

  <p>(e) Setting up a pro-active publicity campaign spearheaded by the Health Education Board for Scotland.</p>

  <p>(f) Improved access to palliative care and symptom management services when appropriate.</p>

  <p>Since 2002, the Executive has also funded the establishment and on-going activities of the UK Hepatitis C Resource Centre in Scotland which is based in Glasgow and offers advice on testing and treatment to those affected by hepatitis C. The services provided by Hepatitis C Resource Centre are in addition to those provided by individual NHS boards.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has commissioned Health Protection Scotland to estimate the current and future burden of HCV-related disease in Scotland over the next two decades. Further work is also being commissioned to identify how much it will cost NHSScotland to care for individuals infected with hepatitis C and how cost-effective different approaches to hepatitis C case finding and treatment would be.</p>

  <p>The Executive is also developing an action plan, in consultation with stakeholders, for issue in spring 2005. The main objectives of the plan are to set out the actions that will (a) reduce the transmission of HCV and (b) manage the burden of disease among those individuals who know they are infected and those who do not. Key areas of the plan will cover treatment and care and education and training.</p>

  <p>The Health Department is working with clinicians to develop Managed Clinical Networks for Hepatitis C. A further meeting in February is proposed.</p>

  <p>Recommendation 3</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive should invite the Scottish Legal Aid Board (SLAB) to consider the following:</p>

  <p>(a) Proceeding with the development of the template on Advice and Assistance as soon as possible;</p>

  <p>(b) Including in the template provision for meeting/negotiation with the defender;</p>

  <p>(c) Including in the template provision for class actions as well as individual clinical negligence cases;</p>

  <p>(d) Updating the guidelines to the profession;</p>

  <p>(e) Introducing an &quot;interests of justice&quot; test for civil legal aid applications in clinical negligence cases, and</p>

  <p>(f) Proceeding towards the making of staged payments.</p>

  <p>Reform of Civil Advice and Assistance is the subject of recent SE consultation procedures- available from the Executive website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/consultations/justice" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/consultations/justice</a>. This consultation deals with proposals for granting and providing civil advice and assistance, as well as remuneration of practitioners. Templates to deal with different types of cases following the Consultation procedures are to be drawn up as part of this process by SLAB.</p>

  <p>Recommendation 4</p>

  <p>(a) That the Scottish Executive should consider including the following in their revision of the NHS complaints procedure: better training for complaints/claims handling staff; more accessible information for complainants and claimants in clinical cases; more emphasis on face to face or telephone contact to clarify points not clearly expressed; increased support or advocacy for complainants and claimants in the early stages to prevent complaints escalating and to enable complaints to be dealt with appropriately.</p>

  <p>(b) The Scottish Executive should consider encouraging NHS trusts and boards to use their power to make ex-gratia payments under the NHS complaints procedure in respect of &quot;lesser injuries&quot;.</p>

  <p>The Executive has taken all of these points into consideration in devising the new procedure, which it is hoped will be issued within the next few months. The new complaints procedure will place more emphasis on early resolution of complaints with more face to face contacts where appropriate. The Health Rights Information Scotland project (part of the Scottish Consumer Council) will provide a leaflet with information that they consider patients need and will consider in what ways this should be made accessible.</p>

  <p>The power to make ex-gratia payments remains an option for consideration by individual NHS boards on completion of investigations under the complaints procedure. Details can be found at: <a href="http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/publications/me/complaints/CHS/Section2/020_180CompletionOfTheComplaintsProcedure.htm" target="_blank">http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/publications/me/complaints/CHS/Section2/020_180CompletionOfTheComplaintsProcedure.htm</a>.</p>

  <p>(a) We endorse the recommendation made by the Royal Society of Edinburgh in their Report &quot;Encouraging Resolution - Mediating patient/health service disputes in Scotland&quot;, that the Scottish Executive should, in conjunction with the National Health Service Scotland Central Legal Office (CLO), undertake a fully researched mediation project mirroring that being undertaken by the National Health Service Litigation Authority (NHSLA) in England.</p>

  <p>A working group with representation from the Executive&rsquo;s Health and Justice Departments, Central Legal Office, an NHS Board Medical Director, the Medical and Dental Defence Union in Scotland and Edinburgh University was set up to take this recommendation forward and the group is currently finalising a specification for a fully researched project in resolving clinical negligence claims through mediation. The project is expected to run for a period of three years from 1 April 2005.</p>

  <p>(b) The Scottish Executive should consider making initial funding available for Action against Medical Accidents (AvMA) to open a Scottish branch.</p>

  <p>The Executive (Health Department) is currently working with AvMA on a funding proposal to develop AvMA's presence in Scotland.</p>

  <p>(c) The Scottish Executive should invite the Law Society and the Scottish Legal Aid Board to consider increasing the level of fees to solicitors in civil business to enable them to pursue clinical negligence cases and also to enable increased expenditure to be available for payment of outlays in relation to reports, e.g. medical reports.</p>

  <p>An interim 5% increase was made to fees in civil advice in June 2004. This would affect clinical negligence type cases as well as any other type of civil aid case that required to be legally funded subject to the usual tests of probable cause and appropriate to receive legal aid on eligibility grounds.</p>

  <p>(d) The Scottish Executive should draw the attention of the Lord President of the Court of Session to the need for implementation of judicial management procedures for complex clinical negligence cases.</p>

  <p>Enquiries are being made to establish the current position.</p>

  <p>(e) The Scottish Executive should encourage the Central Legal Office to continue and develop its practice of offering structured settlements early in the negotiating process.</p>

  <p>A number of settlements have been reached on a structured basis, and the Central Legal Office will continue to encourage this process in appropriate cases.</p>

  <p>I will write to you separately when enquiries have been completed on 4(f) and will place a copy of my response in the Parliaments Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>- For this analysis, the amount of each discount was converted to 2004 prices on the basis of changes in the retail prices index between the purchase date and 2004.</p>

  <p>- Cases where no discount was granted have been excluded from the data.</p>

  <p>- Not applicable cells occur where no sales have taken place.</p>

  <p>- Modernised right to buy sales were introduced in 30 September 2002 and data collected separately for these sales from 2003 quarter 2 onwards.</p>

  <p>No additional funding has been allocated to NHS boards to assist in the delivery of health services for refugees and asylum seekers.

It is for each NHS board to deliver services to its resident population, including refugees and asylum seekers, from these funds.</p>

  <p>As part of the NHS Scotland&rsquo;s <em>Fair for All</em> programme, NHS boards are specifically required to ensure that the services they provide are equipped to deal with the needs of ethnic minority communities, including refugees and asylum seekers. A National Resource Centre for Ethnic Minority Health has been established with annual core funding of &pound;330,000 to support the development of frontline services. A further &pound;86,550 has been provided in the current year to allow the centre to develop a programme which specifically addresses inequalities in health provision to asylum seekers and refugees.</p>

  <p>All opticians must be registered with the General Optical Council to practice in the UK. They must therefore meet the registration requirements and comply with the code of practice of the General Optical Council.</p>

  <p>Dispensing opticians and optometrists must also comply with their Code of Conduct, which states that &quot;patients must be able to trust Dispensing Opticians and Optometrists with their wellbeing&quot; and that practitioners &quot;have a duty to maintain a good standard of practice and care and to show respect for all aspects of human life&quot;.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers are committed to improving the quality of social care services provided and to raise the level of education and training available to staff working in the sector. Ministers recognise the important role the voluntary and independent sector play in the provision of social care services and the support that the sector as a whole requires to meet the requirements of the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001. There are many influences on workforce development which need to be taken account of in partnership with providers, planners and managers of services and significant additional funding has been made available.</p>

  <p>The Education, Training and Development Working Group, as a sub group of the National Workforce Group, developed the draft <em>Strategy for the Development of the Social Services Workforce </em>which was issued for consultation on 17 December 2004 which sets out the development of the social service workforce over the next five years and beyond.</p>

  <p>The draft strategy identifies various action points including looking at how we can streamline and simplify diverse funding streams. Following consultation, the strategy will be revised to take account of comments received and action will be progressed on this basis.</p>
