  <p>The first phase of the Highlands and Islands Sheep Strategy ended in December 2001, when the achievements were evaluated and a report produced. The evaluation concluded that there were considerable benefits through physical and genetic improvements in flocks.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what level of market support was received for agriculture in 2000-01, broken down by commodity.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-12-13.5.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80155" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa1213.htm#1">

  <p>The value of indirect market support to agriculture in Scotland can be estimated by using OECD Producer Subsidy Estimates (PSE) for the EU. The calculation is dependent on assumptions about a number of factors such as exchange rates and differences between domestic and world commodity prices.</p>

  <p>The provisional estimate of indirect support for Scotland in 2000 (the latest year available) is &#163;155 million. It is not currently possible to produce a reliable breakdown of this figure by commodity. However, provisionally we estimate that in 2000 the main recipients by commodity of indirect support were beef (around 38%) and milk (around 44%). These figures should be treated with caution and may be subject to revision as further information becomes available.</p>

  <p>Precautionary measures to reduce the theoretical risk of transmission of vCJD through blood or blood products were introduced in 1998 following advice from the UK Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) and the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC).</p>

  <p>There is no scientific evidence that vCJD can be transmitted in humans through blood or blood transfusion. Purely as precautionary measures, and to reduce the theoretical risk to the blood supply, plasma for the manufacture of blood products is currently obtained from non-UK sources (Germany and USA) and donated blood from UK donors is leucodepleted (white blood cells are removed).</p>

  <p>Our Child Care Strategy is about supporting children and families. Good quality affordable child care not only benefits children, but can help parents to take up work or study. We allocated &#163;16.75 million to local authorities through Child Care Strategy funding in the current year, and this will rise to &#163;40.65 million by 2006.</p>

  <p>Officials have worked jointly with colleagues in the Department of Trade and Industry to develop a Work Life balance Toolkit for Child Care Partnerships. The Toolkit will help Child Care Partnerships engage with local employers on the business case for adopting family friendly policies.</p>

  <p>We are liaising with the Department for Work and Pensions on the new child care partnership manager's role in Jobcentre Plus districts. From April 2003 child care partnership managers will aim to help improve the information flow on child care services, particularly for lone parents, to encourage more parents into employment.</p>

  <p>The bill does not permit crofting communities to buy salmon fishings located on contiguous land. It is the salmon fishings themselves which have to be contiguous.</p>

  <p>There are tests that apply to the acquisition of salmon fishings. These are the same as apply to the acquisition of the croft land.

  <p>No estimate has been or can be made. There are too many uncertainties.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-30835 by Ross Finnie on 18 November 2002, whether it is satisfied, bearing in mind the opinion of the Court of Session in the case of <i>County Properties</i> v <i>the Scottish Ministers</i> and, in particular, paragraph 19 of that opinion, that the approval of applications made under Part 3 of the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill will be fair, given that none of the safeguards mentioned in paragraph 19 of the opinion will be present.</p>

  <p>The approval of applications by Scottish ministers under Part 3 of the bill will be fair in that the provisions of that part are in accordance with the general principles laid down by the courts in both the County Properties and Alconbury cases. There is provision in section 78 for any interested party to refer any question arising from an application for consent to buy to the Land Court and section 88 provides a right of appeal against ministers&#146; decision on questions of law.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-30836 by Ross Finnie on 18 November 2002, whether there will be two public interest tests when an application is made under Part 3 of the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill, namely that the application is in the public interest using the qualified definition in the bill and that it is in the public interest in the normal sense of the phrase as applied to Article 1 of Protocol 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

  <p>As stated in the answer given to question S1W-30836, the purpose of section 71(2) of the bill is to elucidate the meaning of the phrase &quot;public interest&quot; as used in the bill. Whether or not ministers consider a proposed acquisition by a crofting community body is in the public interest will depend on the facts and circumstances of each particular case.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answers to questions S1W-30836 and S1W-30837 by Ross Finnie on 18 November 2002, why, if the exercise of the crofting community right to buy under the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill must be in the public interest in order to be compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), there is no test of the public interest, in the sense of the phrase as applied to Article 1 of Protocol 1 of ECHR, in the bill.</p>

  <p>Article 1 of Protocol 1 of ECHR provides that no one shall be deprived of their possessions except <i>inter alia</i> in the public interest. This is why an acquisition under the crofting community right to buy must be in the public interest in order to be compatible with the Convention. What constitutes the &quot;public interest&quot; in each particular case can only be decided on the facts of that case.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the purpose of the word "furthering" in the amended section 71(1)(j) of the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill is to introduce a comparative test of sustainable development whereby the proposed operation by the crofting community body is compared with the existing operation and, if not, what the purpose of the word is.</p>

  <p>The Standard for Chartered Teacher was developed, through consultation, as a generic, quality-based standard. Chartered Teacher programmes will be accredited if they enable candidates to meet that standard and impact positively on professional performance.</p>

  <p>Chartered Teacher programmes will contain four core modules:</p>

  <p>Professional development: review, reflection and planning;</p>

  <p>Learning and teaching;</p>

  <p>Education for all, and</p>

  <p>Working together.</p>

  <p><i>Education for All </i>will focus on the full range of pupil diversity and the effects of diversity on teaching and learning. Thereafter, programme providers and candidates can elect to pursue any aspect of education inclusion, including issues relating to deaf pupils, through option modules.</p>
