  <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service has advised that the Cardonald telephone system is the main &quot;Hub&quot; for the three Emergency Medical Dispatch Centres in Scotland and controls the operation of the local telephone systems at the other sites. An initial fault on the Inverness telephone system caused the corruption of the processor memory at Cardonald and this subsequently affected the telephony systems at all sites.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service experienced disruption in their normal call handling operations on 21 July and there was a period of 50 minutes when all three Emergency Medical Dispatch Centres (EMDCs) were out of operation while a controlled close down and restart was carried out.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service has advised that their normal call handling operations were impacted as follows:</p>

  <p>Inverness EMDC between 01:05 and 14:55.</p>

  <p>Cardonald EMDC between 09:56 and 14:00.</p>

  <p>Norseman EMDC between 09:42 and 15:30.</p>

  <p>This means that there was a period of just over four hours when all three centres were experiencing difficulty. The controlled close down and restart took place between 13:10 and 14:00.</p>

  <p>During the overall period some calls continued to be answered by the Scottish EMDCs in the usual way, some were routed by BT to mobile telephones in the three Scottish EMDCs and, where necessary, some were routed to be answered by the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service or the North West Ambulance Service. These contingency arrangements are part of the established resilience procedures that are in place to deal with a scenario such as the one experienced on 21 July.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service has advised that during the times of 01:05 to 15:45, the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service dealt with 121 calls and the North West Ambulance Service dealt with 28 calls, less than 10% of the incidents dealt with by the ambulance service that day. Of these, some calls were found to be duplicates, therefore 125 patients had their details taken and then passed back to Scotland for an ambulance to be dispatched.</p>

  <p>It is not the case that no ambulance control room was operating on 21 July 2010. The Scottish Ambulance Service experienced disruption in their normal call handling operations on 21 July and there was a period of 50 minutes when all three Emergency Medical Dispatch Centres (EMDCs) were out of operation while a controlled close down and restart was carried out.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service swiftly put in place contingency plans to support 999 calls while the operation of the EMDCs was compromised. However, any compromise of the call handling operations of the Scottish Ambulance Service is of concern and the Scottish Ambulance Service therefore instructed BT to undertake a full review of the resilience of the telephony system.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service have been undertaking a thorough investigation in to the incident on 21 July. This has included reviewing the sequence of events on the day, considering how the contingency arrangements worked, understanding what the impact was on service delivery and, most importantly, auditing the clinical outcomes for patients. The ambulance service have been focussing on learning lessons and identifying actions that need to be taken forward by the service and others.</p>

  <p>As part of their investigation, the Scottish Ambulance Service have undertaken a clinical audit that has reviewed every 999 call on the day, as well as all of those patients for whom an ambulance was requested within one hour or two hours by their GP, with particular focus on the 125 patients who were routed outside of Scotland for their calls to be answered. Dr George Crooks, Medical Director of the Scottish Ambulance Service, has informed me that the clinical case mix and outcomes achieved on 21 July reflected those experienced when the service is working as normal and that there were no adverse outcomes attributable to the delays associated with the buddy system.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is considering the possible impact of the changes to housing benefit proposed by the UK Government. It is essential that the effects of these changes are fully understood, particularly with regard to vulnerable households and critical policy objectives such as the 2012 homelessness commitments. Officials are in regular contact with their counterparts in the Department for Work and Pensions and I have stressed to UK ministers the importance of genuine and extensive consultation on their welfare reform proposals, both in correspondence and during a meeting on 29 July 2010 with the UK Minister for Disabled People.</p>

  <p>The joint Scottish Government/COSLA 2012 steering group met in June and September 2010. The meeting in September 2010 discussed measures to assist local authorities in maintaining progress towards the 2012 homelessness target and the potential implications of housing benefit changes proposed in the UK budget for those experiencing homelessness.</p>

  <p>Additionally, a prevention of homelessness event was held for local authorities in June 2010 to explore the benefits of a housing options approach, with practice highlighted from Scotland and England. At this event, I announced funding for local authorities to work together in taking forward this approach. A series of regional seminars have been held during August and September 2010 to develop action plans in this regard.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will consider using its powers under the Inquiries Act 2005 to establish an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the conviction of Mr Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi, his subsequent release and surrounding events, on the basis of public concern and, if not, whether it will consider setting up a joint inquiry with the UK Government under the provision of section 32 of the Act and the concordat on the Act between the UK Government and the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s actions have already been reviewed by committees of both the Scottish and UK Parliaments and we have no plans to initiate any inquiry. As I explained in my statement of 20 August 2009, the Scottish Government does not doubt the safety of the conviction of Mr Al-Megrahi. Nevertheless, there remain concerns to some on the wider issues of the Lockerbie atrocity. The questions to be asked and answered in any such inquiry would be beyond the jurisdiction of Scots Law and the remit of the Scottish Government.</p>

  <p>The number of fine defaulters receiving custodial sentences has dropped markedly falling from a figure of 8,358 in 1999-2000 to 1,506 in 2008-09.</p>

  <p>Precise cost estimates for Scotland are not currently available. Estimating such costs is not straightforward, as it is not possible to directly attribute all crimes and offences to individual offenders or reoffenders.</p>

  <p>However, a social exclusion unit report on &quot;Reducing reoffending by ex-prisoners&quot; (2002) noted that:</p>

  <p>It is possible to estimate the cost of re-offending by ex-prisoners from the overall costs of crime calculated by the Home Office:</p>

  <p>this analysis looked at &quot;notifiable offences&quot; &ndash; a subset of crime that excludes some crimes such as drug trafficking and possession, handling stolen goods, public order offences, low level disorder, fare evasion, motoring offences, and other summary offences;</p>

  <p>it put the total costs of these crimes at around &pound;60 billion, counting costs incurred in anticipation of crime (for example, insurance), costs as a consequence of crime (for example, health services, repairing damage) and the costs of the criminal justice system, and</p>

  <p>it is estimated that re-offending by recent ex-prisoners accounts for at least 18 per cent of total crime, so at least &pound;10.8 billion, and probably much more.</p>

  <p>Scottish Government officials are in the process of developing similar estimates for Scotland.</p>

  <p>All NHS boards continue to work with their partners towards improved access to services and outcomes for veterans, their carers and families based on prevention, appropriate intervention and sustained recovery.</p>

  <p>These principles are at the heart of new arrangements and investment in place since April 2009 for improved access to specialist and community based metal health services for Veterans and their families.</p>

  <p>In partnership with NHSScotland, we have made &pound;1.2 million available each year to fund new arrangements through Combat Stress, the ex-services mental health welfare charity, to provide specialist mental health services for Veterans in Scotland at Hollybush House in Ayr. A range of specialist evidence based treatments, therapies and rehabilitation are available based on comprehensive individual needs assessment. The new arrangements represents almost double the previous annual investment.</p>

  <p>We are also funding Combat Stress to provide two Regional multi-disciplinary teams to cover the East and West of Scotland to improve access to community outreach services at nearly &pound;560,000 over three years to 2011. The Teams seek to ensure Veterans with service related mental ill health are appropriately assessed, supported and treated in order that they can maintain their place in the local community and achieve their full potential. We are currently considering arrangements beyond 2011.</p>

  <p>In partnership with NHS Lothian we are also investing &pound;930,000 to 2011 for the Veterans First Point pilot in central Edinburgh. Operational since April last year, the community-based service provides a &quot;One Stop Shop&quot; for assistance to Veterans and their families no matter what that need might be. Over 300 veterans have used the service to date. The pilot will be evaluated and the outcome will inform the further development of improved mental health services for Veterans across Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Police Services Authority (SPSA) delivers forensic science services to all eight police forces and the Crown Office Procurator Fiscal Service on a national basis. The SPSA is committed to creating an improved and responsive national service and has been carrying out extensive engagement with stakeholders over the last 18 months as part of its forensic modernisation programme. I anticipate SPSA will submit proposals for the Scottish Government&rsquo;s consideration later this month. We will carefully consider SPSA&rsquo;s proposals before reaching a decision.</p>

  <p>Notes</p>

  <p>1. Figures are based on remand admissions during the period and will differ from published figures on the number of remand receptions.</p>

  <p>2. An admission is defined as an individual spending a period in custody without being liberated into the community, whereas a reception is registered every time there is a change of custodial status. For instance, the case of an individual coming in on remand who then receives a custodial sentence is counted as one admission, but two receptions. An individual coming in on remand on two separate occasions counts as two admissions.</p>

  <p>3. Data are extracted from a live management information system and updated on an on-going basis. The information presented here may therefore differ slightly from information shown previously.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Prison Service shares information with community-based social work and police colleagues in relation to throughcare and risk management upon a prisoner&rsquo;s release. The Management of Offenders etc (Scotland) Act 2005 describes in particular joint arrangements for the management of high risk sex offenders. Section 10 and 11 of this act describes the arrangements for assessing and managing risks posed by certain offenders. These are known as Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements. (MAPPA). There is however, no statute stating who must be informed of a prisoner&rsquo;s release.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally by the Scottish Government. Sport, fitness and leisure opportunities are available through a range of providers in the public, private and third sectors. The report published by Audit Scotland in 2008 entitled <em>A Performance Overview of Sport in Scotland</em> (Bib. number 45497) provides details of the net revenue spend by Councils per head of population. In addition to this sportscotland invests government and lottery funding in a range of sports programmes and activities. Information on sportscotland&rsquo;s investment can be found on its website at <a href="http://www.sportscotland.org.uk" target="_blank">www.sportscotland.org.uk</a> .</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government committed to completing the previous administration&rsquo;s redevelopment programme and has provided over &pound;20 million to the secure estate since 2002. This, along with financial spend from the secure estate, increased the number and geographical spread of places; improved specialist provision, and saw the creation of a dedicated unit for girls and young women.</p>
