  <p>The Scottish Executive outlined in the 2000 Dental Workforce Report that workforce planning was a dynamic process intertwined with service redesign and workforce development. Whilst the action plan identified in 2000 will start to impact by 2005, an updated Dental Workforce Report will be published in 2003-04 to reflect the changing service need.</p>

  <p>In the past year the National Workforce Unit and the National Workforce Committee have been established as part of the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s workforce development strategy.

  <p>NHSScotland is working to minimise cancellations of planned hospital admissions for in-patient and day case treatment. <em>Managing Waiting Times &ndash; A Good<strong> </strong>Practice Guide,</em> which was published on 13 June 2003, provides guidance to hospitals on the effective management of hospital admissions and recommends that they should monitor and review cancellations and, where appropriate, set performance improvement targets.</p>

  <p>Cancellations as a percentage of planned hospital admissions for in-patient or day case treatment is one of the indicators in the Performance Assessment Framework (PAF). The PAF supports self-assessment by NHS trusts and performance management of them by NHS boards. It also enables the Scottish Executive to hold NHS boards to account for their performance via the annual Accountability Review process.</p>

  <p>The licensing of medicines is a reserved matter and is the responsibility of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Information about the agency and its work can be found at www.mhra.gov.uk.</p>

  <p>The agency has advised that the following drugs containing new active substances have been granted UK marketing authorisations since 1 June 2002:</p>

  <p>Varilrix vaccine; Flucis injection; Migard tablets; Fromig tablets; Puvasoralen capsules; Zyfetor capsules; Avodart capsules; Loterox eye drops; Avelox tablets; Octegra tablets; Crestor 10mg, 20mg, 40mg tablets.</p>

  <p>Medicines can also be licensed through the European Commission. Information about the EC licensing system can be found on the website of the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products at www.emea.eu.int.</p>

  <p>Information on which NHS boards have included these drugs in their formularies is not held centrally. The Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) provides advice to NHS boards about newly licensed medicines as soon as possible after the product is marketed. We would expect boards to take into account any advice and evidence from the SMC and ensure that recommended medicines are made available to meet clinical need. Further information about the SMC can be found on www.htbs.co.uk/smc.</p>

  <p>Free dental checks for all are one of the factors in planning the dental workforce. However, other changes can equally impact on the service demand and workforce and these have been taken into account in modelling work which is currently being undertaken by NHS Education for Scotland.</p>

  <p>It would be inappropriate to refer cefuroxime to NHS Quality Improvement Scotland. Cefuroxime is not generally recommended as a treatment for MRSA, and its use in patients with MRSA would normally be avoided. An exception to this might be that a patient was suffering from a second infectious organism, sensitive to cefuroxime, which might justify its use.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is undertaking work to improve antimicrobial prescribing. One of the aims is to reduce the creation of drug-resistant bacterial strains such as MRSA. The Scottish Medicines Consortium, facilitated by NHS Quality Improvement Scotland is assisting in taking this work forward.</p>

  <p>We are committed to constant improvement in the care and support of people with learning disabilities. Lessons have been drawn from the fatal accident inquiry report, including training needs and first aid equipment.</p>

  <p>The inquiry report findings will inform the future organisation of care and I look to NHS Scotland to have regard to and apply the recommendations for change made within the inquiry findings. The Deputy Chief Medical Officer has already written to NHS Scotland drawing attention to the recommendations, which include aspects of communications, general nurse training and awareness of individual needs, all issues that go to the core of good in patient care.</p>

  <p>In addition, a Health Needs Assessment Report for people with learning disabilities is expected to be published by NHS Health Scotland in the autumn. This is looking at the measures that will be required from the health service and their partners to ensure the health needs of people with learning disabilities are better met in the future.</p>

  <p>Inverclyde Council&rsquo;s assessment prior to May 2003 was that the school estate in Inverclyde required both rationalisation and significant investment in new and refurbished school buildings. They were developing a Public Private Partnership proposal designed to address those issues, following the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s provisional award of financial support in July 2002 based on the Outline Business Case the council submitted in December 2001. We await with interest the approach which the new council will take to addressing the clear and major needs identified.</p>

  <p><em>Building our Future &ndash; Scotland&rsquo;s School Estate, </em>produced jointly by the Scottish Executive and COSLA and published in February 2003, sets out the strategic framework for the improvement of Scotland&rsquo;s school estate over the long term and a vision of well designed, well built and well managed schools. Change is already under way. The strategy is complemented by a commitment of resources for the biggest ever school building programme in Scotland. This includes financial support for Public Private Partnership projects, in addition to the substantial other capital resources available to local authorities.</p>

  <p>The Deputy Chief Medical Officer&rsquo;s letter to health professionals, including general practitioners, on 14 January 2003 made clear that parents are entitled to know if thiomersal is contained in vaccines available to them, and the reasons for this. The letter also provided various research references to facilitate discussion with parents.</p>

  <p>More generally, as GPs are aware, any final decision about the immunisation of a child requires the informed consent of a parent or guardian. In that process, it is appropriate for general practitioners to make available information on why a particular product is recommended, while recognising that it is open to parents to request, and doctors to provide, an alternative vaccine, which is available through the NHS.</p>
