  <p>Training is regarded as an important issue in the development of the Strategy for Scottish Agriculture. The importance of training, and other related issues such as the development of business skills, better use of technology, communication and the transmission of best practice, has been highlighted by a number of organisations and individuals who have contributed to the Agriculture Strategy work. This will be reflected in the final strategy document due for publication early next year. The strategy will also take account of the outcome of the review of training in the major land-based sectors in Scotland which is currently under way.</p>

  <p>Since May 1999, over 50 EU Regulations, Directives and Decisions which directly affect agriculture have been implemented. Details of these are publicly available in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</p>

  <p>Most of these instruments require equal application by all member states, while others contain optional elements which we have used in ways which best suit the needs of Scottish farmers. A full comparison of differences between implementation in Scotland and other member states and their devolved administrations could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.</p>

  <p>The Executive has no plans to review such regulations but remains closely in touch with the industry to identify any problems which may arise.</p>

  <p>For the future, we will continue to consult the industry on the implementation of significant new regulations. The recommendations of the Red Tape Review report, designed to reduce burdens on farmers, are also being actively pursued - with a number already implemented. The Red Tape Review Panel also concluded that the UK does not, in general, apply regulations any more strictly than other member states. In addition, we will be studying the recently published Better Regulation Task Force report <i>Environmental Regulations and Farmers</i> relating to England, to see whether its recommendations may be adapted to benefit Scottish farmers.</p>

  <p>Miller Civil Engineering Limited do not collect tolls on the Skye Bridge.

  <p>The Scottish Executive remains committed to introducing a ban on tobacco advertising. The decision by the European Court of Justice means that we can no longer proceed, as proposed, to effect a ban through the introduction of Scottish Regulations under the European Communities Act 1972. Sensibly we can take only limited action in this area in isolation from the rest of the UK. We are in discussion with other UK Health Departments over the best means to effect a ban.</p>

  <p>It is anticipated that any domestic legislation would substantially cover the measures contained in the Directive 98/43/EC, including brand-stretching and point of sale advertising.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not have any direct influence on BTA operational matters. These are for the organisation itself to determine. The BTA is required to work closely with the Scottish Tourist Board. The two boards have agreed a Memorandum of Understanding, which sets out what each will do to promote Scotland overseas. Scotland benefits from BTA activity in 27 primary markets overseas.</p>

  <p>This contract was primarily awarded to provide sign language training, on a voluntary basis, to members, their staff and the parliamentary staff. Unfortunately, to date, there has been insufficient demand to run a course on signing in-house, but we have supported a member of staff through the successful completion of both Stage 1 and 2 of the BSL course at evening classes. We expect shortly to have sufficient numbers to arrange a course in-house. The contract was also awarded in anticipation of the need to provide deaf awareness training as part of our equal opportunities initiative to be launched early in the New Year.</p>
