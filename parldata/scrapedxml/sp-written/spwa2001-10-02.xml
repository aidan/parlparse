  <p>Infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) was added to the list of diseases in the Annex to Council Decision 90/424, by means of amending Decision 2001/572 dated 23 July 2001. The effect of this addition is that, in the event of further outbreaks of ISA, affected member states may, at their discretion, seek a financial contribution from the Community towards the cost of implementing a programme for the eradication and monitoring of this disease.</p>

  <p>We have no plans to request the addition of viral haemorhagic septicaemia to this list.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive and the UK Government have delegated the responsibility of deciding what is a sport to their respective sports councils. By its definition, recreation is an activity that promotes the refreshment of health or spirits by relaxation and enjoyment. What constitutes recreation therefore is down to the individual concerned.</p>

  <p>A formal recognition process is employed to identify those activities with which the Sports Councils wish to be associated and which, particularly given the finite resources available, the councils think should be developed by them. It does not determine an activity as a sport.</p>

  <p>The initial assessment of any application for recognition by the Sports Council should be the responsibility of the home country Sports Council in which the application originated. If the home country Sports Council concerned, following the initial assessment, considers it appropriate, a case is then presented by that council for further consideration by the five Sports Councils in the United Kingdom.</p>

  <p>In their assessment, the home country Sports Councils employ a range of criteria. These include physical skills; physical effort; accessibility; rules and organisation; strategy and tactics; essential purpose; physical challenge; risk; uniqueness of the activity; level of participation; and other considerations such as political, moral and ethical issues.</p>

  <p>There is no process involved in designating an activity as a recreation. By its definition, recreation encompasses a limitless range of activities.</p>
