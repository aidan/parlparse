  <p>determine whether the Initiative enabled better utilisation of teachers&#8217; time, and</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive Education Department (SEED) commissioned The Scottish Council for Research and Education (SCRE) Centre in Glasgow University to review the research literature on composite classes in 2002. Copies of that report are available at:</p>

  <p>http://www.scre.ac.uk/cat/1860030734.html.</p>

  <p>The SCRE paper concluded that:</p>

  <p>&quot;&hellip;it seems reasonable to conclude that, at least in Europe, there is no evidence to show that composite classes affect pupils&#8217; academic performance adversely. It is possible that pupils may gain socially from the experience and show non-cognitive benefits which to date have not been quantified.&quot;</p>

  <p>Currently we have no further plans to commission research into the impact of composite classes on pupil attainment or teaching practices.</p>

  <p>Any guidance that is judged helpful will be issued, if required, in advance of local authorities being expected to reduce class sizes. However, the transition between P1 and P2 is a matter for individual education authorities taking into account the needs of their schools and pupils. In addition authorities already have experience of the transition of classes of 30 in P3 to classes of 33 in P4.</p>

  <p>Within EU waters, sandeel fishing for commercial purposes is specifically prohibited at all times by the Wee Bankie (Firth of Forth) area closure, required by Paragraph 10 of Annex V of EU Regulation (EC) 2341/2002. This closure expires on 31 December 2003 unless - as is expected - a continuation of it is otherwise agreed. In order for scientists to monitor the effects of the Wee Bankie restriction, a limited sandeel fishery is allowed. The fishery is managed at the discretion of a scientific monitoring team, which comprises both Scottish and Danish scientists. The Scottish Executive does not hold administrative details of the monitoring programme centrally.</p>

  <p>As a requirement of the Total Allowable Catches and Quota regulation, which lasts for only one year, the Wee Bankie closure needs annual re-agreement in Council. The Commission has proposed to include the Wee Bankie fishing restrictions in a new technical conservation regulation, intended to replace<em> </em>Regulation (EC) 850/98 (as amended). This inclusion would allow for an extended period of closure at Wee Bankie. The Scottish Executive supports the Commission&#8217;s proposal.</p>

  <p>There are other sea areas where fishing for sandeels is indirectly prohibited. The Scottish Executive does not hold details of such closures centrally.</p>

  <p>It is unacceptable that any woman exercising her right to seek a legal abortion within the Abortion Act 1967, or to ask for the prescription of legally licensed emergency contraception, should be obstructed or intimidated. However, there is already provision in Scots law for redress against harassment. Section 53 of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 currently makes it an offence for two or more persons to obstruct the lawful passage of others in a public place and to fail to move away on being required to do so by a constable in uniform. The common law offence of &quot;breach of the peace&quot; may also cover any type of behaviour which causes alarm and distress that may arise from groups gathering together. Enforcement would be a matter for the police.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what action it is taking to address light pollution of the night sky.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2003-08-15.14.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80032" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-03/wa0815.htm#7">

  <p>Road lighting is often identified as one of the main sources of light pollution. At present both the Executive and local authorities work to the relevant British Standards for road lighting installation and employ technologies which take full account of advances in efficiency and design. All trunk road lighting schemes are also designed in accordance with the best practice guidance set out in the <em>Design Manual for Roads and Bridges</em> . The objective is to provide lighting which achieves night-time road safety objectives whilst minimising adverse environmental impacts and intrusion. All new and replacement trunk road lighting is of a less polluting type which offers superior control of the emitted light, giving a reduction in the amount of light spillage into the night sky.</p>

  <p>Planning controls can also play a part in reducing light pollution from other types of lighting schemes. Where there is a proposal for which a planning application is required, the planning authority may take action to mitigate the potential adverse effects of any external lighting. This might include imposing suitable planning conditions to prevent or minimise light pollution.</p>

  <p>In addition to the above framework, one of the commitments in the Partnership Agreement is to reduce light pollution and save energy by specifying appropriate lighting standards. The Executive intends to develop and publish guidance on public lighting which will meet these aims.</p>

  <p>The <em>Scottish Ministerial Code</em> and the <em>Guide to Collective Decision Making</em> have been up-dated and will be published today. The <em>Scottish Ministerial Code</em> , which was last revised in February 2002, provides a code of conduct and guidance on procedures for members of the Scottish Cabinet and Junior Scottish Ministers. It underlines our commitment to working in partnership with the Scottish Parliament and has been revised to reflect the Partnership Agreement and recent changes in procedure and terminology. The <em>Guide to Collective Decision Making</em> sets out the principles of collective decision-making and the principles and procedures to be followed to ensure effective conduct of business. It too has been up-dated to reflect the Partnership Agreement and changes in procedure and terminology since it was last revised in June 2002.</p>

  <p>Parliament will be aware that the SQA has again delivered the examinations round successfully. I have written to Sir John Ward congratulating him and the other members of the board and staff of SQA.</p>

  <p>It is important that the SQA ensures that the momentum in restoring full confidence in the examination system is maintained and that the quality assurance procedures in place are as rigorous as they can be to maintain standards. I have made clear to the SQA that I expect them to drive forward the development of their quality assurance procedures as a means to further underpin renewed confidence in the exams system.</p>

  <p>The commitment to recruit 1,000 additional teachers was met through Excellence Fund programmes for Education Authorities. Advice offered to the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council (SHEFC) on the number of teachers required reflected this commitment. Specific funding for additional teacher training was not separately identified within the overall level of grant in aid to SHEFC.</p>

  <p>The requirement to increase the teacher workforce to 53,000 by 2007 will require additional teachers to be trained. The precise number can only be identified through the annual teacher workforce planning exercises that will take place between now and 2007. Funding will be made available to the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council as appropriate.</p>
