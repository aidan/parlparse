  <p>: E-commerce is an enabling technology and the term is capable of wide interpretation. It is estimated that there are currently 72 staff working within the core and associated departments of the Scottish Executive who are wholly or partly engaged in business processes, improvements in public service delivery and the promotion and support of information and communication technologies who could fall within a reasonable definition of e-commerce. This estimate excludes staff in agencies and non Departmental Public Bodies engaged in similar tasks.</p>

  <p>At its meeting on 1 February, Highland Health Board discussed and agreed an action plan for implementing each of the five recommendations contained in the Scottish Health Advisory Service report. The plan will be taken forward in partnership with the Highland NHS Trusts and the Highland Council in the context of a local strategy for care of older people. The target dates for implementation of four of the recommendations range between May and August this year. The remaining one (relating to a manpower review) will be completed by April 2001.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Health Advisory Service will follow up progress on implementation of the recommendations, but the Scottish Executive will also monitor how they are being taken forward. We would expect any plans for improvements to services for older people to be reflected in the Health Improvement Programme for Highland and in the Trust Implementation Plans for 2000-01.</p>

  <p>Solar energy takes several forms such a passive solar design, active solar heating and photovoltaics. I understand that the 16th European Photovoltaics Conference and Exhibition will be held in Glasgow in May 2000 with Government support, and that BP Solar is seeking projects in the Glasgow area to coincide with the conference. In addition, organisations in Scotland are able to submit proposals for inclusion in the New and Renewable Energy Programme operated by the DTI on a UK basis; this includes a solar programme. Scottish schools and colleges are also able to apply to the Foresight Scolar programme to have a photovoltaics system installed at a third of the total cost. Four Scottish schools have already submitted applications.</p>

  <p>To date the mechanism for encouraging the development of renewable energy projects in Scotland has been the Scottish Renewables Obligation (SRO), the third round of which was announced last year. The support offered under the SRO is designed to enable renewable technologies to become more competitive and to gain a foothold in the market. The third round included support for wave energy for the first time, and three contracts for wave energy were awarded to developers. In addition, in March, the Government announced a new wave energy R&amp;D programme as part of the Department of Trade and Industry&#8217;s (DTI) New and Renewable Energy Programme.</p>

  <p>Although the response of manufacturing industry to the opportunities that arise from the increasing use of renewable energy is largely a matter for the commercial judgement of those companies involved, one of the objectives of the Scottish Renewable Obligation has always been to provide a stimulus to the manufacturers of such generation equipment.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is well aware that the planned growth in the use of renewable energy should present significant opportunities for employment creation, especially in rural areas.

  <p>It is important for all sectors of society to be aware of the environmental benefits of renewable energy. The public needs to understand the threats posed by climate change, and to be aware of the various measures that can be taken to reduce carbon emissions, including those to increase the availability of renewable energy. The issuing of a consultation document on climate change, along with the attendant publicity, will be designed to help that process of public understanding. For renewable energy to obtain wider acceptance, for instance under the green electricity tariff schemes which are being promoted by several electricity suppliers, it is also important that electricity from renewable sources should come at no extra cost or at a cost that is acceptable to consumers.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s policies on the location of housing and retail development are set out in National Planning Policy Guidelines 3: Land for Housing and 8: Town Centres and Retailing. NPPG3 indicates that priority should be given to the re-use of urban brownfield sites wherever possible and that the release of sites in the Green Belt should be considered only in exceptional circumstances. NPPG8 contains a firm commitment to the protection and enhancement of existing town centres in preference to sites outwith town centres. This guidance indicates that new retail developments should not conflict with Green Belt policy.</p>

  <p>British Steel has carried out extensive work on this site, but even now this work is not yet completed and parts of the site are still to some extent contaminated, and may need further remediation. There are however other large parts of the site which were never used for the steel plant and are not contaminated, and in effect these are greenfield sites.</p>

  <p>The extent of the contamination (and other infrastructure constraints) was a key consideration when Lanarkshire Development Agency drew up the Ravenscraig Masterplan. The consultants looked in detail at the ground conditions, the possible end uses, likely method of remediation required and likely cost. A fairly detailed matrix was produced along with a Remediation Strategy as part of the Masterplanning process. The location of the various uses shown in the current Masterplan &#8211; urban village; business park; town centre; area for commercial development, and the residential neighbourhood &#8211; in effect represent the optimum locations for each type of development, taking into account cost and value along with design considerations.</p>

  <p>There is also a Secure Containment Facility, covering an area of 30 acres out of the total site area of 1,125 acres. This facility, which contains contaminated material removed from elsewhere on the site, is intended for landscaping purposes only.</p>

Waste incinerators in Scotland are regulated by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency which holds public registers giving information about each incinerator. Such information includes the types of waste that may be disposed of, monitoring data and, where appropriate, details of the quantities of waste which may be burnt in a specified period.</p>

  <p>I am very pleased to be able to announce that I have agreed the disbursement of next round of RSI funds, based on the recommendations of the RSI Advisory Group. These recommendations identify projects to be funded throughout Scotland. I have accepted the Advisory Group&#8217;s recommendations on the level of funding and that funding for new projects in Edinburgh and Glasgow should be determined in relation to a comprehensive strategy for addressing rough sleeping in the two cities.</p>

  <p>We are supporting a total of 57 projects throughout Scotland to deliver on our three new priorities:-</p>

  <p>Meeting needs beyond the central belt, including rural areas.</p>

  <p>Preventing people having to sleep rough through direct support such as rent deposit schemes.</p>

  <p>Specialist support for those at the greatest risk of rough sleeping, including prisoners.</p>

  <p>The projects include:</p>

  <p>Twelve specialist accommodation projects to provide 146 places for those at risk of rough sleeping.</p>

  <p>Ten rent deposit schemes, providing 250 tenancies a year for people who would have problems finding deposits. Deposit schemes are effective in helping homeless people get and keep tenancies, even if they have been in rent arrears in the past.</p>

  <p>23 outreach projects, with 32 staff, to connect rough sleepers with mainstream services and help them off the streets.</p>

  <p>Five resettlement projects with 11 support staff to help homeless people move out of hostels and back into communities.</p>

  <p>Twelve specialist support projects to tackle the needs of those the research shows are most likely to end up on the streets. These will provide or develop housing support projects in eleven prisons to reduce the risk of prisoners losing their accommodation while inside and help them on their release. They also include addiction and mental health projects to help vulnerable people keep a roof over their heads.</p>

  <p>The Report of the Advisory Group is being published today and copies will be made available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre.</p>

  <p>People with mental health and learning difficulties qualify for legal aid in the same way as any other person - by satisfying a number of statutory tests, one of which is financial eligibility.

  <p>The Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Bill will make provision for legal aid to be available to adults with incapacity and anyone else who wishes to use the measures provided for in the Bill, subject to the usual statutory tests being met.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Central Research Unit is undertaking a number of studies which look specifically at access to legal advice and services for people with mental health and learning difficulties and the results of these studies will be carefully assessed by the Scottish Executive Justice and Health Departments in the context of policy development on Adults with Incapacity and on mental health.</p>

  <p>: No government departments or agency has an explicit power to ban such installations as long as the operator complies with all relevant licence conditions, health and safety provisions and planning requirements. If the results of research into the non-established health effects of telecommunications installations persuaded the Executive that such a ban should be introduced, it would be necessary to consider whether the licensing regime, the Health and Safety regime or the planning regime might best be adapted to effect such a ban.</p>

  <p>Telecommunications operators may install masts in any location provided they have fulfilled all relevant licence obligations, health and safety requirements and planning procedures and have reached agreement with the occupier of the property. The Executive has no plans to pursue a ban on masts in locations such as schools and hospitals.</p>

  <p>Under the terms of the devolution settlement for railways announced on 31 March 1998, now incorporated in the UK Transport Bill introduced on 1 December 1999, the Scottish Ministers will be able to issue directions and guidance to the Strategic Rail Authority for the franchise providing passenger rail services which begin and end in Scotland. They will reflect strategic priorities for the provision of passenger rail services throughout Scotland. It would then be for the train operating company, in conjunction with Railtrack, to ensure the availability of the necessary infrastructure to meet the terms of the franchise.</p>

  <p>There is no intention to commission such research at present. In assessing ways of tackling traffic congestion in England and Wales, no distinction is made between Scottish, English or Welsh traffic. The solutions implemented as part of the English and Welsh trunk roads programmes will therefore provide benefits irrespective of traffic origin and destination. Economic benefits are assessed as part of the scheme appraisal process.</p>

  <p>In formulating transport policy, the Scottish Executive takes account of the National Road Traffic Forecasts (Great Britain) 1997 amongst a range of other considerations. The NRTF is produced by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, and provides the latest forecasts of the projected growth in the volume of motor traffic on roads in Great Britain until the year 2031. This forecast shows an estimated growth in traffic levels from 1996 to 2011 of 28% and from 1996 to 2021 of 46% based on the capacity of the current road network, current policies and current behaviour. The NRTF figures are available for Great Britain but cannot be robustly broken down for Scotland.</p>

  <p>The NRTF is currently being up-dated and revised by DETR with assistance from the Executive. The revised figures will provide more localised results. They are expected to be available later in the year.</p>
