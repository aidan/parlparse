  <p>Advocacy is central to the Executive&#8217;s vision of a new era of a modernised health and social care service. Our commitment has been clearly demonstrated by the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000 and our recent review into services for people with learning disabilities. To ensure its availability for all who need it, we have been consulting on guidance designed to assist the development of local independent, integrated advocacy services across Scotland. This should be published in November along with the Health Plan for Scotland.</p>

  <p>We also provided financial support to a national advocacy conference that took place earlier this year, support that will continue in future years. At that conference I announced that we will require health boards to work in partnership with NHS Trusts, local authorities and other agencies in their area to put in place independent advocacy services which address the needs of local people. I expect these services to be in place within 12 months of the issue of the guidance. We have also funded Scottish Human Services to employ an Advocacy Development Officer to support this local work.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what its intentions are in relation to VAT on bridge tolls and in particular whether commitments by Her Majesty&#8217;s Treasury to pay for tolls from Government funds will apply to Scotland, whether any comparable commitment in Scotland would have to be funded by the Executive, and whether the Executive is committed to ensuring that bridge users in Scotland are treated no less favourably than those in England and Wales.</p>

  <p>VAT is a reserved matter and the UK Government is therefore responsible for implementation of the European Court of Justice decision that VAT should be levied on road, bridge and tunnel tolls not controlled by public authorities. Treasury Ministers have announced that they will consult toll operators on a scheme to ensure that private motorists will not suffer as a result of the Court&#8217;s decision. Details of the scheme have yet to be drawn up but Treasury Ministers have given an assurance that it will be fully funded. The scheme will apply equally to Scotland as it does to other parts of the UK. Scottish Ministers and officials will continue to work closely with Whitehall colleagues to ensure that Scottish interests are fully represented in the development of the proposed scheme.</p>

  <p>Fuel duty and taxes are reserved matters and the Scottish Executive has kept in close dialogue with the UK Government on the effects of rising fuel costs on the industry. The UK fishing industry is already exempted from fuel duty payments, so taxation is not a factor in the increase in fuel costs for fishing vessels.</p>

  <p>Direct subsidies to the industry would almost certainly fall foul of EU state aid regulations. However, we are willing to consider whether fisheries&#8217; structural funds could provide any longer-term incentives to switch to more energy-efficient fishing within the overall package of resources available to the industry.</p>

  <p>UK Fisheries Departments have offered to undertake an examination of fuel use by the UK fishing industry and we will be involved in this work.</p>

  <p>There is no comprehensive information available about the amount of fuel used by Scottish fishing vessels. A survey of costs and earnings of UK fishing vessels was undertaken by the Sea Fish Industry Authority in 1997-98. The Fishermen&#8217;s Handbook, which is available from the SFIA, contains estimated fuel costs for vessels that were sampled. However, the information is not wholly representative because many vessel owners were unwilling to co-operate with the survey.</p>

  <p>No specific quota of funded places is currently allocated by the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council (SHEFC) to courses of initial teacher education (ITE) for the training of teachers in the Gaelic medium. No information is held centrally on the number of applicants or intakes to ITE courses of those training as Gaelic medium teachers.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&#8217;s most recent guidance to SHEFC on initial teacher education draws attention to the importance of keeping up the supply of Gaelic medium teachers. SHEFC&#8217;s circular letter of February this year allocating funded places for ITE encourages teacher education institutions (TEIs) to continue to respond to the need for teachers able to teach in the Gaelic medium through their intakes to the BEd Primary, Primary PGCE and Secondary PGCE courses.</p>

  <p>The work being undertaken on Islay is part of a national study, which seeks to measure the value which society attributes to geese and to quantify the economic costs in terms of agricultural damage. The commissioning of an economic study designed to measure the benefits to society from the presence of geese was a recommendation of the National Goose Forum.</p>

  <p>The total cost of the study is estimated at &pound;81,560 over the two-year lifetime of the project. A total of &pound;22,860 was spent in 1999 and a further &pound;58,700 is projected to be spent this year.</p>

  <p>The cost to the Scottish Executive of the initial court action brought by the RSPB totalled &pound;19,446.25. Following the appeal, which overturned the decision by the Lord Ordinary in favour of Scottish Ministers, liability for the petitioners&#8217; expenses fall to Scottish Ministers. These remain to be determined.</p>

  <p>Investigations by the Canadian authorities are continuing and we still await definitive information. The Scottish Executive&#8217;s concern at this delay is shared by the UK Government which has sought recently from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency a progress report on its investigations into the circumstances that gave rise to the contamination of the Hyola rapeseed.</p>
