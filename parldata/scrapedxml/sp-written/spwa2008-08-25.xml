  <p>The budgetary provision for concessionary fares for the next three years is &pound;181.4 million in 2008-09, &pound;187.4 million in 2009-10 and &pound;189.4 million in 2010-11. This budget provides support for the development and delivery of concessionary travel schemes for older, disabled and young people. It covers reimbursement to bus, ferry and rail operators participating in the schemes and the marketing and survey costs of running the schemes. The vast majority, almost 99%, of the budget is for bus operators participating in the Scotland-wide free bus travel scheme for older and disabled people.</p>

  <p>The 2008-09 estimates are subject to an agreed cost escalator. Negotiations are underway with the Confederation of Passenger Transport to reach this agreement which is necessary to establish the estimate for 2008-09. The estimates for 2009-10 onwards are subject to the outcome of the three year review of the scheme, which is also currently underway.</p>

  <p>John Swinney and I met with representatives of COSLA, ACPOS and the Scottish Police Authorities Conveners Forum on 31 July. The main outcome was agreement that the Scottish Government should continue to press its case with the Treasury for additional funding to cover the costs of increased commutation factors. We also agreed that talks should continue at official level to ensure progress is made. We remain convinced that there should be parity of treatment by the Treasury with that afforded to England and Wales.</p>

  <p>We are currently assessing the practicality of setting a target for the percentage of expenditure by the public sector in Scotland with small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).</p>

  <p>We are continuing to develop the Scottish Procurement Information Hub, which provides detailed expenditure and supplier data from a significant number of high-spending public sector organisations in Scotland. Further development of the information hub will allow us to monitor the percentage of expenditure with medium, small and micro businesses and also to monitor average spending trends with SMEs in different sectors.</p>

  <p>Data from the information hub shows that in the financial year 2005-06 (the most recent data available), just over 50% of public expenditure was with SMEs.</p>

  <p>Patients and community pharmacies were invited to participate in a survey carried out by the previous administration in 2006 and designed to gather their views on the domiciliary oxygen therapy service (DOTS). The representative body, Community Pharmacy Scotland, was not directly involved but many of their members responded to the community pharmacy survey. A total of 820 patients and 164 community pharmacies responded to the surveys.</p>

  <p>I have agreed to a second phase of the DOTS review to consider the impact of recent developments. The second phase will comprise commissioned research and the establishment of a review group to consider all of the issues. The review group will directly involve Community Pharmacy Scotland.</p>

  <p>The eHealth Programme currently has two HEAT Targets:</p>

  <p>E1 - Universal utilisation of the Community Health Index (CHI) number; and</p>

  <p>E7 - To increase the percentage of new GP outpatient referrals into consultant led secondary care services that are triaged online for clinical priority and appropriate recipient service to 90% from December 2010.</p>

  <p>Monitoring arrangements are in place. On eReferral NHS boards are required to produce local delivery plan trajectories on an annual basis as part of the HEAT process. This includes providing a trajectory for the percentage of referrals triaged electronically, against which performance is monitored monthly.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are required to provide monthly performance monitoring information on their use of the CHI number on clinical communications. Performance is monitored against targets on a monthly basis, and additional support is provided to boards where that is required.</p>

  <p>Most diagnoses are made by standard local laboratory testing for Clostridium difficile toxins, not culture/isolation of the organism. The latter is required for typing, which is carried out at the Scottish Reference Laboratory. The Reference Laboratory has specific guidance setting out the criteria for when to culture and submit specimens for typing which cover those situations where typing can contribute to the management and investigation of cases. Presently, there are insufficient numbers of typed isolates to allow any kind of meaningful national analysis.</p>

  <p>On a) the Scottish Management of Antimicrobial Resistance Action Plan (ScotMARAP) launched by me in March outlines the national programme for Scotland in tackling antimicrobial resistance and prudent prescribing over the next five years. This was followed by CEL(30) 2008 on 8 July 2008, which sought the immediate implementation of our national policies in this area and set out the funding of &pound;40,000 for each mainland NHS board and &pound;20,000 for Island Boards for 2009-10 and 2010-11, with pro-rata funding for 2008-2009.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Antimicrobial Prescribing Group (SAPG) will monitor progress by overseeing national surveillance of resistance and antibiotic use, and driving improvements in prescribing practice.

  <p>The Scottish Government wrote to all NHS boards on the 15 July 2008. All boards with disused hospital premises were asked to carry out a physical inspection to ensure that no patient identifiable information is present. All boards have been asked to confirm when this has been completed. The outcome of these checks will be reported to the Parliament. To date responses have been received from 19 out of 22 territorial and special health boards. All territorial boards operating hospitals have responded to indicate that checks have been completed and no patient identifiable data was present. Responses from three special health boards are awaited to indicate whether they have such premises and the outcome of any checks.</p>

  <p>A number of initiatives under the public procurement reform programme impact on innovation and skills development in the private sector.</p>

  <p>To enable businesses to gain a better understanding of public sector markets and contracts, we have recently launched a national advertising portal at: <a href="http://www.publiccontractsscotland.gov.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.publiccontractsscotland.gov.uk/</a>.</p>

  <p>Businesses will be able to access the portal free of charge and to use it to identify opportunities for proposing innovative solutions to meet public sector requirements.</p>

  <p>We have developed a procurement competency framework which identifies the skills and competency levels required by purchasers across the public sector in Scotland. The framework recognises that in order to stimulate innovation, purchasers need to fully understand the market and to express their requirement in terms which allow businesses to propose innovative solutions.</p>

  <p>The development of user intelligence groups by the procurement centres of expertise will promote sharing of knowledge between Scottish contracting authorities and a better understanding of the market and what it can offer.</p>

  <p>We are aware of the proposed content of the innovation procurement plans for UK Government departments which are currently under development by the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills.</p>

  <p>We will shortly be publishing a <em>Scottish Procurement Policy Handbook</em> which will set out the fundamental rules, behaviours and standards applicable to public procurement activity in Scotland. The handbook will require all Scottish contracting authorities to consider how they can procure innovative solutions to their requirements. Compliance with the principles in the policy handbook will be mandatory and will be measured and reported on during contracting authorities&rsquo; audits.</p>

  <p><em>The Scottish Procurement Policy Handbook</em> , which will be published shortly, will recommend that purchasers test the market to determine what solutions are currently or potentially available prior to advertising a contract. It will advise purchasers to take advantage of the more flexible procedures permitted by EU procurement law. It will also provide guidance on the preparation of specifications which are expressed in terms of outputs or outcomes and performance. By describing what is to be achieved rather than specifying how it should be done, the scope for businesses to propose innovative solutions can be maximised.</p>

  <p>Purchasers can also access guidance on market engagement and developing output or outcome specifications through the Scottish public procurement toolkit at:</p>

  <p>There are different types of public inquiry, but under the Inquiries Act 2005 a Minister (including the Scottish Ministers) may cause an inquiry to be held where it appears that (a) particular events have caused, or are capable of causing, public concern, or (b) there is public concern that particular events may have occurred.</p>

  <p>Ministers therefore have the power to instigate inquiries themselves, rather than simply calling for them to be held. The Scottish Ministers can do so if the subject-matter is concerned wholly or primarily with a matter that relates to Scotland and is not a reserved matter within the meaning of the Scotland Act 1998.</p>

  <p>&quot;Level playing field support&quot; was replaced in Scotland by &quot;revenue support&quot; in 2002. The previous administration left no plans or funds in support of any new revenue support for local authority PPP projects. The new government even found that there was &pound;65 million in revenue support that the previous administration had not identified for PPP projects.</p>

  <p>Local authorities received the largest ever settlement in 2007 which has allowed them to invest some &pound;1 billion into new schools projects, in addition to the ongoing revenue support for the schools NPD projects procured under the &quot;schools PPP programme&quot;. It is for local authorities to select the form of delivery and funding which offers the optimum value for money solution over the life of the procured asset and services.</p>
