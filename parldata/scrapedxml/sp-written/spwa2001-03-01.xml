  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many legal staff employed in the Crown Office (CO) and Procurator Fiscal Service (PFS), excluding Crown Counsel but including senior civil service grades, have been seconded to work on the Lockerbie trial in each year since 1997 and how many are currently seconded, categorised in each case by (a) grade and (b) years of experience in the CO or PFS.</p>

  <p>The numbers, grades and years of experience of staff seconded to the case during the relevant years are as shown in the table. The details for 2001 also show the details for those currently seconded, who since 1999 have constituted the core group of seconded legal staff. The additional staff seconded in 1999 and 2000 served for varying periods of time, but generally for shorter periods in 2000 than in 1999.</p>

  <p>A staff survey has been held for a number of years within this department, under the direction and analysis of independent consultants. The last such internal exercise, agreed in partnership with the TUS, was held last summer. It served a number of purposes in support of staff pay and conditions, working environment, checking on pressures of work and stress issues, training and development systems including staff appraisal etc. The survey is used, in consultation with the TUS, to understand and improve various aspects of working conditions. It has been instrumental in the department&#8217;s re-accreditation in December 2000 for Investor in People status. An independent summary of the findings and an action plan was circulated to all staff and the TUS in December 2000. There are no plans to publish these documents outwith the department.</p>

  <p>The UK guidelines on drug misuse, &quot;Drug Misuse and Dependence Guidelines on Clinical Management&quot;, provide clear guidance on the prescription of methadone and other substitute drugs. Implementation of that guidance will help to address the variations in prescribing practice reported in the Effective Interventions Unit&#8217;s (EIU) recent consultation workshop report.</p>

  <p>In addition, we are working closely with Royal College of General Practitioners and others to look at what further training requires to be given to GPs to help them implement this guidance.</p>

  <p>The EIU will also be looking at the training and support needs of GPs and primary care teams as part of its detailed work, now under way, on effective shared care arrangements for drug users. There will be a focus on the development of local training strategies to meet local needs. The EIU will be consulting widely with practitioners over the next few months.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is working to identify those changes to Scottish law, both civil and criminal, that may be necessary to encourage e-commerce in Scotland. This work involves consideration by the Law Society of Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s aim is to bring forward Orders under section 8 of the Electronic Communications Act 2000 between 2001 and 2005. Priority legislative changes will be made later this year. This will include consultation of interested bodies. As well as assisting e-commerce generally, this will enable us to meet the <i>e-Government Strategy</i> target of making all government services available electronically by 2005.</p>

  <p>Some related changes have already taken place. The Scottish Executive takes part in international negotiations about the use of electronic commerce and in particular the way in which arrangements for jurisdiction and procedure of the courts can reflect the increased use of electronic media for concluding agreements and entering into obligations.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&#8217;s recently published strategy for the Enterprise Network, entitled <i>A Smart</i> <i>Successful Scotland</i> , (Parliament Reference Centre, Bib. no. 10982) made clear that demographic change and its impact on the Scottish Economy is a matter which needs further study.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has recently announced the establishment of a unit in Scottish Enterprise to be called Future Skills Scotland. The effects of an ageing workforce is an area in which Future Skills Scotland will have an interest in due course.</p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise is also concerned with this issue and has recently published a research paper on the subject in the Fraser of Allander Quarterly Economic Commentary (Volume 26, Number 1, January 2001). A copy of this paper is available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. no. 11552).</p>

  <p>No formal studies have been undertaken in this area, but the Scottish Executive&#8217;s recently published strategy for the Enterprise Network, entitled <i>A Smart Successful Scotland</i> , (Parliament Reference Centre, Bib. no. 10982) made clear that demographic change and its impact on the Scottish economy is a matter which needs further study.</p>

  <p>The economic and social status of rural Scotland is routinely monitored. Over the period 1991-99 the rural population grew by 1.4% despite the stability of the overall Scottish population. Recent research has shown that, despite the perception that most rural migrants are of retirement age, a significant proportion of rural migrants are of working age, employed and with young children.</p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise are at present actively examining the problem of population ageing together with business groups such as the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB).</p>

  <p>The CBI and the FSB have already been involved in the Foresight exercise in Scotland through the Ageing Population Panel which is co-ordinated by Scottish Enterprise. Over the next few months, Scottish Enterprise will be contacting these bodies to begin a more formalised dialogue on this subject. The outcome from these discussions is as yet unknown, but Scottish Enterprise will be encouraging these bodies to raise awareness with their members so that Scottish employers are encouraged to recruit older workers.</p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise also hope to run a conference this summer to raise awareness of the issues surrounding population ageing with members of these organisations and other external partners.</p>

  <p>I can today announce the publication of the Executive&#8217;s consultation paper <i>Freedom of Information &#8211; Consultation on Draft Legislation </i> as the next stage in bringing forward a distinctive and effective Scottish freedom of information regime.</p>

  <p>The consultation period will run until 25 May and the Executive intends introducing a Bill to the Parliament later this year.</p>

  <p>At the heart of the draft Bill is a new legal right of access to information held by a wide range of Scottish public authorities, underpinned by a powerful, independent Scottish Information Commissioner.</p>

  <p>The draft Bill will be laid before Parliament and circulated for wide consultation. Copies will also be placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre. I hope there will be an opportunity for the Parliament to debate these proposals in early course.</p>

  <p>The New Housing Partnerships budget for 2000-01 amounts to &#163;114.5 million. In addition, &#163;25.3 million has been carried forward from last year. This reflects slippage in councils&#8217; expenditure on approved projects, largely resulting from their commitment to full consultation with tenants. On the basis of indications from councils, it is expected that approximately &#163;70 million will be spent in this financial year. The arrangements for carry forward of resources into next year will be announced in due course.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2001-03-01.33.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80132" speakername="Jackie Baillie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-01/wa0301.htm#13">

  <p>There are a range of indicators which can be used to measure poverty, of which low income is only one.</p>

  <p>The Statistical Programme Committee of the European Union recommend using a range of different thresholds for the analysis of low income based on various percentages of mean (50%, 60%) and median (50%, 60%, 70%) equivalised income. The 60% median threshold has been recommended for use as the headline indicator. Data for these thresholds are set out in the <i>Social Justice Annual Report</i>.</p>

  <p>The table illustrates the level of the low income threshold for various types of households in 1998-99 for 60% median GB net equivalised income. Equivalisation adjusts income according to household size and composition to reflect the extent to which households of different sizes require a different level of income to achieve the same standard of living. The actual level of the low income threshold is therefore different depending on the household composition.</p>

  <p>The functions and remit of the Quality and Practice Review Unit are described in the Crown Office &amp; Procurator Fiscal Service Annual Report 1999-2000, which was circulated to all members of the Scottish Parliament. The Quality and Practice Review Unit was established to enable the department to complete a rolling programme of reviews of individual Offices or Crown Office Units (Office Reviews) and cross-departmental reviews of particular topics or areas of work (Thematic Reviews). The overall purpose of the Quality and Practice Review Unit is to contribute to the improvement of the quality of work of the department and to promote and maintain public confidence in its work.</p>

  <p>The remit of the Quality and Practice Review Unit is to report to the Crown Agent on the quality of professional practice in the department including decisions in cases, outcomes, and processes and other aspects of performance; to identify and promote good practice; to assist with the development of performance indicators, and, where approved by the Crown Agent, to work with other agencies to improve the quality of service and the efficiency and effectiveness of the wider criminal justice system.</p>

  <p>The Quality and Practice Review Unit is directly accountable to the Crown Agent and acts independently of the management regime within the Crown Office &amp; Procurator Fiscal Service. The Quality and Practice Review Unit has the authority of the Lord Advocate and Crown Agent to access all papers, files and computer records and to interview any member of staff of the department and Crown Counsel in connection with their work, subject to the limits of the remit (general or specific) for that review.</p>

The Scottish Executive is concerned about anything which encourages children to smoke, but has no power to ban or otherwise restrict the sale of these products in Scotland.
