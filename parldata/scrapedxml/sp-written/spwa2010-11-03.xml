  <p>The Scottish Government is committed both to helping farmers and crofters maximise their share of Common Agricultural Policy funds and to avoid the loss of support through penalties levied for non-compliance with regulatory requirements that were avoidable. Where funding is claimed through the over declaration of eligible land, no matter how unwitting the claimant&rsquo;s actions, the Scottish Government must implement the scheme of penalties set by the EC under European legislation, as it is required to do by the Scotland Act.</p>

  <p>The fertiliser market is subject to the normal regulatory and competition regimes, and driven by world supply and demand of nitrogen, phosphates and potash. Fertiliser prices in Scotland are dependent on currency exchange rate movements, which have also resulted in increases in the value of the Single Farm Payment in recent years. Farmers can keep their fertiliser costs down by following the Scottish Government&rsquo;s &quot;Farming for a Better Climate&quot; programme and having soil analyses done so that they are not buying fertilisers unnecessarily.</p>

  <p>On 16 September 2010 I had a discussion with Maria Miller MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Disabled People, where I expressed concerns over the future of the Independent Living Fund. I also set out our preference for the fund to be devolved, as it is effectively an extension of social work care. Details of the Department for Work and Pensions&rsquo; (DWP) proposals are still being formulated and it was agreed that Scottish Government officials meet with officials from the DWP to discuss these details as they are drawn up. A initial discussion between officials took place on 28 October 2010.</p>

  <p>The &pound;4.4 million announced by the Minister for Care Services in October 2010 is not new investment. It is being reinvested from the Caring with Confidence programme which came to an end in July 2010. Therefore this money does not carry any Barnett consequential.</p>

  <p>The analysis report was published on 30 September 2010 and comments were requested by 15 October 2010, with the aim of publishing the final version of the principles before the end of October 2010. On 12 October 2010, Scottish Government officials presented the analysis report to the Scottish Privacy Forum, which is run by the Information Commissioner&rsquo;s Office (ICO). The report was well received at that meeting and informal comments from the Assistant Commissioner (Scotland) were favourable.</p>

  <p>Following that meeting we have decided to delay publication until December 2010, by which time we expect to have received formal feedback from the ICO. That will ensure the greatest level of expert input and give us the opportunity to ensure our principles complement, as far as possible, the UK statutory code of practice on the sharing of personal data, on which the ICO launched its consultation on 8 October. This will mean our principles have the strongest possible support from the ICO.</p>

  <p>The programmes mentioned in the answer to question S3W-36453 relate to Recommendation 5 of the Council of Economic Advisers which states &quot;The Council recommends that the Scottish Government conducts a review of the scope for innovation in the services sector.&quot;</p>

  <p>To use competition in public procurement as a means of increasing productivity and innovation, as suggested in Recommendation 3, our enterprise agencies actively encourage companies to register with the Scottish Government&rsquo;s portal, Public Contracts Scotland (PCS). This portal promotes competition by providing companies with direct access to a wide range of opportunities across the public sector. Additionally our enterprise agencies welcome collaborative bids for tenders which help encourage small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and micro SMEs to participate.</p>

  <p>Food safety controls on materials and articles in contact with food are harmonised at a European level and Scottish Ministers are advised on such matters by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The agency has not done any assessment specifically on the health impact of bisphenol A (BPA) as used in the manufacturing of plastic bottles.</p>

  <p>However, since 2000 the FSA has undertaken two research projects and one survey on BPA in food contact materials. In all cases the levels of BPA identified were unlikely to be of concern to health. The agency continues to keep the published evidence on BPA under review and will act to protect consumers if the evidence shows that it is necessary to do so.</p>

  <p>The agency monitors closely what scientific research is being done elsewhere and avoids duplication of studies on what is in most cases a global market.</p>

  <p>Food safety controls on materials and articles in contact with food are harmonised at a European level and Scottish Ministers are advised on such matters by the Food Standards Agency in Scotland.</p>

  <p>a. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) recently issued its latest opinion on the safety of bisphenol A (BPA). The EFSA opinion did not lead to the current safety limit for BPA being revised. However, the EFSA opinion notes uncertainty associated with some new studies, of which the relevance for human health could not be assessed. The commission has taken a precautionary view on this uncertainty and discussions have started in the European Union to consider ways to limit exposure of infants to BPA from polycarbonate baby bottles, given the vulnerable nature of these consumers.</p>

  <p>The agency is actively involved in consulting stakeholders on these proposals to inform a UK negotiating line.</p>

  <p>b. There is no proposal to ban the use of bisphenol A in the manufacture of any other bottles containing food or drink.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is aware that care advisors play a valuable role by providing practical and emotional support for people living with muscular dystrophy and their families.</p>

  <p>The issue is discussed in the Mackie Report from the Cross Party Group on Muscular Dystrophy and the report by the Scottish Muscle Network on its review of neuromuscular services. Neither, however, indicates the optimal number of such posts.

  <p>There are currently two such care advisor posts, one covering the east of Scotland, the other the west. Until the end of the current financial year, they are funded jointly by the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign and by NHS Lothian and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde for the east and west respectively. Each board gave a commitment earlier this year to assume responsibility for funding in full the relevant post from April 2011.</p>

  <p>Performance for rail services between Perth and Edinburgh is monitored by Transport Scotland. The Public Performance Measure (measuring reliability and punctuality) has shown consistent improvement, rising from 85% in 2006 to 91.1% at present. This is the result of a combined effort by First ScotRail and Network Rail to improve both punctuality and reliability across the whole of the Scottish network.</p>

  <p>In December 2008, the Scottish Government introduced in partnership with First ScotRail a package of improvements to the Edinburgh-Fife-Aberdeen corridor, which provided an hourly service between Edinburgh and Perth via Fife, and 1,290 additional seats daily.</p>

  <p>The Strategic Transport Projects Review published in 2008, sets out our investment priorities, and includes proposals to improve services between Aberdeen/Inverness and the Central Belt. As a first step, improvements will be made on the Highland Main Line, full details will be known later in 2010.</p>

  <p>Publication of the Glasgow and the Clyde Valley Joint Structure Plan in 2000 preceded the transfer of responsibility for rail strategy and funding to Scottish Ministers.</p>

  <p>It is therefore not known whether, or to what extent, the costs, catchment areas and populations relating to these new or relocated stations were established at the time.</p>

  <p>However, this information may be available from the Glasgow and Clyde Valley Strategic Development Planning Authority, the successor authority to the Glasgow and Clyde Valley Joint Structure Plan Committee.</p>

  <p>The economic welfare benefits of the new Airdrie-Bathgate line have been estimated at &pound;682.7 million, in 2002 prices discounted over the 60 year appraisal period as standard. At the local level, the line is projected to bring 900 jobs and an additional 1,900 residents to West Lothian, and 400 jobs and 1,000 additional residents to North Lanarkshire (N.B. these are distributional impacts: no net increases were estimated at the Scotland level).

  <p>The appraisal of Laurencekirk railway station, undertaken by Scott Wilson Consultants for Aberdeenshire Council and the Scottish Executive, estimated that around 36,000 annual trips would be made to and from this station. From its opening in May 2009 to March 2010, 52,369 passenger journeys were made. This data was supplied to Transport Scotland by ScotRail. Monthly passenger data is not held by Transport Scotland. In future, annual data, typically used in preference to monthly data as it avoids issues relating to seasonality, will be publicly available for this station via the Office of Rail Regulation website:</p>

  <p>Information relating to the current catchment area population of this station is not held by Transport Scotland, though the appraisal reported a resident population of approximately 2,800 in the township and rail potential hinterland, with 4,700 in the surrounding Mearns of Aberdeenshire (National Census Data, ONS, 2002).</p>

  <p>Stena Line is due to re-locate from Stranraer to new facilities at Cairnryan in late autumn 2011. This has provided opportunities to improve rail provision to better match local needs. As a result Transport Scotland has asked Scotrail to work on improving the timetable for south west Scotland, including services to and from Stranraer, to deliver improved service frequency and new journey opportunities</p>

  <p>The proposed timetable is anticipated to take effect in December 2011.</p>

  <p>We have allocated some &pound;7.5 million to the Community and Renewable Energy Scheme (CARES) this financial year which will support around 300 projects. Increased funding pressures, alongside the introduction of the feed in tariff and (forthcoming) renewable heat incentive at a UK level, suggest that future support for community renewables may need to be revised. In this context, we have already published an initial business case for a pre-planning loan fund to be used by community groups and landowners to finance renewable energy projects. This report is published at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2010/10/01105500/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2010/10/01105500/0</a>.</p>

  <p>Ministers will be considering support for community renewables, including the loan fund proposal, under the spending review process.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, Community Energy Scotland, our contractor for CARES, will continue to support projects already in the system, as well as offer free and independent advice to communities interested in developing their own local renewables projects.</p>

  <p>My answer to question S3W-36450 referred specifically to the new UK Government&rsquo;s commitment, published in May this year, to review the control and use of accumulated and future revenues from the Fossil Fuel Levy (FFL) in Scotland (currently standing at &pound;191 million). The Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth has written to the UK Government on several occasions requesting the early release of these funds. This request is backed by leaders in Scottish Industry, environmental non-governmental organisations, business organisations and Trade Unions, dedicated to Scotland&rsquo;s sustainable economic development, who wrote to the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 14 October 2010 pressing for the release and rapid deployment of these funds.</p>

  <p>The Chief Secretary of the Treasury wrote to the Cabinet Secretary on 19 October 2010 with a new proposal. The new UK Government proposal is that Scottish Ministers surrender current and future FFL surpluses in exchange for the creation of a ring fenced &pound;250 million for Scotland to form part of an undefined and yet to be established Green Investment Bank. We do not believe that this proposal as it stands is in Scotland&rsquo;s interests, or changes the current position in any material way. The Cabinet Secretary has replied to the Chief Secretary of the Treasury expressing these concerns and seeking urgent clarification of the details underlying the proposal.</p>

  <p>There is no approval process for LMO or LFASS, rather beneficiaries need to meet eligibility criteria; therefore, the total number of LMO applications in each year is shown. For LFASS, the figures are for paid claims.</p>

  <p>In addition to the RP approvals shown above, a further 392 cases have been approved through the forestry ongoing approvals process, launched in August 2009.</p>
