  <p>The extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) unit in Leicester was established more than five years ago to evaluate the evidence for treating adults with ECMO, but it was not until 2007 that it was recognised as a national service for the treatment of patients from across the UK, including Scotland. All admissions to the unit were considered as part of this trial of effectiveness.</p>

  <p>NHS boards arrange transfers of patients to Leicester directly. However, we are aware that one patient from NHS Ayrshire and Arran was transferred for treatment in 2007-08, and this month, one patient from NHS Lanarkshire and one from NHS Dumfries and Galloway were transferred.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Health Survey is a National Statistic and, as such, has complied with the rules set out in the Pre-release Access to Official Statistics (Scotland) Order 2008. The Order states that the maximum period of pre-release access to statistics in their final form is five working days before publication. Pre-release access to the Scottish Health Survey 2008 was given to ministers and officials within the five working day period before publication.</p>

  <p>In addition, the UK Statistics Authority&rsquo;s Code of Practice for Official Statistics allows early access to be granted for quality assurance purposes.

  <p>The reform of Highlands and Islands Enterprise has developed a sharper focus on its key role of supporting sustainable economic growth while continuing to support fragile rural communities. This has led to many success stories not least attracting Welcon Towers to Machrihanish to save and develop the wind tower manufacturing facility.</p>

  <p>Highlands and Islands Enterprise should not be viewed in isolation however, as it is only one arm of the very significant package of funding we have in place to support and stimulate economic growth in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland. Skills Development Scotland, the newly established business gateway for the area, the Road Equivalent Tariff Scheme and the Town Centre Regeneration Fund together bring a funding investment of &pound;26.7 million this year, in addition to that allocated to Highlands and Islands Enterprise</p>

  <p>Businesses in the area also benefit from a range of non-domestic rates relief including the Small Business Bonus Scheme, which alone amounts to an estimated &pound;14.4 million in 2009-10, Rural Rate Relief and Empty Property Relief.</p>

  <p>No such referral target has been set. Most referrals take place quickly and well within the target times for other illnesses. The exception to this is referral to consultants for those requiring access to specialist child and adolescence mental health services.</p>

  <p>We will shortly announce a target for access in this area in line with commitment I made in November 2008.</p>

  <p>The staffing and equipment required to run an accident and emergency unit is a matter for NHS boards and varies depending on the size of the unit and the number of attendees. A wide range of health professionals, which includes consultants, doctors, nurses and support staff are required to care for patients needing emergency care.</p>

  <p>Planning guidance on accident and emergency departments within hospitals in Scotland is provided in the <em>Scottish Health Planning Note (SHPN 22)</em> available from the following link:</p>

  <p>A further source of information is the College of Emergency Medicine publication <em>The Way Ahead - December 2008</em>, which sets out the workforce, facilities and equipment needed to deliver the core service in emergency medicine. The document is available at:</p>
