  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many people have waited longer than one month for their results after seeing a cancer specialist in each NHS board in each year since 2007.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally. The Scottish Government has a target of 62 days from referral to treatment for those patients who have symptoms related to a cancer. This necessitates quick access to a cancer specialist, diagnostic tests and results in order to meet the target.</p>

  <p>The legislation does not require the needs of all carers to be assessed. <em>The Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968</em> , as amended by the <em>Community Care and Health (Scotland) Act 2002 (&quot;the 2002 Act&quot;)</em> , gives substantial and regular carers the right to request an assessment of their ability to provide care. <em>The Children (Scotland) Act 1995</em> , as amended by the 2002 Act, gives substantial and regular carers of a child with disabilities the right to request an assessment of their ability to care. The legislation also requires local authorities to inform carers of their potential right to a carer&rsquo;s assessment.We are working with partners so that they better understand the importance of the carer&rsquo;s assessment and that they take forward proposals to increase uptake of good quality outcome-focussed assessments. Some ideas being taken forward by local authorities include the introduction of carers&rsquo; self-assessment and the development of e-learning carer awareness modules for staff. <em>The Carers Strategy for Scotland</em> , to be published shortly, will include action points to encourage the uptake of good quality assessments and will highlight good practice in the carrying out of carers&rsquo; assessments.</p>

  <p>The Health Board (Membership and Elections) Scotland Act 2009 stipulates that an independent evaluation, be carried out into the Pilot Health Board Elections. The London School of Economics in association with the University of St Andrews has been appointed to undertake this task, and this will also look at the effects of the non-statutory pilots which are underway. The Scottish Government expects the findings of this Independent Evaluation to be laid before Parliament in the autumn of 2012.I wrote to you in March 2009 prior to Stage 3 of the Act to outline the approach that I intend to take in delivering non statutory alternative pilots. This involved a mix of the following approaches across NHS Grampian and NHS Lothian:strengthening the role of Public Partnership Forums by appointing at least one of their members to the local health board;reducing the number of Executive members on a Board to 5 and increasing the number of non executive members. This will give a clear majority to non executive and councillor members;enhancing the public appointments process in the pilot area to increase the diversity around the board table.I can confirm that a member of Midlothian Public Partnership Forum has been appointed to the NHS Lothian Board after a selection process overseen by the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments. You will also wish to note that the number of Executive Directors in both non-statutory pilot areas has been reduced to 5 which is consistent with the reductions in both Pilot Elected Health Boards. An enhanced public appointment process to appoint 2 additional members in NHS Grampian is currently underway which is aimed at increasing diversity around the board table. A further appointment will also be made to the NHS Lothian Board in due course using the alternative proposals.</p>

  <p>We have not issued guidance to local authorities or NHS boards on the use of non-geographic telephone numbers. We understand, however, that the industry regulator, Ofcom, is currently carrying out a review of all non-geographic call services and they will be considering the use of such numbers by our public bodies and the impact this has on consumers.</p>
