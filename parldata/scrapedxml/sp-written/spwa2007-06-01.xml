  <p>Together with the local authority, training agencies, the voluntary sector, Communities Scotland and other local partners, Scottish Enterprise is making a significant contribution to the Ayrshire economy by increasing employment and economic development opportunities.Examples of such support for North Ayrshire include: workforce development, the Lochshore project on the site of the former Glengarnock Steel Mill, Ayrshire Innovation Centre, the Clyde Marina/Ardrossan Harbour project and the Irvine Bay Urban Regeneration Company.</p>

  <p>The Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) is one of a number of methods which can be used to measure health benefits when deciding on priorities for expenditure in the NHS. Different approaches are relevant in different circumstances.</p>

  <p>The QALY provides an estimate of the extra quantity and quality of life provided by a healthcare intervention, combined within a single measure. Estimates of cost per QALY are often used, for example, in cost-effectiveness studies of new drug treatments or health care interventions.However, the QALY alone cannot form the basis of prioritisation of expenditure across the whole of the NHS. Estimates of QALYs are not available for every potential health care intervention or preventative approach, so there are limits to the possible coverage of this approach. Moreover, other factors such as population health needs and local priorities must be considered as well.</p>

  <p>The primary objectives for the Scottish planning system are, as set out in SPP1 (Scottish Planning Policy 1: The Planning System), to:</p>

  <p>set the land use framework for promoting sustainable economic development;</p>

  <p>encourage and support regeneration, and</p>

  <p>maintain and enhance the quality of the natural heritage and built environment.</p>

  <p>The passage of the Planning etc. (Scotland) Act 2006 was the first step in a modernisation process aimed at creating a more efficient, inclusive and sustainable planning system that is fully fit for purpose. Immediate priorities are now focussed on implementing the act and realising a change in culture among planning professionals and other stakeholders in the planning system. Priorities include the introduction of secondary legislation and policy to regulate and guide the revised working of the development planning and development management systems, and the preparation of the second National Planning Framework.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government plans to utilise fully the current road and rail networks, deliver a replacement Forth crossing as soon as practicable and take forward key improvements to nationally significant trunk routes. We will improve services for Scotland&rsquo;s rail commuters, with an aim to providing more space, more frequent services and faster journey times. We will work towards ensuring that Scotland has a comprehensive bus network where sustainable bus services are delivered to a high quality.

  <p>City of Edinburgh Council is refreshing the business case into the reopening of the Edinburgh South Suburban Railway (ESSR) line for passenger use. Recent discussions have taken place between Transport Scotland and City of Edinburgh Council officials where it was agreed that the business case should also include consideration of the impact on capacity at Waverley station and the extent to which allocating paths to ESSR trains would impact on implementing wider aspirations.</p>

  <p>It is for developers to propose the location of wind farms. Subsequent applications for planning permission or for consent under the Electricity Act are subject to consultation requirements and authorities determining an application must fully consider all material issues relevant to the proposals, including local authority development plans and relevant guidance. Consequently, consultees&rsquo; responses including any views of Clyde Muirshiel Regional Park Authority and representations from members of the public are considered as part of the overall determination process.</p>

  <p>Ministers specified a set of requirements for Scottish Water in February 2005 following a robust stakeholder led and evidence based process. These requirements cover the period 2006-14 and include a wide range of service and environmental improvements. Our objective for Scottish Water for 2006-10 is to outperform the regulatory settlement by delivering these requirements within the level of resources determined in November 2005 by the independent economic regulator, the Water Industry Commission.</p>
