  <p>Vulnerable adults across Scotland have access to a wide range of advocacy services on any aspect of their life. We have issued guidance to that effect to local authorities and the NHS as part of the implementation of single shared assessment and care management, specific legislation such as the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000 and the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Act 2003, and the development of independent and other advocacy services more generally. We also fund national bodies responsible for supporting and developing advocacy services. We have no plans to extend these arrangements in the specific way suggested.</p>

  <p>It is expected that there will be around 200 staff in the agency. Most of these will transfer from the transport group, however, there will be a number of new posts, largely resulting from an increased management role in the public transport major projects and additional responsibilities devolved to Scottish ministers through the UK Railways Act. However, the total number of new staff cannot be estimated at this stage until the number of staff transferring is known.</p>

  <p>In 1993, the then Scottish Office commissioned a Shipping Subsidies Review to find a longer term solution to the financial viability of ferry services to Orkney and Shetland. That review concluded that Tariff Rebate Subsidy (TRS), the mechanism then used to support P&amp;O Scottish Ferries&rsquo; Northern Isles operations, was no longer an adequate subsidy system for the support of shipping. The main reasons were that: TRS failed to provide for the replacement of vessels, as it could not guarantee the profitability required for such major investments or the security needed to attract a long-term commitment to the routes; TRS encouraged excess capacity and competition, particularly from freight-only competitors, that depressed profitability, threatening the long-term viability of all shipping operations; TRS could not compensate for any fall in traffic revenues, and, as PO Scottish Ferries&rsquo; revenues from freight carryings fell due to competition, so did its overall profitability to the point that it was no longer commercially viable.</p>

  <p>The Shipping Subsidies Review Report recommended that The Scottish Office should introduce new arrangements based on a block grant set to reflect estimated volumes, revenues and costs. Scottish Office Ministers announced in October 1994 their decision to award a block grant for the period 1997-2002 and an open competitive tendering exercise began in June 1995. Three bids were received and after thorough consideration, Scottish Office Ministers concluded that the bid from P&amp;O Scottish Ferries offered the best value for money. Scottish Office Ministers subsequently agreed that P&amp;O Scottish Ferries should be paid a basic annual block grant, subject to clawback arrangements should the company&rsquo;s profits exceed forecasts.</p>

  <p>NorthLink leases its three roll-on/roll-off passenger/vehicle vessels from Royal Bank Leasing Ltd under chartering arrangements signed by them on 22 December 2000.

  <p>However, and as part of the contractual amendments made to enable the early termination of the contract between the Scottish ministers and NorthLink and the start of the proposed new contract with another operator, an early termination agreement made on 27 September 2004 provides that the end date for each charter shall be the date, to be set by the Scottish ministers in due course, for the end NorthLink&rsquo;s contract for the provision of the Northern Isles ferry service.</p>

  <p>No Scottish Executive officials have visited Poland in connection with the construction of vessels for CalMac and no such visits are planned for the future. Responsibility for the procurement of Caledonian MacBrayne vessels rests with that company rather than with Scottish ministers.</p>

  <p>International migration has been on the increase in recent years and as the market place for health care professionals has become global this will continue to shape the supply and demand of workforce capacity. To this end, the NHSScotland, in line with UK policy, will be introducing a Code of Practice for international recruitment of health care professionals which will prohibit active recruitment from developing countries. However, appointments to medical training and substantive positions are made via an open recruitment process and NHSScotland does not give preference to any applicant on the basis of their country of origin.</p>

  <p>This data will not be available to the department until January/February 2006. Traditionally, employment for physiotherapy graduates has been good, 91% in 2003 and 86% in 2004. Initial information available to the department suggests that students that have only recently graduated, may find it more difficult to find employment in their first year than in previous years and it will take until later in the year for these new graduates to find positions in NHSScotland.</p>

  <p>Scottish graduates are free to apply to any NHS health board employer across Scotland for junior physiotherapy posts. However, some flexibility may be necessary in order that options available to the individual for employment are not restricted or limited, as some geographical areas and some work settings are more popular than others.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>There are no current plans to provide additional ring fenced resources to cover the costs incurred by sustainable energy-conserving features in new social housing. Social housing projects which include sustainable energy-conserving features will be assessed on their merits with such measures being financially supported subject to value for money criteria. Communities Scotland will continue to encourage RSLs to consider the whole-life cost of their design proposals and is considering ways of incentivising greater energy efficiency.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive promotes sustainable development practices for all housing development grant-funded by Communities Scotland. This involves the measurement of the following indicators for all projects:</p>

  <p>energy efficiency as measured by average performance SAP ratings<br /> average energy (space + water heating) costs per annum (&pound;)<br /> average CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per annum (tonnes)<br /> number of new units built on &quot;brownfield&quot; sites<br /> existence of a verifiable sustainable development policy (for RSLs engaged in housing development)<br /> space standards as per average resident capacity<br /> the level of housing for varying needs barrier free compliance<br /> the level of secured by design dwellings.</p>

  <p>The information requested is set out in the following two tables. The proportions in the tables are estimates derived from (a) the Family Resources Survey (FRS) and (b) the FRS&rsquo;s Individual Incomes Analysis.</p>

  <p>Due to the small sample sizes in the FRS in Scotland, the latest three years of data have been used to derive the proportions.

  <p>There are no disputes between the Crofters Commission and the Scottish Land Court. The Scottish Land Court has had no role in the recent de-crofting case in Taynuilt, Argyll.

  <p>The exact number of people newly diagnosed with dementia in Scotland is not available centrally. However, national estimates of the numbers of people consulting for dementia since 2000 can be given based on the number of patients seen for the condition in general medical practices participating in PTI (Practice Team Information). PTI data are obtained from a sample of Scottish general practices whose population is broadly nationally representative of the Scottish population in terms of age, sex, deprivation category and rural/urban mix.</p>

  <p>The number of participating practices is too small to allow estimates for individual NHS board areas.</p>

  <p>Estimated annual number of patients with a first GP diagnosis of dementia by age group; years ending 31 December 2000-04:</p>

  <p>No estimates have been made by the Executive of how long employment will continue in the oil industry.</p>

  <p>Current employment levels within the oil industry are directly related to the economic life of production which depends on a broad range of factors, including the price of oil.</p>

  <p>The Department of Trade and Industry estimate that oil production in the North Sea could be sustained at significant levels to at least 2035. Employment relating to production of oil should therefore continue to at least this date.</p>

  <p>However, as Aberdeen is a global centre of excellence, employment within the oil industry should continue even after production ceases from the North Sea.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>All prisoners in the SPS establishments and HM Prison Kilmarnock who participate in Education programmes or who self-refer with possible learning difficulties are subject to assessment and support from Prison Education Units, based on identified need.</p>

  <p>Additionally, every prisoner is subject to a health care assessment on admission, which includes questions on psychiatric history. Prisons operate multi-disciplinary mental health teams, who receive referrals and plan the appropriate level of support for the individual, including any specific advocacy requirements.</p>

  <p>The Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 comes into force on 5 October 2005. In preparation, the SPS will be initiating communication with local authorities regarding securing the availability of independent advocacy to people in prison with a mental disorder.</p>

  <p>The care of prisoners is guided by the recently revised SPS Healthcare Standards. The aim is to deliver health care appropriate to the individual needs of people. Feedback from groups of prisoners from a number of Establishments is that they do not wish to be treated differently solely on grounds of age, but older prisoners may present with additional needs, and individual care plans need to be designed accordingly. A recent specific recommendation by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspector of Prisons regarding older people in HM Prison Peterhead has been met.</p>

  <p>Ministers regarded the choice of date for introducing the smoking restrictions as a matter for them and consequently the Executive did not seek the views of members of the National Smoke-free Areas Implementation Group on this issue. The start of British Summer Time had tentatively been mooted for some time as a possible date for the law to take effect, drawing on the positive experiences of a similar start time for smoke-free legislation in both Ireland and New York.</p>
