  <p>There will be no saving of money as a result of the introduction of modulation. On the contrary, modulation will mean that in the period up to 2006 about &#163;114 million will become available for new commitments under agri-environment and woodland schemes than would otherwise have been the case.</p>

  <p>Grade B clinical scientists' posts including radiotherapy physicists are funded by NHS Trusts and cover a wide range of qualifications and experience. Post holders are expected to undertake further programmes of professional training, but there is not a nationally managed structure of post-registration training.</p>

  <p>The new Special Health Board for Education in NHSScotland, which I announced in June 2001, will, over a period of time, ensure suitable structures to support training for all groups of staff. <i>Our National Health</i> gave a commitment to improve our support and co-ordination of those aspects of workforce planning which need to be done centrally. The Executive is currently considering how to achieve this in the light of the report of the Scottish Integrated Workforce Planning Group.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Cancer Group are also considering all workforce requirements flowing from <i>Cancer in Scotland: Action for Change</i> which will include radiotherapy physicists since their work is primarily concerned with cancer treatment.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The number of oncologists as at September 2000 is provisional.</p>

  <p>These data most likely under-estimate the total activity and should not be taken as an accurate reflection of new patient referrals per whole-time consultant oncologist per centre as, for example, they do not include inter- or intra-hospital referrals.</p>

  <p>The number of first out-patient appointments per consultant oncologist (wte) has been calculated by dividing the numbers of first out-patient appointments in the year ending March by the number of consultant oncologists employed in the previous September (i.e. the mid point of the year).</p>

The Scottish Cancer Group was tasked to bring forward investment plans to support implementation of <i>Cancer in Scotland</i> by end September 2001.</p>

  <p>Proposed implementation/investment plans were prepared within each of the north, south east and west of Scotland regional cancer advisory group areas. They were subsequently endorsed by the Scottish Cancer Group first in draft form at their meeting on 14 September and subsequently in their final form on 19 October 2001.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-18265 by Susan Deacon on 6 November 2001, what information it holds on consultations with, and recommendations made by, oncologists on budget items included in <i>Cancer In Scotland: Action For Change, National Implementation/Investment Plan 2001-02</i> .</p>

  <p>The Scottish Cancer Group (SCG) membership includes two oncologists as well as Dr Anna Gregor, Chairman and Lead Clinician for Cancer Services in Scotland who is also a practising oncologist.</p>

  <p>To advise and inform the development of the strategic agenda, all SCG members are expected to communicate freely with their colleagues across cancer networks, the voluntary sector and among patients and to ensure appropriate feedback to the group.</p>

  <p>In addition, I understand that regional planning processes included input from oncologists and other specialities with an interest in cancer services, as evidenced by the broad range of investment plans announced last month.</p>

  <p>The following table shows the latest available data held centrally on the headcount of staff in post at 30 September 2000 (provisional) for those doctors whose speciality is recorded as clinical oncology. Vacancy information for consultant and staff grade clinical oncologists show there were no vacant posts at 30 September 2000. Vacancy information for other grades is not available centrally.</p>

  <p>Information on the number of posts funded by charities is not available centrally but is held by local NHS management. Contact details for NHS management personnel is available on www.show.scot.nhs.uk.</p>

  <p>Cancer services in Scotland are delivered by clinicians working within three regional managed clinical networks. The number of oncologists working within a particular NHS board area is therefore not an indicator of the level of local patient access to these highly specialised services.</p>

  <p>My answer to question S1W-20184 set out the support we provide for activity programmes and residential breaks for children and young people. We also provide a range of support for teenage mothers and babies through Sure Start Scotland. There is no single model of support as the needs of children and parents will vary. Sure Start Scotland supports a range of activities which provide opportunities for parents to acquire skills; to promote self-esteem and personal confidence and to enable parents to assist the development of their children.</p>

  <p>The answer given to question S1W-20179 gives details of our Sure Start Scotland initiative, which provides support to teenage mothers and their babies, among others.</p>

  <p>In addition, we have also awarded a project grant of &#163;50,000 for 2001-02 to Big Brothers and Sisters to assist them in developing a network of mentoring projects throughout Scotland. Big Brothers and Sisters provides mentors for children or young people from one-parent families.</p>

  <p>The answer given to question S1W-20184 sets out the resources being made available for out of school hours childcare and learning and study support, including activity programmes and residential breaks. Study support can be particularly helpful to disadvantaged pupils, particularly from older age groups, in providing them with access to facilities for study and challenging activities that might not otherwise be available to them. Similarly, the distribution formula for allocating childcare resources to local authorities takes account of comparative deprivation.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is providing funding of over &#163;27 million for study support and out of school hours learning over the period 1999-2002. In addition the New Opportunities Fund is investing &#163;23.6 million of lottery resources over the same period for out of school hours learning projects. As well as support for homework, coursework and the development of key skills, the programmes provide for creative ventures in the arts field and a full range of sports, including football, shinty, badminton and swimming, and adventurous outdoor activities such as sailing, canoeing, orienteering, abseiling, hill walking and cycling. Many of these activity programmes are provided on a residential basis at weekends and during the Easter and summer breaks.</p>

  <p>A further &#163;8 million is being made available over 2001-04 to local authorities to enable them to support the most fragile existing out of school childcare provision in disadvantaged areas. This is additional to &#163;49 million already allocated to local authorities in the last comprehensive spending review for childcare support. The New Opportunities Fund is also making &#163;25.3 million available for out of school childcare projects over 1999-2003, which is being enhanced by up to &#163;7 million to provide further support in disadvantaged areas. An additional &#163;14 million will be made available by the New Opportunities Fund over 2002-06 for a range of childcare provision, including out of school care.</p>

  <p>In addition, Community Learning Strategy Partnerships are required to analyse the needs of local communities in planning provision of community-based education facilities. This analysis of local needs should include consideration of the requirements and appropriate provision of community-based resources for all young people.</p>

  <p>Cycling has its place within the health education curriculum and may be discussed in other areas such as environmental studies. However, as with the rest of the curriculum, priority given to individual aspects is for each education authority to determine.</p>

  <p>Many primary schools do undertake cycle training. A study earlier this year - <i>A review of the Take-up of Cycle Training in Scottish Schools</i> - indicated that of the 85% of schools who are offered training, two out of three accepted. In total circa 31% of children complete a cycle training course during the year.</p>

  <p>The Executive also supports the Safer Routes to Schools initiative. The aim of this initiative is to encourage more children to walk, cycle or take public transport to and from school.</p>

  <p>Finally, the Scottish School Travel Advisory Group is currently developing a strategy to reduce the reliance on car travel for the school run and thus increase the use of other modes including walking, cycling and public transport. Their report is due in the next few months.</p>

  <p>The Executive has identified a number of problems with exclusion orders and matrimonial interdicts under the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981, and these are referred to in the white paper <i>Parents and Children</i> . Some have been addressed by the Protection from Abuse (Scotland) Act 2001, and others will be dealt with in the forthcoming draft Family Law Bill. The National Group to Address Domestic Abuse in Scotland has set up a working group to review existing legislation relating to domestic abuse, and this is expected to complete its work next year.</p>

  <p>Research on the effectiveness of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 is on-going and research work on exclusion orders has been identified as a priority for 2002-03.

  <p>The Pay Review Body for Doctors and Dentists (DDRB) has recommended a general pay increase of 3.6% for all doctors and dentists, with the exception of General Medical Practitioners, for whom the recommendation is 4.6%.</p>

  <p>The Pay Review Body for Nurses, Midwives, Health Visitors and the Professions Allied to Medicine (NPRB) has recommended a general pay increase of 3.6% for nurses, midwives, health visitors and the professions allied to medicine. In addition, the NPRB has recommended targeted increases for the lowest paid grade A and B nurses and equivalent PAMs &#150; a minimum lump sum payment of &#163;400 and extra progression for staff developing their skills through Scottish Vocational Qualifications.</p>

  <p>These increases are double the rate of inflation and ahead of pay settlements in the economy generally. They reward those who are at the heart of rebuilding our NHS and who deliver patient care day in, day out. The increases should also help with our plans for recruitment and retention generally &#150; more nurses and more doctors for NHSScotland. I am therefore pleased to confirm that the Scottish Executive has accepted the recommendations of both the DDRB and NPRB for 2002-03 in full and that once again we will implement them without staging.</p>

  <p>The awards will be met from the resources available to health boards in 2002-03.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>SPS have a legal duty to keep in custody prisoners who have been committed to prison by the courts. The Visitor Identity Systems described in the answer to question S1W-20062, have been introduced in implement of that legal duty, as a security measure to prevent prisoners from leaving the prison disguised as visitors and to help enforce the power contained in the 1994 Prison Rules, by ensuring that persons who have been prohibited from visiting are prevented from entering the prison.</p>

  <p>A Freight Facility Grant (FFG) award totalling &#163;9.7 million was made in September 1999 to TDG Nexus for the development of rail freight facilities at Grangemouth. The main flow of traffic to be handled by the facility was as regards the production of polyethylene and polypropylene at the BP Amoco plant. An award of &#163;10 million was also made in December 2000 to BP Oil UK Ltd for the transportation of fuel by rail from Grangemouth to various locations in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The conditions attached to FFG awards include provision for Scottish ministers to require the repayment of the whole, or part, of any grant already paid if the project is not completed or targets not met.</p>

  <p>BEAR&#146;s contract is complex and detailed and minor breaches will inevitably occur. There are set procedures for rectification of more significant breaches. The first step of this procedure is to issue a default notice to BEAR to ensure the level of service is maintained.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has not issued default notices in relation to BEAR&#146;s performance concerning winter maintenance on 8 and 9 November 2001.</p>

  <p>The Freedom of Information (Scotland) Bill has yet to complete its passage through the Parliament. In keeping with the approach under other statutory Freedom of Information regimes, it is envisaged that all requests for information would be considered on a case-by-case basis and, as such, it is not possible to anticipate whether any particular information relating to the Executive&#146;s contract with BEAR Scotland Ltd would be disclosed.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is keen to support diversification within the rural economy. I launched the Farm Business Development Scheme (FBDS) in July, an innovative business support scheme which provides financial assistance to farmers and their immediate families who want to diversify within or outwith agriculture. A wide range of projects are eligible for grant under the FBDS ranging from projects to develop tourist facilities to projects to provide rural services. These projects will create additional employment opportunities in the rural economy. They will also bring wider benefits and help sustain rural communities through generating additional investment and providing additional services. Applications for grant are assessed on a regional basis by project assessment committees according to local priorities. Already over &#163;150,000 has been awarded under the FBDS to support 11 projects throughout the west area.</p>

  <p>Farms in Ayrshire, as elsewhere in Scotland, benefit from public support through a wide range of schemes funded by the Scottish Executive and the European Commission.</p>

  <p>The Farm Business Development Scheme, for example, supports farmers with the development of additional income generating opportunities so strengthening the sustainability of the farming business.</p>

  <p>It is, of course, for each individual business to decide how to maximise their potential for prosperity. The <i>Forward Strategy for Scottish Agriculture</i>, published in July this year, set out a series of actions through which the farming industry could build a financially sustainable future, and the action which the Scottish Executive would take to support this.</p>

  <p>In 1996, the Scottish Diet Action Plan <i>Eating for Health</i> made a number of recommendations and included nutritional guidelines targeted primarily at pre-school and school age children. Education authorities and schools have been implementing these recommendations to varying degrees. In February 1999 the Her Majesty's Inspectorate report <i>Drug and Nutritional Education</i> identified good practice and areas where action was needed.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Consumer Council and the Health Education Board for Scotland jointly published their research <i>School Meals Service in Scotland,</i> on 19 November which covers a number of issues. The Food in Schools Conference which was held in May 2001, and was supported jointly by the Scottish Executive, the Food Standards Agency, the Scottish Consumer Council and the Health Education Board for Scotland also reported on 19 November. The main outcome from the conference was agreement on the need for a national strategy for school meals to include standards for nutritional content and dining facilities within a framework which eliminates the stigma associated with free school meals.</p>

  <p>To take this agenda forward I recently announced, together with the Ministers for Health and Community Care and Social Justice, the establishment of an expert panel to make recommendations for wide ranging improvements in the delivery of school meals. Chaired by a Director of Education, the panel's remit will be provide Scottish ministers with fully costed recommendations, and an implementation and monitoring strategy to:</p>

  <p>Establish standards for the nutritional content of school meals</p>

  <p>Eliminate the stigma attached to free school meals and improve take up</p>

  <p>Improve the presentation of school meals</p>

  <p>The expert panel will include representatives from a wide range of sectors and stakeholders and it will operate in a consultative and participatory manner to ensure that the views of key groups such as parents, children and young people are taken into account. The panel is expected to report in the autumn of 2002.</p>

  <p>The Fruit Plus initiative is a Glasgow City Council/Greater Glasgow Health Board initiative. It aims to provide a piece of fruit three days a week for pre-school nurseries and primary schools in Glasgow. The funding and timescale of the initiative are a matter for the local authority and the health board.</p>

  <p>Smartcard initiatives are being introduced across a number of local authorities in Scotland, including developments in Aberdeen, Angus, Argyll and Bute and Glasgow that are supported through the Modernising Government Fund.

  <p>A steering group chaired by the Scottish Executive with membership from local authority Chief Executives has been set up to put in place a framework for smartcards.

  <p>As a consequence of devolution, since 1999 the Scottish Executive has strengthened the resources devoted to media and communications in order to respond to the much higher level of public and media interest in the work the Executive is doing than was the case for the Scottish Office. There has in particular been an increase in the number of press officers to support the work of cabinet and deputy ministers, from some 20 in 1999 to over 40 today, as well as the development of a news based component to the Scottish Executive website and continuing spending on publicity and other communication functions.</p>

  <p>The out-turn for spending in the Media and Communications Group budget (covering running costs but not publicity spend) was &#163;1.966 million in 1999-2000 and &#163;2.007 million in 2000-01. Based on spend to date, we expect the outturn in 2001-02 to be of the order of &#163;3 million. No firm budget is in place as yet for 2002-03.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive recently bid for the Ryder Cup golf tournament and the event is to be held in Scotland in 2014. The Executive is presently assisting the Scottish Football Association with consideration of whether to bid for the European Nations Football Championships in 2008. Successful bids have been made by governing bodies/local authorities for the European Junior Swimming and Diving Competition in 2003, the European Cross Country Championships in 2003 and the World Bowls Championships in 2004. The Executive is also aware that a number of other bids have been made or are being considered, including a joint bid by the Scottish Rugby Union and the Irish Rugby Football Union for the Rugby World Cup in 2007.</p>

  <p>The remit of the Non-Native Species Policy Group is to offer advice to ministers of the UK Government, National Assembly for Wales and the Scottish Executive on the effectiveness of current statutory and non-statutory procedures for dealing with the introduction and establishment of non-native species. The group will also advise on: examples of best practice within the UK and abroad; the main vectors for the introduction and control of non-native species; proposals for improving measures to limit the ecological and economic impact of non-native species in GB, and organisations who might take forward any recommended measures. The findings of this review are expected to be with ministers by summer 2002.</p>

  <p>Policy and scientific staff from the Executive serve on this group which is chaired by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Scottish interests are further represented through Scottish Natural Heritage, Forestry Commission and the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.</p>

  <p>Some 20 organisations serve on this group, representing trade associations, nature conservation/advisory bodies, NGOs and other Government Departments.</p>
