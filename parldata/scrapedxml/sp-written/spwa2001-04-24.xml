  <p>The statistical information requested is not available.</p>

  <p>Information is available in relation to the number of reports received, solemn and summary court disposals and non-court disposals. The latter not only includes and specifies cases marked no proceedings but also those cases disposed of by warning, conditional offer, fiscal fine, diversion or referral to the Reporter. This information is recorded for each Procurator Fiscal&#8217;s Office. It is also collated and published each year in the Annual Report of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, which provides both national and regional statistics. The regional statistics relate to the six regions within the Procurator Fiscal Service, which correspond to the Sheriffdoms in Scotland. Statistics are not recorded with reference to parliamentary regions. The information collated in relation to court disposals relates to the number of cases and not charges.</p>
