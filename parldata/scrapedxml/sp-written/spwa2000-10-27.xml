<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-10-27.S1W-10361.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80134" speakername="Sarah Boyack" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa1027.htm#10361">

  <p>Urban nesting by most species of gull has increased over the last two decades and a number of enquiries relating to nuisance caused by gulls are received by the Executive each year.</p>

  <p>Lethal control of three species of gull (Herring gull, Greater and Lesser Black-backed gull) is permitted under general licence for the purposes of preserving public health and public safety. Local authorities and the owner or occupier of a property are able to take appropriate, lawful, action under the terms of this licence. Licences covering other species of gull can also be issued in certain circumstances. There are, however, significant practical difficulties associated with the lethal control of gull populations in an urban setting.</p>

  <p>The most effective long-term solution is to restrict the availability of food, which gulls obtain from household and commercial rubbish and from foodstuffs discarded in the street. This is in part a matter for local authorities to address and in part something which everyone can help to prevent by responsible management of litter and household waste.</p>

  <p>No, the new data collection system will not separately identify the number of households in temporary accommodation which include people of pensionable age.</p>

  <p>However, information is available from the homelessness applications data collection which separately identifies single person households of pensionable age.

  <p>Data about injury road accidents are collected by the police and reported to the Scottish Executive using the STATS 19 statistical report form. These returns cover only road accidents in which one or more people were injured: they do not cover damage only accidents.</p>

  <p>The table below gives the numbers of road accidents which were identified in the STATS 19 returns as occurring on the A81 between its junction with the A891 at Strathblane and its junction with the A821 at Aberfoyle over the period 1995 to 1999 inclusive.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that the statistics given below are based upon the data which are held in the central statistical database and which were collected by the police at the time of the accident and subsequently reported to the Executive. They may differ from any figures which the local authority would provide now, because they do not take account of any subsequent changes or corrections that the local authority may have made to the statistical information, for use at local level, about the location of each accident, based upon its knowledge of the road and area concerned.</p>

  <p>I announced on 28 September that the Executive is committed to a strategic link between Fullarton Road and west of the Kingston Bridge. On 10 October I met the leaders of Glasgow, South Lanarkshire and Renfrewshire Councils and agreed that officials should urgently establish the costs of that link and explore funding proposals, including the option of Public/Private Partnerships, to take forward the project. Those discussions are ongoing and it would be premature to speculate on the outcome.</p>
