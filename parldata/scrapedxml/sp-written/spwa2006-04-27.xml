  <p>The Scottish Executive&rsquo;s Route Development Fund has been designed to work with the aviation market to bring forward direct air services where it can be demonstrated that services should be able to operate on a long-term sustainable basis. We have examined the possibility of a direct Australian service and concluded that the underlying demand is not sufficient to compete with the range and frequency of services available from the hub airports at this time. We are, however, continuing to work to increase the range and choice of services from Scotland which will connect to Australia.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-04-27.4.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80064" speakername="Lewis Macdonald" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0427.htm#3">

  <p>The rights of all Scottish citizens are protected under the European Convention on Human Rights, the Human Rights Act 1998 and the Scotland Act 1998. It is therefore not appropriate for the Scottish Executive to adopt separate rights for people with autism spectrum disorders, such as the European Charter of Rights for People with Autism.</p>

  <p>However, the National Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) Reference Group has formed a new subgroup that will focus on Policy into Practice and Commissioning of services for people with ASD. This group aims to provide guidance for commissioners and service providers to ensure the needs of people with ASD are being met with respect to those rights in the Charter that relate to service provision.</p>

  <p>In 2003, the Executive commissioned the Scottish Council for Research in Education (SCRE) to examine the impact of the policy that requires education authorities to, wherever possible, mainstream pupils with special educational needs (SEN). The research assessed how education authorities implemented the new duty and the impact of the mainstreaming policy, and examined the ways in which different policies and practices impacted on parents, teachers, and pupils with SEN, including pupils with autistic spectrum disorder, and their peers.</p>

  <p>The findings were published in the Impact of the Presumption of Mainstreaming Research report on 13 January 2006, a copy of which is available at:</p>

  <p>No comparisons have been made. The most important principle is to meet the needs of the individual child or young person in the most appropriate setting, whether that is in a mainstream school, a special school, a specialist school like Struan House or a combination.</p>

  <p>I recognise however that there is a need to evaluate educational provision for pupils with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) in these settings and that is why Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education are conducting a specific inspection of educational provision for children and young people with ASD across Scotland. The inspection began in April 2005 and will conclude shortly with a report due in late summer.</p>

  <p>The main Scottish Executive support for local authority net revenue expenditure on additional support needs, including autistic spectrum disorders, is provided through Revenue Support grant. This is an unhypothecated grant and expenditure on individual areas, such as particular interventions, is a matter for each authority taking into account local needs and priorities. For information on the latest allocations of grant to individual local authorities, I refer the member to the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s Finance Circular 8/2005 which can be viewed at:</p>

  <p>Following the establishment of a wild bird protection zone and wild bird surveillance zone the Scottish Executive telephoned all registered poultry keepers in those areas. Those contacts were followed up by inspection visits to the premises by the State Veterinary Service.</p>

  <p>My department wrote to all poultry keepers in the wild bird protection and surveillance zones and the wild bird risk area informing them of legal obligations and good biosecurity practice. My department also wrote to Scottish poultry keepers outside these zones highlighting the importance of good biosecurity and vigilance for signs of disease.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Executive has been meeting frequently with the poultry industry stakeholder group to ensure the industry was fully informed of developments and that the Executive was alert to any emerging issues. Stakeholder groups acted as an invaluable link to their members in helping to disseminate information.</p>

  <p>On confirmation of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza a veterinary risk assessment was made to assess the appropriate size and location of the Wild Bird Risk Area, and how far it should extend from the wild bird surveillance zone round Cellardyke. In addition to veterinary and epidemiological advice, the assessment also drew upon expert ornithological advice. The risk assessment was reviewed following confirmation that the swan was a Whooper. This confirmed that the measures were relevant and proportional.</p>

  <p>To date the Scottish Executive has not carried out any research on the prevalence of crystal methamphetamine in Scotland. The Scottish Crime and Victimisation Survey 2006 will for the first time include questions on awareness and use of crystal methamphetamine. Results from this survey should be available by June 2007.</p>

  <p>Our strategy for tackling drug misuse is focused on outcomes such as the drug-free life, the crime-free life and a journey back into education, family life or employment. That means offering a wide range of options to those seeking help, tailored to individual needs and circumstance. A variety of approaches, which are all effective when used appropriately, can contribute to recovery &ndash; abstinence approaches, residential approaches, detoxification approaches and harm reduction approaches.</p>

  <p>Drug action teams are responsible for the strategic planning and co-ordination of action to tackle drug misuse in their area. When developing drug treatment and rehabilitation services, drug action teams and their local partners assess the level of need in their areas and have to ensure that the treatment needs of their local drug using population are met.</p>

  <p>Composite classes have been a common feature in Scottish primary schools for many years. In 2002 the Scottish Executive commissioned the Scottish Council for Research in Education (SCRE) to undertake a literature review of the available research on composite classes.</p>

  <p>In her report entitled <em>All In Together?,</em> published in March 2003, Dr Valerie Wilson concluded that most research revealed no significant difference in the achievement of pupils in composite and single grade classes. The report also highlights that research indicates that children can benefit both intellectually and socially through interaction with older children from being in composite classes. There is therefore no evidence that that children taught in composite classes will be disadvantaged. Indeed were it so, much of the school provision in rural Scotland would be delivering sub-standard levels of education. That is clearly not the case, and high levels of educational achievement are in no way inconsistent with composite classes.</p>

  <p>Following the introduction of the Water Environment (Controlled Activities) (Scotland) Regulations 2005 (CAR) on 1 April 2006, all discharges into the water environment will be subject to authorisation by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA). CAR replaces a number of other regulatory regimes, including the Control of Pollution Act 1974 (CoPA), the Groundwater Regulations 1998 and part of the Pollution Prevention and Control Act (PPC).</p>

  <p>Under the new regulations, it will be up to SEPA to determine what treatment of the chemical waste prior to any discharge is appropriate in order to protect the water environment. Authorisations may impose conditions on the operator, such as limits on amounts of discharge or treatment of chemical effluents before its discharge into the water environment.</p>

  <p>The Regulations are based on a source-to-sea approach, so the wider effects of discharges can be measured, monitored and controlled.</p>

We have no information on ConFor&rsquo;s budget, but we are content that the payments we have made have been justified as ConFor is the leading representative body for forest industries in Scotland, and the rest of the UK.</p>

  <p>The Executive&rsquo;s current activities to promote Fresh Talent overseas do not include attendance at any careers events in Australia.</p>

  <p>However, we are working closely with partners, such as the FCO, the British Council and Scottish Development International (SDI), to look for opportunities to promote Fresh Talent overseas. For example, the opening of an SDI office in Australia could result in new opportunities for the Executive to work closely with SDI to promote Fresh Talent in Australia.</p>

  <p>Improvement and repair grants must be given subject to the provisions of Part 13 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987, as amended by Part 6 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001. One of those provisions is that the amount of grant is based on an assessment of the financial circumstances of the applicant, as set out in regulations. This ensures that public funds are targeted towards those on the lowest incomes.</p>

  <p>A local authority which failed to comply with these provisions in giving improvement and repair grants would not be committing an offence, but would be acting outwith its powers.</p>

  <p>Local authorities notify the Executive of their annual revenue expenditure in the local financial returns (LFRs). These forms include expenditure on school transport which is expenditure incurred under sections 50 and 51 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980. This includes buses, taxis and any other transport costs arising from the transport of children to school. The gross expenditure on school transport by local authorities in the last three years for which information is available is set out in the table below.</p>

  <p>Although the LFR returns include a figure for total library expenditure this is not broken down to mobile library service level and the majority of the total relates to other library costs. Information on mobile libraries is not therefore held centrally. Further information on library provision across Scotland may be obtained from the Scottish Library and Information Council (SLIC) at Building C, Brandon Gate, Leechlee Road, Hamilton, ML3 6AU (telephone 01698 458 888).</p>

  <p>Please note that across Scotland varying admissions policies apply. In some health board areas everyone under the age of 16 treated in hospital for injuries as the result of deliberate self-harm will be admitted. This is not the case in other areas.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is currently involved in several initiatives that are aimed at raising awareness of self-harm among young people.</p>

  <p>The See Me campaign is currently involved in a phase of campaign activity aimed at children and young people that specifically addresses self-harming behaviour and challenges attitudes towards those who self-harm.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&rsquo;s <em>Children and Adolescent Mental Health Framework</em> is inclusive of those who self-harm. Heads Up Scotland, the National Project for Children and Young People&rsquo;s Mental Health aims to support local work to improve the mental health and well-being of children and young people.</p>

  <p>Choose Life the Executive&rsquo;s Suicide Prevention Strategy and Action Plan is being implemented through action plans agreed with Community Planning Partners in each local authority area in Scotland. A range of these action plans include funding for work to tackle self-harm among young people, where self-harm has been identified as a risk factor that can cause suicide.</p>

  <p>NHS Health Scotland has produced an information and resource booklet <em>Talking</em> <em>about Self-harm</em> designed for individuals, primarily those who are over 16 years old who are self-harming and their peers and families.</p>

  <p>The Executive will seek further opportunities to build on this work in the future.</p>

  <p>Local authorities and health boards in Scotland do not have specific set targets for the promotion of positive mental health. Therefore, monitoring and audit specifically of such targets is not currently required.</p>

  <p>Health Ministers undertake, each year with individual health boards, an annual review to discuss key issues around performance. This includes performance on all aspects of mental health including the actions taken by health boards, as part of health improvement strategies, to promote positive mental health.</p>

  <p>The positive mental health messages and actions required under the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 are being delivered by local authorities nationally.

  <p>The latest estimate of non-domestic rate income for 2005-06 amounts to &pound;1,931 million. This figure is based on the mid-year returns provided to the Scottish Executive by councils in October 2005. Final audited returns are not due to be submitted until February 2007, in accordance with the Local Government Finance Act 1992.</p>

  <p>The forecast amount of non-domestic rate income in 2006-07 is &pound;1,904 million. This is lower than 2005-06 as a result of the reduction in the poundage rate, partially offset by buoyancy, outstanding appeals and revaluations.</p>

  <p>I can announce that the Scottish ministers have granted consent to this proposal in terms of section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989. Additionally, this consent carries deemed planning permission in terms of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997.</p>

  <p>This announcement follows a lengthy consultation process which involved a wide range of stakeholders and members of the public. Following consultation with East Ayrshire Council, East Renfrewshire Council, South Lanarkshire Council and other bodies, conditions were attached to this consent to safeguard local and environmental interests.</p>

  <p>The proposed development raised a number of issues in respect of its likely impact on the operation of air traffic control radars at Glasgow Airport; the NATS En Route installation at Lowther Hill and the Corse Hill weather radar operated by the MetOffice. I am pleased to confirm that, following detailed negotiation between the parties involved, solutions have been agreed to the complete satisfaction of the aviation authorities, Glasgow Airport and the MetOffice. These ensure that the wind farm development can proceed without impairing the safe operation of these facilities.</p>

  <p>It is estimated that the wind farm will save some 650,000 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> annually. The Executive&rsquo;s targets are that 18% of the electricity generated in Scotland should come from renewable sources by 2010 and 40% by 2020. This is a Programme for Government commitment and a central plank of the Scottish Climate Change Programme. This single development equates to over 5% of the total capacity likely to be required to meet the 2020 target, and is the largest single onshore wind farm to be consented in Europe.</p>

  <p>This is an extremely important development that underlines our commitment to renewable energy and is a significant milestone towards achieving our renewable energy and climate change targets.</p>

  <p>Further to the answer to question S2W-23903, I understand that Viewpoint Housing Association Ltd. has now completed its review of services and have concluded that due to the small size (28 flats) of the City Park sheltered housing development and the lack of demand, a meals service is not sustainable. The association reports an increasing and significant deficit. The Association advises that it has ensured alternative arrangements are in place and that no extra sheltered contract tenants have been left without alternative provision. In reviewing its housing support services and their value for money the association has concluded that supplying a full catering service is no longer viable and has made alternative arrangements to ensure that service users receive an acceptable and healthy option to the service that has been withdrawn. The service will be reviewed by Fife Council in July 2006 to ensure that the service meets the service user&rsquo;s assessed needs.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-04-27.65.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80062" speakername="George Lyon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0427.htm#35">

  <p>In presenting statistics on suicides it is conventional to combine deaths classified as intentional self-harm (suicides) with those classified as events of undetermined intent. This is because the majority of the latter are likely to have been suicides. However, this assumption is known to be less valid for children, particularly those aged under 10. For this reason the following table shows the two categories separately and restricts the information on events of undetermined intent to deaths aged 10 to 15.</p>

  <p>Working for Families projects must meet the following criteria to be considered for inclusion. Each project must: offer good value for money in terms of cost against return for client outcomes; meet the aims of the fund by contributing to the overall goal of removing child care and other barriers to employment; work with one of the three target groups (lone parents, parents on a low income, and parents with other stresses in the household); fit with the overall Working for Families delivery structure within a local authority, and complement rather than duplicate existing service provision.</p>

  <p>Funding decisions are taken locally by the Working for Families Steering Group following consultation with key stakeholders. In all cases, Working for Families projects respond to the local situation and current available service provision. In most cases projects are commissioned by Working for Families locally in response to identified need, as opposed to applications being received for funding, although the latter has been the agreed mechanism used in a minority of local authorities. Final sign-off of projects rests with the Scottish Executive who assess each project&rsquo;s viability based on value for money and relevance to the aims of the fund.</p>
