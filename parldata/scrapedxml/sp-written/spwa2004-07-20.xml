  <p>The employment of junior doctors, as with all other staff, is a matter for NHS boards and their deployment and numbers are not determined primarily for service delivery reasons. They are training grade posts and as such are designed to provide junior doctors with high-quality training experiences. This will ensure that Scotland produces well trained doctors to deliver safe and effective services, which are appropriate to patients&#8217; needs.</p>

  <p>The commissioning and training of junior doctors to meet known and anticipated patient needs will be further supported through the developing Scottish arrangements to implement the postgraduate medical training reforms set out in the UK policy <em>Modernising Medical Careers</em>.</p>

  <p>&#163;16,000 was spent on publicising Traveline Scotland in 2003-04. A further &#163;240,000 has been made available to spend on the marketing and evaluation of the service until February 2005.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has any responsibilities to ensure safety at, or around, level crossings, in particular with regard to public highways, public rights of way and private access tracks and, if so, what measures it is taking to carry out such responsibilities.</p>

  <p>The responsibility for safety on the approaches to level crossings on public roads rests with the appropriate roads authority. In the case of trunk roads this falls to the Scottish ministers and for local roads this falls to the relevant local authority.</p>

  <p>The Executive ensures that regular inspections on the trunk road network are undertaken which includes the approaches to level crossings. Any safety issues identified are addressed with appropriate measures. Network Rail also monitors and addresses safety matters at level crossings, working in conjunction with the relevant roads authority where appropriate.</p>

  <p>Recognising the issue of safety, railway lines are excluded from access rights established by Part 1 of the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003. Private access tracks are governed by the terms of the railway legislation which specifies and permits their use. Safe passage at these level crossings is the responsibility of the authorised user.</p>

  <p>Our position has not changed. We are committed to over &#163;22 million of improvement schemes on the A96, but there are no current plans to upgrade the entire route to dual carriageway.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for the Clyde Tunnel rests with Glasgow City Council. The Scottish Executive provides revenue support to local authorities for roads, bridges and tunnels, including the Clyde Tunnel, through the general local government finance settlement. That support is not ring fenced, and it is for each local authority to decide how to allocate its expenditure. There are no current plans to change this arrangement.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it is appropriate to use pens in order to enclose deer prior to shooting them; whether this practice is humane; what evidence it has in respect of the extent to which deer culled in this manner suffer from stress, and how the humaneness of this method of killing deer compares with instant death from a skilled stopper&#8217;s bullet.</p>

  <p>Based on advice on best practice from the State Veterinary Service and the Deer Commission for Scotland, we have no reason to believe that the use of live capture pens to handle wild deer causes undue stress. As with any animal handling system, welfare will largely depend on calm, competent operators.</p>

  <p>The production of guidance on the use of this system will be considered by the steering group charged with developing best practice in deer management.</p>
