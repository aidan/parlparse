  <p>In dealing with fingerprints at a crime scene the presumption is that any marks discovered may be evidential and must be treated accordingly. All actions involving the processing of fingerprint lifts and impressions must therefore be fully documented and audited and Scenes of Crime Officers must be in a position to be able to recall the precise location of any mark found. Current practice allows this to be done by making contemporaneous notes, a sketch or photograph of the location.</p>

  <p>The Executive is involved in visits to Scotland by representatives of overseas governments on an extremely regular basis. A total number of visits since July 1999, including details of which ministers were involved, could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.</p>

  <p>SPS did not collect tender cost data in respect of the contract for HM Prison Kilmarnock. Tender costs are not separately identified in any Scottish Prison Service contract.</p>

  <p>Assessors have been appointed twice during the past three years. In 2000, the Minister for Finance invited nominations from the Conservative and Scottish National Parties by writing to their parliamentary spokesmen. He also asked the Convenor of the Equal Opportunities Committee for nominations. Decisions were announced by means of an answer to written question S1W-13732 on 1 March 2001. A news release was also issued on the same date.</p>

  <p>In 2001, a system along the lines outlined in the Commissioner for Public Appointments&#146; Code of Practice was used. Nominations were invited from a wide group of organisations and individuals, including the Convenors of the Parliament&#146;s subject committees. Of the 27 applications received, 11 declared having undertaken political activities on behalf of the Labour Party and one on behalf of the SNP. The remaining 15 applicants had not undertaken any political activities.</p>

  <p>Details of an individual&#146;s political affiliations are not recorded because it would be inappropriate for an individual&#146;s voting preferences to be known.</p>

  <p>Although none of the organisations approached submitted nominations, we understand that individuals were notified that a competition to fill these vacancies was underway. The range of applicants in terms of their backgrounds and geographical locations indicate that a large constituency of people were alerted to these vacancies.

  <p>The Executive has provided backing for the Association of Directors of Social Work in launching and developing their programme of Support for Front-line staff. One of the programme&#146;s primary aims is to improve information about assaults or threats at work and the responses by local authorities to these.</p>

  <p>The responsibility for the occupational health and safety of police officers rests with their respective Chief Constable, not the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>However, the Police (Scotland) Act 1967 contains provision for a penalty not exceeding &#163;2,500 and/or three months imprisonment for any person who assaults a police officer in the execution of his duty. For a second offence within a two-year span, a period of imprisonment not exceeding nine months and/or a fine not exceeding &#163;5,000 is applicable.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is keen to see the Larkhall-Milngavie project taken forward. That is why we have continued to support Strathclyde Passenger Transport, following Railtrack&#146;s announcement that it was withdrawing its support last December, to try and identify practical ways to keep this scheme moving forward.</p>

  <p>There are a number of complex technical and legal matters to consider before work can start on the rail link. We are continuing to press both Railtrack and the Strategic Rail Authority to take this project forward. The outcome of the various discussions will determine the way that the project will be managed and a possible timetable for delivering the rail link.</p>

  <p>The provisions of the British Railways (No. 3) Order Confirmation Act 1994 remain in force until amended or repealed.</p>

  <p>No specific assessment has been carried out for this purpose.

There will also be a transitional hardship fund whose purpose will be to assist those with incomes above the threshold, but who suffered significantly as a result of having their relief withdrawn. It will have a budget of &#163;1 million over the next two years.
