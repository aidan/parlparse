  <p>The Safe City Centres Initiative is a three year pilot programme which started in 2003-04 and concludes in the current financial year 2005-06. The following table details the amounts allocated by the Executive to each of the pilot areas over the three year period.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what progress it is making in developing its revised strategy for the relocation of public sector jobs.</p>

  <p>We are making good progress with a more strategic implementation of the relocation policy. As ministers have discussed with the Parliament&rsquo;s Finance Committee, we are determined to speed up the implementation process and to make it more transparent and consistent. A website has been launched, which gives up-to-date lists of bodies under review as well as new central guidance on the relocation process. The website also contains a list of potential location opportunities identified in partnership with local authorities and local enterprise companies. We are also committed to introducing a new more strategic trigger for location reviews, making a more explicit connection between relocation policy, efficient government and best value, partly as a result of the recommendations made by the Finance Committee.</p>

  <p>The Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004 made a number of changes to the rules governing who can stand for election as a councillor. Section 7 lifts the requirement for council employees to resign upon nomination as a candidate but replaces it with a requirement to resign upon election. Section 8 reduces the age at which a person may stand for election as a councillor from 21 to 18. Both these sections came into force on 20 January 2005. Section 9 removes the salary threshold above which council employees are regarded as holding politically restricted posts and are therefore prevented from standing for election as a councillor. That section will be commenced at a suitable opportunity before the next local government elections.</p>

  <p>The swap rate is negotiated as part of the competitive dialogue under the invitation to negotiate procurement process. There is no set range as it will depend on the prevailing market factors in each case. It is for each public authority, supported by professional advisers, to obtain the best deal possible, and to ensure that overall their project delivers good value for money. The Scottish Executive&rsquo;s funding for PPP projects requires that prior to contract signature the authority can demonstrate in its final business case value for money and affordability using the relevant swap rate assumptions.</p>

  <p>A special adviser can only commission work of a civil servant on behalf of his or her minister as required by the Special Adviser Code of Conduct. Ministers regularly commission work from civil servants either directly or through their special advisers as part of the normal channels of business in the Scottish Executive.</p>
