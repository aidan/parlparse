  <p>The following tables show the annual figures for the number of discharges from acute hospitals in Scotland with a diagnosis of alcohol poisoning for the years 1981-82 to 2006-07.</p>

  <p>World Health Organization International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes have been revised four times from 1950 to date. ICD6 was in use from 1950 to 1957, ICD7 from 1958 to 1968, ICD8 from 1968 to 1980, ICD9 from 1981 to 1996 and ICD10 from 1996 to date. Codes cannot be matched exactly between revisions and as a result trend data is not reliable. The match between ICD9 and ICD10 however, is good and information has been supplied for the years covered by these two revisions.</p>

  <p>There are currently no plans nor proposals to reconfigure ambulance services in Scotland. However, the Scottish Ambulance Service continues to utilise and manage all its resources to deliver the highest possible levels of patient care.</p>

  <p>In relation to operational management, however, the Scottish Ambulance Service has taken a decision to merge the North East and North &amp; West Operating Divisions. Any redesign of the administrative management of this new North Division will be the subject of consultation with all stakeholders, particularly Scottish Ambulance Service staff, and this will be taken forward by a general manager with extensive project management experience. A programme of consultation and engagement is currently being developed. Any changes to the management and administrative structure as a consequence of this merger will not affect the location or deployment of ambulances in the North of Scotland and will not adversely impact on the quality of patient care or the speed of response to emergency calls.</p>

  <p>In the course of her statement on 4 June, the Cabinet Secretary for Health &amp; Wellbeing advised that the service would be developing a comprehensive stakeholder engagement plan, designed to give better information to MSPs, ambulance service staff and the wider public about service development. The Scottish Government expects the ambulance service to apply the principles of such a plan in all circumstances where change may be under consideration. This applies to operational management change as well as to changes that impact on patient care.</p>

  <p>We are committed to reduce emissions by 80% by 2050 which is equivalent to an average reduction of more than 3% per year. Continuous progress to reduce emissions is essential and the Scottish Government believe that reporting an annual measure of progress within a multi-year budget process is the best means of achieving this. Independent, expert advice would be taken on the trajectory of emissions needed to meet our 2050 target.</p>

  <p>We are considering our final approach in light of responses to our consultation on a Scottish Climate Change Bill. In the meantime, we have committed to reduce emissions over the period to 2011 from a baseline of 2005.</p>

  <p>Appointments to the Committee of Inquiry on Crofting were made by the previous administration.</p>

  <p>I understand that in appointing the independent chair of the inquiry, the previous administration looked for the following skills and experience:</p>

  <p>an understanding of the economics of crofting, in relation to land management and property value;</p>

  <p>a recognition of the requirements for an effective system of regulation;</p>

  <p>effective communications skills and experience of chairing public fora;</p>

  <p>the ability to gain the respect of the crofting community in general and the Scottish Crofting Foundation in particular, and</p>

  <p>a recognition of the importance of crofting to the culture of the Highlands and Islands.</p>

  <p>The chair of the inquiry made recommendations to ministers for appointment to the committee of inquiry based on members&rsquo; ability to bring a range of expertise, including of crofting, and geographical coverage, together with an open-minded, imaginative approach to address the committee&rsquo;s broad terms of reference.</p>

  <p>All energy performance certificates will be produced using an asset based rating that follows the methodology framework set out in the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. The principal benefit of an Asset Rating is that it has the power to influence the people who can make a difference to the building fabric and services, the building owners. A consultation on the implementation of Articles 7, 8 and 9 of the Directive was carried out in 2006, and a significant majority of consultees supported the asset based approach.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government works with a range of delivery partners in the commercial and voluntary sector on initiatives outlined in Healthy Eating, Active Living: An action plan to improve diet, increase physical activity and tackle obesity. We will publish guidance for NHS boards on locally delivered healthy weight strategies by the end of 2008. This will cover treatment in primary, secondary and tertiary care, addressing coordination of services through local regional and national pathways. The guidance will encourage NHS boards to work with partners in these sectors wherever possible.</p>

  <p>I last met Royal Mail Group on 21 May 2008 where we discussed a number of issues including the universal service rate. The Scottish Government&rsquo;s position on the retention of a universal rate is set out in our response to the Independent Review of the UK Postal Services Market at the following link <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/06/postalreviewresponse" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/06/postalreviewresponse</a> .</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government supports the retention of a universal rate for the postage of goods across the UK. Scotland&rsquo;s geography and our proportionately larger rural and small business sectors render the continuation of the universal service obligation vital to maintain the drive against social exclusion, to enhance community cohesion and to support fragile local communities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has had a continuing dialogue with the UK Government throughout the interim review from the time it was announced on 21 April 2007. This was most intensive from mid-February 2008 onwards when there was frequent e-mail and phone-call correspondence; a number of meetings were also held.</p>

  <p>These discussions covered a range of subjects that would support the continuance of the measures such as the preparation of papers to be submitted to the commission; the arrangements of meetings with the European Commission; the handling of the Scottish and UK support for the measures in the Anti-Dumping Committee and the lobbying of UK views to other member states.</p>

  <p>Local authority representatives form the majority of the regional transport partnership membership which has agreed the regional transport strategy (RTS). Constituent councils are under a duty, so far as possible, to perform their transport functions consistently with the applicable RTS.</p>

  <p>Delivery of the strategies is a matter for each regional transport partnership working in partnership with their constituent councils. Regional transport partnerships are required to provide Scottish ministers with an annual report detailing their performance against their objectives, targets and performance indicators.</p>

  <p>The report highlights two key constraints affecting golden eagle populations. In the eastern and central Highlands many tradionally occupied golden eagle territories now lie empty while others have a high turnover of breeding birds. The evidence shows that this pattern is strongly associated with some grouse moors. In some parts of the western Highlands, the lack of live prey is a significant constraint apparently leading to poor production by golden eagles, with some territories rarely producing any flying young. There is an association between this deficiency and land management practices including intensive burning and heavy grazing.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will continue to pursue measures which will improve the conservation status of golden eagles. Scottish Natural Heritage is currently giving consideration to the identification of further special protection areas for golden eagles and will make recommendations to ministers on this in due course. The Partnership for Action Against Wildlife Crime is working to strengthen and develop inter-agency work to combat wildlife crime.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is working with Scottish Natural Heritage to consider ways of expanding the population across Scotland, notably in the south of Scotland where the golden eagle is currently scarce. Reintroductions may be possible, but there are a number of factors that exercise influence on natural patterns of spread and colonisation of golden eagles and the challenges for securing improvement in their conservation status are correspondingly complex.</p>
