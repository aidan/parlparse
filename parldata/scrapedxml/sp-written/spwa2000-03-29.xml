  <p>I attended the EU Agriculture Council meeting in Brussels on 20 March as part of the UK delegation led by Mr Nick Brown, Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in the UK Government. Ms Christine Gwyther, Secretary for Agriculture and the Rural Economy at the National Assembly for Wales was also present.</p>

  <p>The Council had an exchange of views on the Commission&#8217;s White Paper on Food Safety, focusing particularly on the case for horizontal legislation providing for controls across the whole food chain, the need for transparency in the operation of controls, and procedures for the effective handling of the results of inspection visits. This, together with debates on the Commission&#8217;s White Paper in other Councils, will inform the Commission&#8217;s eventual report to Heads of Government.</p>

  <p>The Council agreed on conclusions to guide the Commission in its strategy for accommodating budgetary and WTO pressures in the fixing of export refunds on processed goods. The UK delegation emphasised the importance of export refunds to the cereals-based spirit drinks sector, notably Scotch whisky, and urged the Commission to recognise this concern in its implementation of export refund reductions. A statement to this effect was recorded in the minutes of the Council.</p>

  <p>The Council also had a first discussion of a proposal to maintain the EU subsidised school milk scheme, but on a basis of a reduced EU budget contribution and compulsory co-financing by member states. The UK delegation stressed the importance to the UK of continuing the scheme for the benefit of school children, and requested the Commission to examine other possibilities for savings in the EU milk regime before co-financing had to be considered.</p>

  <p>Amongst other issues discussed in the Council were the present state of negotiations on the EU banana regime and the impact on agriculture of the EU Nitrates Directive. The Council also agreed a request from Italy for authorisation for payment of a state aid in the sugar sector, with Finland, Denmark and the Netherlands abstaining.</p>

  <p>Cancer is one of three clinical priorities for the NHS in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Improving the care of people with prostate cancer presents many challenges, not least of which is the lack of clinical consensus as to the most appropriate treatment.</p>

  <p>The Chief Medical Officer and the Lead Clinician for Cancer Services/Scottish Cancer Group are currently considering the various issues on my behalf, including how best to facilitate the development of brachytherapy within specific centres in Scotland for those patients who need it and the need for additional specialist training for those clinicians delivering urological-oncology services.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is determined to address the challenges presented by cancer in all its forms. <i>Towards a Healthier Scotland </i> includes a commitment to reduce cancer mortality by 20% by 2010.</p>

  <p>There are currently no plans for prostate cancer specific national public awareness campaigns. Rather a comprehensive cancer strategy is being pursued which will bring benefits for Scots everywhere. This strategy ranges from health promotion for children and adults, through early detection, earlier prevention and for those individuals unfortunate enough to need it, speedier diagnosis and the best quality of care possible, in a modernised NHS,</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive also supports and encourages men&#8217;s health initiatives of which there are good examples across the country, such as an annual Men&#8217;s Health Weeks and Well Man Clinics. A variety of leaflets and other information are available through a variety of means, including for example the workplace and betting shops. These, and other initiatives, aim to alert men, inter alia, to early cancer symptoms (generally and tumour specific) but importantly also that they must take greater care of, and responsibility for, their own health by seeking medical advice whenever symptoms suggestive of cancer appear.</p>

  <p>Around 80% of Highers being taught this year are new Highers. Although teachers were given the option to introduce selected Higher courses from next year, around 5,000 courses at Intermediate and Access levels have been introduced voluntarily by schools. HMI observations indicate that teachers are generally implementing Higher Still effectively.</p>

  <p>The inevitable difficulties of change are being dealt with by the Scottish Qualifications Authority and the Higher Still Development Unit, who have also taken steps to ensure that pupils will not be disadvantaged.</p>

  <p>Henry McLeish and I have decided that the Scottish Executive will, as is the practice with all developments, review the first year of implementation of Higher Still and publish the results in the autumn.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Integrated Workforce Planning Group (SIWPG) has made its interim report to the Director of Human Resources for the NHS in Scotland, on the principles and key issues for workforce planning in the NHS environment. It has clearly identified for the NHS in Scotland that it is vital to integrate good planning and development of the workforce with service planning and redesign, to make sure that effective modern services can be provided and sustained.</p>

  <p>The SIWPG will now research good practice and appropriate mechanisms for workforce planning. It will make evidence-based recommendations on how workforce planning should be carried out and on the structure and support it needs. It will show how service changes can best be supported by planning the workforce in the short and long term, and by linking planning at all levels to improve the quality and standard of care provided to patients. This will give practical help to managers throughout the NHS in Scotland on how to make more effective use of existing and future investment to modernise the workforce.</p>

  <p>Statistical information in the form requested is not held centrally. The length of time required to reach judgement in any case is a matter for the presiding sheriff. However in the case of Small Claims and Summary Cause actions the procedural rules provide that the sheriff may either pronounce his or her decision at the conclusion of a hearing or give it in writing within 28 days.</p>

  <p>Statistical information in the format requested is not available. The procedure followed in fixing Fatal Accident Inquiries is that the Procurator Fiscal will usually discuss with the Sheriff Clerk available dates for Inquiries and will then make enquiries with the next of kin and other parties to the FAI as to the suitability of the proposed dates. The parties to the FAI require to be given sufficient notice of the proposed date to enable them to make the necessary investigations and preparations.</p>

  <p>Once the suitability of a date has been established the Procurator Fiscal will make a formal application to the Sheriff Clerk for the FAI which will already have been provisionally programmed for a particular date. The formal application is often made only shortly before the date programmed for the hearing.</p>

  <p>I announced on 22 February that an additional &pound;6.8 million was being made available to the NHS in Scotland to spend on intensive care and high dependency beds and on new equipment. It is for health boards, working with NHS Trusts, to determine how best to use the additional resources in light of local needs and circumstances.</p>

  <p>The Chief Medical Officer has established a short-life group to examine how intensive care and high dependency services can be improved. The group will look at ways of improving the flexibility of these services and of matching provision with need. Health boards are expected to take full account of the group&#8217;s recommendations when taking decisions about how their share of the additional &pound;6.8 million should be used.</p>

  <p>It is not the Executive&#8217;s policy to divulge its assumptions about public sector pay increases. The costs of meeting the Pay Review Bodies awards in 2000-01 is estimated to be &pound;88.2 million and these costs will be met from the additional resources made available to health boards for 2000-01.</p>

  <p>The Secretary of State for Education and Employment established a committee under the chairmanship of Sir George Quigley in December 1998, as required by section 25 (4) of the Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998, to review fee support for students from England, Wales and Northern Ireland in the fourth year of first degree courses at Scottish institutions. The report has been laid today before the Scottish Parliament.</p>

  <p>The UK Government has accepted the recommendations addressed to it in the report.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to say that the Scottish Executive has accepted that a fourth year fee concession should be applied to students from England, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>

  <p>The Executive will discuss with the UK Government the precise mechanism for paying those fees and the impact on student support. I expect this fee concession to come into effect for students who enter the first year of their courses in September 2001.</p>

  <p>The Executive has actively encouraged public organisations to purchase home-produced pigmeat which is produced to very high health and welfare standards. In addition, extra marketing resources will be provided in the new financial year to support the marketing of Scottish pork and bacon. Currently, with the other Agriculture Ministers, I am exploring what other forms of assistance, financial or otherwise, might be available to this sector without breaching the very tightly drawn EU State Aid rules.</p>

  <p>Further to my answer on 14 December 1999 (S1W&#8211;2856) local agencies and partners have continued to address the problems caused by the downsizing of RAF Saxa Vord.</p>

  <p>The Unst Joint Response Team, formed immediately after the announcement of the drawdown (August 1999) continues to meet regularly. The team has comprised Shetland Islands Council (SIC), Shetland Enterprise Company (SEC), Unst Community Council and the RAF. Membership was recently extended to include the Employment Service and Shetland&#8217;s Adult Guidance Network.</p>

  <p>I am also maintaining a close interest in the activity of the Unst Partnership, which has been formed to co-ordinate a regeneration plan for Unst which aims to broaden and deepen its economic base. I will expect the enterprise agencies to look closely at project ideas which emerge.</p>

  <p>Development staff from the enterprise network visit Unst regularly to give project advice. I understand that local partners are optimistic that a number of projects will be approved over the next few months, creating new jobs. Projects are also coming forward from Yell which, if successful, would lead to further job opportunities, including for people on Unst.</p>

  <p>Highlands &amp; Islands Enterprise and SEC are taking the lead in developing an inward investment strategy for Shetland as a whole, with emphasis being placed on how incoming businesses can take advantage of the resources which would be created by the redundant MOD property assets.</p>

  <p>The first live broadcast of a parliamentary event on the Internet in the UK was by the Scottish Parliament on 1 July 1999, for the Opening Ceremony. This provided a &quot;proof of concept&quot; that the Internet could be a broadcast medium for parliamentary work, and also provide a diversity of visual and textual information at the same time. The service provided was more comprehensive than that at the Northern Ireland Assembly</p>

  <p>Investigations are being carried out into the feasibility of broadcasting committee and plenary meetings on the Internet. This is particularly important for committee meetings since committee rooms have little space for the public.</p>

  <p>The feasibility study concerns options for hosting the server for the Internet broadcasting, bandwidth to support demand for video streaming at the interim accommodation, and video player application software.</p>
