  <p>The number of Integrated Administration and Control System, Area Aid Application forms submitted to each SEERAD area office for each of the last four complete scheme years is shown below.</p>

  <p>The information on penalties is not readily available in exactly the form requested. The table indicates the percentage of these subsequently found by officials to contain errors which resulted in reductions or penalties being applied. These errors were identified either during administration checks or inspections. Claims submitted late and those &quot;reduced&quot; due to insufficient set-aside have not been counted in the percentage penalised. Not all of these adjustments to claims will have resulted in a financial penalty.</p>

  <p>In September 2003 I announced that, after listening to the sector and other stakeholders, I would publish a draft Bill to provide the regulatory framework that Scottish charities need and deserve. I am pleased to publish today a draft Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Bill for consultation.</p>

  <p>The draft Bill is a wide-ranging piece of legislation, bringing Scottish charity law requirements together in one place. It sets out a number of important measures including:</p>

  <p>creating a Scottish definition of a charity, with a public benefit requirement;</p>

  <p>providing for the newly-established Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator to become an independent statutory body with an enhanced range of powers, including granting charitable status and maintaining a statutory register of all charities operating in Scotland, and</p>

  <p>provisions to better regulate fundraising activity by and for charities.</p>

  <p>The draft bill also takes forward a number of measures which have been called for by charities for some time, including the creation of the new Scottish Charitable Incorporated Organisation, making charity re-organisation easier and widening trustees&#8217; investment powers.</p>

  <p>Copies of the draft bill (Bib. number 32822) and associated consultation paper (Bib. number 32823) have been placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre, and an electronic version will be made available on the Executive&#8217;s website at www.scotland.gov.uk/consultations. The consultation period ends on 25 August.</p>

  <p>I look forward to introducing the bill to Parliament at a suitable opportunity, once I have considered the views that will be expressed during this consultation period.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-6286 by Allan Wilson on 15 March 2004, what action it is taking to prevent the accumulation of toxic chemicals in (a) freshwater fish, (b) saltwater fish and (c) shellfish.</p>

  <p>Through the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, the Executive limits discharge of toxic chemicals to the marine and freshwater environment where they can be taken up by fish and shellfish. Other regulatory measures taken to protect the consumer from the effects of accumulated toxic chemicals, including those already present in the aquatic environment as a result of historic industrial use, are setting limits for certain contaminants in fish and shellfish and the testing of farmed fish for residues of veterinary medicines. These are matters for the Food Standards Agency and the Veterinary Medicines Directorate. In addition the industry is taking the following action:</p>

  <p>sourcing the highest quality raw materials &#8211; fish meal and fish oils used in aquaculture feedstuffs &#8211; from areas least affected;</p>

  <p>investing in additional processing technology to reduce levels further, and</p>

  <p>examining the potential benefits of incorporating different types of high quality plant-derived oil in feedstuffs.</p>

  <p>Portable oxygen has been available on GP prescription since 1 April 2004. The arrangements we have put in place are designed to ensure that GPs will be prescribing on the basis of specialist advice.

  <p>Statistical information about items dispensed on the NHS does not include the number of patients for whom prescriptions were written. Portable oxygen has been prescribable by GPs since 1 April 2004.

  <p>Part 1 of the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 establishes rights of responsible access to land in Scotland. Under the act, land owners have a duty to manage their land responsibly with respect to access rights. Guidance on responsible management of land will be included in the Scottish Outdoor Access Code, which will shortly be laid before Parliament. The terms of the proposed code, which has been prepared by Scottish Natural Heritage, advises that land owners should provide gates, gaps or other access points for the public to exercise their rights of access, when putting up a fence over long stretches of open country.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has issued no such guidance to local authorities specifically in relation to school building programmes.</p>

  <p>National Planning Policy Guideline 11: <em>Sport, Physical Recreation and Open Space</em> addresses the land use implications of sport and physical recreation, and describes the role of the planning system in making provision for sports and physical recreation and protecting and enhancing open space, including public parks, amenity open spaces, playing fields and sports pitches.</p>

  <p>In addition, Planning Advice Note 55: <em>The</em> <em>Private Finance Initiative and the Planning</em> <em>Process</em> notes that, where the sponsor of a school building project has agreed a development brief with the planning authority, the brief would highlight the relevant aspects of the development plan for the area and identify constraints and requirements in relation to such issues as open space and playing field provision.</p>

  <p>Issues concerning the ownership of such land will depend on the detail of the contract between individual authorities and their private sector partners. Generally, land in public ownership would be under the control of the private contractor for the duration of the PPP contract, and revert to council ownership at the end of the contract, as would the school buildings themselves.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Affairs Office in Washington liaised closely with the US-based organisers of Tartan Day events and were able to advise them of dates that ministers would be in the US. The office aimed to ensure that the Executive were represented at as many of these events as possible. Where ministers were unable to attend Executive officials did so wherever possible. The only Tartan Day events in New York that were not attended by the Executive were for the Scots Heritage exhibition at Ellis Island and the American Scottish Foundation&#8217;s business seminar &#8211; both of these events clashed with other engagements but were attended by representatives of Edinburgh and Glasgow City Councils. The Executive had advised the organisers that attendance was not possible in advance of any formal invitation being issued.</p>
