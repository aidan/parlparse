  <p>Yes. There is extensive European and domestic legislation and comprehensive guidance in place setting out standards and conditions for the welfare of farmed animals.</p>

  <p>All producers must meet these conditions. Regular inspections are undertaken and breaches of the legislation can result in prosecutions.</p>

  <p>Comprehensive standards and conditions for the welfare of farm animals, reflecting European and domestic legislation, are in place, in the form of Welfare Codes and leaflets and these are reviewed regularly.</p>

  <p>A new Welfare Code for sheep has recently been issued and, subject to parliamentary approval, it is proposed to issue new Welfare Codes for meat chickens and laying hens in the coming months. In addition, consultation exercises, seeking comments from all interested parties on proposed new Welfare Codes for cattle and pigs, will be undertaken in due course.</p>

  <p>We have no plans for community support officers with police powers to undertake neighbourhood patrols along the lines proposed south of the border. However, the Executive has provided funding under the Better Neighbourhood Services Fund for a pilot to explore the use of neighbourhood wardens in part of Paisley.

A further &#163;2 million, again over three years, has been allocated to the Lloyds TSB Foundation to support vulnerable children and young people affected by drug misuse.</p>

  <p>The Executive has issued guidance for consultation, <em>Getting Our Priorities Right</em>, which gives guidance on developing policies and promoting good practice for working with children and families where there is a drug misuse problem.

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Funding does not include additional resources of &#163;250,000 allocated to Greater Glasgow NHS Board in 2001-02 or &#163;500,000 in 2002-03 to meet the treatment costs of the Glasgow Drug Court pilot.</p>

  <p>2. The populations used for years 2001 and 2002 are projections based on the 2000 population.</p>

  <p>3. Problem drug misuse is defined as use of opiates and benzodiazepines.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>Waiting time information for drug misuse treatment is not held consistently by drug services across Scotland. We do regard waiting times to treatment as important and so we are currently seeking from Drug Action Teams some local information on waiting times for drug services, as part of the annual corporate planning arrangements.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not hold detailed information that would allow any accurate conclusion to be drawn as to whether additional costs are associated with the provision of separate infrastructures for non-denominational and Roman Catholic schools.

  <p>There are no plans to introduce anti-sectarian courses into the curriculum in Scottish schools.</p>

  <p>Guidance to education authorities and schools and the framework of national qualifications provide relevant opportunities for raising awareness of matters such as sectarianism, through education for citizenship within the subject areas of personal and social development, religious and moral education, and under social subjects within Environmental Studies. The Scottish Executive also funds the Scottish School Ethos Network, which shares good practice in promoting positive ethos in schools, and the Anti-Bullying Network which provides advice and consultancy to schools and shares good practice.</p>

  <p>There has been no assessment made of the education for mutual understanding programme in Northern Ireland, and there are no plans at present to introduce a similar programme in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Tackling sectarianism in Scottish schools falls under our overarching efforts to promote equal opportunities in schools.

  <p>There are no clinical standards for the use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). The decision to prescribe a drug for a patient is a matter for the clinical judgement of the patient's doctor based on the patient need, and is informed by the advice and guidance about the drug contained in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) and the Patient Information Leaflet. The SPC contains information on the safe and effective use of a product and provides the health professional with information that may help in determining a patient's possible susceptibility to the known side effects of HRT.</p>

  <p>Automated telling machine (cash machine) sites are liable for business rates in the same way that all non-domestic lands and heritages, which have not been specifically exempt from rates, are liable. Responsibility for setting rateable values for these sites lies with the Scottish assessors who are independent of both central and local government. Provision for exempting from rates sites occupied by automated telling machines in certain rural areas will be included in the forthcoming Local Government Bill.</p>

  <p>This is an operational matter for the force and information of this sort is not held centrally. Generally, however, the costs of training officers of Strathclyde Police would be met partly by the force from within the budget set for it by Strathclyde Joint Police Board and partly by the Scottish Police College.</p>

  <p>Police forces have contingency plans, developed with partner organisations, to cover a variety of situations that may occur at key premises or installations, including each prison, within their areas. These set out individual organisational roles and responsibilities as well as the actions to be taken should a contingency response be required.</p>

  <p>Nicol Stephen and Peter Peacock have recently met all the authorities who have submitted bids for support for school Public/Private Partnership projects to assist in informing decisions on the bids. They indicated to the authorities that further consideration would be necessary before decisions could be taken on individual bids. We expect to decide the way forward this month.</p>

  <p>Total policing costs in respect of Orange Order parades vary according to the size, location and timing of parades. Most parades (around 600 each year) take place in the areas covered by Strathclyde Police and Lothian and Borders Police. For local marches, where only a small police presence is required, the costs may be less than &#163;100. However, the costs associated with the largest three or four annual events in the Strathclyde Police area are each estimated to be nearly &#163;100,000.</p>

  <p>Total policing costs in relation to football matches with sectarian overtones also vary according to a range of factors, including the clubs involved and the importance of the match in the context of the league or cup. Policing costs will be incurred outside the stadium, for example on traffic and crowd control, as well as inside the ground. Depending on the circumstances, the overall costs of a fixture involving both Rangers and Celtic could be as high as &#163;70,000.</p>

  <p>Initiatives like Sure Start Scotland and New Community Schools offer exciting new and integrated ways of delivering core social work, education and health services. We are evaluating their impact both on services and service users and expect to report by mid 2003.</p>

  <p>The Executive supports the work of the Scottish Social Services Council in promoting social work as a career and promoting social work training. As part of the action plan launched on 18 April, the Executive will establish an awareness and recruitment campaign which will include encouraging people to apply for social work training courses.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is providing &#163;20 million under the Inclusion Programme in both 2002-03 and 2003-04. These resources are to facilitate the inclusion of children with special educational needs in mainstream schools and to bring the length of the school week in special schools into line with mainstream provision. In addition, the Executive is providing &#163;7.8 million to education authorities in both 2002-03 and 2003-04 (up from &#163;5.4 million in 2001-02) for the development and training of teachers and school support staff working in SEN. These funds can be used to enable teachers to attend a range of in-service and post-graduate training courses offering both general SEN training and training in specific aspects of SEN.</p>

  <p>The Executive is also funding an Inclusive Schools project, run by Aberdeen University and to be completed in autumn this year, which will provide schools with examples of good practice in inclusive schooling for children with special educational needs.</p>

  <p>Information on the number of special educational needs units built is not held centrally. However, within the last three years, 18 special educational needs units were opened. These figures include an existing special unit previously falling within the budgetary control of a mainstream school, but which has now been re-classified as an autonomous unit. Also included are special schools which have been re-classified as special units. Information on the capacity of these units is not available.</p>

  <p>No specific instructions have been given to the Enterprise Networks with respect to providing opportunities for the development of refrigerator decommissioning industries. Decommissioning firms will be attracted by the clear market opportunity and I would expect the Enterprise Networks to provide advice and guidance to any such companies as part of their strategic remit to develop business and in ways consistent with the principles of sustainable development.</p>

  <p>The action programme 2002 to reduce youth crime was launched in January. This programme outlines the steps we are taking to build a safer Scotland and to reduce youth offending. We have invested &#163;25.5 million over four years to improve the range, quality and availability of intensive community-based programmes for persistent young offenders. Through the Youth Justice steering group, we are working closely with SCRA and representatives of the children's hearings system to identify further improvements for tackling persistent offending.</p>
