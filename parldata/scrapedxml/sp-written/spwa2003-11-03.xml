  <p>The answer given to question S2W-2779 noted that <em>The Way Forward: A Framework for Economic Development in Scotland</em> describes the overarching strategy within which more detailed policy programmes take place rather than describing detailed measurable targets. There is no <em>single</em> indicator that can be used to measure the quality of life. The partnership agreement sets out a comprehensive set of priorities and commitments, progress against all of which will improve the quality of life in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no plans to publish its contribution to the Allsopp Review, however it will be made available on the Treasury website, in due course, as part of the Allsopp Review reporting arrangements.</p>

  <p>One of the key messages from the Scottish Executive was that there is a clear need to recognise the new environment in which we are producing economic statistics, both at the UK and at the sub-UK levels, and to identify what is required in order to monitor and deliver Government commitments within the various levels of central and devolved government. We also identified several areas where there are gaps in regional economic statistics.</p>

  <p>The Chancellor&#8217;s five economic tests relate to the UK economy and the decision on whether to recommend UK entry into the European Monetary Union (EMU). This decision is a reserved matter, and therefore a matter for the UK Government. The UK Government will only recommend UK membership of EMU if it considers it to be in the national economic interest. The Secretary of State for Transport and Scotland represents Scottish interests in the UK Government.</p>

  <p>The member will be aware from media reports on 16 and 17 October that the <em>Jambo</em> has completely capsized. I am advised that its cargo is now lying on the seabed under the vessel and in its immediate vicinity and that it is no longer practicable to continue to recover it. As a consequence the salvage operation has come to a close. The site is now subject to environmental monitoring, involving the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and Fisheries Research Services (FRS), which will continue over the winter months.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive had been fully involved in the salvage operation through the environment group which was established immediately after the <em>Jambo</em> sank on 29 June. Scottish ministers have been kept constantly informed of progress. I am satisfied that all practicable steps were taken to recover as much of the cargo as possible as quickly as possible, allowing for the unique and extremely difficult circumstances surrounding this unfortunate incident. In the light of that, and of the most recent events, the Scottish Executive has not made, and has no plans to make, representations to Her Majesty&#8217;s Government.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive set out in its Framework for Higher Education how it is working with the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council (SHEFC) and the higher education (HE) sector to ensure that those who have the talent and potential to succeed within HE are enabled to do so, wherever they live or whatever their circumstances. Specifically in Lanarkshire, Bell College was designated as a higher education institution (HEI) in 2001 and was allocated &#163;8.984 million for the academic year 2003-04 through SHEFC. In allocating an additional 340 funded places to help tackle geographic concentrations of low levels of participation in HE in 2003-04, North Lanarkshire was one of the four local authority areas that were targeted by SHEFC.</p>

  <p>We outline in <em>Further Education In Scotland 2002</em> how we have helped develop the further education sector. We are committed to ensuring that further education opportunities are accessible by everyone no matter where they live or their personal circumstances. We have delegated to the Scottish Further Education Funding Council (SFEFC) the duty to secure adequate and efficient provision of further education in Scotland. We expect SFEFC to allocate budgets to individual colleges, and offer other support and guidance, in a way which takes account of that duty.</p>

  <p>The Executive believes that complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) may offer relief to some people suffering from a wide variety of conditions. A GP may refer a patient for CAM if, in his or her clinical judgement, it is appropriate. The GP remains responsible for the patient&#8217;s medical care.

On the first of these, the committee concluded that the report did not support the assertion that asthma was more common in an area close to the opencast coal mine under study. On the second, the committee concluded that the respiratory health of children living in communities close to opencast sites was very similar to that of children living in communities distant from such sites.</p>

  <p>While I am unable to comment on any individual case, I expect that where a treatment has been recommended by NHS Quality Improvement Scotland and clinical need can be demonstrated then it should be provided.</p>

  <p>The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) recently recommended photodynamic therapy (PDT) for age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) in some circumstances. NICE has recommended the use of PDT for a group of people with &quot;wet&quot; ARMD who have a confirmed diagnosis of classic subfoveal choroidal neovascularisation (CNV), with no sign of occult CNV. Individuals should also have at least 6/60 vision.</p>

  <p>Consideration was not given to the use of PDT in occult CNV associated with wet ARMD as at the time the photosensitising agent used in the therapy was not licensed for this condition.</p>

  <p>NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NQIS) has stated that this advice is as valid for Scotland as it is for England and Wales. NHSScotland takes account of advice and evidence from NHS Quality Improvement Scotland and provides funding to ensure that recommended drugs or treatments are made available to meet clinical need.</p>

  <p>The Graduate Endowment is not, however, a deferred tuition fee. Many of those who are eligible to receive free tuition will not have to pay the endowment. There are therefore no plans to review these arrangements.</p>

  <p>In the first instance those commissioning services should monitor and evaluate the quality of the services they provide, to ensure they meet their intended aim of meeting the needs, and contributing to the well-being, of users</p>

  <p>The Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care inspects all services regulated under the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001 against the relevant National Care Standards issued by Scottish ministers. The Standards describe what each individual person can expect from the service provider, and are used to monitor the quality of care services.</p>

  <p>The Social Work Services Inspectorate also has the task of evaluating the quality of social work services in Scotland. It does this by undertaking inspections or reviews of different aspects of social work services, and by producing an annual report on social work services in Scotland.</p>

  <p>As part of the Audit Scotland review process on hospital cleaning, NHS trusts in Argyll and Clyde agreed action plans to help them meet the recommendations. Spending on these plans is a matter for NHS Argyll and Clyde but progress is monitored by the auditors. The Scottish Executive has not allocated specific funding for cleaning services but the overall allocation to NHS Argyll and Clyde has increased by 7% on average over the last three years.

  <p>In the current and each of the next two years we are backing the action plan with &#163;30 million additional investment for local authority and NHS board partnerships.

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Prison Service accepts that &quot;slopping out&quot; is an undesirable practice and is committed to ending it as soon as possible. However, it will be some time before slopping out can be ended completely. The most realistic time that slopping out can be ended is about a year after the completion of the second of the two new prisons that were announced by the Executive on 5 September 2002 as part of its decisions on the prison estates review. A firm date cannot be given because a number of variable factors are involved; including future trends in prisoner numbers, issues affecting the timescale for completion of the new prisons such as the obtaining of planning permission, and the need to make arrangements for decanting and moving prisoners to allow existing accommodation to be improved.</p>

  <p>I have asked Dr Jon Hargreaves, Chief Executive of Scottish Water to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>An assessment was made of the capability of the existing capital delivery model to achieve the required capital efficiency. It concluded that the status quo was not a viable option to deliver the required capital efficiency in the available timescale. Having decided not to use the inherited delivery models, the options available revolved around outsourcing or partnering. There were emerging trends around outsourcing that indicated that the real, or perceived, loss of control is unacceptable to customers. In addition, there is significant evidence of risk &quot;bounce back&quot;. The ultimate reputation risk is carried by the client. Scottish Water&#8217;s focus was therefore on the creation of the most effective and efficient partnering arrangement. Scottish Water initiated a consultation exercise to explore the alternative means of delivering the capital programme. A range of delivery models were identified, five in number. Thereafter comments were sought from external parties who had no vested interest in the chosen model and the final delivery model established.</p>

  <p>I have asked Dr Jon Hargreaves, Chief Executive of Scottish Water to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>A comprehensive selection process was implemented, complying with European procurement legislation, which ensured a competitive environment existed for the duration of the process</p>

  <p>Selection Process:</p>

  <p>Ojec Advert, April 2002 &#8211; 17 Expressions of interest received.</p>

  <p>Pre qualification questionnaire &#8211; reduced number to 10.</p>

  <p>Consultation phase &#8211; Discussions with 10 bidders and the industry as to the optimum delivery model for the procurement of the Capital Programme. Agreed to Integrated Partnership with two Consortia and Scottish Water.</p>

  <p>Implementation Process &#8211; Stage 1 Consortia number reduced to five.</p>

  <p>Implementation Process &#8211; Stage 2 Detailed tender process including cost models, scenarios, on site reviews, commercial financial arrangements, capital programme verification, presentations and interviews (incl. several board members), business plan submission, assessment centre.</p>

  <p>Clarification Process &#8211; Intention from the above was to reduce number to final two. However, to achieve flexibility and best fit, i.e. two consortia and Scottish Water, further clarification was sought, this included, management fees, staff levels, incentive mechanism, use of engineering trading unit and contract services and assessed before the final two were presented to the board on 29 Jan 2003 for approval to proceed to the next stage.</p>

  <p>I have asked Dr Jon Hargreaves, Chief Executive of Scottish Water to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Processes have been established to ensure Scottish Water (SW) maintains a governance role and ensures Scottish Water Solutions are delivering the programme and projects, within the programme, for best value. Benchmarking of projects will be carried out to assess solutions targets against industry best practice again to ensure best value is being achieved.</p>

  <p>SW continues to assume full responsibility for the capital programme</p>

  <p>SW has established a mechanism for controlling the spend on delivering the capital programme.</p>

  <p>Capex approval process, mirrors SW&#8217;s process, and ensures approval of the cost of individual projects is on the basis of best value.</p>

  <p>Key performance indicators have been established and will be monitored by Scottish Water.</p>

  <p>As set out in the Water Industry (Scotland) Act 2002, Scottish Water must, in exercising its functions, act in the way best calculated to contribute to sustainable development. Sustainable management of water is also a requirement of the European Water Framework Directive. Scottish Water have been developing a sustainable development action plan, which includes a commitment to protect and manage our water resources and encourage their customers to use water more efficiently in homes and businesses. Once finalised, the intention is to publish annual updates on progress.</p>

  <p>This would be a commercial matter for BT. We are, of course, committed to extending broadband connectivity across Scotland and our approach is subject to state aid regulations. Achieving pervasive, affordable broadband coverage is likely to involve a mix of technologies and hence our broadband strategy is technology and supplier neutral.</p>

  <p>We have no such plans, since achieving pervasive, affordable broadband coverage in Scotland is likely to involve a mix of technologies, not just asymmetric digital subscriber line. Our broadband strategy is technology and supplier neutral and also subject to state aid regulations.</p>

  <p>No. Broadband does have the potential, particularly through e-business, to impact on local economic growth and on population retention. This is precisely why we have a broadband strategy and initiatives aiming to achieve pervasive, affordable broadband coverage across Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Executive will, of course, evaluate the effect of its polices in Scotland as part of its commitment to evidence-based policy.</p>

  <p>When the three former water authorities were set up in 1996, they inherited infrastructure which had been under funded for decades. By the end of the current investment period, some &#163;4 billion will have been invested by Scottish Water and its predecessor authorities to help bring the water and wastewater infrastructure up to acceptable standards and to comply with the public health and environmental standards required by legislation. This is the biggest level of investment ever made in such services in Scotland.</p>

  <p>I would hope that in so doing, the current arrangements for provision of water and waste water services are closely tied to the aspirations of communities for clean water and a safe environment. In these circumstances, I can confirm that the Executive has no plans to return the control of water services and its provision to local authorities.</p>
