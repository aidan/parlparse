  <p>The Scottish Government has a very clear commitment to ensuring that the whole of Scotland benefits from the Commonwealth Games in 2014.</p>

  <p>We will work with relevant agencies and local authorities to ensure that, Scottish businesses are well-placed to bid for contracts arising from the games, that visitors to the games are encouraged to travel to other parts of the country, and that youngsters everywhere are inspired to take up sport.</p>

  <p>Further information on how we intend to deliver a lasting legacy from the 2014 Commonwealth Games will be published for consultation within the first 100 days of winning the bid.</p>

  <p>A number of budget lines across the Scottish Government provide resources for tackling drug misuse in 2007-08.</p>

  <p>&pound;31.7 million was allocated from the Justice portfolio in 2007-08. Of this, &pound;23.7 million was allocated to NHS health boards for drug treatment and rehabilitation services. &pound;3 million was transferred to the Health and Wellbeing portfolio and Community Justice Services for drugs related activities. The remainder was retained to fund centrally determined projects.</p>

  <p>In 2007-08, an additional &pound;12.1 million has been made available for drug treatment and rehabilitation for offenders including Drug Treatment Testing Orders.</p>

  <p>There is also expenditure on drugs from the local government budget. The level of this funding has been significant, and at least comparable to the ring-fenced funding provided by central government. The most recent figures available show that in 2005-06 &pound;37.3 million was spent by local authorities on community care services for people with drug and/or alcohol problems.</p>

  <p>Health boards also use some of their unified budget for drug treatment services. For example, the most recent figures show that costs and fees for methadone mixture in 2005-06 amounted to &pound;12.2 million.</p>

  <p>Other relevant budgets, such as the police and some of those within the Health and Wellbeing portfolio also used some of their resources towards tackling drug misuse. Education authorities also provide drugs education in schools from their wider budgets.</p>

  <p>We are delighted that the Cross Border Co-operation Programme has been approved by the European Commission. The programme brings a welcome &euro;192 million of EU investment to a &euro;256 million programme for the cross border region, which includes parts of Western Scotland.</p>

  <p>This provides a great opportunity for Scottish organisations, including local authorities, to collaborate with their Irish and Northern Irish partners in developing creative and innovative projects that will bring long term economic and social benefits to the cross border area. The rules for the programme require Scottish partners to work with partners from Northern Ireland and the Republic in joint projects of mutual benefit.</p>

  <p>Individual project proposals will be dealt with by the programme&rsquo;s Managing Authority, the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB), on a case-by-case basis. The SEUPB will provide support and advice on all applications and we would encourage all potential project applicants to make early contact with SEUPB to ensure their proposals are presented in the best possible way. Scottish Government officials will work closely with the SEUPB and their Irish and Northern Irish counterparts to promote eligible Scottish projects to the best advantage.</p>

  <p>The programme sets out a range of actions that local authorities and other partners might respond to. These include initiatives to support enterprise through economic development and community sustainability under the specific themes of: (1) enterprise; (2) tourism; (3) collaboration, and (4) infrastructure. All project applications must clearly show that they contribute to one of these themes.</p>

  <p>Scotland's membership of the European Union, currently as part of the United Kingdom, requires it to meet all obligations with relevance to its devolved competences, including the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). Full membership as an independent state would of course provide Scotland with a greater influence in negotiations on the much needed reform of the CFP.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Budget: Spending Review 2007 sets out our intention to invest &pound;1.44 billion in increasing the supply of good quality, sustainable housing over the period 2008-11. The details will be published in due course. Communities Scotland is commissioning research to establish the baseline costs of energy efficiency measures for social housing and then to explore the financial implications of CO <sub>2</sub> reductions at specific levels.</p>

  <p>All the new homes to be provided will be built to the high environmental standards set by the relevant planning requirements and building standards applicable at that time. Current Scottish building regulations, published in 2007, require that the energy performance of new homes should reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from new housing by an average of 23% beyond the previous standards. <em>Scottish Planning Policy on Renewables </em>(SPP6), which was also introduced in 2007, requires that any developments of 500m<sup>2</sup> or more should include low and zero carbon equipment to reduce carbon emissions by at least a further 15%.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The SPS does not keep cost data specific to fine defaulters.</p>

  <p>In 2006-07, there was an average daily population of 46 fine defaulters and the average annual cost per prisoner place was &pound;30,989. So an estimated cost of imprisoning people for non-payment of fines in 2006-07 would be around &pound;1.4 million.</p>

  <p>In 2006-07, there were 5,963 fine default receptions and the average fine outstanding per reception was &pound;277.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>(i) The rateable value ranges shown in the table correspond to those on page 12 of the Scottish Budget: Spending Review 2007.</p>

  <p>(ii) The table shows the number of non-domestic properties with rateable values of up to &pound;15,000 in North Lanarkshire, South Lanarkshire and Falkirk. Information is also given for all of East Ayrshire and East Dunbartonshire, as parts of these local authority areas also fall within the Central Scotland parliamentary region.</p>

  <p>(iii) The number of eligible businesses will be lower than the number of non-domestic properties in each area, because some businesses have more than one property. This may affect eligibility for relief under the Small Business Bonus Scheme, which will depend on:</p>

  <p>the combined rateable value of all properties in Scotland which a business owns, leases or is otherwise entitled to occupy;</p>

  <p>whether the property is eligible for one of the existing rates relief schemes, and</p>

  <p>the level of other public sector assistance received by the business.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Following the opening of replacement accommodation at HM Prison Perth in October 2007, the design capacity of the estate is approximately 6,400. HM Prison Addiewell is due to open in December 2008, providing 700 places, and new house blocks will open at HM Prison Edinburgh (early 2009) and HM Young Offenders Institution Polmont (late 2009) providing a further 250 places. When this additional accommodation comes on stream, subject to prisoner numbers at the time, it will be used to reduce the levels of cell-sharing across the estate and to allow unfit accommodation to be decommissioned or replaced.</p>

  <p>Work is also underway to deliver a new 700 place prison at Bishopbriggs. Following the termination of the competition to design, build, operate and finance the new prison on 24 August 2007, SPS is now preparing for a new competition to design and build a prison for public sector operation and management as instructed by the Cabinet Secretary for Justice on 22 August 2007. We expect to commence this procurement process around the turn of this calendar year and to award a construction contract around the end of 2008, with a view to HM Prison Bishopbriggs opening during 2011.</p>

  <p>The Cabinet Secretary for Justice also announced in August 2007 that HM Prison Aberdeen and HM Prison Peterhead (both considered to be unfit for purpose) would be replaced with a new prison in the Peterhead area (HM Prison Grampian). SPS is now taking forward this development, and will be using the private sector to construct the prison and public sector staff to operate and manage the facility. No firm date has yet been set for the opening of HM Prison Grampian &ndash; further work is required, including site identification, securing planning permission and development of a specification. It is therefore likely to open after HM Prison Bishopbriggs.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has not received such a formal request from the leader of Glasgow City Council.</p>

  <p>We have announced as part of the enterprise network reform that responsibility for local regeneration and local delivery of Business Gateway would transfer to local authorities. The aim of the reform was to de-clutter the enterprise landscape in Scotland and to allow Scottish Enterprise to focus on priorities which will make a net positive impact on our national economy.</p>

  <p>Glasgow City Council has a budget as updated under SR07 and it is up to the local authority to prioritise within that budget.</p>

  <p>It is also important to remember that there will still be a Scottish Enterprise local office in Glasgow which will continue to work in partnership with Glasgow City Council to deliver.</p>

  <p>This budget provides a central fund to support strategic long-term investment in the evidence base in cross-cutting policy areas across all the portfolios. Work for the Strategic Spending Review and, more recently, development of high-level outcomes for the Purpose and five Strategic Objectives has revealed gaps in the evidence base particularly around the evaluation of longer-term policy impacts. Directorate research budgets focus mainly on short-term sectoral needs. A central fund will support the development of performance analysis and high-level policy evaluation designed to assess our performance in achieving the Purpose and Strategic Objectives.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>The bi-annual <em>Social Work Posts and Vacancies: October 2007</em> publication contains national level data on social worker numbers at service level. For statistical reasons, these cannot be broken down by local authority and the latest available annual statistics have therefore been used as noted above.</p>

  <p>1. Total establishment = WTE filled posts + WTE vacant posts.</p>

  <p>2. In the October 2006 census, there was a change in methodology to eliminate the double counting of staff covering for absent staff. Therefore, 2006 figures are not comparable with previous years.</p>

  <p>3. Staff numbers may fluctuate over time as a result of various factors, including changes in the way services are provided and changes in the numbers of vacancies.</p>

  <p>4. For some local authorities, certain services are provided by other departments (e.g. some services for children may be provided by education departments). This will result in some differences in the level of staffing between local authorities.</p>

  <p>5. In 2006, data for Dundee City was not provided. The data supplied for 2005 has been used.</p>

  <p>6. In 2006, children and families data for City of Edinburgh was not provided. The 2005 data for children and families has been used.</p>

  <p>7. Vacancy data for Eilean Siar was not provided for 2006, so 2005 figures have been used.</p>
