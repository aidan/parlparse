  <p>In the period 2000-03 the Executive has provided &#163;99,000 for training to organisations in the voluntary sector that specifically support carers. Over the same period we have also provided &#163;500,000 to voluntary sector bodies to help implement the Carers Strategy, including the development of carer-related training tools. The Executive also provides substantial resources to local authorities and the voluntary sector to support carers, and some of these resources will be used for training purposes.</p>

  <p>The current round of Structural Funds Programmes runs from 2000 to 2006. Allocation of funds ceases for all programmes at the end of 2006, although activity may continue to the end of 2006. Elements of funding in transitional programmes reduce after 2005. In Highlands and Islands, this relates specifically to the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). However, part of the area will remain eligible. The regulations provide for coverage in 2006 for areas which meet the Objective Two criteria. This is not Objective Two status as such. It is merely a basis for determining eligibility for ERDF in the final year for allocating funds under the programme. We will be discussing with the Commission what this means in terms of precise coverage towards the end of 2003.</p>

  <p>The question of future regional funding is dependent on the outcome of discussions on the future of European Regional policy. Commission proposals are due to be published in 2004.</p>

  <p>The National Grid for Learning Scotland web services provides a range of resources, information and facilities for teachers, learners, parents, community groups and other stakeholders in education. Expenditure comes from the Education Department&#8217;s budget. In the most recent budget publication, <i>The Scottish Executive Draft Budget 2003-04 </i> ( <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library5/finance/dbd03-00.asp" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library5/finance/dbd03-00.asp)</a> , the expenditure is included in the &quot;New educational developments&quot; line in Table 3.03.</p>

  <p>The Older People&#8217;s web section is an integral part of the Executive&#8217;s website. The work to develop and maintain it is being carried out by staff in the Older People&#8217;s Unit and is a routine part of their on-going work.

  <p>In order to increase the uptake of LPG in Scotland, the Scottish Executive introduced its complementary scheme autogas+ on 1 July 2002. Autogas+ is funded from the Powershift budget. The following table shows autogas+ grant vehicle applications that have been approved and paid to date.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will make representations to Her Majesty&#8217;s Government on action that could be taken to combat the illegal smuggling of wildlife through ports in the light of the report by the World Wide Fund for Nature which identified the ports in Lerwick and Greenock as being in the top 10 wildlife smuggling ports in the UK.</p>

  <p>The control of illegal trade in wildlife imported into the UK is implemented and enforced by the UK Government through the Control of Trade in Endangered Species (Enforcement) Regulations 1997 which set down the police powers, offences and penalties for breaches of the legislation.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive appreciates the concerns expressed by the WWF and the Trade Records Analysis of Flora and Fauna in Commerce (TRAFFIC) in highlighting potential weaknesses in the efforts of Government and its agencies in their efforts to combat illegal trade in wildlife. The Executive is in regular contact with the UK Government on all aspects of wildlife crime through its membership of the Partnership for Action Against Wildlife Crime (PAW), which includes key Departments of the UK Government, the Police and other enforcement agencies.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s commitment to tackling the illegal international wildlife trade is clearly demonstrated through its funding in April this year of a two-year secondment of an intelligence officer to the UK&#8217;s National Wildlife Crime Unit, based at the National Criminal Intelligence Service in London.</p>

  <p>The specific issues relating to the level of illegal smuggling of wildlife through Scottish ports referred to in the WWF report will be raised by the Executive&#8217;s representative on the PAW Steering Group when it next meets in January 2003.</p>

  <p>There are no immediate plans to take such action. The WWF report has only just been received and we will be giving consideration to its findings and recommendations in due course.</p>
