  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what factors explain the 30% decrease in the value of manufactured drink exports in the year 1999 Q2 announced in News Release SE1161/1999, and what level of confidence it has in the accuracy of these figures.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/1999-11-18.S1W-2365.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80205" speakername="Henry McLeish" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-99/wa1118.htm#2365">

  <p>A significant factor affecting this decline is likely to have been the decrease in world markets during this period, especially that resulting from the economic crisis in East Asia in 1998. This particularly affected whisky exports, which were especially strong in this market.</p>

  <p>The decrease in the value of manufactured drink exports during the period is also a reflection of the historically high levels of drink exports during 1997. However, current levels are still above those in 1995.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is confident in the accuracy of these figures. They are produced by members of the Government Statistical Service and are based on data collected by the Office for National Statistics. The series is derived from a sample of drink manufacturers covering an average of over 90% of total turnover in this industry between the first quarter of 1995 and the second quarter of 1999.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&#8217;s Scottish manufactured export figures are produced by members of the Government Statistical Service using data collected by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).</p>

  <p>The series for manufactured exports in real prices is derived at the five digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) level by deflating each current price series at that level using the appropriate ONS UK Export Producer Price Index. This enables aggregate series for Scottish manufactured exports to be derived at 1995 prices.</p>

  <p>The comparison of the aggregate current and real price export series at 1995 prices generates an implied producer price index for Scottish manufactured exports as a whole. This is shown in the table below for the period 1995 quarter one to 1999 quarter two.</p>

  <p>Salmon stocks, as measured by annual catches, continue to decline throughout the range of the species. This has led to advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) urging caution in the exploitation of both early-running multi-sea winter (MSW) salmon and later running one-sea winter (1SW) salmon. In the circumstances, alteration of the fishing season as suggested would lead to increased exploitation of a diminishing resource, and therefore the Scottish Executive have no plans to extend the autumn fishing season.</p>

  <p>The Age of Legal Capacity (Scotland) Act 1991 allows a person under the age of 16 years to consent to any surgical, medical or dental procedure or treatment where, in the opinion of a qualified medical practitioner attending him, he is capable of understanding the nature and possible consequences of the procedure or treatment. This envisages a situation where it may not be necessary to obtain parental consent if the child has sufficient understanding, a qualified medical practitioner is present and there are no other legal constraints on that consent.</p>

  <p>Under the National Health Service (General Ophthalmic Services) (Scotland) Regulations 1986, the parent, guardian or other adult person who has charge of a child under 16 must apply for an eye examination on that child's behalf.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the tables issued to MSPs on 6 October following the Minister of Finance&#8217;s announcement to Parliament of the Executive&#8217;s proposed spending revisions. Figures for real terms spending on the health budget were included in those tables. The provision for 1999-2000 includes &pound;139 million end-year flexibility carried forward from 1998-99. It is necessary to exclude this element of provision to compare like with like. On that basis there is a real terms increase of 3.7% in the health budget in 2000-01.</p>

  <p>The Chief Scientist Office (CSO) of the Scottish Executive is not currently funding any research projects specifically on prostate cancer. However, in 1998-99, 20 cancer-related research projects with a total value of nearly &pound;2.2 million were being funded by CSO. Many of the findings of these projects will have a relevance to prostate cancer.</p>

  <p>CSO also funds research indirectly which may have a relevance to prostate cancer. It is estimated that &pound;4.7 million of the general funding allocated to the NHS in Scotland for research was used in support of cancer studies.</p>

  <p>The main agency through which the UK Government supports medical and clinical research is the Medical Research Council (MRC) which is estimated to spend some &pound;15 million per year directly on research into cancer.</p>

  <p>Checks of entitlement to free prescriptions (point of dispensing checks) were introduced as a deterrent to fraud against the NHS. Patients have been asked by community pharmacists to provide proof of entitlement since January 1999, and by dispensing doctors since August 1999.</p>

  <p>It is too early to quantify savings arising from these arrangements, not least because income from prescription charges is subject to a variety of influences. However, although increased income cannot be attributed solely to the introduction of point of dispensing checks, this is likely to be a factor. Since their introduction there has been an increase in the number of prescriptions on which charges have been paid, and in the number of prescription prepayment certificates (season tickets) issued.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to strengthening the current levels of women&#8217;s representation on public bodies. The Scottish Executive has retained the targets set by the previous Scottish Office of increasing the proportion of women appointees from the 1998 level of 47% to 50% by 2002, and of increasing the proportion of bodies chaired by women from 22% to 35% over the same period. We are currently reviewing systems for appointment, including measures to improve women&#8217;s representation, and I shall be making a statement in due course.</p>

  <p>There was no question of the priority areas for funding being decided on 1 October. The purpose of the consultation announced on that day was to seek views on the priorities to be used. We are now considered the views expressed and announced on 16 November that applications relating to new measures made available from 31 March 1999 and projects relating to self-standing systems for the storage and disposal of farm waste will be given priority.</p>
