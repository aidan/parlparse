  <p>The incidence of shellfish poison contamination is making it necessary for scallop fishermen and processors to make changes to their operations and to seek opportunities for diversification. I have advised the industry that my department is willing to discuss ways of helping the scallop sector to make changes to take account of this problem.</p>

  <p>The shellfish sector has considerable potential despite these problems. Scallop landings in 1999, the first year of major closures, were valued at &pound;16.4 million. This was higher than the average value of landings in the period 1992-98 of &pound;15.3 million.</p>

  <p>The provision of dental services in general is kept under review by health boards, Acute Trusts and Primary Care NHS Trusts which work in co-operation to ensure availability of and improvements in services. In relation to primary care orthodontic services, Primary Care NHS Trusts and island health boards may apply for approval to Scottish Ministers to employ specialist orthodontic salaried dentists where in their view this would be the most appropriate way forward to tackle problems with access to such services in their areas.</p>

  <p>We have made additional provision for expenditure on the environment in Scotland by the Scottish Executive and local authorities of almost &pound;190 million in total over the next three years (2001-02 to 2003-04) - a major funding package to deliver on our commitments to the environment and set in train action now to protect future generations.</p>

  <p>The Environmental Protection provision includes extra grant-in-aid to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency of &pound;16.5 million over the three years (&pound;5.3 million/&pound;5.3 million/&pound;5.9 million); and increased provision for waste initiatives.</p>

  <p>The Natural Heritage provision will give Scottish Natural Heritage &pound;22.7 million extra over the three years (&pound;7.0 million/&pound;7.3 million/&pound;8.4 million), with a further &pound;10.6 million extra (&pound;2.1 million/&pound;3.3 million/&pound;5.2 million) going to the establishment of National Parks.</p>

  <p>The allocation for water represents the public expenditure support to the three Scottish water authorities to help finance their investment programmes to meet environmental and public health standards. The public expenditure treatment of the water authorities, which are public corporations, has changed substantially as a result of the move to resource budgeting. The figures in the table show total capital spending less profits, and do not take account of the cost of capital charge on net assets. No decisions have yet been made on the allocation of this provision between the three water authorities, and a further announcement will be made in due course. For the rest of the environment programme, there will be an increase from &pound;61 million to &pound;76 million &#8211; an overall percentage increase is 25% in real terms compared to 2000-01.</p>

  <p>In addition to these increases, we have provided almost &pound;50 million extra<strong> </strong>across the three years of the review period for environmental improvements within the overall increased expenditure by local authorities. This should enable local authorities to increase expenditure on flood prevention, coastal protection, access to the countryside and air quality and on dealing with waste and contaminated land.</p>

  <p>In addition to the general funding for local authorities on the environment, I shall be proposing special arrangements specifically on waste for the distribution of a further &pound;50 million extra over the review period to help local authorities to take forward implementation of the National Waste Strategy.</p>

  <p>Taken together with the spending increase of &pound;86.7 million set out in the table, this provides a total increase of almost &pound;190 million.</p>

  <p>Under the provisions of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982, local authorities shall seek to ensure that the total amount of licence fees receivable is sufficient to meet the costs of operating the licensing systems established under the Act, including the mandatory licensing of houses in multiple occupation (HMOs). Most fee income will derive from licence applications, but fees can also be charged for the issue of certified duplicate licences, the consideration of a material change of circumstances or a material change in premises used as HMOs, and the issue of certified true copies of entries in the register of licence applications. The level of charges is a matter for each local authority and details are not currently held centrally, although this is expected to be one of the matters to be included in the Scottish Executive&#8217;s monitoring of the operation of mandatory licensing of HMOs.</p>

  <p>Nursing students on diploma courses are supported by a non-means tested grant. The basic allowances are &pound;5,409 for those over 26 and &pound;4,803 for those under 26. Additional means tested support is provided for students with dependants, and excess placement travel costs are reimbursed.</p>

  <p>Support for nursing students on degree courses is by means of a means tested bursary and repayable student loan, subject to eligibility conditions. The bursary and loan each make up about 50% of the total living cost package and the maximum bursary payable is &pound;1,825. An additional allowance for approved travel costs over the first &pound;80 is also available. Where applicable, supplementary allowances of up to &pound;1,000 from the Lone Parents Grant, up to &pound;740 from the Two Homes Grant and an amount from the Dependants&#8217; Grant for students with a dependant spouse or children are also available.</p>

  <p>Students in receipt of either type of bursary also have their fees paid on their behalf by the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no plans to introduce abuse prevention projects into schools.</p>

  <p>All education authorities in Scotland have guidelines and procedures for child protection to ensure the safety and wellbeing of children and young people and to protect those adults working with them.</p>

  <p>Schools also play a part in the prevention of child abuse through the teaching they offer. <i>Promoting Personal Safety and Child Protection in the Curriculum</i> offers support to teachers in the planning and development of personal safety as an integral part of the curriculum. The Executive has also commissioned the University of Glasgow to create staff development materials, which will help schools to audit current practice and mount staff development activities.</p>

  <p><i>A Commitment to Protect - Supervising Sex Offenders in the Community</i> recommended that all education authorities should have in place a personal safety programme promoting pupils&#8217; skills, knowledge and understanding to assist them in living safely and feel empowered to reject inappropriate behaviour. Practical advice on this recommendation is being developed by the Expert Panel on Sex Offending.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is aware of these worrying trends and is committed to tackling the problem of under age drinking. Current action couples enforcement to reduce availability of alcohol to under-18s with targeted alcohol education to encourage a sensible approach to drinking. A national alcohol misuse strategy is currently being worked up and measures to tackle under age drinking will be an important factor.</p>

  <p>The Auditor General for Scotland&#8217;s report on the Holyrood project, published this week, explains in part 1 that the decision to adopt the &quot;construction management&quot; method of contracting was taken in July 1998 by &quot;project management&quot; in the Scottish Office, consistent with advice from the Design Team and the project&#8217;s cost consultants.</p>

  <p>I am informed that all implications of the various methods of procurement were considered by the Scottish Office before a decision was made to opt for the Construction Management/works package approach to the Holyrood building project in July 1998. There has been no direct criticism of this decision in the investigations carried out by John Spencely and auditors on the project. The Construction Management Agreement requires the appointed Construction Manager to put a framework in place for managing the construction process, with construction works being carried out by the Trade Contractors. This approach offers the flexibility to deliver each element of the building at the best possible price and has enabled progress to be made on site notwithstanding the continued development of the final design.</p>

  <p>The fit-out of the new Parliament building will be managed by the Holyrood Project Team acting together with the Scottish Parliament Procurement Office. It is envisaged that Bovis Lend Lease may have a role as the Parliament&#8217;s agent in procuring some elements of the fit-out, given their considerable understanding of the finished building and their existing responsibilities as Construction Manager for the project.</p>

  <p>SPCB Report No 4 was endorsed by the Parliament on 5 April 2000. This made clear that, based on the latest design proposals, the Holyrood building could be delivered for &pound;195 million. The Convener of the Holyrood Progress Group has reported to the SPCB that the Quantity Surveyor&#8217;s latest cost report for September 2000 is consistent with that figure. He has also assured me that, as the tendering process continues, the Design Team is carrying out an ongoing review of opportunities to identify any potential for further savings.</p>
