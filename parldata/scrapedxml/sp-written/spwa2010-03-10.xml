  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive for what reason it did not commission modelling from the University of Sheffield on the impact of minimum unit pricing of alcohol on low-income households when offered this at a cost of &pound;7,400.</p>

  <p>The University of Sheffield&rsquo;s minimum price research proposal provided an option to attempt to model the impact of minimum pricing on low income groups. The Sheffield proposal acknowledged that the small Scottish sample sizes meant that Scottish consumption and purchasing data may have been supplemented with UK-wide information, or the definition of &quot;low income&quot; relaxed. The proposal further noted that it was unlikely that price elasticity matrices for low income groups would be Scotland-specific, again due to sample size issues. The value of deriving estimates of the potential impact on low income groups in Scotland based on largely non-Scottish data was considered weak. In addition, the decision not to extend the study to low income groups was informed by the findings from the minimum price research carried out by the University Sheffield study for the Department of Health in England. That research suggested the impact of minimum pricing on moderate drinkers was likely to be limited, at around an extra &pound;6 per year (based on a 40p minimum price).</p>

  <p>The cost of updating the University of Sheffield minimum price model is &pound;36,272.25 (inclusive of VAT). The cost reflects the considerable amount of work required to integrate consumption data from the Scottish Health Survey 2008 and the Scottish Schools Adolescent Lifestyle and Substance Use Survey 2008, data from the 2008-09 Scottish Crime and Justice Survey, mortality figures and alcohol sales data into the model. These data were not available to the University of Sheffield researchers at the time of the original minimum pricing research.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Excludes mental illness hospitals, psychiatric units and maternity hospitals.</p>

  <p>2. Figures in this table relate only to those individuals who are treated as inpatients or day cases in an acute hospital. They do not include individuals managed as outpatients.</p>

  <p>3. Note that these figures include residents from other health boards that were treated in Highland and Island hospitals but do not include Highland and Island residents treated in other health boards.</p>

  <p>4. Discharges where alcohol-related diagnosis is recorded as primary or secondary reasons for admission to hospital.</p>

  <p>5. Diseases recorded using the World Health Organisation&rsquo;s International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD10).</p>

  <p>- Alcohol-related: F10, K70, X45, X65, Y15, Y90, Y91, E24.4, E51.2, G31.2, G62.1, G72.1, I42.6, K29.2, K86.0, O35.4, P04.3, Q86.0, T51.0, T51.1, T51.9, Y57.3, R78.0, Z50.2, Z71.4, Z72.1. These codes were defined in a recent in-depth review of ISD&rsquo;s core alcohol related code set. Further information about the review and resulting consultation process is available at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.alcoholinformation.isdscotland.org/alcohol_misuse/3986.html" target="_blank">http://www.alcoholinformation.isdscotland.org/alcohol_misuse/3986.html</a>.</p>

  <p>6. Caution is necessary when interpreting these figures. The recording of alcohol-related problems may vary from hospital to hospital.</p>

  <p>Due to the way alcohol related conditions are recorded, we are unable to determine whether or not the reason for admission is directly attributable to alcohol. Therefore, this figure may be an overestimate.</p>

  <p>Information in the table relates to discharges from acute non-obstetric, non-psychiatric hospitals. It should be noted that patients with alcohol-related conditions may be admitted to mental illness hospitals. Statistics for these admissions are not included in the table.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government, NHS Scotland and local authorities have recently embarked on a major programme to reshape care for older people and all aspects of delivering care are within the scope of that review. We are therefore committed to an extensive programme of public engagement as part of the work of the reshaping programme. Details of a series of national and local events will be announced shortly.</p>

  <p>We have also very recently launched Care Information Scotland which offers information and guidance for care and support services for older people. Further information is available at the following website<a href="http://www.careinfoscotland.co.uk/home.aspx" target="_blank"> http://www.careinfoscotland.co.uk/home.aspx</a>.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has made available &pound;2.6 million of pump priming funding through NHS boards and their stakeholders to help further develop eye care services in the community. An evaluation of the pilot projects has been undertaken and a report is currently being finalised.</p>

  <p>We have also made &pound;2.2 million available over this, and the next, financial year to pilot seven &quot;one stop shop&quot; models for sensory impairment services across Scotland. We are working alongside organisations representing people with visual and hearing impairments such as RNIB Scotland and Grampian Society for the Blind in piloting the &quot;one stop shop&quot; model. Areas that have a high proportion of older people, such as the Borders, Western Isles and Argyll and But, have been specifically chosen as pilots.</p>

  <p>Early discussions have been held with a major bus operator. However, the successful bus operator must be selected using a competitive tendering process.

  <p>There will be wide consultation and detailed pre-planning to minimise disruption to all vehicles. Whilst animal welfare is an important consideration, transporters will need to take account of potential delays at Kessock Bridge when they plan their journeys. It is not anticipated that traffic delays will be excessive once additional measures are in place and sufficient advance warning is provided for road users to help them better plan their journeys taking account of the roadworks on the bridge.</p>

Moving the core storage facility to Keyworth will affect ease of access and increase costs for students in Scotland.

  <p>There are a wide range of provisions that have the potential directly or indirectly to require actions by landowners or property owners to remedy deficiencies of one kind or another.</p>

  <p>Some examples of particular note are:</p>

  <p>- In the rural environment, farm dwelling houses and other farm buildings listed under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) (Scotland) Act 1997, the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 and sites included in the Inventory of Historic Gardens and Designed Landscapes are protected under Cross Compliance from alteration, damage or destruction by land managers who receive European Common Agricultural Policy support payments.</p>

  <p>- In the historical environment,though it will often be the case that local authorities may also use other powers under eg the Building or Housing Acts to deal with historic buildings.</p>

  <p>Particularly, the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) (Scotland) Act 1997, Sections 42 and 43 relate to listed buildings and allow either local authorities or Scottish ministers to serve a repairs notice as the basis for the compulsory purchase of the property. Section 49 allows local authorities or Scottish ministers to serve an urgent works notice on an unoccupied listed building. Section 50 allows the local authority or Scottish ministers to recover the costs incurred in serving a notice under Section 49 from the owner. Section 68 allows the powers under Section 49 to be applied to unlisted buildings within a conservation area.</p>

  <p>In addition, Section 5 of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 allows Scottish ministers to carry outworks for the preservation of a scheduled monument in cases of urgency. Section 10 allows Scottish ministers to acquire compulsorily any ancient monument for the purpose of securing its preservation.</p>

  <p>In the urban environment:</p>

  <p>- Section 179 of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 provides planning authorities with the power to serve a notice on the owner, lessee or occupier of land in their area where they consider that the state of the property is adversely affecting the amenity of the area. Such notices may require specified steps to be taken to improve the condition of the land.</p>

  <p>Also, the Building (Scotland) Act 2003 contains powers for local authorities to deal with defective and dangerous buildings. Section 28 allows a local authority to serve a defective building notice on the owner of the building where they consider that there is a defect(s) which requires rectification to bring the building into a reasonable state of repair, taking into account its age, type and location.</p>

  <p>Section 29 of that act requires a local authority to deal with dangerous buildings and carry out work to make the building and surrounding area safe. They may undertake emergency work and serve a dangerous building notice under Section 30.</p>

  <p>Commitments set out in <em>Better Cancer Care, An Action Plan </em> are funded directly and indirectly through a number of different Scottish Government channels.</p>

  <p><em>Better Cancer Care </em>included a commitment to support the ongoing development of MacMillan Cancer Support&rsquo;s Scotland Service Network through the award of a &pound;500,000 investment over two years (2008-10) to extend the range and quality of benefits and financial advice given through network partnerships.</p>

  <p>Funding is made available for the replacement of radiotherapy equipment, which in 2009-10 amounted to &pound;20.6 million. Funding for the coming financial year is still to be determined.</p>

  <p>A total of &pound;4.54 million has been committed to deliver the breast, bowel and cervical cancer screening programmes in 2010-11.</p>

  <p>For the cancer waiting times commitments, a total of &pound;519,558 was provided <br /> 2008-09, and &pound;711,000 in 2009-10 on a non-recurring basis to NHS boards. The budgets for 2010-11 have not yet been finalised.</p>

  <p>In 2009-10, a total of &pound;65,000 of Section 16B grant funding was made available to Maggie&rsquo;s Centres, Marie Curie Cancer Care and Breast Cancer Care, for specific project work to support people living with cancer, in line with commitments in <em>Better Cancer Care</em>. It is expected that a number of Scottish cancer charities will benefit from Section 16B grant funding in 2010-11, in recognition of their invaluable contribution to the delivery of cancer care.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government Chief Scientist&rsquo;s Office is currently funding 33 cancer research projects at a cost of &pound;6.1 million. In addition, the Chief Scientist Office spends approximately &pound;11.8 million per annum supporting the cost of cancer research carried out in the NHS.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Government is funding a range of healthy lifestyle campaigns around alcohol, smoking, sun/UV exposure, and obesity, which will all help to lower the number of cancer diagnoses in Scotland, as set out in <em>Better Cancer Care</em>.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has not met with representatives of the UK Government about its boiler scrappage scheme, but officials have consulted on a number of occasions the Energy Saving Trust which is managing the scheme on behalf of the Department of Energy and Climate Change. We are currently developing a boiler scrappage scheme that will suit the needs of Scottish householders and support the forthcoming Energy Efficiency Action Plan.</p>

  <p>Note: 1. As at January 2010.</p>

  <p>In 2008-09, there were 97 cases currently (as at January 2010) recorded as homicide by the police, in Scotland. These cases resulted in the deaths of 99 victims. For 96 of the 99 homicide victims in 2008-09, one or more accused persons have been identified (as at January 2010). A total of 132 accused persons had been identified for the homicide cases recorded in 2008-09.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is taking proactive action to address violent crime and homicide. The government&rsquo;s alcohol bill is bringing forward proposals for minimum prices for alcohol &ndash; an approach supported by experts as an effective way of reducing alcohol misuse, a contributory factor in much violent crime.</p>

  <p>We are continuing to provide record investment in the police-led national Violence Reduction Unit. Their work to tackle homicide includes the development of the Phoenix homicide database in conjunction with Strathclyde Police. This database enables the police to collect and analyse information from homicides in the force area, including detailed information about victims, offenders and locations. Feedback received at debriefing meetings, held once cases are closed, is also being inputted to enable officers to learn from the experience of previous cases and promote best practice.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers meet with councils, including East Ayrshire and South Ayrshire, on a regular basis to discuss a wide range of important issues. There have however been no specific discussions between ministers and elected members in East Ayrshire and South Ayrshire Councils on the future of Crossroads Primary School.</p>

  <p>Under current legislation &ndash; the Education (Publication and Consultation Etc.) (Scotland) Regulations 1981 &ndash; and the Schools (Consultation) (Scotland) Act 2010, which was passed unanimously by the Scottish Parliament on 19 November 2009 and will come into force on 5 April, local authority decisions to close schools may, under certain circumstances, either be referred to, or called-in by, ministers for their consent. It would therefore be inappropriate for ministers to prejudge any decision they may have to take at a later stage by discussing the future of any school currently being statutorily consulted upon by a local authority.</p>

</table></p>

  <p>The figures relate to the period from the date claims are received by the NHS board or the Central Legal Office to the date of final payment of the award. This may be a single payment or the last of a series over years of interim payments.</p>

  <p>If a case goes to a formal proof hearing, this can be many years after the proceedings commenced. Delays can occur with sists or the temporary stopping of the court processes for a variety of reasons. In the case of baby birth injuries, it is usual practice to raise proceedings soon after birth but then to sist them until the child is 10/12 to establish the true extent of the consequences of the injury as they grow up.</p>

  <p>The figures for those clinical negligence claims closed without settlement in the five financial years ending on 31 March 2009 are as follows.</p>

  <p>These figures relate to the period from the date claims are received by the NHS board or Central Legal Office to the date of file closure. Reasons for closure include repudiation (claims that have been rejected by the NHS board), abandoned claims or cases where there is no longer any activity from the pursuer or their solicitor in progression of their claim.</p>

  <p>Health Protection Scotland does not routinely request or collect typing data on norovirus. Regardless of strain, there is no difference in either the treatment of a patient with norovirus or in the management of any outbreak. The care of any patient with norovirus is based on an individual clinical assessment of their needs.</p>

  <p>The independent review of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 was published on 7 August 2009 as part of the consultation on the review of the act. Copies were placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre and also sent to the chairs of relevant cross party groups and to parliamentary committees. Following the consultation period (7 August to 6 November) 82 written responses were received.</p>

  <p>An analysis of the consultation responses has now been completed. The report of the analysis along with the research findings will be published on the Scottish Government website in the week commencing 8 March 2010.</p>

  <p>Responses to the recommendations included in the consultation will inform policy development in this area. Amendments to the act will require primary legislation which will be taken forward as part of a further legislative programme. However, there will also be some changes through practice guidance or amendments to secondary legislation.</p>

  <p>The target for 2009-10 is a developmental one that has provided a focus for NHS boards and the Waiting Times Delivery Board in their work to implement the new referral to treatment waiting time target. It has focussed attention on workforce, services, data collection, quality of care, referral protocols and information systems. A three month pilot started with NHS boards in January 2010 to ensure that appropriate data-gathering systems are in place to allow their performance around the waiting time target to be monitored.</p>

  <p>The waiting time target, to be in place from April 2010, means that by March 2013 no one will wait longer than 26 weeks from referral to treatment for specialist child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS). It is supported by our additional investment of &pound;5.5 million more each year in CAMHS by 2011-12 that will enable us to significantly increase the CAMHS capacity in Scotland.</p>

  <p>TAGRA has been overseeing an assessment of the impact of the NRAC formula on remote and rural areas as agreed in the Parliamentary debate on Remote and Rural Healthcare in June 2008. I expect them to report their findings to me in the near future.</p>

  <p>In terms of future budget allocations for NHS boards, when I accepted the recommendations of NHSScotland Resource Allocation Committee (NRAC) I made it clear that no board would receive a cut in funding as a result of these changes. Any adjustments made to the 14 territorial NHS boards&rsquo; funding will be phased in over a number of years, as was the practice under both the previous SHARE and Arbuthnott formulae.</p>

  <p>Given the current tight financial climate there is unlikely to be significant movement in NHS boards&rsquo; relative shares of NHS funding in the immediate future.</p>

  <p>Police authorities are funded by Police Grant from the Scottish Government, with the balance of their budgets being met by constituent local authorities. Police funding is at a record level and police grant will increase by 3.1% in 2010-11.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Government is directly meeting the recruitment, training and salary costs of 1,000 officers over the lifetime of this Parliament. In 2009-10, the Scottish Government has provided funding for 189 new officers as well as continuing to meet the salary costs of 612 additional officers recruited in 2007-08 and 2008-09. From 1 April to 31 December 2009, 704 police officers have left the service and 929 have been recruited. The timing of recruitment of additional officers and officers replacing those who have left the service is a matter for police authorities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government have implemented a set of policies and applications to reduce power consumption and costs of its IT systems. Power policies on PCs, laptops and printers ensure that these devices are switched to low power states when not in use. PCs and laptops are monitored and shutdown automatically when not required after 19:00 in the evening. The automatic shutdown of printers after working hours is also being evaluated.</p>

  <p>Since the introduction of these policies in April 2008, it is estimated that these measures have saved the Scottish Government 533<strong> </strong>tonnes of carbon and &pound;100,000 in energy costs in the running of IT Services.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government would be supportive of the Scottish Surfing Federation developing a Scottish surfing team to take part in International events. However, they have not yet gone through the formal process for recognition as the sports governing body in Scotland as agreed by the Home Country Sports Councils. sportscotland, the national agency responsible for the development of sport and physical recreation in Scotland, have offered their support to the Scottish Surfing Federation to help them through the recognition process.</p>

  <p>If successful, as the recognised governing body for surfing in Scotland, this would put the Scottish Surfing Federation in a much stronger position when presenting their plan to enter a Scottish team in future international surfing events.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has taken a number of actions to support supply teachers unable to secure permanent positions and has worked with partners, including local authority employers, to ensure that they also play their part.</p>

  <p>It is crucial that those in supply posts are supported in their responsibility to engage in continuing professional development (CPD). Local authorities, as their employers, clearly have a vital role in doing that. The Scottish Government therefore asked the National CPD Team (funded by the government and based at COSLA) to refresh guidance for local authorities on CPD for supply teachers. I brought that guidance to the attention of local authority Directors of Education through a letter issued on 5 February 2010.</p>

  <p>To support those primary responsibilities of professionals and their employers, the Scottish Government also tasked the National CPD Team with developing an online resource for teachers who are not currently regularly employed and who have difficulty accessing CPD. That online resource &ndash; &quot;CPD Step In&quot; &ndash; is now available through GLOW, providing a discussion area with chat, forum and web meeting tools, the facility to share resources and links, advice on professional review and development, and examples of free, online CPD on GLOW and beyond.</p>

  <p>Further information on the guidance on CPD for supply teachers and on CPD Step In is available on the CPD Scotland website <a href="http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/cpdscotland/index.asp" target="_blank">http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/cpdscotland/index.asp</a>.</p>
