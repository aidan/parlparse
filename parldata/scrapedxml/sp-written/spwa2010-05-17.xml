  <p>At the meeting of the Cross Party Group on Epilepsy on 29 April 2010, I said that I would investigate the position in Scotland in relation to ESN numbers and whether there were any cutbacks either in the actual number, or in the hours they are asked to work in this specialist capacity. All NHS boards have now confirmed that their epilepsy specialist nurses focus solely on supporting people living with epilepsy and are not expected to carry out other duties.</p>

  <p>There are currently no epilepsy specialist nurse vacancies. As the answer to question S3W-33457 on 17 May 2010 indicates, however, there are no epilepsy specialist nurses in NHS Borders, Dumfries and Galloway or Western Isles. NHS Orkney and Shetland have links to the epilepsy specialist nurse in NHS Grampian.</p>

  <p>We are also aware of the Joint Epilepsy Council target of one epilepsy specialist nurse per 100,000 population.</p>

  <p>The equivalent figures for local authorities are not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The increase from 2007 onwards reflects the downturn in the private housing market which meant that more opportunities for &quot;Off the Shelf&quot; purchases at competitive prices were offered to Registered Social Landlords. Due to the &pound;120 million accelerated AHIP programme, as part of the Economic Recovery Plan, these opportunities were able to be maximised.</p>

  <p>The equivalent figures for local authorities are not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The increase from 2007 onwards reflects the downturn in the private housing market which meant that more opportunities for &quot;Off the Shelf&quot; purchases at competitive prices were offered to Registered Social Landlords. Due to the &pound;120 million accelerated AHIP programme, as part of the Economic Recovery Plan, these opportunities were able to be maximised.</p>

  <p>The Pentland Firth and Orkney Waters marine spatial plan was started to provide momentum in advance of the implementation of the new statutory marine planning system. The main focus has been assembling information which will be necessary for planning this sensitive area, regardless of the final agreed boundaries for planning. The marine spatial plan may be incorporated into future statutory marine plans but this will depend on decisions in Scottish marine regions and other statutory marine planning processes.</p>
