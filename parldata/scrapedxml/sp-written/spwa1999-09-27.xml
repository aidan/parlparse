  <p>The topics proposed by the UK Government for the 2001 Census of Population were announced in the White Paper (Cm 4253) published on 4 March 1999. The White Paper contained a proposal to include, for the first time in a Census in the UK, a question on the provision of care. The precise wording of the question is still undergoing research.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is reviewing the proposals of the UK Government for the Census and later in the year will make proposals about the content of the Census in Scotland, in an Order for approval by the Parliament.</p>

Final Budget proposals will be presented to the Parliament in January alongside the Budget Bill.

  <p>I have set the following targets for Fisheries Research Services for the financial year 1999-2000:</p>

  <p>Delivery of Service.</p>

  <p>To achieve 90% of the performance targets set in the Schedules to the Service Level Agreement.</p>

  <p>To achieve 80% of the milestones agreed for Research and Development projects.</p>

  <p>To maintain, <i>pro rata</i>, FRS&#8217; publication output per member of staff.</p>

  <p>To produce 12 information pamphlets for the industry in the course of the year.</p>

  <p>Quality of Service</p>

  <p>To submit the scientific work of the Fisheries Management Programme at the Marine Laboratory to a peer review by a visiting group and for the group to report by May 2000.</p>

  <p>To submit by March 2000 the quality manuals and documentation which are required for the accreditation by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service, of the monitoring programmes for algal toxins, microbiological contamination of shellfish, List II viral diseases of fish, and sampling of fish for residues of veterinary medicines.</p>

  <p>Efficiency targets</p>

  <p>To carry out the agreed programme for the Scottish Executive within the agreed budget.</p>

  <p>To recover full economic costs from external customers.</p>

  <p>To restrict administrative costs to a maximum of 18% of the total running costs.</p>

  <p>To restrict the Support Services Staff to 30% of the total staff numbers.</p>

  <p>To increase research vessel utilisation to 540 days per year, operating at a daily cost of &pound;5,300 (<i>Scotia</i>) and &pound;2,500 (<i>Clupea</i>).</p>

  <p>These various tasks should provide a sound basis for evaluating performance by establishing a time series for certain indicators and by requiring external scrutiny by external accreditors and scientific peers.</p>

  <p>Promoting public health is one of the Scottish Executive&#8217;s priorities for the NHS in Scotland and I expect to see this reflected in every aspect of Health Boards&#8217; activities. Data on health promotion activities is only collected centrally for Health Promotion Teams and Divisions within Health Boards. I am aware that this may not cover all health promotion expenditure by Health Boards, for example time spent by the district nurse on health promotion issues will not be included. For this reason comparisons between Health Boards can be misleading.</p>

  <p>There is no clear definition of malnutrition. Malnutrition can mean both under nourishment as well as over nourishment. The programmes for monitoring the nutritional status of children throughout the UK has shown that most children are adequately nourished, but that there is a persistent rise in the numbers overweight and obese. For adults, Scottish Health Survey data indicate that, whilst only 6.9% of Scots in the 16-64 age group were classed as underweight, 51.4% were classed as either overweight or obese. Eating a healthy and balanced diet and keeping physically active together help people to maintain appropriate body weight. The Scottish Executive is pursuing a range of initiatives to encourage and support the population to make the necessary changes to their diet and physical activity levels.</p>

  <p>Generally, planning permissions lapse if development is not begun within 5 years. Once development is underway it is open to the relevant planning authority to serve a completion notice on the developer if they are of the opinion that the development will not be completed within a reasonable period.

  <p>Consideration is being given to the possibility of using fine income to fund additional speed cameras. In addition, local authorities in Scotland can seek approval from the Scottish Ministers to introduce decriminalised parking schemes. These enable a local authority to administer its own parking penalty scheme and to retain the revenue from the penalties to finance its parking enforcement procedures.
