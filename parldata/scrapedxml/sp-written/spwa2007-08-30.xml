  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the Minister for Europe, External Affairs and Culture intends to invite Lex Brown of Anta Estates for a meeting to seek an application for the development of Castle Tioram.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2007-08-30.S3W-2880.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80307" speakername="Linda Fabiani" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-07/wa0830.htm#2">

  <p>Castle Tioram is an ancient monument of national importance scheduled under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. Any development would require scheduled monument consent, obtained on behalf of Scottish ministers through Historic Scotland.</p>

  <p>In August 2006, Historic Scotland wrote to Lex Brown of Anta Estates to provide him with guidance to assist with any future scheduled monument consent application for Castle Tioram. It would be for the owner to approach Historic Scotland for further advice or to submit a fresh application. On 27 July, Mr Brown was interviewed on STV&rsquo;s north regional news programme stating his intention to submit proposals for the castle. Following the interview Historic Scotland wrote to Anta Estates on 30 July to advise that they looked forward to receiving the revised application. As is normal practice, once Historic Scotland receive the application it will be judged on its individual merits.</p>

  <p>It would be inappropriate for Scottish ministers to procure an application for scheduled monument consent as this would prejudice their role in the consent process.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what steps it will take to ensure that all local authorities fully implement the provisions of the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 and the Scottish Schools (Parental Involvement) Act 2006 and that parents are made aware of appropriate placements and services across their own and adjacent local authority areas in order that they can make an informed choice about their children&rsquo;s education.</p>

  <p>We have provided education authorities with guidance on their duties arising from both the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 and the Scottish Schools (Parental Involvement) Act 2006.</p>

  <p>The implementation of the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 is already being evaluated. Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) are monitoring and evaluating the consistency, effectiveness and efficiency of education authorities in implementing the new legislation. An interim report of their findings can be found on the HMIE website at: <a href="http://www.hmie.gov.uk/publication.asp" target="_blank">http://www.hmie.gov.uk/publication.asp</a>, with a final report of their findings due to be published in November 2007. HMIE are also monitoring how the Parental Involvement Act is being implemented as part of their regular programme of inspections of schools and education authorities.</p>

  <p>In respect of placements, all education authorities are required to make information available to parents about their schools and the type of education provision they can offer. Where an education authority is unable to offer appropriate provision through its own services, it should provide parents with information on alternative forms of provision that are available in other education authorities, grant-aided or independent schools.</p>
