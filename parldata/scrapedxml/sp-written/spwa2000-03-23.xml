  <p>Under the Code of Practice on Access to Scottish Executive Information, information will be disclosed unless the harm likely to arise from disclosure would outweigh the public interest in making the information available. In this case, the public interest in disclosure is outweighed by the harm which would be caused to the frankness and candour of internal discussion, including discussions between the Scottish Executive and the UK Government.</p>

  <p>In the light of this detailed survey, work the route of the interconnector has been selected by NIE to avoid munitions detected and the use of a remotely operated vehicle water-jetting system specified in the cable laying contract with its high-resolution detection equipment will make it possible to avoid any extraneous objects on the seabed.

  <p>Local authorities will not be required to register land on a contaminated land register by a specific date. Following implementation of the new contaminated land regime, which, subject to Parliament, we hope to bring into force in Scotland early in June this year, it will be up to each local authority, as the enforcing authority, to identify contaminated land within its area and to record in a public register all regulatory action taken in respect of its remediation. In the case of contaminated land identified as a special site, the enforcing authority will be the Scottish Environment Protection Agency.</p>

  <p>Local authorities will have 15 months from the date of the commencement of the enabling regulations to produce strategies for inspecting their areas to identify contaminated land.</p>

  <p>Gas safety is a reserved matter. I understand that HSE, which has responsibility for these matters, undertakes a seasonal gas safety advertising campaign each year. This campaign emphasises the need for regular maintenance and servicing of appliances by CORGI registered installers. As part of this campaign, HSE runs a freephone Gas Safety Advice Line, based in Glasgow and publicised on winter gas bills issued by gas suppliers.</p>

  <p>Employment policy is reserved to the UK Government, which therefore takes the lead on the funding and delivery of the New Deal throughout Great Britain, although in close consultation with its partners, including the Scottish Executive. Many partner organisations at local level also provide New Deal services under contract or provide funds and other resources, including training funds to enhance the quality of New Deal in their areas. The public and voluntary sector organisations, which contribute to the New Deal in this way, fall within the remit of the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>Over 21,000 young people have found jobs through the New Deal for Young People up to the end of December 1999. Youth unemployment in Scotland has fallen by 5,000 since February 1998, a fall of 55%.</p>

  <p>Professor Kennedy's Group (known as the Advisory Group on Quarantine) was set up to look at whether the existing system of quarantine for entry into the UK should be modernised. The group reported in September 1998 recommending radical changes. This report was issued for public consultation. Responses received were strongly in favour of the Kennedy proposals. A main recommendation was that sufficient time should be allowed for a smooth and orderly transition to the new arrangements, the timescale initially being one of three years.</p>

  <p>Since submission of the Kennedy report, representatives from the administrations of the British Isles authorities have met regularly to agree and work-up the new arrangements. This has included approaches to other countries about providing the necessary health certification, discussions with laboratories in Europe where blood samples will be tested after vaccination against rabies, discussions with microchip manufacturers and with the transport operators i.e. airlines and shipping agents.</p>

  <p>With ministerial colleagues' agreement, Mr Nick Brown, MP announced on 26 March 1999 that a pilot scheme to trial the proposed arrangements for entry into the UK was to be introduced within the next 12 months. This has been successfully achieved, with the launch of the limited scheme on the 28 February 2000. We shall continue to work with the administrations of the British Isles authorities towards full scale implementation by April 2001 as originally planned.</p>

  <p>No equivalent of the process by which the Scottish Executive may inspire the tabling of a written parliamentary question (referred to in questions S1W-4815 and 5379) exists in relation to oral parliamentary questions. The random selection process for oral questions and the limits on when oral questions could be answered mean that such a process would not be suited to bringing matters to the attention of the Parliament.</p>

  <p>Members from all political parties have followed up discussions/contacts with Ministers by tabling questions for oral answer or by asking supplementary questions. Such instances cannot be identified from records held by the Executive.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-4815 by Mr Tom McCabe on 14 March 2000, how it identified those written parliamentary questions lodged by back-bench MSPs which it inspired.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-03-23.34.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80200" speakername="Mr Tom McCabe" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa0323.htm#5378">

  <p>The use of inspired parliamentary questions was considered by the Procedures Committee at its meeting on 15 February, and was acknowledged as a useful method for bringing matters to the attention of the Parliament. Without them some of the wide range of activities of the Executive, which cannot all be the subject of statements or debates in the Parliament, would simply not be noted in the Parliament at all. I am sure that the majority of members would prefer a mechanism such as this to alert them to Executive activity rather than learning of them third-hand through the media. Indeed members of non-Executive parties <i>, </i> and in particular Mr Lochhead&#8217;s party <i>, </i> have said so on a number of occasions.</p>

  <p>Compared with the total number of parliamentary questions, the number inspired by the Executive is very small &#8211; only one in 50. Several members have asked more questions than the entire number of inspired questions. The cost of answering inspired questions is also much less than that of answering ordinary questions as, by their very nature, the information presented in the answer is already available and does not require further work.</p>

  <p>As I indicated in my response to S1W-4815, questions inspired by the Executive are not separately identified in our records. The list provided in that response was compiled by calculating the interval between the lodging of each question and the lodging of the answer (the relevant questions being answered normally within a few days), followed by examination of the text of the questions and answers thus identified. This was found to give a reliable indication of questions which had been inspired by the Executive.</p>

  <p>The continuing trend of population decline in Dundee is a cause for concern for the Scottish Executive. The Scottish Executive, through the Enterprise Network, is committed to tackling the causes of population decline. The local enterprise company fully recognises the problem of depopulation in Dundee and they are engaging with their partners in the public and private sectors to address the causes of decline. They expect a gradual reversal of this trend and a stabilisation of the population over the forthcoming years. The Scottish Executive also recognises the importance of building strong and sustainable communities and has recently confirmed its continuing support for the four Social Inclusion Partnerships operating in Dundee. The Scottish Executive is providing funding of &pound;3.6 million to the four SIPs in the current financial year and is aware that these SIPS have been making good progress in tackling the problems of social exclusion.</p>

  <p>The Executive has no such evidence. We are not aware of any instances of a Scottish local authority or school distributing literature promoting homosexuality to children: nor do we know of any local authority or school which has any intention to distribute such literature. The existing safeguards have a good track record in protecting children from potentially inappropriate behaviour and the additional measures we are taking will further strengthen them.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive recognises that hackney cabs and private hire vehicles (PHVs) have a role to play in public transport provision. While not operating to specific timetables, they can provide a convenient alternative means of transport to the public. They can also have a role in improving accessibility for those who do not have access to a car, and in reducing the need of some to own a car and thus reducing car usage.</p>

  <p>In developing Local Transport Strategies, local authorities have been asked to address the scope for the promotion of taxis and PHVs in overall local transport provision in their areas.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive was closely involved in developing the guidelines <i>Modernising Trust Ports: A Guide to Good Governance</i> . The guidance was drawn up following wide consultation with the trust sector and its representative bodies. The guidelines apply to the Scottish trust ports sector and the Executive endorses the underlying principles of open, accountable and transparent operation of trust ports. The guide sets national standards of accountability as a benchmark to provide good practice for the future. The guide also makes clear that the Executive has the option to amend these standards for application to the trust ports sector in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive recognises the important role and contribution of the harbours at Peterhead and Fraserburgh for the local economy, and in particular for the fishing industry. <i>Modernising Trust Ports: A Guide to Good Governance</i> , published in January 2000 sets out standards of accountability for the trust ports sector. It encourages ports to overhaul the appointment process based on the best commercial and government practice. The extent to which any change to board structure is required will depend on whether a port&#8217;s existing board structure fully reflects all of the interests of the local communities and stakeholders which the port serves. An implementation guide is planned to be published this spring to assist ports in undertaking this process.</p>
