  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-36729 by Richard Lochhead on 28 October 2010, whether it considers that variations exist in approaches taken by different EU member states concerning agricultural support scheme land eligibility regulations and penalty systems.</p>

  <p>My officials have visited a number of member states to examine their systems for delivering agricultural support and have hosted several reciprocal visits to look at our systems. Although each member state is unique in terms of their support schemes, computer systems and farming structures, nevertheless, these exchanges have been particularly helpful in informing best practice in the implementation of these measures. As I explained in answer to question S3W-36729, however, European legislation governs all member states and, amongst other things, defines what constitutes eligible land, and sets out in detail how penalties are to be applied. I expect any variation in these areas, in other words non-compliance with the regulations, would lead to the member state concerned being fined by the Commission&rsquo;s auditors.</p>

  <p>Support is available through the Scotland Rural Development Programme (SRDP) for farmers wishing to set up a care farming operation. The Scottish Government has announced that an expert group will be set up through the Future CAP (Common Agricultural Policy) Stakeholder Group to take forward work on the inquiry&rsquo;s recommendation of a Top-Up Fund (TUF). The current CAP Regulation does not allow for a TUF. We would therefore need to negotiate to ensure Scotland can develop a TUF when the future CAP post-2013 legislation is being discussed in Europe.</p>

  <p>It is too early to say what specific measures will be available in the next programming period for the Scotland Rural Development Programme for the period 2014-20. The European Commission has only just embarked on the process to determine the content of the next Rural Development programmes with the publication of its Communication on the Common Agricultural Policy towards 2020 on 18 November 2010. The Commission is expected to make legislative proposals by summer 2011 after which negotiations over the final content will begin. Once the appropriate regulations from the Europe are known to the Scottish Government &ndash; most likely later in 2012 - it will be possible to determine what support may be offered.</p>

  <p>Diabetes, both type 1 and type 2, affects slightly more men than women, but both are equally susceptible to the complications associated with diabetes.</p>

  <p>Our Diabetes Action Plan draws attention, however, to the fact that the relative risk of cardiovascular disease is particularly high in women with type 1 diabetes diagnosed under the age of 40, and we would expect those caring for these women to bear that in mind.</p>

  <p>The action plan also draws attention to the recommendations in Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) Guideline 116 dealing with the management of pregnancy in women with diabetes, including the need to recognise women with gestational diabetes, the prevalence of which is increasing.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Diabetes Group, on behalf of the Scottish Government, will monitor NHS boards&rsquo; progress with the actions in the plan over the next three years.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) Guideline 62 on prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) has been replaced by SIGN Guideline 122 on the prevention and treatment of VTE, which was launched on 10 December. One of the new guideline&rsquo;s key recommendations is that all patients admitted to hospital should be individually assessed for risk of VTE and bleeding, and that the risks and benefits of prophylaxis must be discussed with the patient. SIGN has produced an implementation plan to accompany the guideline, to ensure that its recommendations are widely publicised and implemented throughout NHSScotland.</p>

  <p>SIGN Guideline 36 on antithrombotic therapy is also being revised, and a new Guideline on the topic is expected next year.</p>

  <p>Achieving reliable VTE prophylaxis in surgical patients is already part of the Scottish Patient Safety Programme&rsquo;s peri-operative workstream. The Programme has recently agreed to extend its work to include the assessment of all patients, medical as well as surgical, for VTE prophylaxis.</p>

  <p>The treatment of thyroid conditions is covered by the curriculum for specialty training for general practice and is included in the assessment process. Both the curriculum and the assessment process are set by the Royal College of General Practitioners, and approved by the General Medical Council.</p>

  <p>The GP training curriculum enables GP trainees to gain specialist experience in a number of areas as well as their general experience in a practice setting. The curriculum equips them to recognise and understand thyroid related conditions.</p>

  <p>GPs are generalists and would seek the help and advice of specialists if the management of the patient&rsquo;s condition required specialist expertise.</p>

  <p>The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) database records when an accused is marked for Court Proceedings i.e. when the Procurator Fiscal makes the decision that Court Proceedings are the appropriate course of action for an accused. We have, therefore, used the date of this marking for proceedings as the date of commencement of proceedings as this date is recorded for all methods of commencing proceedings.</p>

  <p>Table 1 shows the average time between a report being received by the Procurator Fiscal and the date when a decision was taken to take Summary Court Proceedings against an accused, broken down by police force area.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The information for this question has been extracted from the COPFS&rsquo; Case Management Database. The database is a live, operational database used to manage the processing of reports submitted to procurators fiscal by the police and other reporting agencies. The table reflects the information recorded on 9 December 2010.</p>

  <p>2. Cases reported to procurators fiscal may contain more than one accused, and these accused may have decisions taken on the same date or on different dates. Only the earliest date has been used in the calculations.</p>

  <p>3. The table includes only the original commencement of summary court proceedings (it excludes any where proceedings were re-raised). It also excludes accused persons if the initial decision was to proceed by way of petition, even if subsequent proceedings were taken in a summary court. The table excludes accused persons where a prosecution in a summary court followed a failure to accept a road traffic fixed penalty or a rejection of a direct measure such as a fiscal fine etc.</p>

  <p>4. Commencement of a criminal case has a number of legal definitions depending on the nature and method of proceedings. Solemn proceedings may be commenced by way of a Petition for Warrant in terms of Section 34 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 (the act) or the service of an Indictment in terms of section 64 of that act. Although in general most solemn proceedings are commenced by way of petition, it is entirely competent for an indictment to be served where there has been no previous petition procedure. Solemn proceedings have been excluded from the answer, as the application for a petition does not necessarily result in proceedings in the sheriff court.</p>

  <p>5. Summary proceedings in the sheriff, stipendiary magistrates and justice of the peace courts (formerly district courts pre Court Unification) may be commenced by the service of a complaint on an accused person in terms of s.138 of the act or when a warrant to apprehend or cite the accused is granted by the court under section 135.</p>

  <p>6. In summary proceedings the COPFS case management database records when a warrant is sought by the prosecutor from the court, not when it is granted by the court. In relation to non-warrant cases, the database records when a complaint is sent for service on the accused in cited cases (that is when the accused is cited to appear at a future court hearing); however it does not record when a complaint is sent for service in cases where the accused appears from custody or by way of an undertaking from the police.</p>

  <p>There is no legal maximum length of time between a report being received by the Procurator Fiscal and the commencement of a criminal case in a summary court. However, the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995, Section 136 stipulates that for some statutory offences, summary proceedings must be commenced within six months of the contravention of the statute (i.e. the date of the offence).</p>

  <p>Table 1 shows the maximum number of days, broken down by police force area.</p>

  <p>A total of 378,466 cases were included in these calculations, and 86 per cent were dealt with in 28 days from the date of receipt (the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) key target being 75% within 28 days in relation to prosecution decisions). Many of the cases that took the longest time to mark for proceedings required detailed further investigation prior to the commencement of proceedings; they included allegations of fraud, sexual offences and contraventions of health and safety legislation.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The information for this question has been extracted from the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service&rsquo;s Case Management Database. The database is a live, operational database used to manage the processing of reports submitted to procurators fiscal by the police and other reporting agencies. The table reflects the information recorded on 9 December 2010.</p>

  <p>2. Cases reported to procurators fiscal may contain more than one accused, and these accused may have decisions taken on the same date or on different dates. Only the earliest date has been used in the calculations.</p>

  <p>3. The table includes only the original commencement of summary court proceedings (it excludes any where proceedings were re-raised). It also excludes accused persons if the initial decision was to proceed by way of petition, even if subsequent proceedings were taken in a summary court.</p>

  <p>4. The table excludes accused persons where a prosecution in a summary court followed a failure to accept a road traffic fixed penalty or a rejection of a direct measure such as a fiscal fine etc.</p>

  <p>The cost per course of drug treatment for osteosarcoma is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The number of courses of treatment varies from patient to patient, depending on their response to initial treatment and the general health of the individual patient. This is a clinical decision made at a multidisciplinary team meeting and should involve a full discussion with the patient and their family or carer.</p>

  <p>Currently, patients with resectable osteosarcoma who are under the age of 40 are recruited to the &quot;Euramos&quot; clinical trial. This is an international study by four leading multi-institutional osteosarcoma groups based in the USA, Germany-Austria, Europe and Scandinavia. Patients follow the standard treatment regimens according to which arm of the study they are randomised to and, therefore, costs are variable.</p>

  <p>There are longstanding commissioning arrangements to ensure patients are able to benefit from specialised services for the treatment of rare and ultra-rare conditions. Access to this national resource is managed by the National Services Division (NSD) of NHS National Services Scotland, which commission relevant treatment within NHSScotland or from highly specialised services across the UK or further afield in Europe, as and when it is required.</p>

  <p>The European Council published a recommendation on rare diseases in 2009 which proposes a national plan for rare diseases. The Scottish Government fully supports this recommendation and is working with officials from across the UK to explore the extent to which the UK meets the requirements of the recommendation and to agree areas of possible collaboration and progress in the future.</p>

  <p>In relation to the evaluation of medicines, Scotland has robust, equitable and transparent arrangements for the introduction of newly licensed clinically and cost-effective medicines to treat all conditions, including rare diseases. In appraising orphan medicines to treat rare diseases, the Scottish Medicines Consortium may, in addition to the standard assessment of clinical and cost-effectiveness, apply modifiers which consider other additional factors. Subject to meeting certain criteria, this can facilitate acceptance of a medicine notwithstanding the economic evidence provided. Full details of the Scottish Medicines Consortium policies can be found on the SMC website: <a href="http://www.scottishmedicines.org.uk/smc/3863.21.24.html" target="_blank">http://www.scottishmedicines.org.uk/smc/3863.21.24.html</a>.</p>

These groups require the governor to confirm that they have assessed the risk of community access for all prisoners being considered for transfer in a multi-disciplinary setting. Multi-disciplinary contributions include social work, psychology, prison intelligence, healthcare, prison management and police intelligence reviews. All prisoners transfer to HMP Open Estate, there is no differentiation between sites.</p>

  <p>I have asked John Ewing, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service, to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>In 2011-12, the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) will transfer responsibility for the health and care of prisoners in custody in Scotland to the National Health Service in Scotland. This transfer will take place in November 2011 and the SPS budget has been reduced by &pound;10 million in 2011-12 to reflect this change of responsibility. The SPS current expenditure budget for 2011-12 has also been reduced by a further &pound;5.1 million to reflect the efficiency savings that SPS is expected to achieve in line with the Scottish Government&rsquo;s efficiency targets for all public sector organisations.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Prison Service capital budget for 2010-2011 reflects the expected high level of spending on prison projects in the current year. The capital budget for 2011-12 is based on the planned capital project expenditure for that period which is expected to be lower.

  <p>The arrangements for remunerating the chair of the National Performance Management Committee were approved by the then Health Minister, Andy Kerr, in 2006.

  <p>The terms of the appointment provide for up to 24 days per annum to be paid, which, at the current daily rate, would equate to an annual remuneration of &pound;9,648. However, in practice, the actual number of days remunerated has been below 24 in each year of the appointment.</p>

  <p>I have asked John Ewing, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service, to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Long-term adult offenders, including sex offenders, are subject to strict release conditions. Under current arrangements, prisoners are allocated to their area of residence within seven days of admission to prison. This definition of residency is based on the prisoner&rsquo;s address at arrest and their court of disposal. Once set, the respective local authority manages the offender&rsquo;s case through imprisonment onto release. Any requests to change residency will be dealt with between the relevant local authorities.</p>

  <p>The current practice of returning prisoners, including sex offenders, to a prison in their home area prior to release will continue. Therefore, we would anticipate that only offenders defined, as resident in Clackmannanshire would be released back into Clackmannanshire.</p>

  <p>Specifically the following training has been provided:</p>

  <p>Three psychologists trained to deliver sex offender programmes covering the following (current STOP, CORE and Rolling).</p>

  <p>Two social workers are trained to deliver the community sex offender group work programme.</p>

  <p>Six (five social workers + one team manager) social work staff are trained in child protection (CP) levels one &amp; two.</p>

  <p>Six (five social workers + one team manager) social work staff are trained in vulnerable adult support and protection.</p>

  <p>Two social work staff are trained in joint police &amp; social work interviews (specific to sex offender work).</p>

  <p>Two managers attended multi agency public protection arrangement (MAPPA) training delivered by fife police.</p>

  <p>Eight staff have received a basic awareness to MAPPA training</p>

  <p>HMP Glenochil&rsquo;s focus for programme delivery, until 31 March 2011, was agreed in early 2010 before the decision was made to transfer sex offenders. SPS is currently undertaking the evaluation of the Good Lives Sex Offender Programme which is being tested at HMP Peterhead. Once this is completed, it is expected that HMP Glenochil will feature in the SPS&rsquo;s strategy for the delivery of offending behaviour programmes specifically targeted at sex offenders.</p>

  <p>As at the 6 December 2010, there were no sex offenders at HMP Glenochil who are serving sentences of less than one year and four months.</p>

  <p>All sex offenders sentenced to six months or longer are subject to statutory post-release supervision. They therefore meet the criteria for the Enhanced Integrated Case Management process, which includes formal risk assessment and structured risk management planning. As a result, they would all be considered for interventions to address their offending, though it can be challenging to arrange this in custody when the sentence is very short.</p>

  <p>However, arrangements are in place to ensure, as far as reasonably possible, that prisoners who present a risk to children, and who are not permitted visits with minors, are segregated at visits from those prisoners who may receive visits from children. This practice is consistent with other sites that hold sex offenders.</p>

  <p>I have asked John Ewing, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service, to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>There is no separate specialist unit at HMYOI Polmont for the assessment and management of sex offenders. All young people convicted of a sex offence are managed under an enhanced integrated case management arrangement. An allocated social worker will manage their case throughout the duration of their sentence in partnership with prison staff and community based social workers. This can include access to appropriate programmes. When necessary, HMYOI Polmont locate young people convicted of a sex offence in a separate area of the establishment, alongside other young people requiring to be separated for their own protection.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how much of the &pound;24.4 million in the Zero Waste budget in 2010-11, as noted in Table 11.06 of Scotland&rsquo;s Spending Plans and Draft Budget 2011-12, will be allocated to local authority projects to assist them in achieving municipal waste targets in 2011.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-12-13.S3W-38027.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80340" speakername="Richard Lochhead" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa1213.htm#17">

  <p>The &pound;24.4 million budget for Zero Waste includes support for a number of programmes, including work to develop markets for recyclate use; waste prevention and minimisation; re-use and recycling awareness; support for community recycling groups; and support for local authorities. Full details of the Zero Waste Scotland Operating Plan for 2010-11 can be found at: <a href="http://www.zerowastescotland.org.uk/document.rm?id=9643" target="_blank">http://www.zerowastescotland.org.uk/document.rm?id=9643</a> .</p>

  <p>It is not possible to disaggregate the &pound;24.4 million budget down to the level of beneficiaries, as the support programme delivered by Zero Waste Scotland takes a whole system approach and focuses on all waste, irrespective of where it arises or who manages it. Nevertheless, local authorities do benefit from the Zero Waste Programme outcomes.</p>

  <p>In addition, over &pound;30 million of the Zero Waste Fund was allocated to local authorities to assist with delivery of new and improved waste infrastructure. The Scottish Government letter dated 4 December 2009 addressed to COSLA and council chief executives, advised local authorities of the amount of Zero Waste Fund monies to be paid to them. In accordance with the concordat, this funding is not ring fenced, however the letter highlighted partnership working with COSLA and recognised the need to make good progress on recycling/composting diversion targets and to commit resources accordingly. This is in addition to the &pound;65 million from the former ring fenced Strategic Waste Fund that was incorporated into the block grant provided to local authorities by the Scottish Government in 2010-11.</p>

  <p>To summarise, &pound;95.7 million was paid to local authorities during 2010-11, they also benefit from the Zero Waste Scotland Programme, as detailed above.</p>
