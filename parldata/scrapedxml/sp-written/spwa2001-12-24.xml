  <p>Since 1990, Access Funds, now known as Hardship Funds, have been allocated to institutions on the basis of the number of students enrolled on further education, higher education and postgraduate courses. The further education allocation is now administered by the Scottish Further Education Funding Council. The funds for higher education students are provided by SAAS. Institutions are no longer allowed to transfer money between their sectoral allocations, to ensure that the Executive&#146;s relative priority for support of students in higher and further education is reflected in the actual distribution to students.</p>

  <p>In addition, from this year, the Mature Students Bursary Fund (MSBF) has been introduced for full-time higher education students. MSBF is separate from Hardship Funds and is targeted, in particular, at students with childcare costs.</p>

  <p>We have received representations from some institutions seeking greater flexibility in the use of the funds. We are currently considering whether some flexibility should be introduced between MSBF and Hardship Funds for higher educarion students during the period MSBF is being phased in.</p>

  <p>I have also, in my letter of policy guidance, asked the Scottish Further Education Funding Council this week to consider how the further education student support system might be simplified, to ease administrative burdens, and improved so funds are better targeted to achieve our principal policy objectives of focusing on students in greatest need and aligning as far as appropriate and possible the student support arrangements in further education and higher education.</p>

  <p>We have no current plans to provide further support to part-time higher education students. Support for higher education students is principally focused on full-time students since they generally have less opportunity than part-time students to support themselves while studying. Part-time higher education students studying at least 50% of a full-time course can apply for a &#163;500 loan each year towards study related costs, including travel. Unlike full-time students, they may also be able to retain their entitlement to income related benefits while studying.</p>

  <p>The relative heights of crops at farmscale evaluation sites is not a matter of safety or regulatory concern and is not measured by the Scottish Executive or our GM Inspectorate. The scientists who are overseeing these trials will consider whether any differences are significant as part of their final analysis.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1O-4268 by Ross Finnie on 6 December 2001, whether the genetically modified oil-seed rape being trialed at Roskil farm on the Black Isle is based on a different variety to the non-GM crop it is being compared with in the trial and, if so, why, and whether any other trials are being conducted using this method.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2001-12-24.11.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80155" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-01/wa1224.htm#5">

  <p>The farmscale evaluation programme does not compare the GM crop with a non-GM variety. It is designed to compare the effect on biodiversity of the agricultural practices required to grow herbicide-tolerant GM crops with conventional agricultural practices. The conventional variety used on each trial site is selected by the farmer to represent what would traditionally be grown in a particular area but the variety itself is not pertinent to the methodology of the trial. Different growers participating in the evaluations around the UK will select appropriate varieties for their area and any varietal differences are nullified by the number of sites involved.</p>

  <p>The conventional oilseed rape which has been planted at Munlochy is a variety with the trade name Royal. Like the GM variety, it is a fully restored hybrid.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1O-4268 by Ross Finnie on 6 December 2001, whether it will make representations to the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment and the Agriculture and Environment Biotechnology Commission seeking a scientific opinion as to whether the differences in height between the genetically modified oil-seed rape and the normal oil-seed rape in the trial at Roskil farm on the Black Isle could adversely affect the comparison of biodiversity between the two.</p>

  <p>No. The reported difference in height between crops at Munlochy does not raise any safety or regulatory issues of concern to the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment. The conduct of the farmscale evaluations is determined by an independent Scientific Steering Committee who will determine in the context of the whole UK trial programme whether such differences are significant in their final analysis.</p>

  <p>NHS Boards have conducted local maternity service reviews, which take account of the various geographical and demographic features of their particular area. The Scottish Executive is currently auditing NHS Board strategies against the principles laid out in <i>A Framework for Maternity Services in Scotland. </i> A working group will meet in early 2002 to consider the appropriate configuration of models of acute and intra-partum maternity care for Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive set up the Remote and Rural Areas Resource Initiative to explore issues affecting the full range of health services in rural Scotland. A recently formed sub-group has been created to look specifically at maternity services in remote and rural settings.</p>

  <p>The introduction of the resource accounting and budgeting system has not changed the way NHS Boards account for capital. NHS Boards are given an annual general allocation to meet the health care needs of their resident populations. It is for boards to determine how to manage and deliver local health care services to meet these needs within the funds available. In the current year all NHS Boards received increases in their unified budgets of at least 5.5%, more than twice the rate of inflation.</p>

  <p>NHS Boards are given an annual allocation to meet the health care needs of their resident populations. NHS Boards received an average increase in unified budget of 6.5% in the current year. Increases to individual boards ranged from a minimum of 5.5% to a maximum of 9.8%. It is for boards to determine, within the funds available, how to manage and deliver local health care services including meeting any expected growth in demand.</p>

  <p>NHSScotland employers are expected to employ staff on a permanent basis. Where the use of bank and agency nurses is necessary, employers are to apply the criteria in the Accounts Commission for Scotland Report <i>Temporary Measures</i> which was published in February 2000. The criteria are:</p>

  <p>flexible rota management;</p>

  <p>asking part-time staff to work extra hours;</p>

  <p>sharing staff across wards or departments;</p>

  <p>appointing a bank nurse;</p>

  <p>offering overtime to existing staff;</p>

  <p>appointing an agency nurse.</p>

  <p>It is also recognised that action must be taken to provide nurses and midwives with career appointments in Scotland. With this in mind, <i>Facing the Future,</i> the Report of the Convention on Recruitment and Retention in Nursing and Midwifery, has recognised a need for; an increase in employment opportunities in Scotland; greater commitment to meeting continuing professional development needs; and innovative schemes to provide flexibility, choice and options in working practices. The network of Workforce Centres announced at the conference will help develop the current and future shape of the nursing workforce on the basis of sound principles and research. To boost the pool of nurses the Scottish Executive is funding a recruitment campaign to reach the care workforce at regional and national level. In addition, guidance on family friendly policies was issued to NHSScotland in January to help employers in their efforts to encourage new recruits and to retain staff who wish the opportunity to balance work with family commitments.</p>

  <p>There will inevitably be a significant reduction in management posts when the three existing water authorities are merged into a single management structure. The exact number of these posts and how they will be filled are operational matters for the prospective Board of Scottish Water, and its approach will be developed over time.</p>

  <p>We are currently focussing attention on the major celebrations in prospect next year to mark Her Majesty's Golden Jubilee. Plans for celebration of the anniversary in 2003, if appropriate, would be considered in due course in liaison with Buckingham Palace and relevant Whitehall departments and interests.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether residual bottom ash from incineration or energy from waste plants can be classified as recycled material and, if so, what the criteria are for making such a classification.</p>

  <p>Residual bottom ash from incineration or energy from waste plants can be processed and used as an aggregate substitute. Bottom ash is a controlled waste and therefore any storage, transportation and treatment of the ash must be carried out in accordance with Waste Management Licence requirements.</p>

  <p>As a by-product of the incineration process this material would usually be referred to as a &quot;secondary aggregate&quot; rather than a &quot;recycled aggregate&quot;. &quot;Recycled aggregates&quot; would usually refer to aggregates that have been used previously in construction.</p>

  <p>This is an operational matter for the Scottish water authorities. I understand from them that their records show that no charities in any water authority area have had their water supply withdrawn for non-payment of water bills in 1998-99, 1999-2000, 2000-01, or to date in 2001-02.</p>
