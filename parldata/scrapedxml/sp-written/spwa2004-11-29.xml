  <p>Policy and operational matters in relation to Dungavel are a matter for the Home Office. This includes matters relating to the provision of education services, other facilities for children, social work services and health.</p>

  <p>When any child, including an asylum seeker child, is taken into care he or she becomes the responsibility of that local authority&rsquo;s social work department. Local authorities should act as good parents would in relation to the health care of children who are looked after by them and placed away from their own homes. Care plans should fully reflect health care needs and should include health promotion, general surveillance and assessment of developmental progress, as well as treatment for illness and accidents, in order to promote the physical, social and emotional health and development of the children.</p>

While all Scottish conference destinations benefit from its marketing work, the unit works closely with the main city convention bureaux, helping them attract major conferences and providing financial support to assist with the presentation of bids for such events.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what powers ministers have had since 1995 to intervene in the advertisement, recruitment, selection and appointment of a GP by an NHS board or trust; how often such powers have been exercised; on what basis such powers were exercised, and within which NHS board areas.</p>

  <p>The NHS (Scotland) Act 1978 provides that ministers may give directions to NHS Boards on the exercise of their functions. No general directions have been made since 1995 in respect of advertisement, recruitment, selection and appointment in respect of GPs.</p>

  <p>The NHS (General Medical Services) (Scotland) Regulations 1995 and the NHS (Primary Medical Services Performers Lists) (Scotland) Regulations 2004 enable ministers to give particular directions to an NHS board when they remit a case for reconsideration following an appeal by a doctor.</p>

  <p>Since 1995 a direction has been given in one case. Following an appeal by a doctor who was not selected for a medical vacancy a direction was given for the re-advertising of the vacancy, and for consultation with local interests, to Lanarkshire health board.</p>

  <p>The procedures for the admission of GPs to the medical list of an NHS board between 1995 and 2004 were contained in the NHS (General Medical Services) (Scotland) Regulations 1995. Since 1 April 2004 the NHS (General Medical Services Performers Lists) (Scotland) Regulations 2004 apply.</p>

  <p>The only breach of procedure which has come to the attention of ministers in that time was revealed in an appeal by a doctor who was not selected for a vacancy in 2004. An application in the name of a practice rather than an individual medical practitioner was accepted by Lanarkshire Health Board.</p>

  <p>Between 1995 and 2004 ministers had no role in any aspect of the appointment of GPs in individual cases unless an appeal was submitted by an unsuccessful applicant. If an appeal revealed a defect in any aspect of a case the NHS (General Medical Services) (Scotland) Regulations 1995 enabled ministers to give an NHS board any directions they considered desirable to ensure the proper determination of an application. Generally similar provisions are contained in the NHS (Primary Medical Services Performers Lists) (Scotland) Regulations 2004.</p>

  <p>There are no specific guidelines relating to the organisation of meetings with Health Department officials and the public, but there are a number of materials which have been issued to support consultation and engagement with the public.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has produced Good Practice Guidance on Consultations which stresses the importance of engaging with the public and provides support and guidance in doing so. The Scottish Executive Equalities Unit has complemented this with <em>Good Practice Guidance &ndash; Consultation with Equalities Groups</em>.</p>

  <p>Changing to Deliver was launched in January 2003 and is the Scottish Executive's corporate culture change programme. Key amongst its aims is to promote the outward focus of the Executive and its ability to inform, engage and consult meaningfully with the public in the development of policy and services. Guidance and support is available from the Changing to Deliver Team.</p>

  <p>Within the Patient Focus and Public Involvement programme of work, a toolkit to support the involvement of people <em>Building Strong Foundations</em> (Bib. number 34489) has been issued to the NHS and the Health Department. This includes practical examples of methods of involving people, including meetings. In addition, the Partners in Change initiative produced a <em>Checklist of Meetings</em> (Bib. number 34490) which are intended as a practical resource for people who set up or are involved in meetings with the public. Guidance will shortly be issued to the NHS and the Health Department on &quot;Informing, Engaging and Consulting the Public in the Development of Health and Community Care Policies and Services&quot;.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the procedure for filling the vacancy for a single GP practice at the Rowallan Medical Centre in Blantyre was governed by the National Health Service (General Medical Services) (Scotland) Regulations 1995 and whether these regulations applied to the rerun of that appointment.</p>

  <p>The provisions in the NHS (General Medical Services) (Scotland) Regulations 1995 which dealt with vacancies for GPs contained various stages. Where more than one application was received, an NHS board was required to select a candidate and report to the Scottish Medical Practices Committee which would approve the addition of the candidate&rsquo;s name to the NHS board&rsquo;s medical list. By the time the selection process was rerun for the Blantyre vacancy that committee had been abolished, the 1995 regulations were revoked and the new GMS contact was in place. It was not therefore possible to complete the process under the 1995 Regulations. To deal with such a situation the General Medical Services (Transitional and Other Ancillary Provisions) (Scotland) Order 2004 came into effect on 1 April 2004. It provides that the provisions in the 1995 regulations up to and including the selection stage remain in force to deal with outstanding cases. It makes clear that once an NHS board has selected a candidate that doctor is offered a contract to provide general medical services under the new arrangements.</p>

  <p>Under the NHS (General Medical Services) (Scotland) Regulations 1995 it was a matter for each GP on the medical list to decide whether to practise on their own or in a group practice. Any change to the arrangement had to be notified to the NHS board and patients.</p>

  <p>The NHS (General Medical Services Contracts) (Scotland) Regulations 2004 provide that any variation to the contract held by a doctor or doctors must be notified to the NHS board and agreed in writing before it can take effect.</p>

  <p>The NHS Reform (Scotland) Act 2004 places a duty on NHS boards to ensure public involvement and equal opportunities. This applies to the development and provision of services generally, but would not extend to final decisions on the appointment of GPs or NHS staff. While boards should take steps to consult patients on proposals to appoint GPs and listen to views, it is for the board to make the final decision on employment matters.

  <p>We have no plans to introduce new legislation to give local authorities further powers in this area. Planning authorities already have the powers necessary to deal with land or buildings the condition of which is adversely affecting the amenity of their district.</p>

  <p>Section 179 of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 gives planning authorities the power to serve on any owner, lessee or occupier of any such land or buildings a notice requiring the person responsible for the land to take whatever steps are necessary to abate the adverse effect. Where the recipient of such a notice fails to comply with its requirements, the planning authority have powers under section 179 to take steps to rectify the situation to their satisfaction and recover from the person who is the owner or lessee any expenses reasonably incurred by them in doing so.</p>

  <p>Part 3 of the Local Government in Scotland Act 2003 also created a new discretionary power which enables local authorities to do anything they consider is likely to promote or improve the well-being of their area and/or persons in it.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-11708 by Cathy Jamieson on 9 November 2004, whether it considers that the position whereby the Public Defence Solicitors&rsquo; Office (PDSO) in Edinburgh has an allocated percentage of the custody court duty plan in Edinburgh constitutes an automatic right of the PDSO to represent an accused person and, if so, whether it will amend this right.</p>

  <p>No. Solicitors acting as duty solicitor, whether from the PDSO or a private firm, will act for any person held in custody who requests their services. This does not restrict the freedom of any individual to choose a solicitor to act for him or her.</p>

  <p>The PDSO&rsquo;s share of the summary duty plan in Edinburgh was set initially at 60% but has been reduced by the Scottish Legal Aid Board in subsequent years and for 2004 was at 40%. In solemn matters the PDSO has the same pro rata share as any comparably sized private firm.</p>

  <p>Today the Scottish Executive published <em>Building a Better Scotland: Efficient Government &ndash; Securing Efficiency Effectiveness and Productivity</em> . This plan describes how the Executive will increase the efficiency, effectiveness and productivity of the Scottish public sector, save at least &pound;745 million a year by 2007-08, and achieve aggregate cumulative cash-releasing savings over the next three years of &pound;1,732 million, and work towards its initial target of &pound;1 billion a year by 2009-10. The plan also contains proposals for further &quot;time-releasing&quot; efficiency savings, including five initial areas of reform which aim to produce the equivalent of &pound;300 million annual savings by 2007-08.</p>

  <p>The issues to be addressed in considering a new junction on the M8 motorway near Bishopton are complex. In reaching its decision on whether to allow new accesses on a motorway, the Scottish Executive needs to consider the impact that providing extra accesses will have on congestion and traffic flows on a motorway network which is clearly of significant importance to the Scottish economy. The impact on the M8 needs to be balanced against the benefits of a new access for the Bishopton development.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Advice to Community Planning Partnerships (CPPs) was first issued last year when we published guidance on integrating Social Inclusion Partnerships (SIPs) and CPPs. The guidance set out the requirement for CPPs to maintain the large part of SIP expenditure in 2004-05 on existing SIP areas and themes. The information is given on page 10 of <em>Integrating Social Inclusion Partnerships and Community Planning Partnerships</em> published by Scottish Executive in August 2003, a copy of which is available in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 34488).</p>

  <p>More recent advice has been provided following the announcement of the Community Regeneration Fund (CRF), which commences in April next year. CPPs are required to submit Regeneration Outcome Agreements (ROAs), which will include the need to set out how CPPs are managing the transition towards targeted outcomes. CPPs will therefore require to consider how existing SIP projects and services fit with the specific regeneration outcomes the CPP aims to achieve. The information is given on page 16 of <em>Community Regeneration Fund guidance on Regeneration Outcome Agreements</em> published by the Scottish Executive in August 2004, a copy of which is available in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 34043)</p>

  <p>Where CPPs decide continuation of funding of former SIP projects is no longer appropriate, CPPs have been advised to consider whether they should sustain such projects using mainstream resources, funding from other programmes or whether time-bound exit strategies should be used.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Advice to Community Planning Partnerships (CPPs), which includes local authorities as partners, was first issued last year when we published guidance on integrating Social Inclusion Partnerships (SIPS) and CPPs. The guidance set out the requirement for CPPs to maintain the large part of SIP expenditure in 2004-05 on existing SIP areas and themes. The information is given on page 10 of <em>Integrating Social Inclusion Partnerships and Community Planning Partnerships</em> published by Scottish Executive in August 2003, a copy of which is available in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 34488).</p>

  <p>More recent advice has been provided following the announcement of the Community Regeneration Fund (CRF), which commences in April next year. CPPs are required to submit Regeneration Outcome Agreements (ROAs), which will include the need to set out how CPPs are managing the transition towards targeted outcomes. CPPs will therefore require to consider how existing SIP projects and services fit with the specific regeneration outcomes the CPP aims to achieve. Where CPPs decide continuation of funding of former SIP projects is no longer appropriate, CPPs have been advised to consider whether they should sustain such projects using mainstream resources, funding from other programmes or whether time-bound exit strategies should be used. The information is given on page 16 of <em>Community Regeneration Fund guidance on Regeneration Outcome Agreements</em> published by the Scottish Executive in August 2004, a copy of which is available in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 34043)</p>

  <p>The guidance is also available on the Communities Scotland website: <a href="http://www.communitiesscotland.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.communitiesscotland.gov.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>Employers in recruiting and selecting staff for care homes for children and young people take into account the type of post applied for, safe recruitment practices including Disclosure Scotland requirements and checks with previous employers, and Scottish Social Services Council (SSSC) registration requirements.</p>

  <p>Registration with the SSSC requires staff to have or achieve certain qualifications within a set timescale &ndash; usually three years from initial registration. The qualification requirements set by the SSSC vary according to the role to be carried out by staff and according to the type of setting or service in which they are employed.</p>

  <p>Registration of residential child care managers commences in April 2005. For staff in residential child care settings with supervisory responsibilities, registration commences in October 2005 and July 2006 for all other staff working in residential child care settings. Whilst specific entry qualifications for staff working in residential child care are determined by employers, the qualification requirements set by the SSSC to work in such settings must be taken into account.</p>

  <p>Pay of workers in these sectors is a matter for employers and there are no plans for the Scottish Executive to become involved.</p>
