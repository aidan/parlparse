  <p>Significant progress has been made in delivering our policy on architecture. The Executive provides &#163;300,000 annually to The Lighthouse to deliver a national programme of activities to raise awareness of the benefits of good architecture. Other initiatives include a &#163;600,000 sustainable design programme which is currently under way and, last year, &#163;144,000 was invested in an educational initiative for school children. A new body, Architecture and Design Scotland, will be established in early 2005 to replace and build upon the work of the Royal Fine Art Commission for Scotland.</p>

  <p>No projections have been issued for individual authorities. The new funding for respite under the home care initiative is designed to achieve the equivalent of 22,000 extra weeks nationally. But that is not the only funding available to local authorities for the provision of respite care. Individual authorities will assess projected needs locally as part of their service planning and development. Authorities have been required to set out in a Local Outcome Agreement the outcomes to be delivered for their share of the home care initiative resources. We are currently reviewing draft agreements and information from these will not be available until next year.</p>

  <p>On 1 June local authorities were given a new duty to provide direct payments to eligible people who want them. Executive guidance to local authorities states that all eligible people should be made aware that direct payments are an option and should be given access to local support.</p>

  <p>The Executive has also set up Direct Payments Scotland to work closely with local authorities and local support organisations to help them set up direct payment schemes in their areas, including help with the establishment of local support services. This work involves increasing local awareness of direct payments and providing support and information, as well as identifying and addressing local training needs.</p>

  <p>The Community Safety Partnership Award Programme, introduced on 1 April 2002, makes &#163;4 million per annum available to local authority-led Community Safety Partnerships to assist them in identifying and addressing local community safety priorities which can include capital and revenue costs of CCTV. Renfrewshire Community Safety Partnership were awarded &#163;147,521 in 2002-03 and &#163;145,433 in 2003-04. It is anticipated that a similar Community Safety Partnership Award will be achieved in 2004-05.</p>

  <p>As part of partnership agreement funding, an additional &#163;1 million will be allocated in 2005-06 specifically for CCTV. Details on how this will be distributed have still to be finalised.</p>

  <p>Other Executive funding streams such as &quot;Quality of Life&quot; funding can also be used to fund local CCTV systems.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive publication <em>School&#8217;s Out &#8211; A Framework for the Development of Out of School Care</em> set out a number of recommendations for local authorities and other bodies to develop out of school care (OSC) provision. Recommendation 1 calls on local authorities to undertake a review of OSC provision within their areas and identify priorities to address any gaps in provision. The Executive has issued guidance to local authorities on meeting this recommendation, and they are expected to report their findings in spring 2004.</p>

  <p>The Standards in Scotland&#8217;s Schools etc. Act 2000, which came into force in April 2002, placed a new duty on authorities to secure a pre-school education place for all eligible children. The duty placed on local authorities allows them to secure pre-school education from voluntary or private partner providers within the sector. Local authorities are responsible for the commissioning of these places.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&#8217;s Childcare Strategy aims to provide affordable, accessible, good quality child care for children in all neighbourhoods. In order to implement the strategy at a local level, the Executive provides Childcare Strategy funding to local authorities. Local authorities, in conjunction with the local child care partnership are responsible for the allocation of funding to meet local child care needs, including &quot;wraparound&quot; provision within their areas.</p>

  <p>The Executive has also commissioned a nationwide research project to look at parental demand for child care. This project will explore the issues that affect vulnerable groups such as lone parents, ethnic minorities, student parents, young parents and parents of disabled children or children with additional special needs. The report on the findings of this research is also expected in spring 2004.</p>

  <p>The support for the Eco-Schools programme has been as part of the overall framework of improvement on the National Priorities in Education, introduced by the Standards in Scotland&#8217;s Schools etc. Act 2000. The Executive remains committed to the importance of sustainable development, and will take account of that in the planned review of the national priorities in education for 2005 and beyond. As part of the review, we will consider the future role of various developments which aim to improve outcomes for school pupils, including the Eco-Schools programme.</p>

  <p>Guidance to local authorities and schools sets out opportunities for teaching sustainable development at every level of the school curriculum.</p>

  <p>Under the arrangements to report against the National Priorities for Education, local authorities will submit information on &quot;the number/percentage of primary and secondary schools within their area that are participating in the Eco Schools programme or a similar accredited environmental award&quot;.</p>

  <p>The Sustainable Secondary Schools Partnership (SSP) managed by Learning and Teaching Scotland and involving various environmental organisations are involved in a four-year initiative on education for sustainable development in secondary schools.</p>

  <p>We have also recently established the Education for Sustainable Development Liaison Group (ESDLG) to consider wider issues of education for sustainable development in schools and to make recommendations for a strategy for the future.</p>

  <p>Scottish Development International does not keep records of how many jobs are created by individual inward investors in a given year. The published figures reflect the number of jobs which a company plans to create or safeguard at the time its decision to invest in Scotland was made. The published figures refer only to projects in which Scottish Development International and its partners can claim to have had a significant involvement in ensuring that the project takes place in Scotland. The following figures relate to projects where a company has made a decision to invest or expand and where the main activity of the project is manufacturing.

The European Court of Justice&#8217;s decision in the Altmark case deals with the interaction between the treaty and the relevant state aid regulations for bus services.

  <p>The outcome of the Review of Governance and Accountability in the Further Education Sector was announced in March 2003. The consultation process upon which the review was primarily based found general support for existing arrangements, but with scope for modernisation in specific areas. Ministers announced a programme of 14 measures aimed at enhancing standards of governance and accountability in the further education sector.</p>

  <p>Most of the measures can be implemented without the need for legislation (mainly through formal guidance by ministers and from the Association of Scottish Colleges).</p>

  <p>We will be consulting shortly on the proposals to amend, by order, the Further and Higher Education (Scotland) Act 1992 in order to reduce the maximum length of board membership, and to relax the current statutory restriction on the appointment of a local authority employee or elected representative to the Chair of a college board.</p>

  <p>We will consult separately on the other measures requiring primary legislation &#8211; to extend the remit of the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman to further education and higher education complaints, and to give the Scottish Further Education Funding Council the right to attend meetings of college boards.</p>

  <p>When announcing the outcome of the review, ministers indicated that they intend to assess the effectiveness of the new arrangements after two years.</p>

  <p>No decision will be taken on the possible commercialisation of GM beet and oilseed rape until the results of the farm scale trials and GM dialogue have been fully evaluated. The results from the trials have been forwarded to the statutory Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE) for their advice on implications for the case-by-case assessment of these particular crops. The Executive expects to receive ACRE&#8217;s advice by the end of the year.</p>

  <p>The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) is introducing new IT programmes as part of its modernisation of casework processing systems: the &quot;Future Office System&quot; (FOS). The COPFS will shortly commence the roll-out of the first phase of FOS, which will enhance current casework processing systems and deal with summary business. The new system will run alongside the existing casework processing systems in use throughout the department and, in time, will be fully integrated with them, resulting in a full electronic casework processing system for all criminal cases.</p>

  <p>At September 2002 the cost of the development of the computer software for solemn work was estimated at &#163;1 million. This figure has been adjusted in light of changes to overall requirements within COPFS and to meet the system changes arising from Lord Bonomy&#8217;s recommendations.</p>

  <p>1. Figures for Scotland are the total number of days for all pollutants monitored at each site.</p>

  <p>2. The Edinburgh site only became operational in October 1992 and hence there is no annual figure for that year in the first, Scotland, table.</p>

  <p>3,4. Total days are higher for Edinburgh than for Scotland in 1994 and 1995. Where more than one individual pollutant is moderate or higher on a given day it is counted as a single day for the Scotland total.</p>

  <p>Three of the seven key performance indicators already focus on whole or part of rehabilitation in line with the challenge set for SPS to protect the public by reducing re-offending.

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally in the exact form requested. However the number of care home residents supported wholly or mainly by local authorities as at March 2002, plus those supported by the Department for Work and Pensions under the preserved right rate of Income Support, provides the best estimate of those who would have retained at least the personal expenses allowance at that time.

  <p>Data about injury road accidents are collected by the police and reported to the Scottish Executive using the STATS 19 statistical report form. These returns cover only accidents in which one or more people were injured: they do not cover &quot;damage only&quot; accidents.</p>

  <p>Information on the involvement of fire service road rescue units in road accidents is held locally by fire brigades and relates to both injury and damage only accidents.</p>

  <p>The following table gives the number of road traffic injury accidents in Renfrewshire in the years 1998 to 2002 inclusive and the number of road traffic accidents that required the assistance of a fire service road rescue unit on roads in Renfrewshire in the years 1999 to 2002 inclusive. It has not been possible to provide the figure for 1998 within the timeframe for this question.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that the statistics given in the table for injury road accidents are based upon the data which are held in the central statistical database and which were collected by the police at the time of the accident and subsequently reported to the Executive. They may differ from any figures which the local authority would provide now, because they do not take account of any subsequent changes or corrections that the local authority may have made to the statistical information, for use at a local level, about the location of each accident, based upon its knowledge of the road and area concerned.</p>

  <p>Ministerial consent for the closure of such denominational schools is required only in certain circumstances.</p>

  <p>Schedule 2 to the Education (Publication and Consultation Etc)(Scotland) Regulations 1981, which applies to non-denominational and denominational schools alike, covers circumstances where the school concerned is more than 80% full, or where the alternative school is five or more miles distant in the case of a primary school and 10 or more miles distant in the case of a secondary school from the school proposed for closure.</p>

  <p>Sections 22C and 22D of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 cover circumstances where pupils would no longer be able to attend a school of the denomination concerned; or where, following representations from the church or denominational body concerned, ministers consider that the proposal would result in a significant deterioration in the provision, distribution or availability of school education in denominational schools compared with other public schools.</p>

  <p>The Care Commission does not regulate schools. It is responsible for the regulation of certain care services including day care of children services and some school care accommodation services. Both public and independent sector services are regulated taking account of the relevant National Care Standards, which are prepared and published by Scottish ministers.</p>

  <p>Day care of children services such as nurseries and playgroups can be provided in school premises. The appropriate National Care Standards for all these services are &quot;early education and childcare up to the age of 16&quot;.</p>

  <p>The Care Commission currently regulates the residential care aspect of independent residential special schools, grant-aided residential special schools, education authority residential special schools (registered prior to April 2002) and independent schools with boarding provision voluntarily registered prior to April 2002 under section 34 of the children (Scotland) Act 1995. The National Care Standards for &quot;school care accommodation services&quot; are applied to these services.</p>

  <p>Under the pilot programme, some 430 schools across all local authority areas have adopted the integrated (formerly new) community school approach. We understand that, since the start of the roll out programme in April 2002, the number of schools involved has risen to more than 1000. Adoption of the integrated community school approach does not necessarily impact on pupil or teacher numbers in the schools involved.</p>

  <p>There is no optimum size of school for adoption of the integrated (formerly new) community school approach. All schools are expected to become integrated community schools by 2007. Experience over the pilot programme and the first year of the roll out programme indicates that the integrated community school approach can be adopted successfully in individual schools or in cluster of schools.</p>

  <p>The Executive recognises that science centres are valuable assets in helping to create a more enterprising, pro-science country. The direct benefits of science centres are, however, very difficult to measure objectively. A study conducted in November 2002 by HM Inspectors of Education concluded that, overall, the service provided by the centres was greatly valued by schools, especially primary schools; but it also concluded that there was variation in the quality of the service and that there was for scope for improvement in many areas. Other possible impacts of science centres have not been assessed systematically.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to increasing overall numbers of Allied Health Professionals (AHPs), including speech and language therapists, by 1,500. Working groups established as part of the AHP strategy <em>Future Directions</em> are already looking at initiatives to improve recruitment and retention and clinical placements. A range of professional development and leadership opportunities is being developed to retain the existing workforce. In addition, &#163;1 million has been made available for additional student places in priority areas including speech and language therapy, funding is available to support a &quot;return to practice&quot; initiative and alternative routes to state registration are currently being explored.</p>

  <p>Source: General Register Office (Scotland). Compiled by the National Confidential Inquiry Into Suicide and Homicide By People With Mental Illness, (University of Manchester).</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>&quot;Inquiry suicides&quot; are those of patients who died within 12 months of contact with mental health services. &quot;Community Suicides&quot; are those of patients who were not in-patients at time of death. The figures for general Scottish suicides include those for &quot;sequelae&quot; or &quot;late effect&quot; and include those under 15 years of age. The remaining figures do not include those for &quot;sequelae&quot; or &quot;late effect&quot; or those under 15 years of age.</p>

  <p>It is for this reason that the Scottish Executive identified people with mental health problems, in particular those in contact with mental health services as a priority group for action, as part of the Choose Life national strategy to prevent suicide in Scotland, which I launched in December 2002.</p>

  <p>There is no single known reason to explain why suicide rates in Scotland are higher than those in England and Wales. However, under the work of the National Programme for Improving Mental Health and Well-Being, plans are in hand to co-ordinate the available evidence relating to suicide in Scotland and elsewhere. New research will then be commissioned to cover gaps in information and will focus on factors influencing prevalence.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has agreed to fund the implementation of the agreement <em>A Teaching Profession for the 21st Century</em> in full. However, it is for local authorities to determine how they spend their allocated funding and how they administer early retirement and winding down schemes.</p>

  <p>Both teacher and employer representatives will be fully involved in any discussion on how any future changes to the retirement age for public sector workers will affect the operation of winding down and early retirement schemes. A principal aim of any new pension scheme will be to introduce a greater degree of flexibility, particularly in the transition from work to retirement, and making the &lsquo;&#8217;winding down&#8217;&#8217; provisions more widely available, giving teachers increased scope to vary their working patterns when nearing retirement.</p>

  <p>Track access grant is limited to funding rail track access charges, although eligible flows can include rail journeys to and from ports. The Executive&#8217;s budget is currently &#163;1 million per annum.</p>

  <p>The proposed water freight grant scheme for revenue support for new shipping routes is currently being discussed with the European Commission with a view to implementing the scheme in 2004-05. Funding of the scheme will initially be provided from the FFG budget.</p>

  <p>Any company within the European Union and European Economic Area is eligible to apply for these grants, provided the proposal removes lorry journeys from Scotland&#8217;s roads.</p>

  <p>The Weeds Act 1959 places responsibility for control of certain weeds, including ragwort, on the occupier of the land. The Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department investigates all written complaints received about the presence of injurious weeds, including ragwort, on land, and where necessary will advise the occupier to carry out control measures to prevent the weeds from spreading. The act also empowers ministers to serve notice requiring the occupier to take action to prevent weeds from spreading.
