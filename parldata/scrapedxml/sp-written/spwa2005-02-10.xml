  <p>Ambulance services make a vital contribution to high quality, responsive health care in Scotland. Through the Scottish Ambulance Service, the Scottish Executive is investing in more ambulance service staff, modern vehicles, better equipment and state of the art control and dispatch systems to help further improve the effectiveness of the service.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive also sets performance indicators for the Scottish Ambulance Service, including emergency response times. The Executive monitors performance against these targets, as of course does the ambulance service itself. It is the responsibility of the ambulance service to ensure that its resources are deployed to optimise its performance and to meet demand.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has not allocated any additional resources to local authorities specifically for asylum seeker costs or support. However, over &pound;7 million has been provided since 2001 for projects promoting integration of refugees and asylum seekers.</p>

  <p>The Home Office is responsible for providing support to asylum seekers. However, from 1999 to 2003 the Scottish Executive paid grants to local authorities, on behalf of the Home Office, to cover support costs of asylum seekers who arrived prior to the establishment of the National Asylum Support Service. The full costs of these grants were reimbursed to the Scottish Executive by the Home Office. The breakdown of the payments is provided in the answer to question S2W-13857 on 9 February 2005.

  <p>St&oacute;rlann, the Gaelic Resources Centre, carries out an annual evaluation of the education materials required by teachers for Gaelic-medium education. The Scottish Executive seeks to ensure that there is adequate provision of good quality materials for Gaelic-medium classes. It would, however, be difficult to establish parity with the wide range of English language materials that are available for schools immediately. The Scottish Executive is not aware of any research that seeks to establish a correlation between the availability of Gaelic-materials in Gaelic-medium classes and the appeal of Gaelic-medium education to Gaelic speaking teachers. We will continue to support St&oacute;rlann to keep improving Gaelic-medium resources.</p>

  <p>It is the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s aim that good quality materials should be available to pupils in Gaelic-medium classes and for all subjects. St&oacute;rlann has made very good progress in providing materials for Gaelic-medium education classes. There is now little need for Gaelic-medium classes to be using English books with pasted over translations. St&oacute;rlann has provided Gaelic books for all stages and most subjects of Gaelic-medium primary education.</p>

  <p>Over the next three years we are making &pound;1.2 billion available to support affordable housing projects across Scotland.

  <p>In addition, Communities Scotland has an agreement with the Forestry Commission about releasing land for affordable housing, and we are looking to extend this approach to other public bodies.

  <p>Currently there are no rehabilitation programmes being developed in partnership with the voluntary sector. However, SPS runs an employability approved activity that was formerly developed by Apex Scotland and SPS.</p>

  <p>Additionally, SPS works closely with over 100 voluntary and statutory agencies in the provision of reintegration services such as employment, housing and addiction support services that assist offenders on return to the community.</p>

Appropriate measures will be put in place to ensure that noise disruption is kept to a minimum during construction.

  <p>The concept of social capital continues to be the subject of active debate. Leading social scientists such as Putman define it in general terms as relating to &quot;connections among individuals &ndash; social networks and the norms of reciprocity and trust that arise from them&quot;. Expressed in this way, claims have been made that social capital is influential in explaining a wide range of factors in society including educational performance, performance in the labour market, and civic participation, all of which relate to social inclusion.</p>

  <p>Yet the mechanisms by which social capital may operate to produce these effects is far from clear. Progress is being made in research to put the concept onto a more rigorous footing, for example to identify categories of social capital and to understand the significance of formal and informal networks and local and wider processes of social attachment, for different social groups in the community. Until this is clearer it is not possible to properly assess the role of the state in promoting social capital as a mechanism for increasing social inclusion.</p>

  <p>Researchers in the Scottish Executive are actively engaged with those developing the knowledge base in this important area.</p>
