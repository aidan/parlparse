  <p>A great deal of research on black grouse has been carried out by conservation organisations, informing the recommendations for protection of black grouse in the Species Action Plan.</p>

  <p>Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), in partnership with other conservation bodies, undertakes national and site-based surveys of a wide range of protected species. I understand from SNH that there will be a national survey of black grouse, to enable further consideration of changes in status and management practices. SNH expect that the survey will be conducted in 2005-06. The last national survey was in 1995-96, when it was estimated that there were 6,510 lekking male black grouse in the UK.</p>

  <p>The Black Grouse Species Action Plan Group was formed to implement the actions given in the Biodiversity Action Plan for this species.</p>

  <p>A wide range of measures are being applied to protect black grouse.</p>

  <p>These include the appointment of project officers, concerned with woodland grouse in the Highlands and in Argyll and work on developing alternatives to deer fencing to reduce the likelihood of birds flying into fences.</p>

  <p>Through the Scottish Forestry Grants Scheme, stewardship grants are made available in support of Biodiversity Action Plans to improve woodland biodiversity, meeting 60% of the standard costs (90% for special areas), of eligible forest operations such as fence removal.</p>

  <p>The award of almost &#163;2.5 million from the EU LIFE-Nature fund in July 2002 supports a five-year project, which although focusing on capercaillie, will benefit all woodland grouse.</p>

  <p>Until 2001, both the capercaillie and black grouse species were partially protected by a close season and by controls on hunting methods. However, in 2001, in response to the decline in the capercaillie population to fewer than 1,000 birds in Scotland, capercaillie, were given additional protection by listing the species in Schedule 1 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.</p>

  <p>Whilst acknowledging that there are problems with access to NHS dental services in some parts of Scotland, the Executive has in place a number of measures aimed at improving access. These include:</p>

  <p>the availability of grants under the Scottish Dental Access Initiative for dentists willing to set up or expand NHS practices in areas of poor access or high oral health need;</p>

  <p>the approval of salaried dentists, where an NHS Board or Primary Care NHS Trust considers that the existing provision is insufficient to meet the demands of the local population, and no independent general dental practitioner is available to fill the gap;</p>

  <p>a &#163;1 million "golden hello" package, which includes payments to vocational trainees taking up vocational training in designated areas and payments to dentists who enter substantive general dental service practice within three months of completion of training, and</p>

  <p>a &#163;3 million package of recruitment and retention measures, which includes the introduction of commitment payments for assistants and the raising of the earnings ceiling for seniority payments, both of which reward dentists for undertaking more NHS treatment.</p>

  <p>Discussions will continue with the dental profession on further recruitment and retention measures.</p>

Additionally, we will shortly be bringing forward measures under the Executive&#8217;s &#163;24 million Broadband Initiative to stimulate demand for broadband services generally and to subsidise the purchase by businesses of appropriate technologies. In certain circumstances, most notably remote and rural areas, these subsidies may be used to support the purchase of community-based solutions, such as wireless.</p>

  <p>Scotland is an open economy, and our economic performance is inextricably linked to global economic conditions, therefore setting a target for growth over a limited period of time cannot take account of circumstances beyond our control and will not aid the delivery of longer term growth and prosperity.

  <p>The Scottish Executive is well aware that the Scottish Economy did not grow in 2002. There are no quick fixes and we are committed to creating the conditions to maximise sustainable economic growth in the medium and long term. <em>A Smart, Successful Scotland, </em> our strategy for the Enterprise Networks, is crucial in delivering this and it is no coincidence that its focus on growing businesses, skills and learning and global connections is so similar to that advocated by Professor Michael Porter&#8217;s recent report to the DTI entitled <em>UK Competitiveness, moving on to the next stage</em> .</p>

  <p>The Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 does not preclude the use of waiting time points in allocation of housing by local authorities or Registered Social Landlords. The act does, however, require that reasonable preference is given to particular categories of applicants and that certain factors, such as the income or age of the applicant (provided the applicant is 16 years of age or over) and length of residence in the area are not taken into account. Beyond this statutory framework, landlords have discretion in drawing up their system of priorities for housing allocations.</p>

  <p>Arran was not part of the original proposals for a possible derogation since the island is already covered by the BSE fallen stock surveillance arrangements. However, all replies are currently being assessed to inform the final definition of the "remote area".

  <p>The most recent activity analysis undertaken by the police service was in February 2003 in connection with assessment work around the tenders for a prisoner escort and court custody project. That project is still under consideration.</p>

  <p>The last general activity analysis covering all police activity was conducted in February 2001. Aggregated data from this exercise were provided by police forces to inform the review of distribution of police Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE). On the basis of this and other data, the Review Working Group made some provisional recommendations in September 2002, which informed police GAE allocations for 2003-04 to 2005-06. The group is expected to make final recommendations by March 2004.</p>

  <p>All public authorities should comply with best practice on openness. The majority of PPP projects are with public authorities other than the Scottish Executive. It is the responsibility of individual public authorities to develop their own proposals for making relevant documents to their PPP projects publicly available. Information should only be withheld where disclosure would cause real harm to the legitimate commercial or legal interests of suppliers, contractors, the public sector client or any other relevant party.</p>

  <p>In due course ministers will issue a code of practice under section 60 of the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002. This will provide guidance to authorities on discharging their responsibilities under the act.</p>

  <p>The Forum for Renewable Energy Development in Scotland, which I will chair, will work with the industry and the new Energy Intermediary Technology Institute to produce a development plan for the marine energy industry in Scotland. Particular attention will be given to the potential to build on synergies between Scotland&#8217;s existing offshore expertise from the UK Continental Shelf and new offshore renewables technologies. We have also provided &#163;2.125 million to help establish a Marine Energy Test Centre off Orkney.</p>

  <p>The Executive may issue guidance on the application of The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997. It is currently liasing with DEFRA on the production of a joint &quot;User&#8217;s Guide&quot; to those regulations to replace existing guidance. However, the new guidance is unlikely to be issued until after prospective changes to the regulations, to be consulted on in summer, are introduced.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency may only be directed by the Scottish ministers. They have not issued any directions in respect of packaging matters. Were they to give a direction, SEPA would be required to comply with it in terms of section 40(8) of the Environment Act 1995.</p>

  <p>The packaging recovery note scheme is administered by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. Its costs of administering the packaging recovery scheme as a whole are met by cost-recovery registration fees paid to it by companies with a packaging recovery obligation under the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997.</p>

  <p>These fees are reviewed regularly. A consultation exercise on changes to the regulations proposed for this summer will include discussion of a new fee structure.</p>
