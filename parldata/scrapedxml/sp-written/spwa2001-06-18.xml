  <p>Initial studies based on observations made in other countries suggest that airborne transmission from infected premises has not been a prominent feature of the current foot-and-mouth disease outbreak.

  <p>No fee is imposed on farmers and crofters by the Scottish Executive Rural Affairs Department in respect of applications for a license to move stock. If a proposed livestock movement is not covered by the General Movement licence (possible only in the Provisionally Free Area), an application must be made to the local SERAD Area Office for an individual licence to move livestock. This is processed by SERAD staff without any charge. The farmer or crofter is required to abide by the conditions of the licence which may incur costs.</p>

  <p>The Executive fully appreciates the impact which the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak is having in the South of Scotland. The &#163;13.5 million emergency relief package which I announced on 2 April made available considerable resources to support those areas worst affected by the disease. As an immediate measure, Scottish Enterprise Borders were allocated &#163;150,000 from the additional funding given to the Enterprise Networks. &#163;100,000 has gone to the Borders Tourist Board from the VisitScotland&#8217;s allocation. Businesses in the Borders will also receive additional funding through the Scotland-wide elements of the emergency package, including the hardship rates relief scheme, estimated to be worth up to &#163;3.5 million for businesses across Scotland.</p>

  <p>The First Minister and ministerial colleagues met representatives from the Borders on 29 May, to discuss the impact of foot-and-mouth disease in the Borders, and what medium- to long-term measures might be required to assist recovery. A positive meeting between local agencies and Executive officials took place on 8 June, to discuss the detail of the plan. Consideration of recovery measures will be taken forward in the context of national recovery strategies.</p>

  <p>There is nothing to prevent school nurses from conducting such inspections with appropriate consent. However, most health boards have now moved away from routine inspections of children for headlice.</p>

  <p>The only effective means of conducting an inspection is by wet combing, which involves thoroughly washing and conditioning the hair then combing it through in layers, a process which can take between 30 to 45 minutes per child and which is not practical in a school setting. Additionally, in order to be effective, inspections require to be undertaken on a regular basis. However, inspecting a class on one day is no guarantee that there will not be an infection the next.</p>

  <p>The Small Area Health Statistics Unit (SAHSU) study will compare health outcomes in people living within 2km of landfill sites with the health outcomes in the rest of the population. The 2 km band was chosen to optimise the study design and is in line with the conclusion of a World Health Organisation workshop held in April 2000 on exposure assessment around landfill sites. The study will cover the whole of Great Britain but importantly will also report the findings of the main analyses separately for Scotland.</p>

  <p>The SAHSU study will report on a number of health outcomes including birth defects and the incidence of certain types of cancer. Further information about the study is available on the Department of Health Internet Site (http://doh.gov.uk/land2.htm).</p>

  <p>The health information used by SAHSU in this study is routinely collected data which have been supplied by the Office for National Statistics, the Information and Statistics Division of NHSScotland and the General Register Office for Scotland. Health Boards in Scotland did not submit data to the study.</p>

  <p>Information, including the location and operating conditions for licensed landfill sites in Scotland, was supplied to SAHSU by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency.</p>

  <p>Scottish Healthcare Supplies currently work closely with individual NHS Trusts to ensure that opportunities for standardisation and co-operative procurement of medical equipment are maximised.</p>

  <p>In spring 2000 Scottish Healthcare Supplies launched a major new initiative, the Strategic Alliance Partnership, in order to maximise benefits for economies of scale, rationalisation and standardisation.</p>

  <p>The Strategic Alliance Partnership aims to identify any commercial opportunity that will achieve savings for NHSScotland. Work will include the standardisation of items in use and rationalisation of the supplier base which should increase the negotiating position of NHSScotland. Launched last spring, this initiative is expected to deliver results within the next two years.</p>

  <p>Scottish Healthcare Supplies are central to the procurement of medical equipment from the &#163;30 million additional capital made available earlier in 2000-01. They anticipate significant savings to the NHSScotland as a result of this centralised activity.</p>

  <p>Another example of co-operative purchasing is the recent central procurement initiative for linear accelerators and simulators. This resulted in a saving of around &#163;1 million and an investment package of &#163;5.8 million that benefited four of the five cancer centres. Further investments under the same procurement process are being planned.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2001-06-18.S1W-14438.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80201" speakername="Mr Jack McConnell" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-01/wa0618.htm#16">

  <p>An amendment proposing an extension of entitlement to free school meals to schoolchildren whose parents receive Working Families Tax Credit or Disabled Person&#8217;s Tax Credit was considered and rejected during the passage of the Standards in Scotland&#8217;s Schools etc (Scotland) Act 2000. The level of Working Families Tax Credit and Disabled Person&#8217;s Tax Credit is a reserved matter.</p>

  <p>Ministers are committed to quality school meals, other healthy eating initiatives and improving the uptake of both. However, we do not collect information about the arrangements which education authorities operate for the provision of free school meals. Authorities are aware of their responsibilities, and in making such arrangements it is for them to take into account questions surrounding the identification of pupils receiving free school meals.</p>

  <p>There are no immediate plans to conduct research into best practice in the provision of free school meals in other countries or into why children do not take up their entitlement to free school meals. We have, however, raised the matter of uptake with COSLA and have agreed to further joint discussion with them about this.</p>

  <p>sportscotland&#8217;s financial planning cycle covers the next three years. The Camanachd Association has been allocated &#163;15,000 per year for the next three years from Exchequer funding for the period covered by the cycle. The association has also been allocated an additional &#163;56,000 per year for the next three years, again from Exchequer funding. The total amount being made available will therefore be &#163;71,000 per year. This funding will enable the association to continue to meet the costs of a national youth sport co-ordinator and two local development officers. The amounts requested by the association were &#163;49,670 for the current year, &#163;51,315 for 2002-03 and &#163;52,920 for 2003-04.</p>

  <p>This is a matter for VisitScotland but I understand that, whilst it is normal practice for recruitment consultants to look into the background of candidates, it is not common practice to place with recruitment consultants a duty to ensure that candidates have no other conflicting interests.</p>

  <p>Seven representations expressing support for the scheme were received between 1997 and 1999. Five of these were from individuals and two from businesses in the area. It would not be appropriate to divulge personal details without having first obtained the consent of those involved.</p>
