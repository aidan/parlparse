  <p>The Scottish Executive welcomes the UK Government&#8217;s consultation on <em>A Modern Regional Policy for the United Kingdom</em> and its commitment to regional policy. The Scottish Executive also welcomes the guarantee that Scotland would not lose out financially under the proposed EU Framework for devolved regional policy.</p>

  <p>Structural funds have brought major benefits to Scotland but the Scottish Executive acknowledges that, following enlargement, the larger part of European regional development funding will go to the new member states after the current structural funds programmes cease at the end of 2006. However, regional disparities will continue to exist and these need to be recognised and addressed. This is one of the key principles of the response that I sent on behalf of the Scottish European Structural Funds Forum to the Department of Trade and Industry on the UK Government consultation.

  <p>The information requested, broken down by parliamentary constituency, is not held centrally. The latest available figures for overall access to broadband technology facilities show that, at the end of March 2003, 57% of the Scottish population had access to broadband services.

  <p>Wild fish populations are regularly monitored by Fisheries Trust biologists, in collaboration with Fisheries Research Services.</p>

  <p>On marine salmon sites, weekly sea lice counts are carried out routinely by farmers to determine the trigger levels for treatments.</p>

  <p>There is better control of sea lice where Area Management Agreements are in place, and sea lice burdens on both farmed and wild fish appear to be reduced in the first year of production following a synchronised fallow. The Tripartite Working Group is currently reviewing sea lice monitoring arrangements to ensure that data collected from wild and farmed populations provides an accurate assessment of local sea lice burdens.</p>

  <p>The current legislation relating to hospital post-mortem examinations is the Human Tissue Act 1961 which provides for the use of parts of bodies of deceased persons for therapeutic purposes and purposes of medical education and research and with respect to the circumstances in which post-mortem examinations may be carried out.</p>

  <p>In terms of the 1961 act, two different sets of circumstances need to be considered. Section 1(1) of the act provides: "If any person, either in writing at any time or orally in the presence of two or more witnesses during his last illness, has expressed a request for his body or any specified part be used after his death for therapeutic purposes or for purposes of medical education or research, the person lawfully in possession of his body after his death may, unless he has reason to believe that the request was subsequently withdrawn, authorise the removal from the body of any part or, as the case may be, the specified part, for use in accordance with the request".</p>

  <p>Section 1(2)(a) of the 1961 act provides that the person lawfully in possession of the body can authorise the removal of any part of the body for the purposes of medical education or research if, after reasonable inquiry, he has no reason to believe that the deceased had expressed an objection to the body being so dealt with after death, and had not withdrawn that objection.</p>

  <p>The 1961 act is generally regarded as unsatisfactory, and the Executive has accepted the recommendation from the Review Group on Retention of Organs at Post-Mortem that it should be repealed and replaced. This will be done as soon as a suitable legislative opportunity arises.</p>

  <p>The review group has produced two sets of recommendations. The first were contained in its initial report, published in January 2001. These were intended to ensure that the role of relatives, particularly parents, in the post-mortem examination process is recognised and respected. These have for the most part been, or are being, implemented.</p>

  <p>The second set of recommendations relates to the second phase of the review group&#8217;s work, the report on which was published in November 2001. Its remit for that phase of its work was to look at the underlying legislation and suggest reforms. These recommendations, on which the Executive consulted extensively, will be reflected in the legislation referred to in the answer given to question S2W-1207 today.

  <p>In fulfilment of one of the recommendations in the first report of the Review Group on Retention of Organs at Post-Mortem, Audit Scotland carried out a validation review, published in March 2002, of the total number of organs held in trusts from 1948 to 2000 from both hospital post-mortem examinations and those instructed by the procurator fiscal. These included organs held in hospital archive/museum collections; those held awaiting instructions for disposal, and those undergoing tests to provide diagnoses. Of the 10,862 organs retained, 4,010 were brains. Many of these were held in university trusts which include specialist units such as the Institute of Neurological Sciences in Glasgow and the CJD Unit in Lothian with a particular interest in research involving brains.</p>

  <p>The Cremation (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 2003, which came into operation on 27 June 2003, put beyond doubt the legality of cremating body parts removed at post-mortem examination, whether that was a hospital post-mortem examination or one instructed by the procurator fiscal. These regulations are a direct response to a recommendation from the review group and are intended to address the problems which families told the review group they had been experiencing.</p>

  <p>Planning seeks to control physical development (for example, the erection of structures and buildings) and changes in the use of buildings and land. Sections 25 and 37(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 require that planning decisions be made in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise. In most cases, it will be for the planning authority initially to take such decisions.</p>

  <p>Where a planning authority grants planning permission it is open to them to attach conditions. The Executive's policy on the use of such conditions is set out in Circular SEDD 4/1998: <em>The Use of Conditions in Planning Permissions</em>. A link to the circular is attached:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/about/Planning/Circular_4_1998.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/about/Planning/Circular_4_1998.aspx</a>.</p>

  <p>Planning policy and legislation are kept under constant review. Should changes be required in primary legislation, we will introduce a planning bill when time and resources permit.</p>

  <p>In order to achieve consistent standards across the whole of the UK, international negotiations, the sponsorship of the Civil Aviation Authority, safety regulation, licensing and economic regulation of airports are conducted on a UK basis. The Scottish Executive plays its part through the UK Government in influencing the formulation of policy on those particular aviation matters.</p>

  <p>Part IV of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 places duties on education authorities not to discriminate against a disabled pupil in the education or associated services provided for, or offered to, pupils at the school by that body. Furthermore, education authorities must take reasonable steps to avoid disadvantage to disabled pupils. However, it does not require education authorities to remove or alter a physical feature, or to provide auxiliary aids or services. These duties not to discriminate came into force on 1 September 2002.</p>

  <p>Ensuring accessibility in respect of access to school buildings is one aspect of the Education (Disability Strategies and Pupils&#8217; Educational Records) (Scotland) Act 2002. Initial accessibility strategies, prepared under the act by 1 April 2003, are now being implemented by all providers of school education. These strategies plan improvements to be made, over time, to the physical environment of the school and other places where school education is provided.</p>

  <p>Part III of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, relating to Rights of Access, Facilities, Services and Premises, will commence from 1 October 2004. This will apply to any service providers using a school for purposes other than education or associated services.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive supports money advice outreach services within the NHS, particularly in areas of deprivation. Local authorities, social inclusion partnerships' and other non-statutory sources including the NHS and health boards provide financial support for these local advice services, including the provision of funding to support the work of Citizens&#8217; Advice Bureaux (CABx) to tackle health inequalities and social inclusion.</p>

  <p>CABx run a number of advice projects in health settings around the country, ranging from sessions in local health centres to a dedicated hospital-based CABx in Raigmore, Inverness.</p>

  <p>The Executive is currently consulting with the money advice sector as to how further support for money advice, as outlined in the Partnership Agreement, might best be targeted. We will look at the issues raised about the links to health, including the issue of delivery, as part of this exercise.</p>

  <p>The Executive has not commissioned research into the links between money problems and health problems in deprived communities.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer <a name="QuestionText">whether the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB) invited the Auditor General for Scotland, in preparing his 2001-02 audit of the SPCB and, in particular, the consideration of the Flour City contract in respect of the Holyrood building project, to interview those companies and individuals that submitted tenders for the contract and those who were associated with the contract after it was awarded; whether the SPCB will make representations to the Holyrood inquiry being conducted by Lord Fraser of Carmyllie that these companies and individuals be interviewed, and what the reasons are for its position on this matter</a></p>

  <p>No. The SPCB cooperated fully with the Auditor General&#8217;s 2001-02 audit, but did not in any way attempt to lead or direct his enquiries. It will be a matter for Lord Fraser to determine what evidence he will consider and from whom. The SPCB shall fully co-operate with the inquiry being conducted by Lord Fraser.</p>
