  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to working with the further education colleges to ensure adequate support to those who require assistance. That includes both asylum seekers and those in other categories who are new to Scotland. I am pleased to announce that the Executive intends to provide new funding of &#163;1.7 million in the current financial year, and in future financial years, to support a package of new measures which will strengthen the ability of the colleges to undertake mainly language work. That sum comprises &#163;0.5 million to boost college provision specifically for asylum seekers, and a further &#163;1.2 million for other groups. The total sum of &#163;1.7 million will be channelled through the Scottish Further Education Funding Council.</p>

  <p>The package of measures will include the waiving of the residence and settlement criteria which until now have governed the ability of a college to claim funding and to reclaim the cost of waived fees; the provision of funding to allow colleges to provide books and support with travel; and a new discretion relating to asylum seekers which will allow colleges to approve continued studies beyond the level of basic courses.</p>

  <p>The decision of the Scottish Executive to provide &#163;1.7 million in extra resources will ensure that existing budgets can continue to be used for their original purpose without detriment to Scottish students.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not readily available and cannot be obtained without disproportionate cost.</p>

  <p>An indication of the extent to which the terms of the ECHR have been relied upon by accused persons and appellants in all Scottish criminal courts since 20 May 1999, when the Lord Advocate became subject to section 57(2) of the Scotland Act 1998, is given by the available statistics showing the number of &quot;devolution issues&quot; (within the meaning of Schedule 6 of the Scotland Act 1998) which have been intimated to the Lord Advocate. Rules 40.1 et seq of the Act of Adjournal (Criminal Procedure Rules) 1996 as amended require written notice of intention to raise a devolution issue in any criminal proceedings in Scotland to be given to the Lord Advocate.</p>

  <p>Between 20 May 1999 and 31 December 1999, 164 devolution issues were intimated to the Lord Advocate. Between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2000 the figure was 821 and from 1 January 2001 to date the number of devolution issues intimated to the Lord Advocate was 172.</p>

  <p>The total number of devolution issues intimated to the Lord Advocate from 20 May 1999 to date is 1,157, of which 60 (or 5.2 per cent) were decided against the Crown (where results are available).</p>

  <p>Since 2 October 2000 accused persons and appellants have been able, in terms of the Human Rights Act 1998, to rely upon convention rights arguments in criminal proceedings without any requirement to intimate their intention to the Lord Advocate. No statistics are available to indicate the number of cases in which convention rights arguments have been relied upon in this manner.</p>

  <p>I appreciate the impact which the necessary foot-and-mouth disease restrictions have had on farming business and that, despite the efforts made to avoid feeding cattle being retained until they were over 30 months, this has been unavoidable in some instances.

  <p>Measures are already in hand to tackle health care associated infection in Scotland. NHS Trusts must ensure that adequate infection control arrangements, based on Health Department guidance, are in place. At my request the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland is introducing new standards for infection control and cleaning services. Compliance will be monitored and verified. The new national surveillance system which I have announced will provide more reliable information on the incidence of health care associated infection.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the reasons are for the increase in the number of appeals sent to the High Court Judiciary, as highlighted in the <i>Criminal Appeal Statistics, Scotland, 2000</i> .</p>

  <p>The most recent issue of <i>Criminal Appeal Statistics, Scotland</i> was published on 22 August 2001. The statistics relate to appeals against conviction, sentence or acquittal concluded in the High Court of Justiciary sitting in its appellate capacity during the year 2000.</p>

  <p>The statistics indicate that the overall total of such cases concluded during 2000 was in fact 2 per cent lower than the total for 1999.</p>

  <p>It is open to any person convicted of a criminal offence in the district, sheriff or High Court to appeal to the High Court sitting in its appellate capacity against conviction alone, sentence alone or against both conviction and sentence. It is also open to the Crown to appeal against acquittal or against sentence in very limited circumstances.</p>

  <p>Crown appeals are comparatively rare. Defence appeals are far more common and are initiated on the basis of advice tendered to convicted persons by their legal representatives as to the prospects of a successful appeal. Such advice in any given case will take into account the whole circumstances of the case so far as relevant and the applicable law.</p>

  <p>One area in which there was an increase in appeal business between 1999 and 2000 concerned persons previously convicted of murder in the High Court and sentenced to life imprisonment who, following a decision of the High Court issued on 29 November 1996 in the case of <i>Elliott</i> v <i>HM Advocate</i>, appealed with a view to having the effective commencement date of such sentences &quot;backdated&quot; to the date on which they were first remanded in custody to await trial. The number of such appeals dealt with during 2000 was over 90, as compared with 21 during the previous year.</p>

  <p>The question is ultimately a matter for the courts to determine.

  <p>Orkney and Shetland&#8217;s ancient legal heritage, which is distinct from that of the rest of Scotland, continues to exist in a number of areas. These are linked to the ancient system of Udal land ownership, the chief feature of which is that grants of land do not emanate from the Crown as feudal superior.</p>

  <p>Another distinguishing feature of this system is that the foreshore in Orkney and Shetland is treated in the same way as land above high water mark across the rest of Scotland. Consequently, it is possible for Udal titles to land to include the foreshore<i> </i>as property.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Health Plan makes it clear that we are committed to providing a safe working environment for NHS staff. Each trust is already required to implement policies based on risk assessment, aimed at reducing violent incidents in the workplace. To assist NHS employers, <i>Dignity at Work: Eliminating Bullying and Harassment in the Workplace</i> guidance was published in February this year and work has begun on further guidance covering health at work which will include personal safety and management of violence and aggression.</p>

  <p>To help GPs, regulations were introduced in July last year, which enable boards and trusts to work with GPs to ensure that treatment to a potentially violent patient is provided at appropriate premises. Guidance is now currently being developed for GPs about how to deal with violent patients.</p>

  <p>There are nine local prisons in Scotland &#8211; Aberdeen, Barlinnie, Cornton Vale, Dumfries, Edinburgh, Greenock, Inverness, Kilmarnock and Perth.</p>

  <p>Each of Scotland&#8217;s 17 prisons currently receives a full, formal inspection on a cyclical basis, every three-and-a-half to four years. Full inspections take between a week and a fortnight depending on size and complexity of the establishment, during which all aspects of the establishment are examined from the point of view of safety, decency, and the establishment&#8217;s contribution to crime prevention.</p>

  <p>Full inspection reports are followed up in subsequent years by intermediate inspections. The Inspectorate also undertakes occasional studies on a theme common to all or several penal establishments. The most recent study <i>Punishment First &#8211; Verdict Later?</i>, a review of conditions for remand prisoners at the end of the 20th century involved visits to all prisons holding remand prisoners but is not included in the figures given below. Similarly, inspectorate time spent in assessing the establishments&#8217; readiness for Y2K has not been included.</p>

  <p>The TUPE Regulations implement obligations under European law and apply in the same way throughout Great Britain. Therefore, if the regulations apply they will have the same effect whether the affected civil servants work in Scotland, England or Wales.

Well-established procedures exist for staff who feel that they are victims of workplace harassment or bullying to report and to have their case investigated.

  <p>There is no money due to security staff in back pay. Management in the Scottish Executive became aware earlier this year that security staff had not been claiming payment for time spent travelling to work. Steps have been taken to ensure that security staff are fully aware that they are able to claim travel time and consequently they have been doing so since 1 April 2001. Management and the relevant trade union have recently issued joint guidance to security staff advising them how to make retrospective claims back to 1 April 1995. These claims will be paid as soon as possible after they have been received. Until such time as all of the claims are received, the total payments to be made will not be known.</p>

  <p>The Western Isles, Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands are marketed by their respective area tourist boards. They also benefit from the generic marketing carried out by VisitScotland and by the British Tourist Authority.</p>

  <p>The level of air fares on routes to the Western and North Isles is a commercial matter for airlines. The Scottish Executive is, however, committed to the maintenance of affordable links to islands communities. Our subsidy to Highlands and Islands Airports Ltd results in lower costs to airlines than if the full economic costs were applied. In addition, the Glasgow-Barra air service and some inter-island routes within the Western Isles, Orkney and Shetland are already subsidised by the Executive. These measures benefit tourists.</p>
