  <p>This information is not held in the form requested.</p>

  <p>Colleges are funded based on a target of weighted student units of measurement (WSUMs). The following table shows the WSUMs completed at colleges from 1999-2000 to 2002-03 (the latest year available).</p>

  <p>The core recurrent funding which the Scottish Further Education Funding Council agrees to provide to each college is not split between full-time and part-time. It is up to colleges themselves to decide on the detailed use of funds. The table shows the WSUMs generated by full-time activity and those generated by part-time activity. These proportions have then been applied to the total core recurrent funding received by colleges to give as close an indication as possible of the funding which would have been attributed to full-time and part-time students respectively.</p>

  <p>Colleges can receive funding in addition to core recurrent funding (e.g. for estates maintenance, student bursaries, and specific initiatives). However, it is colleges&rsquo; core recurrent funding which is associated directly with taught student activity.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Further and Higher Education Funding Councils provide recurrent funding based mainly on factors such as student population and activity. It is up to the institutions themselves to decide on how funding is used. Neither funding council specifies how much funding should be spent on advice to students nor do they require institutions to report on this. In relation to the administration of discretionary funds, again the amount of funding allocated by colleges and universities to this area of their business is for each institution to decide.</p>

It heralded new regional and national teams to support workforce development and dedicated personnel to take this forward.

  <p>NHS Lanarkshire is committed to ensuring that it meets the Executive&rsquo;s target of a maximum waiting time of 26 weeks for a first out-patient appointment with a consultant, following referral by a General Medical/Dental Practitioner from 31 December 2005.</p>

  <p>The National Waiting Times Unit has agreed local performance improvement targets and plans with individual NHS boards, including NHS Lanarkshire, which set out the progress to be made in 2004-06 towards delivery of this commitment.</p>

  <p>To assist with the achievement of the 26-weeks target, the Centre for Change and Innovation is driving forward the implementation of a &pound;7 million national service redesign initiative for Orthopaedic out-patient services, which was launched in May 2004 and for which NHS Lanarkshire is a pilot site.</p>

  <p>In the coming weeks, I will announce full details of new, reduced waiting times commitments for both out-patient consultations and in-patient and day case treatment.</p>

  <p>The national maximum waiting time for orthopaedic surgery is nine months from the date a patient is placed on the in-patient/day case waiting list until the date of hospital admission. This guaranteed waiting time will be reduced to six months from the end of 2005.</p>

  <p>Until April 2004 the Department of Health in London (DH) was responsible for the preparation, printing and distribution across Great Britain of publicity material about help with health charges and about NHS prescription charge exemption and remission arrangements. No costs were met by the Scottish Executive or the Welsh Assembly. The budget for this service has now been divided on a pro rata basis between the Health Departments in Scotland, England and Wales, with &pound;73,000 being transferred to the Scottish Executive. A number of the information booklets revised, printed and issued by DH in the early part of this year are still available for distribution in Scotland. Scottish versions of the booklets will be issued as existing stocks run out.</p>

  <p>These figures are taken from the UK-wide International Passenger Survey (IPS), which samples overseas visitors to Scotland entering the country through Edinburgh and Glasgow airports only (although from 2005 onwards, visitors who enter Scotland through Prestwick will also be surveyed under the IPS). This data is then grossed up to approximate for visitors entering through other airports. No Scottish ferry ports are included in IPS surveying; again, survey data from particular ports of entry in England and Wales from the Republic of Ireland is grossed up to an all-UK figure.</p>
