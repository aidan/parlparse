  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what target time is set by the Scottish Ambulance Service for (a) arriving at the scene of a call-out and (b) delivering a patient to hospital if that is the outcome of a call-out.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2001-09-10.S1W-17583.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80146" speakername="Susan Deacon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-01/wa0910.htm#se_Minister">

  <p>In responding to emergency 999 calls the Scottish Ambulance Service aims to meet national response times targets for getting an ambulance to the scene of the call-out. These vary according to population density and are as follows:</p>

  <p>High Density &#8211; 95 per cent reached within 14 minutes, 50 per cent within seven minutes</p>

  <p>Medium Density &#8211; 95 per cent reached within 18 minutes, 50 per cent within eight minutes</p>

  <p>Sparse Density &#8211; 95 per cent reached within 21 minutes, 50 per cent within eight minutes</p>

  <p>The performance of the Scottish Ambulance Service in relation to these targets is reported in the service&#8217;s annual report. A copy of the report for 1999-2000 was sent to each MSP.</p>

  <p>Once at the scene of a call-out, ambulance paramedic staff will use their judgment to decide what course of action is required, depending on the medical condition of the patient. In some cases, treatment at the scene will be appropriate, and in others the patient&#8217;s needs will best be served by moving them to hospital as quickly as possible. There is therefore no set target time for delivering the patient to hospital.</p>

  <p>Control of pests under the Pests Act 1954 does not require a licence. Under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, which provides for the protection of all wild birds, four general licences are in force in Scotland which permit authorised persons to kill a range of birds referred to as pest species by certain means in certain circumstances. Individual licence applications in respect of these species are not required, but they are required under that Act for birds not covered by the four general licences.</p>

  <p>We intend to produce a range of pest control information leaflets which will be freely available.</p>

  <p>In the year 2000-01, a total of 1,902 general dental practitioners in Scotland were eligible for consideration for commitment payments, subject to meeting the relevant commitment payments criteria.</p>

  <p>In 2000-01, an average of 139 dentists failed to meet the minimum gross earnings criteria of &#163;25,000. An average of 45 dentists failed to meet the 10-year length of service criteria. An average of 33 dentists failed to meet both the minimum gross earnings criteria of &#163;25,000 and the 10-year length of service criteria.</p>

  <p>In 2000-01, there would have been no additional cost of extending the scheme to such persons, as the commitment payment scheme for that year was subject to a cash limited budget of &#163;20 million for Great Britain. The effect would have been to decrease the quarterly monies available to qualifying dentists.</p>

  <p>The provision of short break or respite care services that are relevant and accessible to all sections of the community is a shared responsibility of local authorities, the NHS and housing agencies. In recognition of the importance of respite care we are providing local authorities with significantly increased resources over the next three years to develop an extra 22,000 weeks of short breaks a year across Scotland by 2003-04. The NHS may provide respite and rehabilitation care where there is a clinical need. There is no age limit to NHS care. An expert group under the chief medical officer is currently looking at the journey of care for older people in hospitals and in the community to see what improvements can be made, and this group will also investigate allegations of ageism within the NHS in Scotland.</p>

  <p>I have asked Professor Hawkins, Chief Executive of Fisheries Research Services to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>A summary of the activities of the two fisheries research vessels, <i>Scotia </i>and <i>Clupea</i>, is provided in the table. The output from the stock survey cruises, when combined with additional information from sampling at fish markets and surveys of discards on commercial vessels, provides the Scottish input to internationally co-ordinated assessment work by the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas. Recent assessments of particular relevance to Scotland are:</p>

  <p>Measures to protect cod in waters to the west of Scotland next year were agreed in July. Nephrops fishermen will be able to continue to catch nephrops in these waters with nets of mesh sizes between 70 to 79 millimetre provided that no more than 5 per cent of the catch consists of cod. This outcome emerged after a series of meetings between Commission officials, scientists, UK negotiators and industry representatives.</p>

  <p>The Executive believes that the implementation of the SNAP report on multiple sclerosis (MS) deserves to be given priority by the NHS in Scotland. While implementation is in the first place a matter for health boards and NHS Trusts, the health department has sought information from NHSScotland about various aspects of treatment and care for MS sufferers, and will be extending the coverage of this information soon. The department will go on to discuss the performance of the NHS in relation to the treatment and care of MS sufferers with the boards themselves, involving the MS Society Scotland where appropriate.</p>

  <p>In addition, the SNAP recommendations on collaboration among clinicians in treating MS and on the need for better communications with MS sufferers are being addressed as part of wider initiatives including the introduction of managed clinical networks, and the investment of &#163;14 million over the next three years to improve the capacity of the NHS to communicate with, listen to and work in partnership with individuals and support groups. The issue of the prescription of beta interferon was already under review by the Health Technology Board for Scotland.</p>

  <p>In wider terms we are pursuing our commitment in &quot;Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change&quot; to work with the NHS in Scotland, patients and patient support groups to help improve services for people with chronic enduring conditions like MS. The chief medical officer has been asked to consider how best the voluntary bodies can be involved in this process and the MS Society has been invited to submit their ideas on this process.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive funds SNAP. In due course a follow-up audit will be carried out to check progress against the recommendations.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what savings have been made by (a) it, (b) local authorities and (c) the NHS in Scotland over the last three years as a result of electronic procurement methods, in total and as a proportion of procurement spending, and how these figures compare with the equivalent UK figures.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. Procurement by local authorities is a matter for the individual body concerned.</p>

  <p>Savings announced by UK ministers in July this year were for UK central Government. They were based on a survey of the extent to which UK departments place orders by telephone, fax and other electronic means and of the extent to which invoices are paid through BACs and the Government procurement card. The Executive uses all of these methods in varying degrees and has done so for some time.</p>

  <p>Following informal discussions earlier this year with the police associations, local government and representatives from the private security industry, a consultation paper is being issued today containing proposals to regulate the industry. The consultation paper is being given wide circulation. The closing date for responses is 14 December 2001.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what strategy exists, in connection with the marketing of Scotland as a tourist destination, to promote Robert Burns abroad; which organisations and individuals have been involved in formulating any such strategy; what action has been taken in support of any such strategy, and what budget is made available annually to support any such strategy, detailing the amount spent in 1999-2000, 2000-01 and in 2001-02 to date.</p>

  <p>The Executive is considering how best to develop a programme of events which, as part of the wider Scottish Tourism Strategy, will raise the profile and understanding of Burns both at home and abroad. We are currently consulting with a wide range of bodies&#8212;local authorities, enterprise, cultural and tourism bodies&#8212;as to how the Executive might contribute to their existing plans. Financial information is not available in the form requested.</p>
