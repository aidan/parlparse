  <p>Health for All Children Guidance (Hall 4, 2005) recommends that every child and parent should have access to a universal core programme of preventative pre-school care. The Scottish universal core programme of contacts includes contact with a health professional within the first 24 hours of life, 10 and 28 days, at six to eight weeks, at two, three and four months, at 12 and 13 months and at three to five years.</p>

  <p>The Scottish child health programme includes routine checks to detect any health problems and to ensure that children get any care or treatment they need as soon as possible, including immunisations. Up until school entry, information and advice on a range of health promotion topics should be provided such as weaning, nutrition, child development, safety and dental health. Most of the core programme is undertaken by health visitors/public health nurses, however some of the contacts listed above are undertaken by midwives.</p>

It is for individual local authorities, as employers, to ensure that all teachers employed wholly or mainly to teach pupils who are hearing impaired, visually impaired or both hearing and visually impaired hold an appropriate qualification.</p>

  <p>The guidance was drawn up in consultation with local authorities, representatives of the Association of Directors of Education Scotland and other key stakeholders.</p>

  <p>Under current constitutional arrangements the organisation of HMRC services in Scotland is a matter for that body. However the Scottish Government has an interest in the maintenance of an appropriate level of service across Scotland. We are aware of the decisions that have been made to reduce the number of buildings HMRC occupy in the Glasgow and Edinburgh areas and that a programme of reviews is on-going in respect of other offices. We believe HMRC must ensure an adequate level of convenient face to face service for Scottish taxpayers.</p>

  <p>The way community nursing is organised in Scotland has undergone a major review over the past two years. The aim has been to modernise how health care is delivered to people in their own homes and communities. The recommendations from <em>Visible, Accessible and Integrated Care</em> , the Review of Nursing in the Community, are currently being piloted in four health boards across Scotland. The new community health nurse teams will provide care that is currently delivered by District Nurses, Health Visitors, School Nurses and Family Health Nurses by maximising the range of skills available. By adopting a more generic, team based approach, services will be more flexible and responsive to the needs of local communities. More opportunities will also exist for other health care professionals and others such as local authorities to participate in the delivery of care and services.</p>

  <p>EventScotland is aware that a number of local authorities are considering providing funding in support of projects to celebrate Homecoming Scotland. Organisers of some of these projects have also submitted bids for funding from EventScotland to be part of the official homecoming programme. Details on the allocation of homecoming funding will be available in the week commencing 26 May when it is planned that the full programme will be launched. However, it is for local authorities to decide what funding is allocated by them to different projects, and no information on this is held centrally.</p>

  <p>Under the Local Government in Scotland Act 2003, councils currently have, and will continue to have, a duty to make arrangements for reporting to the public on the performance of their functions. Councils also remain under a duty to have regard to statutory guidance on Best Value, and should continue to be able to demonstrate good governance at a strategic, financial and operational level.

  <p>The review of nursing in the Community, <em>Visible, Accessible and Integrated Care,</em> made a number of recommendations about the delivery of healthcare to people in their homes and communities. Those recommendations, which included new community health nurse teams providing care that is currently delivered by health visitors and others, are currently being piloted in several health boards across Scotland. A more generic, team based approach will allow services to be more responsive to local needs and provide opportunities for other healthcare professionals and other agencies, such as local authorities, to participate in the delivery of care and services. The type and mix of healthcare staff needed to deliver those service will be a matter for NHS boards to determine.</p>

  <p>As far as it is possible to do so, the information requested is given in the table below. It is important to note, however, that in the latter part of the 10 year period in question NHS boards were phasing in a new staff grading classification system as a result of the continuing implementation of Agenda for Change. It is therefore not possible to report fully on staff grades in 2006 and 2007 because there is no direct match between the old and new grades. In addition, the data for 2007 includes only those staff who have been assimilated to Agenda for Change. Over 5,000 (headcount) nursing and midwifery staff have yet to be assimilated. A proportion of those staff will be health visitors, so the apparent dip in numbers in 2007 does not equate to an actual reduction.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>WTE = Whole-time equivalent.</p>

  <p>=Not available.</p>

  <p>1. During 2006 NHS boards were operating a phased approach to assimilation of staff to Agenda for Change and full assimilation had not yet been achieved. Therefore it was not possible to report fully on staff grades due to non-direct match between old grades and new Agenda for Change pay bands. Only high level summaries are available i.e. only down to registered/non-registered total level.</p>

  <p>2. Data for 1998-2005 is based on Whitley Council classification and 2007 data is based on Agenda for Change classification. Therefore the ability to compare trend is limited due to this change in data capture.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally in the form requested. At April 2008, there were 18 DEXA scanners in NHSScotland, and a further two will be commissioned by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde in this financial year. Every NHS board has access to DEXA scanning.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are expected to provide services for people with osteoporosis based on their assessment of local needs. We have drawn to NHS boards&rsquo; attention the results of an NHS Quality Improvement Scotland audit, published at the end of 2005, on the effectiveness of strategies for the secondary prevention of osteoporotic fracture in Scotland. The audit concluded that a fracture liaison service and direct access to assessment by DEXA scanning would allow patients who have sustained a fracture to be offered and receive appropriate therapies to prevent osteoporotic fractures in future.</p>

  <p>The response to the report of the physical education review group included a commitment to provide 400 additional PE teachers to support the growing emphasis on physical education by 2008. Intakes to the professional graduate diploma course in PE were increased. Since 2004, 247 students have entered the PGDE in PE. In addition, the universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh were commissioned to develop a postgraduate certificate in education course in PE for existing primary teachers. To date almost 600 primary teachers have enrolled on the course.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has not set a timescale for the provision of two hours good quality PE for each child every week. As part of Curriculum for Excellence, we expect schools to continue to work towards the provision of two hours good quality PE for each child every week.

  <p>Physical education (PE) alone will not tackle the problem of childhood obesity.</p>

  <p>Over the next three years the Scottish Government will be investing &pound;56 million (&pound;40 million new money) in a range of initiatives to tackle obesity, healthy eating and physical activity. An obesity action plan will be published later this spring providing further details of these.</p>

  <p>Schools clearly have an important role to play and the health and wellbeing experiences and outcomes from three to 15 will provide opportunities for young people to participate in a wide range of physical activity, including regular high-quality PE programmes. In S4 and beyond, the emphasis will shift from a broad general education with elements of choice to depth of learning in selected subjects or experiences as young people begin to work towards qualifications. This will include opportunities to develop an active and healthy lifestyle.</p>

  <p>There is also now a legislative duty on Scottish ministers and local authorities under the Schools (Health Promotion and Nutrition) (Scotland) Act 2007 to ensure schools are health promoting. A health promoting school will provide activities, environment and facilities which promote the mental, emotional, social and physical health and wellbeing of pupils.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is taking action in a number of areas to develop Scotland&rsquo;s marine renewables sector.</p>

  <p>Our &pound;13 million Wave and Tidal Energy Support Scheme is helping a number of wave and tidal energy projects make the transition from research and development to commercialisation.</p>

  <p>Under the Renewables Obligation mechanism the Scottish Government provides higher levels of support for electricity output from marine energy in Scottish waters than elsewhere in the UK. We are currently consulting on proposals for banding the Obligation to maintain the right levels of support for marine energy.</p>

  <p>The unique testing facilities at the European Marine Energy Centre in Orkney have received public sector investment totalling &pound;16 million, and provide a world class location for testing and proving these technologies.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has set out its plans to establish a Marine Energy Policy Group, which will lead on actions relating to further environmental research, monitoring and the production of locational guidance for the marine renewables sector.</p>

  <p>We are also lobbying hard on grid and regulatory matters, including pressing OFGEM and National Grid for a fundamental reform of the transmission charging regime.</p>

  <p>Local authorities&rsquo; and COSLA&rsquo;s commitment to making school buildings available or better available for community use is already well documented. The recent Audit Scotland report <em>Improving the school estate</em> indicated that many schools are providing community access to facilities and new build schools are often designed with community use in mind. The report highlights good practice but also identifies areas for improvement and we will work with COSLA and the local authorities on how best to address this.</p>

  <p>The Department of Health purchases stocks of the MMR vaccine under the national childhood vaccine contract to meet the needs of the entire UK vaccination programme.</p>

  <p>Combined MMR vaccines were first introduced into the routine childhood immunisation programme in 1988. At that time, the vaccines used were Pluserix and MMR II. Immravax was used from 1989. Pluserix and Immravax were withdrawn from use in September 1992 following confirmation that the rate of aseptic meningitis associated with these vaccines was higher than that of other available MMR vaccines. Priorix was used in the routine programme from 1997.</p>

  <p>Priorix and MMRII are currently used in the immunisation programme.</p>
