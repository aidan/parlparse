  <p>Locate in Scotland (LiS) has identified the strengthening of a number of key clusters, which are crucial to the performance and development of the Scottish economy, as part of its strategic portfolio approach to inward investment. Biotechnology is one of the clusters to which LiS has been able to make a considerable contribution and it works closely with Scottish Enterprise&#8217;s Biotechnology Cluster Team to maximise the opportunities available to Scotland in this sector within the &pound;38 million Biotechnology Cluster Action Plan launched last year.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s commitment to the biotechnology sector has been further bolstered by the granting in August 2000 of planning permission for the creation of a biotechnology park at Gowkley Moss, Midlothian.</p>

  <p>A recent addition to Scotland&#8217;s biotechnology base has been made in the shape of the Japanese Kyorin Pharmaceutical Company&#8217;s partnership with the Scottish Biomedical Foundation to develop compounds in the allergy and immunology field.</p>

  <p>URBAN II outline programmes for Inverclyde (Port Glasgow) and West Dunbartonshire (Clydebank South) form part of the UK proposals submitted to the European Commission today. Detailed programmes will now be developed as part of the negotiations with the Commission.</p>

  <p>Negotiations with the European Commission on Objective 2 plans for 2000-06 for the South and the East of Scotland have now been completed, and the Commission is expected to announce in the near future approval in principle of these plans. I look forward to the Commission&#8217;s announcement. The programme will attract over &pound;45 million and over &pound;156 million of European Funding respectively, and should assist in the creation of 3,200 jobs in the south and 17,000 in the east. Formal approval will follow next month.</p>

  <p>The West of Scotland programme is more complex and will take a little longer. Approval is expected in February 2001.</p>

  <p>The Further and Higher Education (Scotland) Act 1992 specifically prevents Ministers from directly interfering in the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council&#8217;s funding of particular institutions or subject areas. The Scottish Executive&#8217;s guidance to the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council sets a broad policy framework and leaves the council appropriately free to exercise its discretion through its teaching and research funding streams.</p>

  <p>Pharmacology is within the council&#8217;s Science teaching funding subject group and Pharmacy is within the Other Health and Welfare teaching funding subject group. The Science teaching funding subject group is prioritised by Scottish Executive guidance, which means that there are restrictions on transfers of council-funded places for teaching out of this priority area into other subjects.</p>

  <p>As for all other research funding subject areas, no specific priority is attached to Pharmacology and Pharmacy by the council.</p>

  <p>There is no statutory requirement upon an owner to keep a building in good repair, whether it is listed or not. There are, however, powers under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) (Scotland) Act 1997 for planning authorities &#8211; and, in exceptional circumstances, Scottish Ministers &#8211; to take action where buildings have deteriorated to a point where there is real concern for their future. These powers provide for the carrying out of urgent preservation works and for compulsory acquisition.</p>

  <p>Advice on maintaining listed buildings of all categories and unlisted buildings within conservation areas in good repair is covered within the <i>Memorandum</i> <i>of</i> <i>Guidance</i> <i>on</i> <i>Listed</i> <i>Buildings</i> <i>and</i> <i>Conservation</i> <i>Areas</i> , the document to which all planning authorities are directed by Scottish Office Development Department Circular No.13/1998 in their consideration of listed building consent and conservation area matters. More specific guidance can be found within the Historic Scotland publication, <i>The</i> <i>Repair</i> <i>of</i> <i>Historic</i> <i>Buildings</i> <i>in</i> <i>Scotland (1995).</i> Although the advice contained within it relates specifically to government buildings, a further book, <i>The Care of Historic Buildings and Ancient Monuments by Government Departments in Scotland</i> , published by Historic Scotland and the Department of National Heritage, is also relevant.</p>

  <p>This is a reserved matter. However, the Scottish Executive is in regular contact with DTI on a wide range of issues relating to petroleum exploration and development on the UKCS and these issues are regularly discussed at Pilot, the successor body to the Oil and Gas Industry Task Force of which I am to be a member.</p>
