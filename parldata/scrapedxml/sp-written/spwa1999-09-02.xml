  <p>I have already convened one meeting of key industry interests to address the present difficulties. This has led to positive action being taken to increase lamb sales on home and export markets. Further meetings are planned so that I can work with the industry to try to help the situation, which I acknowledge is difficult. The Meat and Livestock Commission and SQBLA both have resources available to help promote and market lamb. Recently, I announced that I would provide SQBLA with an extra &pound;150,000 to help find new markets for Scottish beef and lamb.</p>

  <p>Recognising the important role played by the major supermarkets in selling meat and meat products, efforts have been and will continue to be made, to encourage them to support home-produced products, including lamb. Special lamb promotions are planned for this autumn to coincide with the period when supplies are heaviest.</p>

  <p>It is for Ayrshire and Arran Health Board to decide how best to deliver services to the population resident within its area. The Board has recently concluded consultation on its Draft Orthopaedic Strategy and is considering the results. I understand that the Board has no plans to close the Accident and Emergency Departments at either Ayr Hospital or Crosshouse Hospital. The Board has plans to improve the range of services at these departments and in the primary care setting. These include better links with the out-of-hours GP and dentist services and psychiatric services, and improvements to services for children and victims of domestic violence.</p>

  <p>Further to the answer I gave on 22 July to question S1W-505 from Fiona Hyslop, I have today published a summary of responses to the Housing Green Paper &quot;Investing in Modernisation&quot; and made it available on the Internet. Copies of the summary are also available in The Scottish Parliament Information Centre.</p>

  <p>I very much welcome the constructive and well-informed contributions that we received in response to the Green Paper. Tackling Scotland&rsquo;s housing problems and taking forward the wide-range of initiatives identified for action in <i>A Partnership for Scotland</i> is a major challenge.</p>

  <p>We are already moving ahead. I have announced a homelessness review group chaired by Jackie Baillie and we have taken on board the ideas that came forward in the Green paper responses.</p>

  <p>The Green Paper suggested that the goal for housing policy should be the provision of high quality, well-designed housing which is affordable for all, is energy efficient and which supports the integration and regeneration of communities. This proposed vision received widespread support and it is endorsed by the Scottish Executive. Wide-ranging action is needed to implement that vision and to build on the existing community ownership programme. This includes primary legislation, and I should make it clear that the Executive plans to publish a draft Bill in the first half of next year.</p>

  <p>Over the forthcoming months we will continue to work with interested parties in developing our proposals for legislation and non-legislative changes leading up to the opportunity for full pre-legislative scrutiny of the kind which I hope the Parliament will become known for.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether any person domiciled in Scotland who commits murder abroad and is sent back to Scotland will be subject to the licence provisions which attach to all those imprisoned for murder in Scotland and, if not, whether appropriate legislation will be introduced.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/1999-09-02.S1W-852.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80252" speakername="Mr Jim Wallace" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-99/wa0902.htm#852">

  <p>Under the terms of the International Convention On The Transfer of Sentenced Persons and other bi-lateral agreements, the enforcement of the sentence on a person who is sentenced to life imprisonment for murder in a foreign jurisdiction and who is transferred, with his or her consent, to Scotland is governed by Scots law. This means that they would, on release, be subject to the same legal disabilities as a person sentenced to life imprisonment in this country. In other words, he or she would be released on life licence and would be liable to be recalled to custody for a breach of the conditions of that licence.</p>

  <p>As regards those persons who are deported to the United Kingdom or who return to Scotland voluntarily on completion of a prison sentence in a foreign jurisdiction, there are no statutory powers under which they can be made subject to compulsory supervision nor can they be imprisoned other than as a result of a sentence of imprisonment imposed for a crime committed in this country. Consideration is, however, at present being given to what measures might be put in place to deal with such cases. This is a complex area both legally and practically, not least because of the need to ensure that any statutory disabilities placed on such persons do not result in an aggravation of their sentence in breach of Article 7(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

  <p>While those returning to this country on completion of their sentence cannot be made subject to compulsory supervision, the law recognises the need of released prisoners for advice and support. There is a statutory duty on local authorities to make available advice, guidance and assistance to people who request such a service within 12 months of release, including persons deported, or otherwise returning, to this country.</p>

  <p>Also, by virtue of section 20 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, a sex offender order can be made against a person who has been punished under the law in force in a country or territory outside the United Kingdom for an act which constituted an offence under that law and which would have constituted a sexual offence to which Part 1 of the Sex Offenders Act 1997 applies if it had been committed in any part of the United Kingdom. An order can be made if the person has acted so as to give reasonable cause that an order is necessary to protect the public from serious harm. Once a sex offender order is made, the person becomes subject to the registration requirements of the 1997 Act. Breach of an order is a criminal offence.</p>

  <p>Following the 1997-98 review of the trunk road programme in England it was decided that lower cost options should be investigated for upgrading the A74 to motorway between Carlisle and Guardsmill. A study of options is in progress and a report is expected in the autumn. The Scottish Executive is represented on the study steering group. The Scottish Executive will continue to press for early implementation of a scheme to upgrade the road to motorway standard.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive monitors traffic volumes across the Scottish road network and is responsible for the motorway and trunk road network. Responsibility for local roads rests with the appropriate local authority. The Scottish Executive is: considering proposals for the upgrading of the A8000 from the A90 south of the Forth Road Bridge to the M9 Spur, within the Strategic Roads Review; working with the City of Edinburgh, West Lothian and Fife Councils and the Forth Road Bridge Joint Board, within the Forth Transport Infrastructure Partnership, on measures to address congestion on and around the Forth Road Bridge; and encouraging local authorities to address transport problems within their areas through their Local Transport Strategies.</p>

  <p>The intention is that the system of criminal record checks provided under part V of the Police Act 1997 should be self financing. However, we recognise the concerns of the voluntary sector on the proposed charges, and we are keeping the position under review.</p>

  <p>The participation of young people on 1 July was the responsibility of Unique Events, working under contract to the Scottish Office. The request for an escort of young people to the civic procession was made late in the day. The Scottish School of Music and Drama was approached because it offered a group of young people drawn from all over Scotland. Additional young people were required and the organisers approached the Secretary to the Modern Studies Association. It is recognised that the outcome of these approaches, adopted under pressure of time, had shortcomings.</p>

  <p>In relation to the children&rsquo;s parade, all 32 local authorities were approached in order to select schools from their areas to participate in the parade on 1July. Each local authority undertook its own selection process and accordingly the information sought is not available centrally.</p>

  <p>The SPCB recently reaffirmed that the entire Parliamentary complex should be a smoke free environment. The SPCB will be looking to the Business Managers to assist in exhorting all Members to observe the ban. Any Member or their staff found smoking in the Parliamentary complex will be reported to the SPCB, who will consider appropriate action. Parliament staff found smoking will be dealt with under the disciplinary procedures.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Parliament Policy on Smoking in the Workplace, which reinforces this message will be issued to all Members, their staff and Parliament staff this week.<br /></p>
