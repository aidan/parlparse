  <p>The working group considered that it would be helpful to have an indication of the number of no income no assets (NINA) debtors and therefore commissioned a desk study of existing research on over-indebtedness and debt with a view to identifying any information relating to research to try and provide more detailed information on the size of the NINA pool and whether there were different types of NINA debtors who might require different solutions.</p>

  <p>It was not possible, however, to quantify with any accuracy the number of NINA debtors in Scotland. Officials are currently considering whether further research is needed and if so when and how it should be undertaken.</p>

  <p>The group&rsquo;s recommendations propose extensive reform of debtor access to sequestration.

  <p>The study will concern what scope there may be for improving connectivity within and beyond Ayrshire, including with the central belt, which would support economic development and regeneration. As part of the study, consideration will be given to the general circumstances under which improvements in connectivity lead to improved economic development, and to specific improvements in Ayrshire. Work is at an early stage and a contractor has not yet been appointed. The detailed timetable will be finalised on appointment of the contractor but it is expected that the study will be completed in the spring. It is our usual practice to publish research reports.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answers to questions S2W-19210 and S2W-19212 on 4 October 2005. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament's website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="../../../webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a>. The main differences is that the Throughcare Addiction Service (TAS) will:</p>

  <p>Work with prisoners six weeks pre-release. This will enable TAS providers to visit the prisoner in prison and input into individual care packages (Community Integration Plans) on a number of occasions prior to release. Continuity of care will be improved because the same provider will support this prisoner on release.</p>

  <p>The remit of the service is to provide intensive 1:1 support and refer prisoners to appropriate support in the community. This support will focus on motivational work, harm minimisation and getting prisoners access to primary health care. This increased level of help will enable improved levels of communication with primary health care teams in the community.</p>

  <p>Evaluation of SPS Transitional Care Services has shown that it was difficult to engage young offenders in services on release. In targeting this vulnerable group and women the service will tailor care plans to meet individual needs.</p>

  <p>Voluntary Assistance places a duty upon local authorities to make available advice, guidance and assistance to people who request such a service within 12 months of release from prison. This service is not addictions focused, however people with addictions needs can access help and support. Support may be in the form of for example welfare needs, family support or housing.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Males in prison for fine default, serving sentences of less than 31 days, or on remand will not be able to access the new Throughcare Addiction Service. However, they can access voluntary throughcare provision.</p>
