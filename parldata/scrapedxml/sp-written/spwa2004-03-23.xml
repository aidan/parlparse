  <p>All NHS employers have disciplinary and complaints systems in place in respect of their staff. The ability of NHS Scotland to recognise and manage poor professional performance is one of the key aspects in our drive to make the NHSS safer for patients.

  <p>The ban on operators of landfill sites accepting most whole used tyres took effect from 16 July 2003. It is for the producer of used tyres to find ways other than landfill to dispose of used tyres. Other ways can include re-use, material recovery to make new products, civil engineering uses, aggregate substitutes and use as a fuel.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency is due to publish later this year a report on tyres as one of its priority waste stream projects to inform the future management of industrial wastes. This project is considering a number of ways to reduce tyre waste and promote re-use and recycling, such as promoting improved tyre maintenance, re-treading and recycling for use as material in path construction, carpet underlay or surfacing for children&#8217;s play areas.</p>

  <p>Since 2001, the Scottish Executive has provided education authorities with &#163;10.5 million to support modern languages learning and teaching and to take forward the recommendations of the ministerial action group on Languages&#8217; report <em>Citizens of a Multilingual World</em> . One of these recommendations was that "At the national level, a variety of languages other than French alone, including heritage or community languages such as Scottish Gaelic and Urdu, should be taught as a first modern language". Local authorities are generally responsible for ensuring a diversified provision of first modern language within their area if not within each school.</p>

  <p>As autonomous bodies, higher education institutions rightly make their own decisions with regard to curriculum provisions within particular subject areas. Scottish ministers are prevented by legislation from directing funds towards particular courses or institutions as this is a matter for the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council.</p>

  <p>Local government grant methodology has been agreed with COSLA and local authorities following extensive and collective consultation over a number of years. It takes account of a wide range of factors influencing local authority spend to ensure a fair distribution of grant. For these islands authorities it also takes account of the additional costs of delivering services in the islands, giving the three wholly island councils significantly higher allocations per head of population than any of the mainland councils, through the distribution of the Special Islands Needs Allowance.</p>

  <p>The Executive has sought to minimise the impact of these new requirements wherever possible.

  <p>The Executive recognises these concerns, however the EU Animal By-Products Regulation allows catering waste to go to landfill. Catering waste, most of which will have been cooked, presents a lower risk of disease transmission than raw waste.</p>

  <p>The National Care Standards were officially launched in November 2001 by the Health Minister. The event was held at Dynamic Earth in Edinburgh and attracted significant press and media attention. This was followed by the publication and wide distribution of the first 19 sets of standards in late 2001 and 2002. Two further sets of standards have been published in 2003 and 2004. All the standards are available on the Scottish Executive&#8217;s website at www.scotland.gov.uk.</p>

  <p>In September 2002 around 220,000 copies of a general information leaflet about the standards <em>Using care services?</em> was published. This leaflet along with posters was widely distributed to public places such as benefit offices, doctors&#8217; surgeries, libraries and local authority social work departments; to service providers; to umbrella and professional organisations and to the Care Commission. We will be publishing an updated version of this leaflet during 2004.</p>

  <p>The Care Commission has a key role to play in raising awareness of the standards when it is carrying out regulation, inspection and complaints work. The Scottish Executive is working, and will continue to work closely with the Commission to develop ways of further promoting the standards.</p>

  <p>There are also effective ways of publicising the standards which do not involve spending money. The Scottish Executive and ministers take every appropriate opportunity to raise awareness of the standards in correspondence, at meetings and other events. Likewise, the Care Commission has a key role to play in raising awareness of the standards when it is carrying out regulation, inspection and complaints work.</p>
