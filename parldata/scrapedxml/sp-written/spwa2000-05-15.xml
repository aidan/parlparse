  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will provide a progress report on the implementation in Scotland of Part V of the Police Act 1997, which provides for extended access to criminal record checks.</p>

  <p>We have reviewed the position and have decided to plan the introduction of the new checks in Scotland so that it comes into line with the plans for implementation in England and Wales. This is because we consider the two operations need to be developed in parallel to allow for as much integration as possible. Part V certificates will be phased in and July 2001 is now the target date for commencing the service in Scotland.</p>

  <p>We are investing &pound;23 million over three years (1999-2000&#8211;2001-02) in the Alternatives to Exclusion programme. The objective of this programme is to help authorities develop practical initiatives which provide alternatives to exclusion. Projects being supported include in and out of school support units, programmes of personal and social development, enhanced staffing in schools and in support of schools, vocational schemes involving work placements, behaviour support systems and outreach services into schools.</p>

  <p>In general, education authorities and schools make the detailed decisions on spending, including spending on textbooks for schools from within their general education budgets. Additional resources for schools were announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the budget in March. These will be used by schools to assist their approaches to raising standards. The extent to which they might be used to purchase textbooks will be a matter for local decision in line with local priorities identified by schools. Schools will also benefit from additional investment in Higher Still materials and in broadband technology made possible by resources identified in the Partnership Agreement.</p>

  <p>Source: Drawn from local authority staffing surveys compiled jointly by the Scottish Executive and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Figures for full time equivalent staff exclude staff in fire services, police services, Bridge Joint Boards and Valuation Joint Boards.</p>

  <p>2. The data for 1996 is taken from December as earlier figures for that year are considered less reliable due to classification problems encountered by some local authorities in the period immediately following local government reorganisation.</p>
