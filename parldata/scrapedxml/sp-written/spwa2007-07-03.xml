  <p>The curriculum in Scotland is not based on statutory prescription. It is for schools, in the light of the curriculum framework within which they operate, to determine how best they organise the syllabus.</p>

  <p>However, I can confirm that there are no plans to include intelligent design as part of the Curriculum for Excellence review. There is no evidence from HM Inspectorate of Education to suggest intelligent design is being taught in school science classes.</p>

  <p>Formal statistics of participation in higher education are not available for the whole of this period. Nevertheless, the history of Scotland is of a country that has been a world leader in educational innovation and participation over many centuries and it is the ambition of this Government to build upon that strong foundation.</p>

  <p>The combined outstanding debt held as student loans for those students who opted to fully or partly add their liability to their student loan for the three cohorts is &pound;26,306,720. <br /> The total amount repaid by students to the Student Loans Company (SLC) for graduate endowment loan debt is &pound;57,000. <br /> This is a correction to the earlier answer to this parliamentary question given by Fiona Hyslop MSP on 17 July 2007. I have written to Ms McKelvie to say that the Students Award Agency for Scotland (SAAS) has apologised for their mistake. My letter has been lodged with the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 43380).</p>
