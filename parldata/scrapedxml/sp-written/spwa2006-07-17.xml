  <p>Youth theatre is supported through a variety of sources, the Scottish Arts Council (SAC), local authorities, a number of lottery distributors (including SAC) and charitable trusts. There are also some privately run youth theatres.</p>

  <p>Youth theatre is often an integrated part of an arts organisation&rsquo;s work. For example, the Lyceum Theatre, Dundee Rep and Perth Theatre all have youth theatre groups. Therefore it is not possible to draw out the level of funding directed towards the youth theatre element of these organisations work.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Arts Council provides revenue funding to two organisations which are specifically involved in supporting youth theatre: Scottish Youth Theatre and Promote YT &ndash; the national network membership organisation for youth theatres and other organisations developing performing arts by young people. In 2005-06 and 2006-07, Promote YT was awarded &pound;50,000 per annum by SAC. Scottish Youth Theatre was similarly awarded &pound;113,403 in 2005-06 and &pound;116,340 in 2006-07 as core funding.</p>

  <p>Youth theatre has been supported by a number of the lottery distributors including the Scottish Arts Council, Awards for All, the New Opportunities Fund and the Community Fund (now the Big Lottery Fund). Details of funding from each of these organisations are held by the respective organisations.</p>

  <p>Research commissioned by the Scottish Arts Council in 2001 revealed that 14 youth theatres had benefited from SAC Lottery funding and 15 had received funding from another Lottery source (NOF, Community Fund and Awards for All).</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not earmark specific funding for youth theatre within the Scottish Arts Council&rsquo;s grant-in-aid. However, the SAC has indicated that it intends to continue its funding commitment to Scottish Youth Theatre and Promote YT, together with continuing support for theatres which provide a youth theatre service, subject to compliance with its funding conditions.</p>

  <p>Youth theatre can include a diverse and eclectic range of activity, such as musical theatre, dance theatre, site-specific productions and use of multimedia in performance. The Scottish Arts Council supports the definition offered by Promote YT:</p>

  <p>Promote YT recognises Youth Theatre as a unique form of theatre practice which:</p>

  <p>engages children and young people as active participants in the creative process;</p>

  <p>The role of Creative and Cultural Skills (CCS), the UK sector skills council for the creative and cultural industries, is to be the independent industry-led voice of its sectors, working with employers, employees and the self-employed to identify skills and productivity needs, the action they will take to meet those needs, and how they will collaborate with funding bodies and providers of education and training. Therefore the Executive has not made and would not expect to make any representations to CCS about how it should allocate its own budget. The Executive will continue to discuss with CCS its work in Scotland as it develops its Sector Skills Agreement.</p>

  <p>The Executive looks to progress compulsory purchases orders timeously and without undue delay.</p>

  <p>In coming to a decision on the confirmation of a Compulsory Purchase Order, Ministers must carefully assess each case to ensure that a purchase by compulsory powers is soundly based in law and can be justified in the particular circumstances of that case. This may result in the acquiring authority being asked to supply further information, prior to referral to the Scottish Executive Inquiry Reporters Unit, resulting in the process becoming more prolonged.</p>

  <p>Where an inquiry is necessary, the consideration of the case by a reporter is bound by the statutory timescales contained in the Compulsory Purchase by Public Authorities (Inquiries Procedure) (Scotland) Rules 1998.</p>

  <p>Information from 2002 onwards is set out in the following table. It would only be possible to provide a breakdown of the data prior to this date at disproportionate cost.</p>

  <p>The information covers specialist staff employed by media and communications (M&amp;C) Division. &quot;Communications&quot; data covers staff previously known as &quot;Press&quot; officers. The figures include any external secondees from the roster agencies working directly with M&amp;C. There are currently five in Marketing and Public Relations. The secondment programme commenced in autumn 2003.</p>

  <p>Staff in post figures are shown as a 1 January snapshot each year and also include the position as at 1 July 2006.</p>
