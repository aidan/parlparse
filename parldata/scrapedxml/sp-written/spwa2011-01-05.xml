  <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service has advised that between 26 November 2010 and 12 December 2010 they responded to 3,231 incidents where the dispatch code was recorded as falls. This compares with 1,306 over the same period in 2009, and represents an increase of 147% reflecting the earlier severe winter weather compared to last year.</p>
