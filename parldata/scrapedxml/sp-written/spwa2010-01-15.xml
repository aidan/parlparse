  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will consider investigating the practices identified in the Soil Association&rsquo;s report, <em>Soil Carbon and Organic Farming: A review of the evidence on the relationship between agriculture and soil carbon sequestration, and how organic farming can contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation</em> , as a means of helping Scotland meet its emissions reduction targets.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government welcomes the Soil Association&rsquo;s report. It is a useful contribution to the debate, and evidence base, informing the implementation of our Farming for a Better Climate (FBC) action plan ( <a href="http://www.farmingforabetterclimate.org" target="_blank">www.farmingforabetterclimate.org</a> ). FBC focuses on mitigation measures which can be delivered on-farm and which deliver &quot;win-wins&quot; &ndash; good for the farming business and good for the environment, including carbon sequestration. As part of the policy making process, officials plan to meet with Soil Association Scotland colleagues to discuss the detail of the report, and its relevance for Scotland.</p>

  <p>The rules for CAP payment reductions under cross-compliance are laid down in European legislation. In general breaches of cross-compliance should result in a reduction of 3% being applied to a beneficiaries payments for one year under the Single Farm Payment Scheme, Scottish Beef Calf Scheme, Energy Crop Scheme, Protein Crop Premium, Less Favoured Area Support Scheme and certain management options claimed under the Land Managers Options Scheme and Rural Priorities.</p>

  <p>Prior to 2009, most breaches of cross-compliance in Scotland were resulting in a 1% reduction or a warning letter as this was considered to be appropriate for the seriousness of the breaches that were being found. We have now been forced to increase the payment reduction levels under cross-compliance because recent EC audits in Scotland, the UK and across Europe, have ruled the current penalty systems too lenient.</p>

  <p>These increases must be implemented to avoid potential, costly penalties on the Scottish Government from the EU which could have a detrimental and unjust effect on the level of funds available to all farmers and other land managers. The cross-compliance payment reduction systems in England, Wales and Northern Ireland were also tightened up in 2009 following their EC audits.</p>

  <p>Stakeholders were alerted to the review of payment reduction levels in January 2009, following the audits in England and Wales in 2008. We had meetings with them and kept in touch as the review progressed. The revised cross-compliance payment reduction system was discussed with stakeholders at a meeting on 5 November 2009, prior to writing to land managers later that month.</p>

  <p>The scoring benchmarks under the Rural Priorities element of the Scotland Rural Development Programme are agreed by a national committee, in advance of regional assessment committee meetings, and are intended as a guide for the regional committees.</p>

  <p>Regional committees retain the discretion, in exceptional circumstances, to approve cases below the threshold, or reject cases above the threshold, taking account of the full range of local circumstances.</p>

  <p>Individual applicants can obtain information on request from their case officer, on scoring thresholds, and how their own case was scored.</p>

  <p>To date we have not received any request to publish the national thresholds, but would be happy to do so.</p>

  <p>The Regional Proposal Assessment Committee (RPAC) system only relates to the Rural Priorities element of the Scotland Rural Development Programme (SRDP). We endeavour to make decisions on RPAC recommendations as soon as possible after the final committee has sat. However, there are a number of internal procedures to be followed in order to collate and validate the accuracy of the figures before the recommendations can be considered. As the recommendations from all regions are considered by the Scottish Government within the same timescale, there is no regional breakdown of the figures.</p>

  <p>The following table sets out, for each round, the date of the last RPAC meeting and the date of the formal announcement of the results.</p>

  <p>We are not able to report average contract issue times for each region. We issue contracts for successful Rural Priorities applications as soon as possible after approval is given. The time taken to issue contracts can be affected by a number of factors, including the complexity of the case, the accuracy of the information provided by the applicant and changes to payment rates. In such cases, officials remain in contact with applicants to keep them informed of the situation.</p>

  <p>Any applicant with concerns should speak to their case officer in the first instance.</p>

  <p>The consideration of all supporting documentation is an integral part of the project assessment process. All applications for grant are considered within the published framework and timescales for the assessment of applications. These timescales may vary due to the size and complexity of cases.

  <p>The Scottish Government through the Marine (Scotland) Bill will introduce a completely new seal licence system for Scotland. This new system will include consideration of the use of existing non-lethal measures (i.e. anti-predator nets and acoustic deterrent devices) and their effectiveness. It is intended that seal licences should in normal circumstances be granted only where non-lethal measures are not effective. This will ensure lethal measures will be licensed as a last resort.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is researching best practice in non-lethal measures in order to be able to identify effective technology, which does not cause harm to other marine species such as cetaceans. The intention is that this should inform the requirement of the seal licensing system on non-lethal alternatives, including best practice and minimum standards.</p>

  <p>The geographic areas covered by city regions in Scotland are not uniquely defined. For example, the former Cities Growth Fund (the funding for which is no longer earmarked and, since 1 April 2008, has been included within the General Capital Grant paid by the Scottish Government to local authorities in Scotland) allocated funding directly to the councils containing the six formally designated cities in Scotland (Aberdeen City Council for Aberdeen, Dundee City Council for Dundee, the City of Edinburgh Council for Edinburgh, Glasgow City Council for Glasgow, Highland Council for Inverness and Stirling Council for Stirling). These authorities, in consultation with others including local communities and neighbouring authorities, each then drew up a published city vision plan to allocate funding within what each determined was the appropriate city region for their area.</p>

  <p>The First Minister signed a joint statement on climate change with President Nasheed of the Maldives while in Copenhagen. The text of the statement reads:</p>

  <p>Joint Statement on Climate Change from the Scottish Government and the Government of the Maldives.</p>

  <p>We agree that:</p>

  <p>Climate change is the most serious environmental challenge faced by the global community, posing an urgent and far-reaching threat to individuals and communities across the world.</p>

  <p>The effects of climate change will be felt most acutely by people who are already in vulnerable situations because of various factors, including geography. This threat is particularly pronounced in many of the Island Nations of the world, typified by the Maldives.</p>

  <p>Addressing climate change can deliver significant economic, social and environmental benefits. The creation of quality jobs through the transition to a low-carbon economy represents a major economic opportunity.</p>

  <p>Action on climate change should centre on mitigation (reducing greenhouse gas emissions), adaptation (resilience to changes in the climate) and communication (of climate change messages).</p>

  <p>The action taken by both the Maldives and Scotland in terms of action and legislation exemplifies the types of measures necessary to meet the serious threats posed by climate change to our nations.</p>

  <p>Scotland will:</p>

  <p>Promote and support implementation of the Climate Change (Scotland) Act, which reflects international best practice in setting mitigation targets by covering all the internationally recognised greenhouse gases and emissions from international aviation and shipping with a 2020 interim target of 42% emissions cuts towards an ultimate goal of 80% emissions reductions by 2050.</p>

  <p>Help Scotland deliver its responsibilities for providing advice and information, and sharing its collective knowledge and expertise, as part of international assistance and co-operation in meeting the global challenge of climate change. An example of this is in relation to Scotland&rsquo;s Climate Change Adaptation Framework, which offers a model for a strategic approach for integrating adaptation at a national level, with the potential for knowledge transfer on capacity-building.</p>

  <p>The Maldives will:</p>

  <p>Promote and support implementation of the Maldives own climate change programme, including a target to be carbon neutral within ten years, adaptation, renewable energy and research.</p>

  <p>Together we will:</p>

  <p>Recognise the potential of the low-carbon economy of the future.</p>

  <p>Work together to communicate the urgency of global action to tackle climate change and for agreement at Copenhagen demonstrating the action that needs to be taken as a matter of urgency.</p>

  <p>Undertake to develop and deepen the relationship between our nations and the need to further co-operate in meeting the challenges and opportunities posed by climate change.</p>

  <p>First Minister Alex Salmond, Scotland.</p>

  <p>President Mohamed Nasheed, Republic of Maldives.</p>

  <p>There is no specific staffing provision to work on co-operation with the Maldives Government on climate change during 2010. The Scottish European Green Energy Centre in Aberdeen is engaging with the Maldives on renewable energy, and support for this programme will be provided by existing resources, primarily from the Business, Enterprise and Energy Directorate, with additional support as appropriate from the Climate Change and Water Industry Directorate and the Culture, External Affairs and Tourism Directorate.</p>

  <p>The government economic strategy is the overarching strategy that focuses the activity of government, and the public sector in its widest sense, on increasing sustainable economic growth and on addressing the long-term gap in Scotland&rsquo;s economic growth performance compared to many of its competitors. Progress against the government economic strategy is measured through a set of challenging long-term targets.</p>

  <p>The economic recovery plan is firmly rooted within the government economic strategy, and through the economic recovery plan the Scottish Government is ensuring that every area of government activity supports our commitments to deliver economic recovery and long-term sustainable growth by: supporting jobs and our communities; strengthening Scotland&rsquo;s education and skills, and investing in innovation and the industries of the future. Estimates of the number of jobs supported by the actions within the economic recovery plan, including the accelerated capital spending programme, are contained within the <em>Economic Recovery Plan: Update</em> document published on 29 October 2009.</p>

  <p>Although a thaw is now taking place in many parts of Scotland, there is currently no indication that the rate of thawing will result in severe flooding problems. Nevertheless, people should heed the advice on SEPA&rsquo;s website and be prepared for flooding. SEPA&rsquo;s flood warning staff continue to work closely with the Met Office and people should look out for any flood watches or warnings which may be issued on SEPA&rsquo;s Floodline service. In response to the severe weather, the Scottish Government has convened its resilience room, and all strategic co-ordinating groups are providing updates on potential flooding problems.</p>

  <p>Where orthoptists are not available, it is the responsibility of NHS boards to make the most appropriate local arrangements to carry out pre-school vision screening. These arrangements should be made based on clinical effectiveness, availability of and ease of access to other health professionals, including optometrists.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government Health Directorate will shortly issue a Chief Executive Letter (CEL) to reinforce the recommendations for implementation contained in <em>Health for all children 4: Guidance on Implementation in Scotland</em> and this will include further advice on the actions required by NHS boards to find solutions to vision screening issues where no orthoptist screening programme is achievable locally in the short term.</p>

  <p>The HAI Task Force considered a detailed paper prepared by Health Protection Scotland (HPS) at its meetings on 30 September 2009 and 8 December 2009, and a copy of the paper has been placed in Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 50022). The Task Force concluded there would be no defined public health benefit at this time in establishing a norovirus reference laboratory for Scotland and that the position should be kept under review.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to predict how frequently the exception in section 85(1)(b) of the Scottish Marine Bill will be disapplied as part of the marine conservation order process. Scottish Ministers do not intend to disapply section 85(1)(b) as a matter of course and would require a good case for such action. Such disapplication would require the consent of Parliament.</p>

  <p>The generation of marine renewable energy is a priority for the Scottish Government, as is the conservation of marine biodiversity and cultural heritage. The Scottish Marine Bill provides for a planning regime that takes all these priorities into account. I believe it is right that the Scottish Government and Parliament should have this power to protect important marine features, even if the power is very rarely exercised.</p>

  <p>A marine licence will only be suspended, revoked or varied, if through compliance monitoring or a complaint, Marine Scotland believes that a breach has been made. If it is not an emergency situation the licensee may be asked to temporarily suspend operations and to provide a response before any final decision is taken. All licensees will be kept fully informed through dialogue and in writing of the reasons why a licence has been varied, suspended or revoked.</p>

  <p>Decisions on the suspension, revocation or variation of a licence under section 23 will be taken on evidence. All decisions taken by Marine Scotland and the evidence on which they are based will be subject to public scrutiny through the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 and The Environmental Information (Scotland) Regulations 2004. Also, the Marine Bill provides for a right of appeal under section 52.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Ministers are committed to producing guidance on the new marine licence application process. However, it is expected that in practice the process will involve continuous dialogue between the applicant and Marine Scotland before a licensing decision is reached. In addition, all applicants will be informed in writing of the reasons why an application has been refused or of the conditions that are to be attached to a marine licence.</p>

  <p>Safer road design, improved speed management, continued maintenance and a better provision for vulnerable road users are amongst the steps being taken to reduce numbers of injuries and fatalities on Scotland&rsquo;s roads. Transport Scotland assesses the safety performance of the trunk road network on an annual basis by screening all locations where three or more accidents have occurred in a three year period. Further investigations are carried out and where appropriate, mitigation measures are installed.

  <p>Subject to completing the necessary statutory process, it is hoped to seek suitably qualified contractors in 2010-11. However, the Orders require to be approved by Parliament and assuming that is given, we would need to review the remaining stages of the project, including procurement, before issuing a definitive timetable. We expect construction to start in 2011.</p>

  <p>The requirements for clearing snow and gritting pavements and footpaths on the A77 trunk road is set out in paragraph 8.1.5 and appendix 8 of Amey&rsquo;s Winter Service Plan which is available on the Transport Scotland website at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk/files/documents/roads/SW_Winter_Plan_2009_-_2010.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk/files/documents/roads/SW_Winter_Plan_2009_-_2010.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p>The sections of footway on the A77 at High Street, Maybole and two sections of Dalrymple Street, Girvan are assigned as Category &quot;A&quot;. These sections were treated on 22, 23 and 24 December.</p>

  <p>The remainder of the footways in Maybole and Girvan, together with those in Ballantrae, Lendalfoot, Kirkoswald and Minishant are assigned as either Category &quot;B&quot; or &quot;C&quot; and should be cleared within two hours of snowfall ceasing during the period 06.00 hours and 18.00 hours. However, as snowfall continued between midnight on 21 December and midnight on 24 December, no clearing of snow from these pavements and footpaths was undertaken.</p>

  <p>In order to provide consistent advice to the UK&rsquo;s main salt suppliers, which supply to councils and trunk road operators across the UK, a &quot;UK Salt Cell&quot; has been established. The UK Salt Cell brings together the Department for Transport (Chair), the Scottish Government, the Welsh Assembly Government, Transport Scotland, the Highways Agency, COSLA, the Local Government Association and other relevant agencies and departments. It meets twice-weekly to monitor the salt supply and delivery position across the UK, and to advise suppliers on the most effective distribution of available salt supplies. To support that process, Scottish Government officials are also in regular contact with Department for Transport and colleagues.</p>

  <p>I have asked Barry White, Chief Executive of the Scottish Futures Trust, to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>To maximise its impact, the Scottish Futures Trust (SFT) has been involved in a large number of discussions with a very wide range of public and private organisations across Scotland and internationally. To date SFT have had discussions with all 32 Scottish local authorities, seven area health boards, Scottish Government agencies such as Transport Scotland, Scottish Water, and with individual companies as well as with industry representative bodies such as CBI Scotland, Chambers of Commerce and the Scottish Building Federation.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers support the introduction of any innovation that has the potential to save lives. Product safety matters are reserved to Westminster and the introduction of reduced ignition propensity (RIP) cigarettes must be done within the European legal framework. There is currently no European standard for this product type. However, on 29 November 2007, EU member states endorsed the European Commission&rsquo;s plan to draw up a standard. The European Standards Body (CEN) is now working to develop a harmonised standard. Although Scottish ministers would support the early introduction of RIP cigarettes, no action can be taken until CEN produces this standard. I have written to Mr Shahid Malik MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary, <strong>Department for Communities and Local Government,</strong> offering the support of the Scottish Government to ensure that manufacturers are required to meet this new standard as soon as possible. Scottish Government officials have also been working with the chief fire and rescue adviser to the Westminster Government and have been invited to comment on a draft ISO standard for testing these products to ensure that they self extinguish.</p>

  <p>In line with the partnership working set out in the concordat, the Scottish Government is in regular contact with our local government partners to discuss a range of financial pressures on their budgets, including the recent severe winter weather, and consider how these can be accommodated. We will continue to work collaboratively with all councils to try to assist with any difficulties they have.</p>
