  <p>An accurate assessment of spend on hospital buildings is not maintained centrally. However, the capital budget, including capital receipts, available to NHS Scotland in each year was as follows:</p>

  <p>A proportion of each year&#146;s budget was allocated on a formula basis to NHS trusts for routine maintenance, achievement of statutory standards, the purchase of small items of equipment and small capital projects such as ward upgrades. The amounts allocated under these heads range from &#163;54 million to &#163;90 million. The balance in each year has been allocated by Scottish Executive Health Department in support of business cases for buildings and equipment.</p>

  <p>In addition to NHS capital, hospital buildings with a capital cost of &#163;469 million have been provided by the private sector. The annual cost to NHS Scotland for the provision of these fully maintained facilities (the annual unitary charge) was:</p>

  <p>Employers are obliged to comply with the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 and the Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 in the running of their premises. Health and safety legislation includes requirements to protect the public outwith the premises as well as those within. However, health and safety matters are reserved.</p>

  <p>Scottish planning controls, namely the Planning Hazardous Substances consent regime, relate to the storage of specified hazardous substances or categories of hazardous substance above specified quantity related thresholds.</p>

  <p>In addition, it is open to planning authorities, when determining planning applications for new physical development or changes of use of sites that involve the storage or placement of flammable or otherwise dangerous materials in proximity to a railway line or siding, to consider whether the potential risk or impact of an accident is a material consideration in the determination of such applications.</p>

  <p>Where the storage or placement of flammable or otherwise dangerous materials is part of a process or activity subject to control under either Part 1 of the Environment Protection Act 1990 or the Pollution, Prevention and Control Regulations 2000, then conditions can be attached to the authorisation/permit by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency aimed at preventing accidents and minimising the consequences for the environment.</p>

  <p>The Executive has no current plans to introduce legislation in relation to these matters.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how much in real terms the reduction of &#163;5 million in the budget for providing the services and support that people need, as detailed in the social justice section of its spending proposals for 2003-06, will be in 2004-05.</p>

  <p>The real terms reduction in budget for providing the services and support that people need in 2004-05 compared to 2003-04 is approximately 19%. The reduction arises from the completion of the Refuge Development Fund, a three-year programme of capital expenditure to provide accommodation for the victims of domestic abuse. The resources that were available to the fund in 2003-04 have been re-allocated to decommissioning the Glasgow hostels in 2004-05 and 2005-06.</p>

  <p>We have commissioned consultants to help us develop a major events strategy for Scotland. Their report is expected this month and, following consultation with the Major Events Steering Group, we expect to announce the form of our major events strategy later this year. The details of the various types of events on which the strategy may focus will be worked up once this announcement has been made.</p>

  <p>I have placed a copy of the research report (Bib. number 24369) and questionnaire (Bib. number 24368) on the Scottish Executive&#146;s road safety campaign Foolsspeed in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre. The report is titled <i>Changing speeding behaviour in Scotland: An evaluation of the &quot;Foolsspeed&quot; campaign</i> .</p>

  <p>This five-year campaign began in 1999 after a baseline survey in November 1998. Follow-up surveys were conducted in spring 1999, spring 2000 and summer 2001. The research, carried out by the Centre for Social Marketing, University of Strathclyde found &quot;robust evidence that the campaign was associated with a change in attitudes towards speeding&quot;.</p>
