  <p>The children of asylum seekers and refugees have, in principle, the same access to pre-school education as other children of pre-school age, resident in a local authority area. In academic year 2001-02, pre-school year children will be eligible for grant-funded education if they were born between 1 March 1997 and 28 February 1998. Children aged three will be eligible from the start of the term after their third birthday. Local authorities currently have the power to provide nursery education for all such children and from 1 April 2002 will be under a duty to secure this.</p>

  <p>The information requested cannot be broken down by local authority area. Local authorities advise that there are about 23,000 council houses in Scotland with no form of central heating. Scottish Homes figures show that there are about 6,000 housing association properties without central heating. We estimate that there are 40,000 over 60s households in the private sector across Scotland without heating or with a heating system which is broken down and beyond repair. Householders in the private sector can choose from a range of gas, electric, oil or solid fuel systems, subject to constraints of cost and practicability. Tenants in the social rented sector have the same choice where it is reasonable and practicable for the landlord to do so. The programme will be widened in 2004 so that 20,000 local authority dwellings can be upgraded from partial central heating systems to whole-house systems. The Executive is investing &#163;26 million in 2001-02, &#163;30 million in 2002-03 and &#163;40 million in 2003-04. Resources will also come from the investment produced by community ownership and from the energy companies under their Energy Efficiency Commitment.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s general guidance on the making of Patient Group Directions does not set criteria for directions on particular subjects. An NHS board would be expected to take into consideration all relevant factors, including the range of views expressed in any consultation and any specific guidance on a particular subject. The Executive is not aware of any board intending to make a direction in respect of school nurses and emergency contraception. The Executive is currently considering the content of specific guidance for use in any such case.</p>

  <p>Our policy statement, &quot;Renewing Mental Health Law&quot; is being published today and copies have been placed in SPICe. The statement sets out our proposals for a new legislative framework, designed to respond to the needs, rights and aspirations of people in Scotland who use mental health services, as well as their carers and families.</p>

  <p>Our proposals reflect the great majority of the Millan Committee&#8217;s recommendations, and were informed by the views of the Mental Health Legislation Reference Group, which we set up as a source of advice and expertise and by the consultative events arranged with interests in the mental health field.</p>

  <p>For the first time, mental health law will be based on explicit principles, reflecting concepts of equality, fairness and respect for service users and carers. A new mental health tribunal will be established, offering greater scrutiny of compulsory care, and the rights of patients will be strengthened, while having full regard to issues of public safety.</p>

  <p>As already announced, a new Mental Health Bill will be brought to the Scottish Parliament early next year, giving Scotland, when enacted, modern legislation, which reflects the priority the Scottish Executive has accorded to mental health.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-17478 by Sarah Boyack on 28 August 2001, why it would not provide the cost of the Booz Allen and Hamilton study into rail links to Glasgow and Edinburgh airports on the grounds that it is commercially restricted information when an estimated cost of the study was provided in the answer to question S1W-10834 on 1 December 2000.</p>

  <p>My answer to question S1W-17478 was given at the time when the Scottish Executive was in the process of inviting bids to undertake a detailed study into rail links to Glasgow and Edinburgh airports. This study will build on work carried out previously by Booz, Allen and Hamilton and their report formed an integral part of the tender document. Consequently, it was considered inappropriate to reveal the final cost of the Booz, Allen and Hamilton study as this could have influenced the tenders received.</p>

  <p>My answer to question S1W-10834 gave an indicative figure of the possible final cost.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many traffic incidents on the A90 from the Forth Road bridge to Cramond bridge have been related to the installation of traffic lights for the bus lane.</p>

  <p>The A90 between the Forth Road bridge and Cramond bridge is classified as a local road. Traffic management and road safety measures on that section of road are therefore matters for the City of Edinburgh Council.</p>

  <p>Data about injury road accidents are collected by the police and reported to the Scottish Executive using the STATS 19 statistical report form. These returns cover only road accidents in which one or more people were injured: they do not cover damage-only accidents.</p>

  <p>The traffic lights for the bus lane on the southbound side of the A90 came into operation on 1 August 2000. STATS 19 returns have so far been received for nine months since that date. The returns for those nine months show that 15 injury road accidents were identified as occurring on the A90 between the Forth Road bridge and Cramond bridge. The returns do not provide information about the causes of the accidents, nor do they distinguish between accidents on the southbound lanes and those on the northbound.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that this figure is based upon the data which are held in the central statistical database and which were collected by the police at the time of the accident and subsequently reported to the Executive. They may differ from any figures which the local authority would provide now, because they do not take account of any subsequent changes or corrections that the local authority may have made to the statistical information, for use at local level, about the location of each accident, based upon its knowledge of the road and area concerned.</p>

  <p>Guidance on safety in outdoor activity centres was issued to local authorities and independent schools by the Scottish Office Education Department in October 1994. While aimed primarily at safety in outdoor activity centres it was made clear that the guidance was also relevant when planning visits to centres which provide other educationally related activities away from normal school premises.</p>

  <p>It is the responsibility of local authorities, as employers, to ensure that a wide range of continuing professional development opportunities are available for teachers.</p>

  <p>This should include a range of activities that ensures teachers are well equipped to fulfil their responsibilities, outside the school environment as well as within it.</p>

  <p>It is for the local authorities and schools to ensure that appropriate steps are taken for the arrangement and oversight of school trips taking account of guidance which is available and previous experience in this area.</p>

  <p>I shall, however, continue to review whether there is a need to update existing guidance, or further promote best practice.</p>

  <p>It has not been suggested to us that there is a lack of clarity in Scotland concerning the legal duties to children and parents, of schools and local authorities in respect of school trips. This has not, therefore, been under specific review.</p>
