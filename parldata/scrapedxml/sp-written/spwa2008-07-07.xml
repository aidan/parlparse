  <p>In August 2007, NHS 24 set up an online inquiry service for people seeking health information advice. The numbers of emails received each month are set out in the following table:</p>

  <p><table width="50%" border="BORDER" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#CCCCCC">

<td width="31%" align="right" valign="top"> 277</td>

</table></p>

  <p>As part of the continued development of their online service, NHS 24 has recently introduced a facility to enable people to respond to NHS 24 via the feedback form on <a href="http://www.nhs24.com" target="_blank">www.nhs24.com</a>. The monitoring of the number of emails received through this channel began in January 2008 and figures are detailed in the following table:</p>

  <p><table width="50%" border="BORDER" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#CCCCCC">
<tr>
<td width="64%" align="center" valign="top"> Month</td>
<td width="36%" align="center" valign="top"> Emails</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td width="64%" valign="top"> May 2008</td>
<td width="36%" align="right" valign="top"> 64</td>
</tr>
</table></p>

  <p>The average response time to emails is 1.8 days for online enquiries and 0.9 days for website feedback.</p>

  <p>Complaints to NHS 24 are not routinely received directly via email and are not recorded separately from other complaints. Email complaints are accepted, but would require postal address details to allow the complaint to be processed in line with NHS 24 security protocols. A complaint received via email would be managed within the standard complaints procedure and would be acknowledged in writing within three working days. A full response should be given within 20 working days.</p>

  <p>However, as part of an on-going process to improve public accessibility to NHS 24 services, the website was redesigned in 2007 at a cost of &pound;36,687.</p>

  <p>The Beauly Denny public inquiry, the largest in Scotland since devolution, started on 6 February 2007 with public hearings concluding in 20 December 2007.</p>

  <p>The inquiry reporters are now preparing their report, which is not expected until the end of 2008.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers will consider the reporters findings in reaching their determination and therefore a decision may be expected in 2009.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-7851 by Shona Robison on 14 January 2008, what measures would be required to transfer responsibility for test purchasing and monitoring underage alcohol sales from the police to trading standards officers and whether it will consider introducing such measures in the interest of more efficient and cost-effective policing of underage sales of both tobacco and alcohol.</p>

  <p>Primary legislation to amend the provisions of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005 would be required to give trading standards officers such a responsibility. As emphasised during the Scottish Parliament debate on alcohol on 25 June 2008, the Scottish Government is keen to ensure everything possible is done to ensure the effective enforcement of licensing law. We are currently exploring with COSLA and the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland, therefore, the scope for giving trading standards officers a role, alongside the police, in the enforcement of the law in relation to off-sales and, more specifically, in the organisation and execution of test purchasing programmes.</p>
