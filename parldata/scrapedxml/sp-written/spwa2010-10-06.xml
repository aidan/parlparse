  <p>Four carbon capture and storage (CCS) demonstration projects will be supported by the CCS Levy under the Energy Act 2010, with potential co-financing from the European Union under the New Entrants Reserve competition.</p>

  <p>One of these four demonstration projects will be the UK CCS competition winner. The two remaining bids for funding from this competition are Scottish Power at Longannet and E.ON at Kingsnorth in Kent. The competition winner will be selected next year.</p>

  <p>Under the Energy Act 2010, the UK Government is required to consult Scottish ministers on wider programmes to support further CCS demonstration projects with the CCS Levy. The Scottish Government is working closely with the UK Government on this wider programme, including making representations that CCS should be demonstrated on a gas plant as well as on coal.</p>

  <p>Sites chosen for demonstration of CCS will be dependent on the projects which are successful in both the UK and EU competitive processes, and on projects securing the necessary permits to safely capture, transport and store carbon dioxide.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises the potential seriousness of any such incident in both environmental and economic terms. Because of such concerns the First Minister wrote to the Prime Minister suggesting that a major oil spill exercise be held as soon as possible in order to both identify and learn from the lessons arising. This exercise will now be held in the spring and the Scottish Government will be participating to its full extent.</p>

  <p>We continue to monitor the situation and welcome the setting up of the Oil Spill Prevention and Response Advisory Group (OSPRAG) and the UK Government&rsquo;s moves to increase its inspection of drilling rigs and monitoring of offshore compliance through the recruitment of additional inspectors.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will host a seminar on the lessons that the UK can learn from oil spills at Victoria Quay on 5 October 2010. This event will bring together then UK Spill Association, the Emergency Planning Society, the UK Government and Scottish Government.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has consistent data, collected by Oil and Gas UK, which estimate that 33,800 people are directly employed by the sector with 73% of those in Scotland. Clearly, this suggests that any moratorium could impact significantly in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The UK Energy and Climate Change Committee are conducting a short inquiry into UK deepwater drilling to find out about the safety and environmental regulations of oil and gas operations on the UK continental shelf and the potential positive and negative impacts of a moratorium on deepwater drilling. We will be monitoring the committee&rsquo;s deliberations closely.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not provide funding to support investment in grid capacity. Investment in grid infrastructure is regulated by Ofgem, the UK energy regulator. Ofgem administer a price control regime to ensure electricity network operators can develop effective and efficient grid capacity, while protecting the interests of consumers.</p>
