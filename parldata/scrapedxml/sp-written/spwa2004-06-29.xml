  <p>Advance notice of pesticide usage is a legal requirement when aerial spraying of crops takes place.

  <p>The business case for investment in an air service between Inverness and Stockholm was prepared by aviation consultants, AviaSolutions, in conjunction with Highlands and Islands Airports Ltd and Snowflake. The analysis of demand indicated that there was potential for a limited frequency with a 72-seater aircraft service. The Executive's Route Development Fund (RDF) cannot prescribe the aircraft to be used in any service. It is up to the operator to ensure that the operational characteristics of any service match the assessed market.</p>

  <p>The Inverness to Stockholm route demonstrated the need for public sector investment to share some of the risks associated with the establishment of this air service. Once new routes commence with RDF support airports and airlines should work closely to understand how the routes are performing and whether any actions are necessary to improve performance. The Executive is always willing to support this process, to help ensure the long-term success of new routes.</p>

  <p>Discussions with Skye Bridge Limited have begun. Our aim is to end the discredited toll regime by the end of the year.</p>

  <p>The Executive's report <em>Comparative Study of Business Tax Revenue</em> estimated that the revenue raised from business transport taxes in Scotland was equal to 1.1% of GDP in 2000 compared to 1.4% for the UK as a whole. These figures follow the definition of business transport taxes used by the Confederation of British Industry and includes vehicle excise duty and fuel excise duty paid by businesses.</p>

  <p>Vehicle duty and excise fuel duty rates are set at the UK level and these rates do not vary across the regions of the UK. Therefore, differences in total business transport tax revenues, relative to GDP, will in part reflect differences in usage patterns in terms of vehicles and fuel consumption across UK regions not differences in rates.</p>

  <p>Section 37 of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 sets out the provisions by which all planning applications must be determined. Under the provisions of this legislation, it is not necessary for other consents to be in place before planning permission can be granted. Any grant of planning permission does not remove the need to seek other statutory consents nor does it imply that such consents will be forthcoming.</p>

  <p>Crematoria are subject to the waste management regime set out in the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and related legislation. The regulatory authority for this regime is the Scottish Environment Protection Agency.</p>

  <p>These sources do not distinguish people seeking to rent council or housing association property in their area for the first time. Information from local authorities relates to the council as a whole and does not provide separate information for rural areas within the council area. Similarly, information gathered from each housing association does not separately identify rural from other areas served by the association.</p>

  <p>The Executive does not have statistical information on numbers wishing to purchase or to rent privately.</p>

  <p>In preparing local housing strategies councils assess local housing markets to, among other things, identify actual or potential shortages with the aim of developing strategies to address these. The review of affordable housing currently being undertaken by the Executive includes an assessment of shortages based on the available information, which will inform policy proposals.</p>

  <p>There are no regulations relating to the development of new housing on brownfield land. However, it is well established policy to promote the re-use of previously developed land in preference to development on greenfield sites, where appropriate, to encourage a sustainable approach to new development and to meet social and environmental justice objectives. <em>Scottish Planning Policy 3: Planning for Housing</em> restates this policy in relation to the development of new housing, provided that a satisfactory residential environment can be created. Policy does not rule out the development of greenfield sites in specified circumstances.</p>

  <p>No specific research has been carried out in relation to the costs involved for housing on brownfield land, although we appreciate that there can be particular costs depending on the circumstances. Funding mechanisms are in place to encourage the rehabilitation of vacant and derelict land.</p>

  <p>Average income estimates are not currently available at local authority level.</p>

  <p>Research is currently underway to consider the methodological issues lying behind the main sources of income data for Scotland. Subject to quality assurance, this research may lead to future analysis of incomes, below the Scotland level. The research is due to report by the end of this month.</p>

  <p>The Office of National Statistics have produced model-based ward level average income estimates. These are the first results from a small area estimation project and there are concerns about the quality of the results for Scottish wards, in part due to differences in data availability for Scotland. As such the results, which relate to 1998-99, should be treated as experimental.</p>

  <p>Insufficient information was received from the Scottish public bodies for the period 11 October 1999 to 31 March 2001 for a meaningful report to be published. However, the returns which were received showed that major contracts awarded to public relations and marketing companies had been subject to fair and open competition, and that the Scottish Executive procurement policy and best practice procedures were being followed.</p>

  <p>It would not be cost effective to undertake such an extensive trawl of Scottish public bodies on an annual basis, however the Executive propose to continue to monitor the situation on a periodic basis. Arrangements are being put in place by Human Resources Division and Scottish Procurement Directorate for a check to be carried out covering the period 1 April 2004 to 31 March 2005. The mechanism for 2004-2005 will take into account the lessons learned from the 1999-2001 exercise, to ensure that sufficient information is gathered and a meaningful report published on this occasion. It is expected that the report will be available through the Parliament's Reference Centre in summer 2005.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what system it has for assessing whether each commitment in <em>A Partnership for A Better Scotland</em> will provide value for money; who is involved in the operation of such a system, and whether any non-civil servants are involved in the operation of the system and, if so, who.</p>

  <p>I have responsibility for monitoring delivery of <em>A Partnership for a Better Scotland </em> on Cabinet's behalf and regularly meet individual portfolio ministers to discuss delivery issues. I am committed to ensuring that the Scottish Executive's expenditure delivers the best possible value to the people of Scotland.</p>

  <p>In order to support this objective, the Executive has introduced a new system under which significant new spending proposals are reviewed through &quot;Pre-Expenditure Assessments&quot;. Pre-Expenditure Assessments provide an assessment of expected impacts and value for money, and cover:</p>

  <p>the aims and objectives of the proposal;</p>

  <p>the options for addressing these objectives;</p>

  <p>the evidence base on the likely impacts and value for money of the proposal, including cost-benefit analyses where appropriate;</p>

  <p>the financial impact of the proposal, management and procurement arrangements, and</p>

  <p>the plans for monitoring and evaluation.</p>

  <p>This procedure is currently being extended to cover day-to-day spending decisions, and complements existing good practice in project appraisal.</p>

  <p>Target 2 of Sport 21 commits the Scottish Executive Education Department to make progress towards all schoolchildren taking part in at least two hours of high quality physical education classes a week by 2007.</p>

  <p>In my response to the Physical Education Review Group's report, I set out my three key aims for physical education: to provide more time, more teachers and more choice. I will issue guidance to local authorities on physical education within the context of our National Priorities planning and reporting under the 2000 Act to help monitor progress in meeting these three key aims. The report and my covering letter have been placed in the Parliament's Reference Centre (Bib. numbers 33135 and 33136 respectively)</p>

  <p>With Target 2 in mind, a National Priority performance measure has already been distributed to schools, asking them to report on activities and opportunities which encourage young people to be physically active for at least one hour per day. This measure asks schools to link this reporting to local strategies in place for progressing the Sport 21 Strategy and the Physical Activity Strategy.</p>
