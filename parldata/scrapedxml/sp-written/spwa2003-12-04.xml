  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, with reference to recommendation 19 of NHS Audiology Services in Scotland, what other professionals are being considered for further training to enable them to provide care to people in need of audiology services but unable to access them due to any shortage of audiologists in their area.</p>

  <p>The modernisation action plans, which NHS boards have been asked to prepare in relation to audiology services, will identify the functions and areas in which the training of other staff suggested in recommendation 19 might be appropriate. In rural areas, for example, this could involve the training of GP practice nurses in the fitting of hearing aid batteries. Training of this type would be delivered by staff working in the NHS board area involved.</p>

  <p>Carers play a vital role in providing services for those they care for. They receive support from various sources, including local authorities, the NHS, and voluntary bodies. The Executive is providing &pound;21 million this year to local authorities for the benefit of carers as well as &pound;250,000 to voluntary bodies providing information and support for them.</p>

  <p>Following discussions with key stakeholders we will shortly commence a formal consultation process on the concessionary fares commitments outlined in <em>A Partnership for a Better Scotland</em> . These commitments include the introduction of a national free off-peak bus scheme for older people and people with disabilities. The consultation process will run for three months and a decision will then be made on the timescale for delivery.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what progress it is making in determining the extent of illegal fishing outside European Union quotas and regulations.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency devotes significant resources to the monitoring, control and enforcement of fisheries related legislation. However, illegal activity, by its very nature is clandestine and, therefore, difficult to quantify. Nonetheless, variations in the patterns of suspected illegal landings are gauged from intelligence received by the agency through the regular monitoring of the movements and landing arrangements of fishing vessels and the reaction of fishermen when their vessels and catches are the subject of inspection.</p>

  <p>The agency's resources are utilised with the objective of deterring and detecting such illegal activity.</p>

  <p>Any job losses are regrettable but Dundee Football Club is now in administration and decisions on the future of the club are a matter for the administrators. The Executive has no direct locus and Dundee Football Club have not sought Executive assistance.</p>

  <p>Strong partnerships already exist between local enterprise companies, local authorities, Jobcentre Plus and Careers Scotland. These partners have considerable experience in responding to redundancy situations and can offer advice, support and guidance on the range of retraining, upskilling and employment opportunities.</p>

  <p>The running of football clubs is a matter for their owners and directors and in some cases their supporters and shareholders. It is for them to manage the club's resources so that the club can operate on a viable and sustainable basis. It is not for the Executive to impose this discipline on football clubs.</p>

  <p>There are 466 people on the active waiting list for an organ transplant at Scottish units, 435 of them waiting for a kidney transplant. The national UK median waiting time for a kidney is 700 days, for a heart 132 days and for a liver 70 days. The main factor affecting these waiting times is the availability of suitable donor organs.</p>

  <p>Any need for additional classrooms in particular schools, consequent on our commitment to increase teacher numbers to 53,000 by 2007, will be influenced by issues such as local school occupancy levels, future pupil numbers and effectiveness of timetabling.

  <p>Highland Council, working in partnership with Aberdeen University, is addressing its primary teacher recruitment problem by supporting students on a part-time, postgraduate certificate of education course which is being delivered on a distance learning basis. It is open to the council to make similar arrangements for secondary teachers with one of the seven universities that offer courses of initial teacher education.</p>
