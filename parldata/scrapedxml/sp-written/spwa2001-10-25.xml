  <p>Adoption can often be a complex process both for the child and the prospective adopter. To tackle this and other concerns, I established an adoption Policy Review earlier this year with the aim of modernising the system. The remit includes the recruitment, selection and assessment of prospective adopters. The first stage of the review is due to report to me by the end of November 2001.</p>

  <p>Draft National Care Standards for adoption services are currently available. Standards 24 to 37 cover the service adoptive parents and prospective adoptive parents can expect. They include requirements for prompt and comprehensive responses and decisions, and for provision of specialist support from experienced social workers.</p>

  <p>The Executive does not have a target rate for economic growth in Scotland and does not make economic forecasts.</p>

  <p>What is important is that the Executive is addressing the underlying conditions for growth and prosperity in the modern economy. We are set upon raising Scotland&#8217;s global profile, improving our connectivity, exploiting our research strengths and aligning our skills to the knowledge base. We are also taking action in relation to Scotland&#8217;s education and its infrastructure. All are critical to our longer-term economic performance and it is right to seek to improve such conditions at all times.</p>

  <p>The Standards in Scotland&#8217;s Schools etc. Act 2000 requires that local authorities provide education directed to achieving the fullest potential of the child or young person. The distribution of resources from the Executive to support local authorities takes account of rurality and deprivation indicators.

This is double the number of students who qualified last year and will boost Gaelic medium teacher numbers considerably.</p>

  <p>In addition, the current campaign to recruit more teachers includes TV advertising to coincide with Gaelic programming, advertisements in the Gaelic press and key pages of the supporting website will soon appear in the Gaelic language.</p>

  <p>We have introduced a number of measures which have simplified the system of student financial support. We have aligned the levels of support in both sectors so that students in comparable circumstances will receive the same rate of maintenance support, which will be subject to a contribution from their parents or spouse above the same income threshold.</p>

  <p>The process of applying for student support for students in higher education has also been simplified. The Student Awards Agency for Scotland has established an electronic link with the General Register Office which removes the need for most applicants to submit original birth certificates. A system of sample checking income details has reduced the volume of supporting documentation that students and their families have to provide. The agency is also developing a system which will eventually allow student support applications to be made via the internet and to be processed almost automatically. In addition, we are integrating the two existing systems of support for pre-registration nursing students.</p>

  <p>The student support system in higher education will also become more simple over the next few years as new students increasingly fall within the new arrangements introduced this year and the various pre-existing schemes fall out of use.</p>
