The Crown Office and Procurator Service publishes annual statistics to provide a snap-shot of charges which were aggravated by religiously motivated prejudice on its website.

  <p>The government supports measures to ensure the safety of young people when using the internet.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers operate the website <a href="http://www.chatsafer.co.uk" target="_blank">www.chatsafer.co.uk</a> which provides guidance for young people and their parents on safe use of the internet. We also work closely with the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre who are responsible for developing the &quot;ThinkUKnow&quot; training and guidance, which is delivered to school children in a number of areas throughout Scotland.</p>

  <p>In addition Young Scot, through its websites and own pages on Bebo, Facebook and MySpace provides information to young people on how to stay safe when using social networking sites.</p>

  <p>In order to use the Young Scot National Entitlement card as a means of identity verification it would require significant investment from social networking sites and permission from young people to share personal details that they have supplied in order to receive their Young Scot card. We have no plans to pursue such an approach.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will support adding an online component to the Young Scot card to provide children and young people with a reliable way of proving their age when they make purchases of age-restricted goods and services over the internet.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government supports the work of Young Scot and the benefits that the Young Scot card offers to children and young people in Scotland. At present, the Young Scot card is a PASS accredited proof of age card and is accepted by the Scottish Clearing Banks as proof of ID to open a bank account.</p>

  <p>The Young Scot National Entitlement card is currently not able to support the kind of application required to use it as a means of online verification. It would require both significant investment from social networking sites and permission from young people to share personal details they have supplied in order to receive their Young Scot card. We have no plans to pursue such an approach.</p>

  <p>However, young people can still use their Young Scot National Entitlement Cards as proof of age when they physically purchase goods and services from retailers.</p>
