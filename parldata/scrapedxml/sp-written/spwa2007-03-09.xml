  <p>The number of modern apprentices (MAs) broken down geographical area and by year is an operational matter for Scottish Enterprise. This information is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>However, Scottish Enterprise have published these figures for 2005 and are in the public domain. These can be found on their website:<a href="http://www.scottish-enterprise.com/sedotcom_home/training-providers-top/training-providers/performance-and-reports.htm?siblingtoggle=1" target="_blank">http://www.scottish-enterprise.com/sedotcom_home/training-providers-top/training-providers/performance-and reports.htm?siblingtoggle=1</a>.</p>

  <p>The MA programme continues to be demand led and are available to those aged 16 and above who are in employment. There have been no new targets set for additional places, however, we will continue to work with the Enterprise Networks to ensure that there continues to be at least 30,000 MAs in training as set out within the Partnership Agreement.</p>

  <p>(ii) The GAE allocations given are neither budgets nor spending targets for the education service.

  <p>The following table gives details of the net revenue expenditure on pre-primary education in Stirling since 2002. This information has only been supplied from 2002-03, as prior to this date pre-school education was not included in the local government finance settlement. The change in the funding methodology used means that expenditure figures are not comparable.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is strongly committed to the start up and growth of small businesses &ndash; in Stirling and throughout Scotland. Support for the sector is mainly a matter for the Enterprise Network, although direct support from the Executive includes Regional Selective Assistance (RSA). RSA is the Executive&rsquo;s main national grant scheme of financial assistance to industry, aimed at encouraging investment and job creation. It is a demand-led scheme and is available to small and medium-sized enterprises within 15 wards in the Stirling local authority area. Details can be found on the RSA Scotland website (www.rsascotland.gov.uk).</p>

  <p>For the purposes of this answer students are defined as being from &lsquo;low-income&rsquo; backgrounds if they have declared parental/spousal income details of not more than &pound;17,500, which was the SAAS means-tested threshold in 2005-06 for receipt of full financial support through the Young Students Bursary (YSB). For comparable results over the period in question this threshold has been kept constant, even though the full YSB threshold has changed in this period.</p>

  <p>Students who have not declared parental/spousal income details and those that are classed as exempt from parental contribution have not been included in the above table.</p>

Stirling Council&rsquo;s homelessness strategy outlines the action being taken by the council to prevent homelessness and to alleviate the problems caused by homelessness. Stirling Council are undertaking a number of initiatives aimed at addressing the causes of homelessness within the area, but also at ameliorating the impact of homelessness, making use of funding provided by the Executive.

  <p>Yes. When I approved NHS Lanarkshire&rsquo;s service change proposals on 21 August 2006, I made clear that new and replacement services must be in place before existing services are discontinued. This stipulation was accepted in the board chair&rsquo;s reply on 11 September 2006. The general requirement to have new and replacement services in place includes accident and emergency services at Larbert, due to be commissioned before the end of 2009. Residents in the Cumbernauld and Kilsyth area will access emergency services at Larbert.</p>

  <p>NHS Lanarkshire will also ensure that the necessary enhancements to services at Wishaw General and Hairmyres Hospitals are in place before any changes to accident and emergency services at Monklands Hospital are implemented.</p>

  <p>The appropriate response to emergency conditions, such as acute asthma attacks, is a 999 emergency call to the Scottish Ambulance Service, which will bring an emergency response. The community casualty unit in Cumbernauld will not be configured to receive such cases. Where an individual with those symptoms presents at a community casualty unit, staff will have training to manage the situation, but will immediately arrange to transfer the patient, as an emergency, to the nearest emergency care site. In the case of Cumbernauld, this will be at Larbert after completion of the planned changes to emergency arrangements in Lanarkshire and Forth Valley.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-31677 by Tavish Scott on 19 February 2007, how the progress of major road works, such as the repairs undertaken to the A7 at Langholm in January 2007, is monitored and how it ensures that inconvenience to the public and local businesses caused by trunk road closures is kept to a minimum.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2007-03-09.S2W-31926.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80109" speakername="Tavish Scott" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-07/wa0309.htm#25">

  <p>The implementation of major roadworks, such as those undertaken on the A7 at Langholm, is managed and monitored by the trunk road operating company on behalf of Transport Scotland. Careful planning of roadworks is important in reducing the impact on local communities. Trunk road operating companies are required to carry out consultation with the local community and local businesses affected by roadworks. They also discuss arrangements with the police and local authorities and, through that process, decide on the best time and method of undertaking the works.</p>

  <p>The closures and works in Langholm were developed through very close liaison with the local community council and local traders. In addition the Road Haulage Association, bus operators and other statutory consultees were consulted. During the closure Amey had full-time staff monitoring the work and placed sentries at either side of the diversions to advise road users of the best alternative routes to take and to distribute leaflets. The works were supervised at all times by an experienced Amey road engineer with good local knowledge.</p>

  <p>As a result of ongoing consultation with the local community during the works, Amey agreed that additional works at Ashley Bank and Thomas Telford junction would be carried out during the closure to avoid a future closure and minimise any further disruption to the local community.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland and Amey met with the local community council and local traders in Langholm on 2 March 2007 to review the works and reflect if any alternative strategies for future works affecting Langholm would be appropriate.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland has operational responsibility for this area and can be contacted for further information if required.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE) figures are from the GAE Green Books for 1999-2000 to 2006-07. The GAE allocations provided are derived from aggregating a number of sub-categories which together make up the cultural and related services GAE line.</p>

  <p>2. Revenue expenditure is sourced from Local Financial Returns (LFR) 2 and 8, completed by local authorities, which cover culture and related services. Expenditure figures for 2006-07 are not yet available.</p>

  <p>3. Revenue spending may differ from the GAE allocation amounts for a number of reasons. First, the GAE allocations given above are neither budgets nor spending targets for culture and related services. They are simply components used in distributing the total block grant that the Executive provides to local authorities. Second, it is for each local authority to decide how best to allocate the resulting overall block grant across all their services, based on local needs and priorities.</p>

  <p>4. Although the total GAE provision for culture and related services in Scotland increased in 2006-07, Stirling&rsquo;s share using the relative needs-based formula decreased.</p>

  <p>Data on the number of VAT registrations and de-registrations are released annually by the Small Business Service, an agency of the Department for Trade and Industry. These figures are used to monitor the number of business start-ups and closures; they are not available by business size.</p>

  <p>These figures do not account for all UK business activity as only companies with a turnover above the VAT threshold are required to register.</p>

  <p>The following table shows the latest figures on the number of VAT registrations and the VAT registration rate per 10,000 resident adults for the Stirling local authority area and in Scotland for the period 2003 to 2005:</p>
