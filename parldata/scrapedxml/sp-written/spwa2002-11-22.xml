  <p>A copy of the report <i>Climate Change: Review of Levels of Protection Offered by Flood Prevention Schemes</i> was issued to each local authority in Scotland in May 2001. The report recommended that all new schemes should allow for future climate change and that this should be considered on a site by site basis so that the allowance for climate change impacts could be achieved cost effectively. In line with this recommendation the Executive requires councils take account of these predicted climate change impacts over the life of new schemes.</p>

  <p>A 1% annual risk is a widely accepted criterion in relation to flood risk and is the figure used by the Executive to define areas at risk. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency hold indicative flood risk maps for Scotland, which indicate those areas at a 1% annual risk of flooding or greater.</p>

  <p>Research commissioned by the Executive found that approximately 77,000 properties could be at risk from inland flooding (based upon a one in 100 year flood event, i.e. a 1% annual risk of flooding). In addition, about 93,000 properties in Scotland were identified as lying below the five-metre contour level: a proportion of these will be at risk of coastal flooding, especially when future climate change impacts are taken into account. Further work is planned to firm up on these figures.</p>

  <p>I have asked Graeme Munro, Chief Executive of Historic Scotland, to reply. His response is as follows.</p>

  <p>Under the powers available to Scottish ministers to make grants available for the repair of historic buildings and buildings within outstanding conservation areas, the only grants made that are conditional on match-funding by a local authority are those made under the Town Scheme arrangements. Under these arrangements, the local authority and Historic Scotland agree to fund in equal shares fixed grants to owners of 50% of eligible costs normally subject to a maximum grant of &#163;6,000. Historic Scotland currently has agreements with 16 local authorities for 22 Town Schemes and has allocated &#163;418,500 for this purpose in 2002-03. Individual awards of grant are made by the local authorities who hold a record of the properties that have received grant.</p>

  <p>I have asked Graeme Munro, Chief Executive of Historic Scotland to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Historic Scotland operates its historic building repair grant scheme on the basis of establishing whether there is a need for support from the public purse and, if so, of providing the minimum level of grant support towards eligible costs that is necessary for a project to be completed successfully. Where the grant applicant is a private developer we also take account of the rate of return that a project is expected to achieve. The UK Treasury provides guidance to all government departments on acceptable rates of return where public monies are involved.</p>

  <p>During the implementation of projects all applicants are expected to comply with all relevant conditions of grant in order to receive staged payments of grant.</p>

  <p>After a project undertaken by a private developer is completed, a financial re-appraisal is carried out to ensure that the rate of return achieved was in accordance with that projected. If not, the level of grant can be adjusted. Certain conditions of grant concerning future public access, maintenance and insurance remain for the developer to comply with for a set period.</p>

  <p>I am satisfied that the responses are fully in accordance with the <i>Scottish Executive Guidance on Parliamentary Questions</i> . The Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) responds to parliamentary questions about operational and contractual matters because they are his specific responsibility under the agency&#146;s framework document. This approach applies to all executive agencies of the Scottish Executive and is in accordance with paragraphs 58-59 of the <i>Scottish Executive&#146;s Guidance on Parliamentary Questions</i> , a copy of which is available in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 24377). There were 623 questions answered by the Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service in the 12 months to 12 November 2002, an increase of almost four-fold on the previous 12 months. This delayed the average response time but the backlog has now been cleared. In accordance with the Scottish Executive Guidance, all of those answers sought to provide the information requested whenever this was available and where provision of that information was consistent with the <i>Code of Practice on Access to Scottish Executive Information</i> .</p>

  <p>Ministers are ultimately accountable for executive agencies such as the SPS. I consider that through the agency framework documents, ministers take proper responsibility for agencies. If there is information that the member wants and considers has not been provided, I suggest she contacts the Chief Executive who will be pleased to assist her.</p>

  <p>Assessments are carried out by the SPS reception and induction staff in conjunction with social work staff and voluntary sector workers. Aspects of housing and accommodation are discussed at this stage.</p>

  <p>All SPS establishments which release prisoners into the community have the services of specialists who are funded through the Rough Sleepers Initiative (RSI). The aim of these RSI projects in prisons is to provide a housing casework service to all categories of offenders who will be homeless or threatened with homelessness on release and to ensure that support is in place prior to liberation. These projects are currently being evaluated by the Executive.</p>
