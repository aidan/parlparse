  <p>The Advisory Committee on Releases into the Environment have assessed the crop as posing very low risks to the environment and, on that basis, are satisfied that this does not pose a safety threat. On the basis of the information currently available, our understanding is that the GM element of the contaminated crop has extremely low male fertility and its ability to cross-pollinate with other plants is therefore negligible.</p>

  <p>The Executive supports the aim of providing all patients with full and useful information about prescribed and over-the-counter medicines. UK law requires medicines to be supplied to consumers with specified information on the label and with an accompanying leaflet to ensure safe and correct use. There has therefore been a general move by manufacturers towards supplying medicines in packs which have patient information leaflets sealed into them.</p>

  <p>However, a UK Working Group on ME was established in January 1999. The purpose of the group is to review the management of care for ME sufferers with the aim of providing best practice guidance for professionals, patients and carers and to improve the quality of care and treatment for those with ME. The Scottish Executive Health Department has representatives on the group and will make recommendations to Ministers in due course on whether the guidance should also be issued in Scotland.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to give a precise answer. Even during a major influenza outbreak, it is relatively rare for the underlying cause of death to be classified as influenza because doctors do not often mention influenza on the certificate of cause of death. Provisional returns for the three months December 1999 to February 2000 show that influenza was mentioned for 164 deaths of persons aged 65 and over. Influenza was classified as the underlying cause of death for 137 of these. It is known that deaths from a number of other causes, notably pneumonia and other respiratory conditions, increase significantly during a period of high influenza activity. However, there is no standard method of associating a proportion of these extra deaths with influenza.</p>

  <p>Guidance on <i>How to Run Safer Routes to School</i> was issued to each local authority and all schools in Scotland last December. The guidance provides practical advice to all those involved in the journey to school and will help enable safer routes schemes to become more widespread in Scotland. This will contribute significant improvements to the health, safety and social development of our children.</p>

  <p>On 25 May I announced in response to question S1W-5262 that local authorities in Scotland would receive additional capital consents totalling &pound;5.2 million to take forward work on the implementation of safer routes to school schemes in the current financial year. The allocation to each local authority is set out below.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is supporting a major conference on the issue of Safer Routes to School, which is being run jointly by the Cycling Charity SUSTRANS and Glasgow City Council. The conference takes place in Glasgow on 4 September and I shall be giving the keynote address.</p>

  <p>Finally, the Scottish Executive is to set up the Scottish School Travel Advisory Group (Scottish STAG) which will consider, among other things, the report of the UK School Travel Advisory Group and make recommendations on how the report&#8217;s conclusions can best be taken forward in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to reducing the levels of smoking by people in Scotland.
