  <p>The boundaries of the new statutory grant scheme which I announced in my statement of 20 January will be set out in the White Paper which I intend to issue in May. The detail has not been finalised, but the objective will be to assist organisations who provide services to families in transition. Whether an organisation comes within the scope of the scheme will depend on the services it offers. Existing arrangements to support organisations under section 10 of the Social Work Services (Scotland) Act 1968 are not affected and this applies to One Parent Families Scotland.</p>

  <p>People in Scotland who suffer distress about their appearance have a right to medical assessment by their general practitioners, which might result in a referral for expert advice and treatment to psychiatrists, plastic surgeons, or, in exceptional circumstances, to general surgeons, as appropriate. The degree and intensity of the mental distress, the combination of possible treatments, including medicines, surgical operations or psychological support needed to relieve the distress will be different for each individual patient. In very exceptional circumstances, a patient may have such a severe problem that the most effective treatment may be amputation.</p>

  <p>There is no evidence held centrally to suggest any widespread recruitment and retention issues surrounding this staff group.</p>

  <p>However, the recent pay offer to biomedical scientists, if accepted, will mean increases of up to 26% from 1 April 1999 for Trainee MLSOs, 7.1% for MLSO1s and 7.1% for MLSO2s with a further 3.25% for all these groups from April 2000.</p>

Partnership funding can be provided by Historic Scotland, an agency within the Scottish Executive, for the repair of buildings within outstanding conservation areas which are the subject of a Town Scheme agreement between Historic Scotland and the local authority. Assistance is also available in the form of grants for the repair of properties of outstanding architectural or historic interest, or key priorities within outstanding conservation areas, in the ownership of local authorities under the Historic Buildings and Repair Grants Scheme administered by Historic Scotland.</p>

  <p>Housing benefit is a reserved matter and is the responsibility of the Department of Social Security.

There are well-defined fraud procedures in place in each local authority in relation to housing benefit, and all other areas of activity, supported by the Accounts Commission for Scotland.

  <p>We are committed to making information available to all those with an interest in economics and statistics in ways they find helpful and appropriate, by releasing formal publications in paper and electronic forms and responding to ad-hoc enquiries. All these arrangements will continue during the customer review.</p>

  <p>As part of this commitment, we are introducing a new series of economic publications. The first <i>Scottish Economic Report</i> was released on 24 January.</p>

  <p>Local authorities carry out winter maintenance duties on all motorways, with the exception of the M74 between Millbank and Gretna, and trunk roads on behalf of the Scottish Executive in accordance with the requirements of the term management and maintenance contracts for the trunk road network and the <i>Code of Practice for Winter Maintenance for Trunk Roads</i> .

  <p>The study commissioned by the Scottish Executive, Scottish Borders Council, Midlothian Council and Scottish Borders Enterprise has now been completed. It was proposed by the Borders Working Party as a contribution to the consideration of how transport links to the area could be improved to the benefit of its economy.</p>

  <p>The study is the product of a thorough analysis of the technical feasibility of reopening part or all of disused<strong> </strong>railway line from Edinburgh to Carlisle together with a detailed assessment of the economic, social and environmental impacts. Both the capital costs and operational viability of a range of options have been examined in detail. For all of these options the study has found that there would be a need for considerable public funding.</p>

  <p>The study is an impartial and independent one. It has applied a robust methodology to arrive at a set of conclusions that can now be considered by the key stakeholders, in particular the relevant local authorities, local enterprise companies and the rail industry. As intended, the study does not make any recommendations on whether or not the project should be progressed and, if so, how. That is for the key stakeholders to decide and take forward with other interested parties, including the Scottish Executive, as appropriate.</p>

  <p>The study&#8217;s findings will be made available to all that wish to see them. I have arranged for it to be made available through the Scottish Parliament Information Centre and the Scottish Executive Library. Arrangements have also been made for copies to be available in local libraries in the areas concerned. The study will also be available in a digital form.</p>

  <p>There are currently 42 rural and 10 urban Councils of Voluntary Service (CVS). The urban CVS do not, at present, receive direct funding from the Scottish Executive. The main source of their funds is local authorities. For the majority of rural CVS, the Scottish Executive provides the main part of their core funding. Core and project funding can come from other sources such as local authorities, health boards, Local Enterprise Companies and the National Lottery Charities Board.</p>

  <p>The table below shows the direct funding to the rural CVS from the Scottish Executive for the last three years.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what timescale was given to the consultants to research and publish their report on the review of Councils of Voluntary Service; what was the period of consultation; how many responses were received as a result of the consultation, and when it will publish its response.</p>

  <p>The consultants, Eglinton Management, were formally appointed on 13 September to undertake the review of the Councils of Voluntary Service. Their final report was issued for consultation on 15 November, with responses due by the end of 1999. A total of 30 responses have been received and a formal response from the Scottish Executive will issue shortly. <br /></p>
