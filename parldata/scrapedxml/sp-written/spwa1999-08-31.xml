<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/1999-08-31.4.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80172" speakername="Mr John Home Robertson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-99/wa0831.htm#519">

  <p>Yes, we shall respond to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors in Scotland by explaining that Scotland&#146;s forestry interests receive Ministerial attention fully reflecting the relatively greater importance of forestry in Scotland. Policies on forestry in Scotland will be tailored to meet Scotland&#146;s needs.</p>

  <p>While the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has overall responsibility for forestry issues that affect Great Britain as a whole, such as the control of forest pests and negotiations in the European Union, he will be required to consult Scottish Ministers on such matters. I have already met the English and Welsh forestry Ministers to discuss areas of mutual concern, and I shall ensure that our policies on these issues take full account of Scotland&#146;s forestry interests.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what financial provision exists to assist higher and further education students who become ill during their studies.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/1999-08-31.5.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80205" speakername="Henry McLeish" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-99/wa0831.htm#909">

  <p>To be eligible for financial support higher education students must be attending a course. Students who are temporarily absent due to illness can continue to receive support until they have been absent for 28 weeks. At that point, a sick student becomes eligible for sickness benefit. A student who withdraws from his or her course, for whatever reason, is ineligible to receive assistance through the student support system and becomes subject to the arrangements under benefits system.</p>

  <p>Many further education students receive financial support from the bursary award scheme but there is no specific provision for students absent due to illness. Students experiencing particular financial difficulties can apply for assistance to the Access Fund operated by the Colleges. Generally there are no financial repercussions for short-term absences but, since bursaries are discretionary awards, each case is judged on its own merits. Where a student is on long-term sick leave the college will advise the student whether he or she should continue the course. If the student withdraws, the bursary is stopped and, if unemployed, the student reverts back to the benefits system for support.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what is the number of people in each parliamentary constituency in Scotland currently enrolled in each of the following New Deal options: (a) full-time education and training; (b) voluntary sector, and (c) the environmental task force.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/1999-08-31.6.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80205" speakername="Henry McLeish" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-99/wa0831.htm#878">

  <p>Employment policy is reserved to the UK Government, which therefore takes the lead on the funding and delivery of the New Deal throughout Great Britain, although in close consultation with its partners, including the Scottish Executive. Many partner organisations at local level also provide New Deal services under contract or provide funds and other resources, including training funds, to enhance the quality of New Deal in their areas. The public and voluntary sector organisations which contribute to the New Deal in this way fall within the remit of the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>Information is not available on a constituency basis. The table below shows the numbers in Scotland by Unit of Delivery enrolled (end May figures) in each of the following New Deal options: a) full-time education and training; b) voluntary sector, and c) the Environment Task Force.</p>

  <p>The Lord Advocate, who then had policy responsibility for such matters, issued a Consultation Paper, in July 1998 which sought views on a range of possible increases in the jurisdiction limits in the Sheriff Court; an option of forum being provided to litigants wishing to raise personal injury actions for sums falling within the small claims limit and the provision of an additional tier of expenses for small claims exceeding &pound;750.</p>

  <p>Following extensive consultation and having considered the responses to the Consultation Paper, I have decided to lay before the Scottish Parliament orders that:-</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&#168; increase 

                the <strong>small claim</strong> limit to <strong>&pound;1,500</strong>;</p>
<p>&#168; increase 

                each of the <strong>privative jurisdiction</strong> of the sheriff court 

                and the <strong>summary cause</strong> limit to <strong>&pound;5,000</strong>;</p>
<p>&#168; add 

                personal injuries actions to the category of actions excluded 

                from the small claim procedure;</p>
<p>&#168; assuming 

                that Parliament accepts the recommendation to increase the small 

                claim limit, increase the present expenses limit of &pound;75 for small 

                claims up to &pound;750 and to &pound;100 for small claims up to &pound;1,000;</p>
<p>&#168; where 

                the value of the claim exceeds &pound;1,000, limits the expenses to 

                10% of the sum awarded; and</p>
<p>&#168; provide 

                that no expenses are to be payable for claims up to &pound;200.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote></p>

  <p>The appropriate Orders which require to be approved by affirmative resolution of the Scottish Parliament will be brought forward when the Parliamentary timetable permits.</p>

  <p>The Competition Act 1988 applies to all undertakings engaged in economic activities whatever their legal status. Local authorities which engage in commercial or economic activities relating to goods or services will be covered by the provisions of the Act as will those businesses which provide goods and services to local authorities and their activities will therefore equally be subject to the prohibitions in the Act. Competition being a reserved matter, the Act will be enforced throughout the UK by the Director General of Fair Trading who has made contact with all local authorities and is undertaking an education programme to ensure that their staff are equipped to detect cartels and anti-competitive practices which may operate in their areas of activity.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive plans to contribute &pound;1 million towards the development of a network of football academies. The academies will seek to attract the most talented youngsters from local communities with the aim of growing a future generation of Scottish stars. This initiative has been welcomed by representatives of the SFA, the Scottish Premier League and the Scottish Professional Footballers Association.</p>

  <p>As Minister for Sport in the Scottish Executive I am now taking this initiative forward and I chaired the inaugural meeting of the Football Partnership on 14 June at McDiarmid Park, Perth. The Partnership includes representatives from the SFA, the SPL, the SFL, the SPFA, <strong></strong>sportscotland, the Scottish Institute of Sport, the Football Trust and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. The Partnership agreed that a Taskforce of officials under the Chairmanship of Eamonn Bannon (member of <strong></strong>sportscotland) should be set up to draw up detailed proposals for consideration by the Partnership before the end of this year.</p>

  <p>In addition <strong></strong>sportscotland continues to make a significant investment in the development of youth football through a variety of initiatives that include Team Sport Scotland, the Governing Body Sports Development Programme, the National Coach Support Programme and the Talented Athlete Programme. These initiatives and more add up to a total investment of &pound;326,000 for 1999-2000.</p>
