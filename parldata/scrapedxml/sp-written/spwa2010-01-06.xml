  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will instruct the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) to provide compensation to farmers and land managers affected by flooding in cases where the primary reason for the flooding was related to SEPA prohibiting a land manager from carrying out activities aimed at preventing flooding, for example not allowing the clearing out of a drainage ditch due to the presence of a particular aquatic species.</p>

  <p>SEPA will authorise applications made under the Water Environment (Controlled Activities) (Scotland) Act 2005 (CAR) for activities which clearly demonstrate improvements in flood risk management.</p>

  <p>When considering CAR licence applications, SEPA takes into account the social, economic and environmental impacts of such works, including impacts on protected species, aiming to strike a balance between all these factors. There is no provision for compensation to be paid by either SEPA or the Scottish Government for farmers and land managers affected by flooding.</p>

  <p>Yes, the distribution of resources, agreed with COSLA on behalf of all local authorities, for flood risk management included within the General Capital Grant, takes account of a number of specific commitments for flood prevention schemes. The balance of available resources, which as a proportion of the total funding will increase over time as the specific commitments are completed, are already distributed based upon the number of properties at risk of flooding in each council area.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether, in addition to consideration of the number of properties at risk of flooding, susceptibility to a higher frequency of flooding will be a criterion in prioritising future flood alleviation funding.</p>

  <p>It is unlikely that national information on the susceptibility to flooding at a higher frequency than the 0.5% annual probability shown on the published Indicative Flood Map would be available before the next spending review.</p>

  <p>The outcomes of flood risk assessment, flood hazard and flood risk mapping, and flood risk management plans to be prepared under the Flood Risk Management (Scotland) Act 2009 may inform discussion with COSLA about resource distribution in future spending reviews.</p>

  <p>The former ring-fenced flood prevention grant was rolled up into the General Capital Grant from 1 April 2008. Allocation of resources for flood prevention schemes after this date is a matter for individual local authorities.</p>

  <p>The construction of the following flood prevention schemes were supported by flood prevention grant in 2007-08; Bo&rsquo;ness, Braid Burn (Edinburgh), Dunfermline, Earnbank, Forres (Burn of Mosset), Galston, Golf Gardens (Larkhall), Kelvin, Lhanbryde, Linlithgow, Milnathort, Saltcoats, Weem and White Cart (Reservoirs). Where applicable, further instalments of flood prevention grant for these schemes becoming due in the years 2008-2011 were recognised in setting the level of General Capital Grant in those years.</p>

  <p>Flood prevention grant was also awarded in 2007-08 for preparatory costs of schemes at Broxburn, North Renfrew and Water of Leith. The estimated costs of these schemes and other known schemes at Elgin, Dunoon, Dumbarton, Rothes, South West Inverness and White Cart (Urban Corridor) were taken into account in the distribution of General Capital Grant for the years 2008-11.</p>

  <p>The answer to S3W-27844 gave a breakdown of the total number of distinction awards held by NHS consultants in Scotland in 2009. It is not possible to provide information in relation to the seniority points of the consultants holding these awards. However, to be considered for an award, a consultant must be on at least point 5 of their salary scale. Further information on seniority points is not held centrally nor by the Scottish Advisory Committee on Distinction Awards (SACDA), who are responsible for managing the scheme.</p>
