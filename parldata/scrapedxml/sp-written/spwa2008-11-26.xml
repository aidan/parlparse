  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to making its information available to all, including disabled people. We take our duties under the Disability Discrimination Act seriously, and expect other organisations to do so too.</p>

  <p>Both the Scottish Government website (<a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk</a>) and Intranet (Saltire) aim to ensure all content meets a minimum web accessibility initiative &quot;AA&quot; rating. All official publications are made available online in both html and PDF format. In addition <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk</a> uses Dexerit text to speech software for official publications and news releases.</p>

  <p>We will supply Scottish Government published documents in alternative formats where appropriate or on request to increase public accessibility. These will include other languages, audio, Braille and large type formats and will include availability in electronic as well as printed formats.</p>

  <p>We currently have no plans to review this provision.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what procedures are in place to protect modern iconic buildings in city centres from unsympathetic development proposals.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-11-26.S3W-17903.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80307" speakername="Linda Fabiani" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa1126.htm#5">

  <p>The Scottish Government has a range of measures available to protect key modern buildings from unsympathetic development proposals through the provisions of the planning system. The main vehicle for this is the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 and the controls that flow from this. In addition the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) (Scotland) Act of 1997 provides the means by which buildings of special architectural or historic interest are given a measure of protection.</p>

  <p>Once a building is listed, planning authorities are required to have regard to the protection of the building and its setting as part of their development management duties. Similarly buildings within conservation areas are afforded a level of protection because consent is required from the planning authority for their demolition. The planning authority also has powers to require planning permission for alterations in such areas through the use of Article 4 directions.</p>

  <p>Applications for conservation area consent and listed building consent are determined by local authorities, but in certain circumstances the Scottish Government and Historic Scotland will become involved. Scottish ministers&rsquo; policy on listed buildings is contained in the recently published SHEP.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will consider shortening the period of time that must elapse before a building is considered for listing status under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) (Scotland) Act 1997.</p>

  <p>Historic Scotland state in the Scottish Historic Environment Policy (October 2008) (paragraph 2.34f) which supports the legislative remit for listing, that buildings less than 30-years-old will normally only be considered for listing if found to be of outstanding merit and/or facing immediate threat. The ability to consider buildings built after 1978 accordingly already exists for buildings under threat and no change is required to the legislation.</p>

  <p>The issuing of national entitlement cards is the responsibility of each local authority. Any available information relating to card issue statistics by year may be held by them.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland does not hold this level of information but I can advise you that based on information supplied the following number of valid national entitlement cards were in circulation giving access to Scotland-wide free bus travel for older and disabled people as of 23 October 2008.</p>

  <p>The Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 does not introduce new powers relating specifically to derelict buildings.</p>

  <p>The act will allow local authorities to issue a work notice, which gives them revised, more flexible powers to deal with a house which is below the tolerable standard, in serious disrepair, or in need of repair and likely to deteriorate rapidly into serious disrepair or cause damage to other premises if nothing is done to repair it.</p>

  <p>Local authorities will also have a new power to issue a demolition notice for a house which is in serious disrepair and ought to be demolished, provided that this is within a housing renewal area. This is in addition to existing powers to require the demolition of any housing which is dangerous or below the tolerable standards and ought to be demolished.</p>

  <p>There will be a new power to issue maintenance orders to secure the maintenance of a property for a period of up to five years. This should give local authorities more scope to prevent a house falling into disrepair in the first place.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government supports the use of the voluntary Young Scot National Entitlement Card as a proof-of-age card. This card bears the PASS (Proof of Age Standards Scheme) hologram. The PASS scheme is approved by the Home Office. The Young Scot card is available to those aged 11 to 26 &ndash; free of charge and is currently held by over 213,000 young people in Scotland. There is no requirement for young people in Scotland to pay for an identity card to prove their age.</p>

  <p>Sanctions can be considered and applied by licensing boards following a test purchasing failure, not a test purchase visit. Information is not held centrally on sanctions applied following test purchase failures. Under the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976 licensing boards can suspend licences for three or six months. When the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005 comes fully into force on 1 September 2009, licensing boards will have wider powers including the power to suspend a premises licence for any period or revoke it. In addition to sanctions by licensing boards, action can be taken by the courts where an offence has been committed.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government, as noted in its response to the Final Report of the Committee of Inquiry on Crofting, intends to offer, as a transitional measure, existing stud farm bulls, at a cost not exceeding current annual hire costs, to crofting groups which have used stud farm bulls in the past three years.</p>

  <p>The Crofters Commission will shortly be writing to all groups who used the hire service in the past three years to invite them to express an interest in acquiring a bull permanently in the spring/summer of 2009. This will allow the Crofters Commission to assess requirements and initiate discussions with interested groups with a view to issuing bulls in time for the 2009 season.</p>

  <p>Efficiency gains may be either recurring or non-recurring. Non-recurring efficiencies can deliver a variety of valid one-off efficiencies. <em>The Scottish Government Efficient Government Programme 2008-09-2010-11, Efficiency Process &amp; Guidance</em> cites the sale of a surplus asset, e.g. a building or land plot, as an example of a valid non-recurring efficiency, therefore NHS boards are permitted to include these savings.</p>

  <p>Non-recurring efficiency gains only count towards the efficiency target in the year in which they are made, they are not counted cumulatively.</p>

  <p>Accountancy adjustments would not in themselves be permissible in demonstrating achievement of efficiency savings. However, accountancy adjustments that relate to real changes in the way in which services are delivered may be included in demonstrating their overall contribution to efficiency savings.</p>

  <p>The definition of a cash-releasing efficiency saving is where the organisation delivers the same service at a reduced cost, demonstrated by delivering the same outcome(s) or output(s) for a reduced input or delivering a reduced unit cost allowing an increased volume of service for the same cost.</p>

  <p>For example, if a service is redesigned and delivered in a more efficient way, in part by rationalising property requirements, this will have an impact on capital charges. Capital charges are a combination of two components, depreciation and a return on the cost of capital, which represent expenditure charged against boards&rsquo; resources in the same way as other operating costs. If a health board can deliver its services more efficiently by using a reduced asset base, this would reduce the impact on revenue costs in terms of capital charges and these savings may count as a recurring efficiency.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers are currently considering the emerging findings from the Strategic Transport Projects Review. The review will set out national investment priorities for 2012 to 2022. The Aberdeen Urban Network is being considered as part of this process. An announcement is expected later in the year which sets out recommendations on a portfolio of land based transport proposals that will contribute to the Scottish Government&rsquo;s purpose of increasing sustainable economic growth.</p>

  <p>The timetable enhancements which come into force on 14 December 2008 will make rail commuting to and through Aberdeen easier.</p>

  <p>Local authorities are required to assess the accommodation needs of gypsies/travellers in their areas as part of the housing need and demand assessment, which informs the local authority&rsquo;s local housing strategy (LHS) and development plans. The Scottish Government published new guidance in March 2008 to support local authorities to undertake improved housing need and demand assessments. The majority of local authorities are now currently undertaking, or preparing to undertake, new or updated assessments to inform the further development of their LHS.</p>

  <p>Following the completion of the Strategic Spending Review and the signing of the concordat with local government, the Scottish Government provided local authorities with record levels of funding over the period of the spending review 2008-11.</p>

  <p>In accordance with the concordat, it is responsibility of each local authority to allocate the financial resources available on the basis of needs and priorities, including the Scottish Government&rsquo;s key strategic objectives and manifesto commitments. In turn these aims, objectives and outcomes are reflected in the single outcome agreements, including targets on waste, and local authorities have flexibility over how these are achieved. The overall funding package resulting from the spending review 2007 is considered sufficient to deliver Scotland&rsquo;s share of the UK&rsquo;s 2010 Landfill Directive target.</p>

  <p>More specifically, the Scottish Government is working closely with COSLA and local authorities to ensure that appropriate plans are in place to meet Landfill Directive targets. In addition, discussions are underway with COSLA and other partners including Scottish Environment Protection Agency on how best to use the zero waste fund to support successful delivery of zero waste policy aims and objectives in order to meet targets.</p>
