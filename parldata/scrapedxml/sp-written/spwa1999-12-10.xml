  <p>The stores at Ratho and Glenrothes that hold meat and bone meal (MBM) derived from the rendering of bovine carcases processed under the Over Thirty Months Scheme (OTMS) are both full. There is a total of 13 sites across the UK holding OTMS MBM safely and securely pending destruction in accordance with EU rules.</p>

  <p>The procurement of additional units to store OTMS MBM is a matter for the Intervention Board. Currently MBM now produced in Scotland under the OTMS is transported south to a store at Barkston Heath in Lincolnshire, operated by Snowies of Stirling. Surplus tallow, the other main by-product of the rendering process, is stored in Merseyside.</p>

  <p>Emissions of dioxins from waste incinerators are not controlled on the basis of a permitted maximum daily level. Except for very small incinerators burning animal remains, all industrial and commercial waste incinerators in Scotland are regulated by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) under the provisions of Part 1 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.</p>

  <p>Each incinerator is required to operate in accordance with an authorisation granted by SEPA. The authorisation sets down the conditions under which the incinerator is required to operate. Conditions in authorisations are designed to prevent, or where that is not practicable, minimise the release of substances, including dioxins, into the environment. Such conditions include specifying the types of waste that may or may not be burnt; the operating conditions under which incineration may take place; emission limits; and monitoring requirements. Where an incinerator is subject to EC Directives, SEPA is required to include the necessary requirements in the relevant authorisation. Authorisations, monitoring results and details of any enforcement action are available for inspection in the public registers held in SEPA offices.</p>

  <p>Emissions of dioxins from incinerators are required to be kept as low as possible and emission limits are set on a case by case basis. European legislation requires that the concentration of dioxins in the waste gases from new hazardous waste incinerators does not exceed 0.1ng/m<sup>3</sup>. Emissions of dioxins from all other types of incinerators are expected to be less than 1ng/m<sup>3</sup>.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is aware of public concern on landspreading of organic waste.

  <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), as waste regulation authority, has been investigating reports of smells in the vicinity of Mount Vernon for several months. Investigations indicated two sources of smell at the Paterson&#8217;s landfill site: firstly wastes which had recently been brought to the site for disposal, and secondly landfill gases from degrading landfilled waste at the site.</p>

  <p>An enforcement notice was issued by SEPA on 8 October requiring the site operator to take actions to ensure that any waste accepted at the site will not lead to breach of the licence conditions. One of the licence conditions is that &quot;All site operations shall be conducted in such a manner as to ensure that they do not give rise to offensive odours, as perceived by any authorised person of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, West Region, at any point beyond the site boundary.&quot; The notice also required action to be taken to avoid the release of landfill gases.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), as waste regulation authority, has responsibility for considering applications for waste management licences and setting appropriate conditions to protect health and the environment.</p>

  <p>Land use planning decisions are the responsibility of local authorities. Planning authorities must in the first instance take account of the development plan, then all other material considerations, including advice from SEPA, when determining planning applications. Where appropriate, environmental impact assessment provides additional advice. All operational landfills require licences from SEPA as well as valid planning consent.</p>

  <p>The bid document for all Objective 2 coverage in the UK was that published by DTI, the Scotland Office and other UK Government Departments on 8 October (URN99/1021). On that day I made available to this Parliament the proposals for Scotland, which were based on recommendations from this Executive, including our proposed ward list for Scotland.</p>

  <p>Since then I announced on 2 December some minor modifications to our original proposals in order to better reflect the criteria in the EU Regulation. These documents are available in SPICE.</p>

  <p>There is no rank ordering of all wards in Scotland that meet EU criteria for Objective 2 funding, since the proposals represent a balance between deserving areas in Scotland based on the industrial, rural, urban and fisheries criteria set out in the EU Regulation. In preparing our recommendations we based our proposals on data available from Eurostat, the Office for National Statistics, the General Register Office for Scotland, the Scottish Area Deprivation Index and other relevant material.</p>

  <p>No assessments have yet been made. However, it would be our intention to consider systems in other Member States in due course in the context of the review of the EU Directive, 91/630, on pig welfare.</p>

  <p>The sale of scallop roe is not generally prohibited unless it is from an area which has been closed to scallop fishing by a Food and Environment Protection Act 1985 (FEPA) Order due to the detection of algal toxin levels above the statutory limit as no part of a scallop can be harvested from such an area.</p>

  <p>There is no difference in the cost of testing the gonad compared to the whole animal for Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning in king scallops.</p>

  <p>The testing regime in Scotland is directed to the gonad since research has shown that, of the most commonly eaten parts of the scallop, this tends to have the highest concentrations of toxins. The EU legislation requires that the whole body or any part edible separately is tested.</p>

  <p>The testing regime in Northern Ireland is a matter for the Northern Ireland authorities.</p>

  <p>It is generally believed that CHD in Scotland is a mass disease, which affects some 500,000 people. As far as mortality is concerned, the most recent figure for Scotland is that in 1998 there were 13,419 deaths from CHD. The latest year for which the information is available for England is 1997. There were 140,559 deaths from CHD that year.</p>

  <p>As the report of the Acute Services Review (June 1998) noted, however, there is a shortage of data on coronary heart disease, especially in relation to morbidity in the community. Better data are essential so that we can assess whether we are meeting all the needs of those with CHD. The Scottish Executive&#8217;s CHD Task Force is therefore giving priority to setting up a national CHD database founded on the routine management of patients in primary care.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, the most recently published information on the prevalence and mortality from CHD, although categorised as Ischaemic Heart Disease, occurs in <i>The Scottish Health Survey 1995</i>, published by the former Scottish Office Department of Health and <i>Regional Trends</i> based on data provided by General Register Office (Scotland) and the Office for National Statistics. Those data are summarised below.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Health Survey, which is based on respondants in the 16-24 age group, states:</p>

  <p>&quot;Ischaemic heart disease &#8211; The prevalence of IHD was higher in Scotland than in England with the difference being greatest among older informants. Among men, the overall prevalence was 4.0% in Scotland and 2.5% in England. The difference in prevalence was greatest among those aged 45-54 (6.0% vs. 3.0%) and those aged 55-64 (17.0% vs. 10.3%). Among women, the overall prevalence was 2.9% in Scotland and 1.5% in England. The corresponding figures in the 45-54 years and 55-64 years were 3.4% vs. 2.3% and 11.4% vs. 5.9% respectively&quot;.</p>

  <p>We are of course taking forward a &pound;15 million demonstration project under the White Paper <i>Towards a Healthier Scotland</i> which will build on international experience in the primary prevention of CHD. That White Paper also set a target of reducing by 50% between 1995 and 2010 the mortality associated with CHD.</p>

  <p>The ambulatory care model has been successfully developed in various countries: the United States, Scandinavia and England. Such centres offer a day care service combining in one process consultation, diagnosis and intervention, usually by day surgery. They operate on an elective basis, that is they do not carry out emergency work.</p>

  <p>The concept is being taken forward in Scotland as part of the Scottish Executive&#8217;s <i>Programme for Government</i>. The relationship between ambulatory and non-ambulatory care in a particular area is of fundamental importance, and was one of the themes explored in a national conference on ambulatory care which the Scottish Executive Health Department organised on 30 November. The guidelines which will then be produced will also address the relationship between the two types of care.</p>

  <p>The Access to Health Records Act 1990 gives individuals the right of access, subject to certain specific exemptions, to health records containing information about themselves. Parents may also be entitled to access to their children&#8217;s health records. The Act makes no distinction between parents who may be living together or separated. In the case of a child under the age of 16, an application for access to a record may be made by either the patient, a person authorised by the patient or by the child&#8217;s parent or guardian. The child&#8217;s right to confidentiality, however, must also be considered. A child who, in the opinion of the health professional with overall responsibility for their clinical care, possesses sufficient understanding to give or withhold consent to disclosure of their information enjoys the same rights to confidentiality as any other person.</p>

  <p>Capital funding is allocated to individual NHS Trusts for expenditure on specifically agreed capital projects and, because of the nature of these schemes, capital slippage is permitted from one year to another to allow completion of the individual projects. Therefore, the amount of capital allocated is in line with actual expenditure for individual projects.</p>

  <p>Capital resources allocated to NHS Trusts between 1993-94 and 1995-96 are not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The identification and accreditation of suitable training courses and the recognition of qualifications in any complementary therapy is primarily the responsibility of the professional body or bodies which regulate it.</p>

  <p>The regulation of health professions is a reserved matter. However, I understand that herbal medicine professional bodies have been encouraged by the Government to form a single self-regulatory body for all herbalists, in the hope that in due course the profession may be in a position to apply for statutory self-regulation.</p>

  <p>We have no current plans to do so. However, an additional &pound;1 million per year in 1999-2000 and for the next two years has been allocated to health boards to spend on smoking cessation services and nicotine replacement therapy. These services will provide counselling, advice and support to smokers who want to give up. A week's supply of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) will also be offered, free of charge to those who can least afford it.</p>

  <p>A &quot;freephone&quot; NHS Helpline provides advice on health and local health services. Callers can be given information on how to stay healthy and warm during the winter months. This service will be available over the Millennium holiday period.</p>

  <p>This is a matter for North Ayrshire Council. I understand that the council is currently considering a number of initiatives which may involve the transfer of all or some of its housing stock. In the event of such transfer, it will be for the council to assess the implications for council staff and the Direct Labour Organisation.</p>

  <p>Legislation on drugs and driving is a reserved matter under the Scotland Act. Driving a motor vehicle while unfit through drugs is an offence. The police may take a person whose driving appears to be impaired to a police station for examination by a police surgeon.</p>

  <p>The police however have no powers to test drivers for drugs at the roadside comparable to their powers to test for alcohol. Primary legislation would be required to introduce such a power and it would be for the Westminster Parliament to introduce such legislation.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has recently commissioned research to investigate the prevalence of recreational drug use and driving in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Data on injury road accidents are recorded by the police on statistical returns to the Scottish Executive which provide details of the circumstances of an accident, together with information about each vehicle involved and each person injured in the accident. The results of these returns are published annually in <i>Road Accidents Scotland</i> , copies of which are available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre. Information about contamination of the road surface by oil or diesel was added to the accident report form this year, and so is not shown in the current edition of <i>Road Accidents Scotland</i> .</p>

  <p>The returns received for the first nine months of 1999 show that there were three injury accidents, one of which was fatal, in the Grampian Police area in which oil or diesel was reported as being present on the road. This represents 0.4% of injury accidents in the area over the same period; and the data do not indicate whether the fuel spills caused the accidents.</p>

  <p>In the absence of data linking diesel and oil spills to road accidents, and given the low incidence of accidents at which oil or diesel are reported as being present on the road, the Scottish Executive has no plans to change the present targets of its road safety campaign. This concentrates on drink driving and speeding, known major causes of fatalities and serious injuries.</p>

  <p>The A8000 is a local road. Given the pressures on the trunk road budget, I concluded that it would not be appropriate to expand the trunk road network. This approach has been applied consistently e.g. to the extension to the M74, the other local authority proposal examined in the review, the planned Aberdeen Western Peripheral Road and the A801.</p>

  <p>The M74 Northern Extension was first proposed by Strathclyde Regional Council and has been taken forward by Glasgow City and South Lanarkshire Councils as successors to Strathclyde Region. No government, past or present, has given any commitment to designate the proposed route a trunk road. A strategic route through Glasgow is already provided by the M8, which was incorporated into the trunk road network on 1 April 1996. The Executive is committing very significant resources to the M8 through Glasgow, including a &pound;30 million programme of structural repairs on the Kingston Bridge, to address the inherited problems. The M8 through Glasgow is used by high volumes of local traffic, including a significant element of commuting by car. The Strategic Roads Review appraisal shows that the M74 Northern Extension would have a similar mix of strategic and local traffic. The need for additional motorway capacity across the city has to be considered in the context of the Local Transport Strategies which Glasgow City, South Lanarkshire and all other Councils in the area have been asked to prepare. The authorities concerned are best placed to assess the contribution which the M74 scheme can make to the delivery of these strategies and to address the significant impacts inevitably associated with any urban motorway.</p>

  <p>The recent report by the Standing Advisory Committee on Trunk Road Assessment (SACTRA) on <i>Transport and the Economy</i> highlighted the complexities associated with analysing the local economic impacts of transport schemes. They cautioned against exaggerated claims for the significance of such impacts, and argued that studies of local economic development impacts should take full account of the likely displacement of jobs from other areas. The report set out a number of recommendations on how such studies should be carried out. The Executive is currently considering, with the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, the implications of the SACTRA report for its future appraisal methodology.</p>

  <p>The appraisal carried out for the Strategic Roads Review indicated that the M74 Northern Extension would be likely to have an overall positive impact on the local economy. At this stage, it is impossible to be more precise than this.</p>

  <p>Since 1996-97, local authorities have received a block allocation to cover expenditure on all their non-housing capital programmes including Roads and Transport. This method of allocating resources is by agreement with CoSLA. Authorities can also use capital receipts and revenue to meet capital spending needs.

  <p>I have asked Glasgow City and South Lanarkshire Councils to take forward proposals for the M74 Northern Extension in the context of their Local Transport Strategies and in co-operation with other authorities, including Renfrewshire.
