  <p>The Scottish Government funds the Energy Saving Trust (EST) to provide free, comprehensive energy saving advice through the Energy Saving Scotland advice centres. Advisors signpost any callers reporting debt issues to appropriate money advice services.</p>

  <p>EST manage the Energy Assistance Package (EAP) for the Scottish Government. EAP is a holistic approach to tackling fuel poverty that addresses both the home and the householder and includes services to maximise income, reduce fuel bills and improve energy efficiency. The package is supported by a budget of over &pound;60 million in 2009-10.</p>

  <p>Domestic energy suppliers have a number of licence obligations in relation to debt and disconnection and performance against these is monitored by the industry regulator Ofgem. Suppliers are required to report their performance to Ofgem on a quarterly and annual basis and data is published on the Ofgem website.</p>

  <p>The total number of gas and electricity disconnections in Scotland due to debt in 2008 and the first two quarters of 2009 is provided in the table below. The information is not available broken down by Scottish parliamentary constituency.</p>

  <p>Inverness Sheriff Court continues to be fit for purpose. The sheriff court accommodation has been progressively modernised over the years and although split over adjacent buildings, the current volume of court business is manageable within this three court complex.</p>

  <p>I was able to view this progress during a recent visit to the sheriff court. In particular, I would like to place on record my appreciation for the work undertaken to improve the court experience for vulnerable witnesses including children.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is and remains committed to tackling sectarianism.

As part of this, the Scottish Government (SG) is preparing, with NHS Health Scotland, guidance outlining the responsibilities of SG, NHS Health Scotland and NHS boards with respect to delivering this target. This guidance, to issue shortly, will detail the support which can be made available to boards to help them reach the target.</p>

  <p>Data on boards&rsquo; progress is monitored regularly by the Scottish Government. The most recent data was published on 29 September 2009 at:</p>

  <p>On the basis of developments indicated by boards during recent Scottish Government Mental Health Implementation Review meetings, we expect to meet this target.</p>

  <p>: The Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB) is due to undertake a travel to work survey before the end of April 2010 and as part of this survey we will ask a question about the demand for pool vehicles.</p>

  <p>The SPCB has previously provided a pool car for which there was insufficient demand to make it viable. In addition, the SPCB has assessed the demand for joining the city car club and found that there was insufficient demand to justify a corporate membership.</p>
