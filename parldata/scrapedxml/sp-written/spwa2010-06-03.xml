  <p>In March 2009, Councillor Harry McGuigan of COSLA and I published our shared vision for tackling antisocial behaviour in Scotland, <em>Promoting Positive Outcomes. </em> This was developed in partnership with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA) and other national partners, and supported across this chamber when it was debated on 2 April 2009.</p>

  <p>I am delighted to say that a significant amount of work is going in to tackling antisocial behaviour in Scotland.</p>

  <p>We are continuing to meet our commitment of having 1,000 additional police officers on Scotland&rsquo;s streets making our communities safer places to live and work. Additionally, we have committed investment of over &pound;17 million since the Cashback for Communities scheme was announced in June 2007. In North Lanarkshire this amounts to 38 awards receiving a total of &pound;285,488.</p>

  <p>Since its introduction, OPITO (The Oil and Gas Academy) in partnership with the Engineering Construction Industry Training Board has trained over 770 modern apprentices under the Upstream Technician Training Programme for work in oil and gas. OPITO have also formed a partnership with Forth Valley College to help deliver their Transformation Training Programme. This has been funded through the PACE initiative. Through the modern apprenticeship programme we will provide over 1,500 opportunities for young people to commence a Level 3 Engineering MA this year. This figure includes opportunities for those who wish to work offshore.</p>

  <p>Through the Oil &amp; Gas Industry Advisory Group, we are working with the industry to address key areas of strategic priority including skills and industry promotion to enhance the industries&rsquo; competitive position and sustain oil and gas production in the future. The Forum for Renewable Energy Development for Scotland&rsquo;s Offshore Wind Group is considering specific skill needs and is feeding into the Renewable Energy Skills Group with a view to skills interventions being developed. Skills Development Scotland is also supporting Energy &amp; Utility Skills in their development of a Workforce Planning Model to cover offshore renewables.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Biodiversity Strategy is delivered through a wide range of actions that protect endangered plant and animal species, carried out by many partners. A good example of this partnership approach can be found in the new Edinburgh Local Biodiversity Action Plan, that was launched in March 2010 as part of a biodiversity weekend at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh. The local biodiversity partnership are planning a range of actions, including a project to protect and re-establish juniper in the Pentland Hills.</p>

  <p>In the International Year of Biodiversity we are seeking to renew people&rsquo;s appreciation of nature, and to reinforce the message that biodiversity delivers many services vital to human health and prosperity.</p>

  <p>Twinflower was noted to be present in 77 sites in Scottish woodlands in 2008 in the progress report of the UK Biodiversity Action Plan, based on partial survey information. Most of the sites are in native pinewoods. The species is recorded as declining. The Forestry Commission has been undertaking genetic tests to help understand the clonal structure of twinflower populations, as well as carrying out research studies on forest management and design techniques to determine what can be done to help stimulate vegetative propagation, spread and flowering of the species.</p>

  <p>An interface area between moorland and forestry, rather than a hard edge, provides a mosaic of habitats which can create a suitable home for a range of species, including black grouse in particular. Other species which can benefit from a lower density canopy edge habitat include some butterfly species and juniper. Forestry Commission Scotland&rsquo;s design objectives for moorland fringe on the national forest estate are developed on a site by site basis, dependent on the species and habitats present, and the age of the forest. However, the general principles involved are outlined in the Forestry Commission&rsquo;s suite of Forest Guidelines (currently under revision) which cover issues such as biodiversity and landscape design.</p>

  <p>Holders of loans from the Crofters&rsquo; Building Grants and Loans Scheme received a letter from the Minister for Environment on 4 December 2009 offering the opportunity to change to a variable rate of interest, set initially at 3.5%, and to collect information on how many loanholders might take up the offer.</p>

  <p>Other than the already established referral to treatment target for access to specialist child and adolescent mental health, and our commitment to develop an access target for psychological therapies to be announced in 2011-12, there are no current plans to include other mental health services in current referral to treatment waiting time guarantees.</p>

  <p>The Patient Rights (Scotland) Bill will include mental health services in its aims to establish a 12 week treatment time guarantee for patients receiving elective or planned treatment on an inpatient or day case basis.</p>

  <p>Where mental health services are delivered on this basis then the treatment time guarantee will apply. Expected completion of the Bill through Parliament is spring 2011.</p>

  <p>The remark attributed to the chief constable of Grampian refers to a dinner between myself and six out of the eight chief constables. I was supported by two civil servants on that occasion. The meeting provided an opportunity for chief constables to raise any issues they wished to discuss. There were not two separate meetings and it is entirely wrong to suggest that civil servants were acting outwith my authority.</p>

  <p>In a statement issued by the President of Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland, Pat Shearer confirmed that I hosted the meeting and civil servants acted in their official capacity in my support. He also made clear that all parties are working together and share a common interest in providing the best policing service possible for the communities of Scotland.</p>
