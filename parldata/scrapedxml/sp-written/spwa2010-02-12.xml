  <p>Section 7 of the Allotments (Scotland) Act 1892 provides that no building other than one of a specified type (such as a tool-house or shed) may be erected on an allotment.

  <p>It is not inappropriate for a local authority to have an interest in a development, and also to make a decision on a planning application for that development. However, any conflict of interests that might arise from having this dual role must not influence the authority&rsquo;s handling or planning decision. Further advice can be found in Planning Advice Note (PAN) 82: Local authority Interest Developments.</p>

  <p>Statutory guidance exists through the Local Government (Scotland) Acts of 1973 and 1994. There are also accounting guidelines set out in the Local Authorities Scotland Accounts Advisory Committee (LASAAC) document <em>Accounting for the Common Good: A Guidance Note for Practitioners</em> which was revised in December 2007. In addition, the Scottish Government wrote to all local authorities in 2007 to remind them of their responsibilities under accounting codes of practice, best value guidance grant conditions and statute in respect of their management of common good funds and assets.</p>

  <p>Yes, this government will honour these commitments on the school building project and on the protection of local government&rsquo;s share of the overall capital budget, for the entirety of the programme.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government underlined its commitment to improving schools for pupils throughout Scotland with the announcement of &pound;800 million of government support towards the new &pound;1.25 billion school building programme. We have also given a clear commitment that local government will continue to receive the same percentage share of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s total capital budget, before any top slicing, that is currently allocated. The &pound;800 million for the school building project over the 2010-11 to 2017-18 period will be additional to this share.</p>

  <p>I have agreed with the Scottish Law Commission its Eighth Programme of Law Reform, which covers the work to be undertaken by the Commission for the five year period from 2010 until the end of 2014. The programme was presented to Parliament today and is also being published today. Copies have been placed in the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s Information Centre (Bib. number 50195).</p>

  <p>The projects which will be undertaken under the eighth programme have been selected following extensive consultation by the commission. The programme includes existing projects which began under the seventh programme, such as work on trust law and judicial factors. The scope of two existing projects has been revised following consultation, and a new project on security over corporeal moveable property will be combined with the existing project on security over, and assignation of, incorporeal moveable property. The work on provocation, self-defence, coercion and necessity will be considered as part of a general review of the law of homicide. The final part of the criminal reference on previous convictions, similar fact evidence, and the Moorov doctrine, will continue. In addition, the commission expects to undertake new projects which will cover criminal liability of partnerships, law of contract in light of the Draft Common Frame of Reference, some aspects of adults with incapacity law, compulsory purchase, heritable securities, and prescription and corporeal moveable property.</p>

  <p>In addition, the commission will continue work on joint projects with the Scottish Law Commission, covering insurance law, level crossings and statute law revision. It will also carry out work on consolidation of legislation.</p>

  <p>I welcome this programme, which represents a varied and relevant set of proposals, and look forward to receiving reports from the commission in due course. We will continue to work with the commission over ways of taking forward the proposals in those reports, and will continue with the system introduced last year of providing initial responses to reports within three months of publication.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Law Commission also has a general remit to keep the law of Scotland under review for the purpose of promoting reform and development of the law. In addition to the Programme of Law Reform agreed with ministers, the commission also receives from ministers references on specific issues and provides other advice</p>

  <p>All local authorities were aware of the fact that this was a trial and was not meant to be a long-term arrangement, investments were made on this understanding. Scottish Government continues to work with COSLA and local authorities to identify how best to roll-out food waste collections based on local circumstances and needs. Scottish Government is aware that some local authorities have already implemented food waste collections with others planning to do so.
