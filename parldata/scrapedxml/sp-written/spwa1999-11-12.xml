  <p>The Enterprise networks provide a comprehensive range of business support services to help business formation, survival and growth. We keep under constant review existing arrangements for business support in Scotland to monitor the effectiveness of services and to identify ways of improving efficiency and service delivery. We will continue to work with SE and HIE to improve the quality and consistency of business support services, for example, through implementing the recommendations of the Review into Business Support in Scotland concluded earlier this year. The Parliament&#8217;s Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee is currently undertaking an inquiry into business support services at the local level including examination of the co-ordination of services. The Executive will study the Committee&#8217;s findings and conclusions with keen interest in considering whether further improvements are required in our business support arrangements.</p>

  <p>We are currently considering the Scottish implications of the Small Business Service proposals published by the Department of Trade and Industry. Our assessment will take account of the fact that economic development issues are devolved to the Scottish Parliament and the existence of Scotland&#8217;s distinctive business support structure, including the role of Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise and the wider enterprise network.</p>

  <p>We take very seriously the menace presented by child pornography, whatever its source. The law on child pornography already reflects this, with a maximum penalty of three years&#8217; imprisonment, an unlimited fine, or both, for those who publish, circulate or possess with a view to distributing such material.</p>

  <p>The level of penalties generally is a matter we keep under review.</p>

  <p>The <i>Opportunity Scotland</i> consultation paper of September 1998, the <i>Skills for Scotland</i> paper of March 1999 and the SUfI Development Plan of October 1998 all invited comment on our plans to establish the Scottish University for Industry by autumn 2000. Respondents overwhelmingly supported the establishment of the Scottish UfI.</p>

  <p>The Scottish UfI will be required to develop a number of success criteria which will be monitored and published. These will include targets such as the number of enquiries to the Scottish UfI helpline, the numbers taking up learning, the numbers progressing to further learning and the numbers completing learning. The Scottish UfI will be expected to publish an annual report and will be required to meet tough targets under a contractual agreement with the Scottish Executive for its funding.</p>
