  <p>We do not hold information centrally on the timescales involved in the issuing of adoption orders.</p>

  <p>The Adoption and Children (Scotland) Act 2007 (&quot;the 2007 Act&quot;), which will come into force on 28 September 2009, requires a child, placed by an adoption agency, to live with a prospective adopter for 13 weeks prior to an adoption order being granted. New court rules have been developed as part of the implementation of the 2007 Act which govern the processes in court for the hearing and disposal of applications for adoption or the new Permanence Order. These court rules will give a framework for the timescales involved from the time a petition for an adoption order is lodged with the court to the point the application is disposed.</p>

  <p>The Adoption Policy Review Group was set up in 2001 to look at adoption practice and law in Scotland. The first report was published in 2003 and looked at practice issues; the second report was published in 2005 and dealt with the legal framework. The Review Group identified a number of issues which needed to be addressed to ensure that the adoption process was timely and efficient in order to meet the needs of the children involved.</p>

  <p>The recommendations of the second report by the Adoption Policy Review Group led to the development of the Adoption and Children (Scotland) Act 2007 (&quot;the 2007 Act&quot;). The 2007 Act, and associated regulations, makes provision for the process of assessing and approving prospective adopters and assessing children as suitable for adoption. It creates new court rules governing the processes for adoption and the new Permanence Order. The new legislation is designed to minimise any delays in the process and ensure that safe, stable and secure placements are found for children who can no longer live with their natural parents. The 2007 Act will come into force on 28 September 2009.</p>

  <p>Alongside the 2007 Act the Scottish Government is supporting the implementation with guidance and training which has been delivered by the British Association for Adoption and Fostering and the Fostering Network to almost 1,000 practitioners and others, such as Children&rsquo;s Hearing members and local government solicitors. The guidance will provide all those working with the new legislation the necessary tools and good practice to ensure that the system works effectively and efficiently to meet the needs of children.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-14765 by Jack McConnell on 4 April 2001, what change has taken place since April 2001 in the proportion of looked-after children who secure a permanent home.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-09-22.S3W-27204.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80331" speakername="Adam Ingram" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa0922.htm#1">

  <p>We do not hold information centrally on the proportion of looked after children who secure a permanent home.</p>

  <p>The courts in Scotland are required to notify the General Register Office for Scotland when they grant an adoption order. As indicated in the Statistics supplied in the answer to question S3W-27200 on 22 September 2009, there were 418 adoption orders granted in 2008, 67% of those adoptions were by non-relatives. A small number of the non-relative adoptions may have been granted with respect to a child who was looked after outwith Scotland but who was being adopted by adopters resident in Scotland. However, the majority of the non-relative adoptions are likely to involve children who were looked after by a Scottish local authority.</p>

  <p>Adoption is not the only form of permanent option available for children who are looked after by a local authority, and may not be the best option for some of these children. Other options for providing a permanent home to a child who is being looked after by a local authority can include the child returning to their natural parents with support from the local authority or permanent fostering. The Looked After Children (Scotland) Regulations 2009, which will come into force on 28 September 2009, will provide for a robust process for planning for a looked-after child, not only in the short-term, but also the medium and long-term, taking account of all the permanent options available for that child.</p>

  <p>Also, the Adoption and Children (Scotland) Act 2007, which will also come into force on 28 September 2009, introduces a new, flexible court order, the Permanence Order, which is designed to meet the individual needs of a child and to supply them with a permanent home when they cannot return to their natural parents. This order will allow a greater degree of autonomy from the local authority while retaining the safeguard of being a looked-after child.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The information for this question has been extracted from the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service&rsquo;s Case Management Database. The database is a live, operational database used to manage the processing of reports submitted to procurators fiscal by the police and other reporting agencies. If a Procurator Fiscal amends a charge submitted by a reporting agency the database will record details only of the amended charge.</p>

  <p>2. The database is charge-based. The figures quoted therefore relate to the number of charges rather than the number of individuals charged or the number of incidents that gave rise to such charges.</p>

  <p>3. The information in this answer reflects the position on 10 September 2009.</p>

  <p><strong>Frank Mulholland: </strong>The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) database does not contain information to identify local authority areas and the individual jurisdictions do not always match the local authority areas.

  <p>Maximum price ceilings (or thresholds) have been set at the lower quartile (lowest 25%) price level, based on actual house sales data in each area. Lower quartile is the price where 25% of sales fall at or are below. Lower quartile is a commonly used measure for identifying affordable housing in the private sector. Using lower quartile as the base allows us to target funding towards those families in greatest need and unable to trade down in the housing market. Maximum price ceilings are set for property sizes of between two and six apartments &ndash; an apartment is any room in a house, excluding kitchens, bathrooms, hallways and utility rooms. Setting prices by size of property ensures that families requiring a larger property are not disadvantaged.</p>

  <p>In rural areas a 10% uplift has been applied and in the three remote island local authorities, the median (the price at which 50% of sales fall at or are below) is used instead of the lower quartile in recognition of the particular pressures faced by these communities and the low number of house sales in these areas. All maximum price ceilings are rounded up to the nearest &pound;5,000.</p>

  <p>No, I do not have the power to order disclosure of evidence. Section 194J of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 prevents the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission from disclosing any information obtained by it in the exercise of its functions, subject to exceptions set out in section 194K. I am considering making an Order under section 194K(1)(f), which would relax this restriction. Other restrictions, such as those in the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Human Rights Act 1998, would remain in place and would need to be considered to determine what information could be disclosed.</p>

  <p>This information is not collected centrally. Complaints from individuals about being subject to compulsory measures of treatment under the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 are made locally to the appropriate NHS board.</p>

  <p>For short term detention certificates (STDCs), statistics in relation to those who challenge their having been made subject to the certificate may be inferred by the numbers who appeal to the Mental Health Tribunal against the STDC. An individual can appeal to the Mental Health Tribunal for a revocation of a STDC, and Volume 2, Chapter 2 of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 Code of Practice provides guidance on this. Approximately 100 applications for revocation of a STDC are made each quarter, of these around 50% are withdrawn before being heard and between 10 to 25% are revoked. Source Mental Health Tribunal quarterly statistics:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.mhtscotland.gov.uk/mhts/files/Quarterly%20Report%20April%20to%20June%202009.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.mhtscotland.gov.uk/mhts/files/Quarterly%20Report%20April%20to%20June%202009.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p>For Compulsory Treatment Orders (CTOs), these longer term orders may be made directly by the tribunal on the application of a mental health officer, and following a Tribunal hearing at which the patient will have been involved to give their view. Again, the most recent Mental Health Tribunal quarterly statistics (for April to June 2009) provide an indication of the percentages of CTOs made by the tribunal (around 77%) of those applied for. Thereafter, statistics in relation to those who continue to object to the CTO having been granted by the Tribunal might be inferred from the number of appeals made to the Sheriff Principal under the statutory mechanisms. In the period September 2008 to August 2009 inclusive the tribunal was served with 14 appeals to sheriff principals, not all of which went to full hearings having been dismissed as incompetent or because the appellant no longer wished to appeal; it should also be noted that not all of those appeals from the tribunal will have been made by patients, some may have been made by health boards.</p>

  <p>There are three ways in which a person may be subjected to compulsory measures of treatment under the civil regime in the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 (&quot;the 2003 Act&quot;), namely: (a) emergency detention; (b) short-term detention, and (c) long-term detention or compulsory measures under the authority of a compulsory treatment order. In addition, mentally disordered offenders may be made subject to compulsory measures of treatment by the courts under the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 (&quot;the 1995 Act&quot;).</p>

  <p>The majority of compulsory measures of treatment for mental disorder are first approved by either the Mental Health Tribunal for Scotland under Part 7 of the 2003 Act (compulsory treatment orders) or by a court under the 1995 Act in relation to mentally disordered offenders. The two exceptions to this prior authority for treatment for mental disorder by a court or tribunal are: civil emergency detention under Part 5 of the 2003 Act, and short-term detention under Part 6 of the 2003 Act.</p>

  <p>In relation to emergency detention, the authorised period of detention is just 72 hours and the purpose of the detention is to determine what medical treatment requires to be provided to the patient. There is no general authority to give treatment for mental disorder under an emergency detention certificate.</p>

  <p>A short-term detention certificate does enable treatment to be given, in accordance with part 16 of the 2003 Act. Volume 1, Chapter 10 of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 Code of Practice provides guidance on the provision of medical treatment for mental disorder which are set out in part 16, including the issue of consent.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it considers that, as a matter of course, the solicitor representing a person detained under the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 should be able to cross-examine the responsible medical officer and the mental health officer to test whether the criteria for compulsory treatment are met.</p>

  <p>Volume 2, Chapter 7 of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 Code of Practice provides guidance on the processes involved in preparing an application for a compulsory treatment order. This includes guidance on the involvement of the Mental Health Tribunal which determines the application and on the individuals who will be allowed to give evidence at a hearing.</p>

  <p>The Mental Health Tribunal has a wide discretion in terms of its powers to allow a patient&rsquo;s solicitor to examine the responsible medical officer and the mental health officer&rsquo;s evidence. The tribunal also has wide powers of its own to inquire into the evidence available. Scottish ministers would expect that a patient&rsquo;s legal representative would have the opportunity to examine the evidence before the tribunal and that the tribunal would otherwise probe the evidence itself.</p>

Likewise, the duty on the mental health officer to interview the patient and take the other required steps before deciding whether to consent to the granting of a short-term detention certificate is subject to the caveat at subsection (2) of section 45, where it is impracticable to do so.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what its position is on the view that the treatment of a person sectioned under the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 is too reliant on the skills and integrity of the responsible medical officer assigned to that person under the act.</p>

  <p>Volume 2, Chapter 7 of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 Code of Practice details the procedures to be followed by the responsible medical officer (RMO). Where practicable the RMO must consult a Mental Health Officer (MHO) and obtain their consent to the granting of the emergency detention certificate. Where MHO consent is refused the emergency detention certificate may not be granted and the patient may not be detained.</p>

  <p>A range of professionals are involved in the care and treatment of an individual under the act. An individual who is required to receive care and/or treatment will have an MHO appointed to work for them. The MHO&rsquo;s responsibilities include interviewing the individual, advising them of their rights, providing consent for the individual to be assessed or treated in hospital under compulsory measures, applying for a CTO and advising the Mental Welfare Commission and the individual&rsquo;s named person if they have been detained in hospital or when an application is being made for a CTO. The MHO may also liaise with hospital staff and other members of the multi-disciplinary team involved in the care of an individual.</p>

  <p>Anyone carrying out duties or giving someone treatment under the act, e.g. doctors, nurses and social workers, has to follow the principles set out in the act which are to ensure that individuals are treated with respect. This includes taking account of; the patient&rsquo;s past and present wishes about their care and treatment; the views of their named person, guardian or welfare attorney; the range of options available for their care and treatment; what will ensure the maximum benefit for them; making sure that they are not being treated any less favourably because they are being treated under the act, and the individual&rsquo;s abilities and background.</p>

  <p>Antipsychotic medicines are an important group of medicines that are very effective in the treatment of conditions such as schizophrenia, agitation, anxiety, mania and aggression. The use of such medicines is recommended within clinical guidelines such as those produced by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN).</p>

  <p>As with all medicines, the available data on efficacy and safety are carefully considered at the time of licensing to ensure the benefits outweigh any potential risks. Once marketed, the safety of all medicines, including antipsychotics, is monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the independent scientific expert advisory group the Commission on Human Medicines. Any new safety concerns that arise are thoroughly evaluated and the balance of risks and benefits is kept under continuous review.</p>

  <p>All medicines have the potential to cause unwanted side-effects. The side-effects associated with antipsychotic medicines are well recognised and information and guidance on the use of these treatments is available from a number of sources such as the British National Formulary <a href="http://www.bnf.org" target="_blank">www.bnf.org</a> and the Patient Information Leaflet, which should be supplied with the medicine.</p>

  <p>In every case, the decision whether or not to prescribe any treatment for a patient depends on the clinical judgement of the doctor concerned wherever possible in consultation with the patient and also bearing in mind the risks and benefits of treatment.</p>

  <p>It is always a matter of regret if any patient experiences a serious adverse event associated with medication. The risks associated with medicines must be considered against the potential benefits of the treatment and antipsychotics are extremely effective medicines for the treatment of serious conditions including schizophrenia, agitation, anxiety, mania and aggression. The decision to treat a patient with an antipsychotic drug is primarily based on clinical judgement taking into account the patient&rsquo;s condition as well as the risks and benefits of treatment.</p>

  <p>The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the expert independent scientific advisory group the Commission for Human Medicines continuously monitor the safety of all medicines available on the UK market. The MHRA ensures that all medicines are supplied with product information which accurately reflects current knowledge and contains the necessary information to aid the safe use of medicine. This includes information about risk minimisation measures for important risks and, where appropriate, also as advice about how patients should be monitored and under what circumstances consideration should be given to stopping the medicine.</p>

  <p>More generally, it is important to note that the occurrence of an adverse event may not necessarily mean that it was caused by the medicine. Many factors have to be taken into account in assessing causal relationships, including the possible contribution of concomitant medication and the patient&rsquo;s underlying condition.</p>

  <p>There are, at present, two established international classification systems for mental disorders - ICD.1O and DSM-IV which have specific criteria laid down which have to fulfilled to enable a diagnosis to be made.</p>

  <p>Sometimes a diagnosis may change e.g. an individual may appear to have a psychotic condition such as schizophrenia, due to drug taking, which then disappears after treatment and drug withdrawal.</p>

  <p>Also throughout a lifetime an individual&rsquo;s diagnosis may change as different symptoms emerge.</p>

  <p>If an individual has concerns that they have been misdiagnosed then there are a range of options open to them, including that: they may ask for a second opinion; they may apply to the tribunal for revocation of the order; or they may contact the Mental Welfare Commission to look into their complaint.</p>

  <p>In October we will be starting a further phase of consultation on the consolidated Scottish Planning Policy (SPP) to reflect legislative changes since the publication of the draft SPP and in response to representations made on the consultation. A six week consultation on these policy changes will provide a further opportunity to consider the government&rsquo;s response to some of the issues raised in the consultation.</p>

  <p>This would depend on the nature of the consents involved in a particular case. The range of potential material considerations is very wide and can only be determined in the context of each case, but may include carbon impact. It is for the decision maker to decide if a consideration is material and the weight to be attached to it when deciding whether to grant or refuse planning permission. The Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 will place a duty on public bodies to exercise their functions in a way best calculated to contribute to the delivery of carbon reduction targets.</p>

  <p>The Strategic Transport Projects Review (STPR) has recommended a targeted programme of measures to improve road standards on the A82 between Glasgow and Oban/Fort William and reduce accident severity rates between Fort William and Inverness.</p>

  <p>In addition to a general upgrade of the route, the measures would include:</p>

  <p>carriageway widening at selected locations between Tarbet and Inverarnan and Corran Ferry and Fort William, and</p>

  <p>physical works including climbing lanes at Loch Tulla, overtaking lay-bys aimed at providing safer overtaking opportunities and improving journey time reliability and safety targeted measures such as hard strips, junction improvements and local realignment.</p>

  <p>On the section between Fort William and Inverness, measures recommended to reduce accident severity include physical works aimed at providing safer overtaking opportunities, hard strip provision for agricultural vehicles and junction improvements.</p>

  <p>A timetable for undertaking this work will be set in the context of overall affordability and our commitments to other STPR proposals.</p>

  <p>Within the current programme work is progressing to deliver improvements at Pulpit Rock and a new Western bypass at Crianlarich. We are currently engaging with interested stakeholders, including Hitrans and SPT to discuss a vision for the A82.</p>

  <p>There is no requirement in the Police Act 1997 (the legislation under which Disclosure Scotland operates) for criminal record checks to be carried out. It is, however, an offence (under the Protection of Children (Scotland) Act 2003) for an employer to offer such work to someone who is disqualified. It is also an offence for someone who is disqualified from working with children to seek work in a child care post in Scotland. Teaching is a child care post and a prospective employer would have to be satisfied that an offence was not being committed with regard to a new member of staff.</p>

  <p>Current Disclosure Scotland checks are not transferable because they are post-specific meaning that their content could vary from employer to employer. Also, employers cannot share certificates with each other. The subject of the check can show his or her certificate to anyone but that does not mean that a future employer would be willing to accept one from an earlier date.</p>

  <p>Under arrangements to be introduced next year, teachers &ndash; and others working with vulnerable groups &ndash; will apply once to join the new Protecting Vulnerable Groups Scheme. Once they are a member of this scheme, employers would be notified of any change in the disclosure status of their employees. Any new employer would be able to perform a simple check to ensure that a prospective new employee to work with vulnerable groups is already a member of the scheme.</p>

  <p>A Disclosure Scotland check is one aspect of good recruitment practice and it should be used in conjunction with interviewing, taking up references and exploring career history. Local authority recruitment policy and employment decisions are matters for councils and it would not be appropriate for ministers to comment on either.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, given the shortage of teaching positions and the rise in those seeking teaching supply positions, whether it will consider making teaching disclosure arrangements portable so that there are no unnecessary delays in supply teachers securing work.</p>

  <p>It has been recognised that a Disclosure Scotland check is valid only on the day of issue. This means that they are not portable and this can be a burden for some users. This will change when the Protection of Vulnerable Groups (Scotland) Scheme (&quot;PVG Scheme&quot;) is introduced next year.</p>

  <p>The PVG Scheme will establish a membership scheme that people doing regulated work (and that includes teaching) will be able to join. The PVG Scheme will be membership-based and workforce specific. This means that membership will be portable between posts in the same workforce. One advantage for the scheme member and the prospective employer is that once someone is in the PVG Scheme, a full written application will not be needed if the teacher moves to a new post in a different council area. A scheme record update will be available that will confirm to the new employer that membership is still valid.</p>

  <p>At week ending, 6 September 2009, the average turnaround time for standard and enhanced applications that were correctly completed and which did not require further enquiries disclosures was 7.6 days. An enhanced disclosure would be the level requested for teaching positions.</p>

  <p>The report is now expected to be published at the end of December 2009. This is due to the need for more detailed traffic impact assessments to be carried out in relation to committed development proposals in this area.</p>

  <p>The consultation draft of Scotland&rsquo;s Zero Waste Plan is clear that all parts of the public, voluntary &amp; private sectors need to demonstrate best Zero Waste practice in areas such as waste prevention, re-use, recycling and sustainable procurement. The consultation document can be found at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2009/08/19141153/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2009/08/19141153/0</a> .</p>

  <p>As part of the consultation exercise and the process of finalising the Zero Waste Plan, the Scottish Government will consider future requirements for monitoring progress, as well as building the evidence base to achieve consistency between zero waste and sustainable economic growth. The Scottish Government will produce progress reports on Zero Waste achievements.</p>

  <p>The forthcoming Scottish Sustainable Procurement Action Plan will give guidance to public sector organisations on how to procure more sustainably. The action plan will include reference to some key points on how to minimise waste, for example by considering how to avoid waste when drawing up contractual requirements. This would ensure that construction contractors have waste prevention and management plans in place to forecast outcomes, specifying recycled content when purchasing materials such as paper and packaging, and specifying minimum packaging, reusable packaging and take-back of packaging.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s current target to recycle 80% of the waste that we produce across our estate by 2011 remains in place and in 2007-08 we achieved a 76% recycle rate for waste.</p>
