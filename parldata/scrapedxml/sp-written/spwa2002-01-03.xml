  <p>The Scottish Executive provides underpinning support to all parts of the Scottish sheep industry via various methods, including direct payments to producers, and by funding initiatives relating to improving sheep health and genetics, animal traceability and marketing. Some specific measures such as the Ram Purchase Scheme, Highlands and Islands Sheep Strategy, and Highlands and Islands Veterinary Services Scheme are aimed specially at communities in the Highlands and Islands. It is, however, for individual producers to seek advice from relevant advisory organisations in order to develop production procedures which suit their own individual farming circumstances.</p>

  <p>The department gives priority to the payment of subsidies. Figures for specific areas are not readily available. But for Scotland as a whole, payments under the Arable Area Payments Scheme (AAPS) started on 16 November 2001, the first possible date under the EU legislation. By Christmas some 80% of AAPS claimants have had over &#163;94 million paid into their bank accounts. The department is confident that it will meet its EU obligations to pay more than 96% of AAPS payments by the end of January 2002.</p>

  <p>In addition, more than &#163;78 million has been paid out under the various livestock schemes since the beginning of November 2001. This covers almost all of the claims eligible for payment.</p>

  <p>Immigration and asylum are reserved matters. The Home Office advise that around 1,560 unaccompanied children aged 17 or under applied for asylum in the United Kingdom in the first two quarters of 2001.

  <p>Under the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 local authorities have duties towards all children in their areas irrespective of immigration status. Comprehensive guidance on these duties was issued to local authorities in preparation for implementation of the Act in 1997.

This includes children of asylum seekers within their area. Education authorities have a duty to provide adequate and efficient school education for their area.</p>

  <p>In relation to pre-school education, the children of asylum seekers have the same access to pre-school education as other children of pre-school age, resident in a local authority area.

  <p>Psychologists should be familiar with the concept of the triad of impairments characteristic of autism, the range of autistic spectrum disorders and the most common approaches to teaching autistic children.</p>

  <p>Their understanding should arise from their training - where they are introduced to literature on autism - and through practical experience of working with children with autism during placements. In addition, educational psychologists already in post will have opportunities to update their knowledge of autism through Continuing Professional Development (CPD).</p>

  <p>It is the responsibility of each trust, as the employer, to ensure that individuals have the training required to provide effective patient care. The amount of additional training provided locally by trusts for the treatment of specific conditions will differ according to local needs. Information on such training is not available centrally but will be held by local NHS management.

  <p>There are currently no specific incentives for clinical psychologists to train in autistic spectrum disorders. However, the Scottish Council for Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education (SCPMDE) is considering a number of initiatives to ensure that the training strategy for clinical psychology remains responsive to changing service needs.</p>

  <p>There are also no specific incentives available for teachers to specialise and train in autism and Asperger&#146;s syndrome. Teachers are expected to undertake continuing professional development (CPD) as part of their work, and will be expected to fulfil an additional 35 hours CPD from August 2003. The Chartered Teacher programme, to be available from August 2003, is likely to include a module on Special Educational Needs which may cover these syndromes. An additional pay increment is available with every two modules passed.</p>

  <p>General practitioners, like other professionals, are encouraged to look at their own personal learning needs and the health needs of their patients and to seek training in specific areas accordingly. Guidance and assistance is available from SCPMDE via the postgraduate Directors of General Practice Education. Each GP already receives an annual Postgraduate Education Allowance to support an agreed amount of training.</p>

  <p>A theoretical knowledge of autistic spectrum disorder is required for all candidates sitting the examination for membership of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, which is the first-level qualification for all those aspiring to become consultant psychiatrists. In the second phase of training, as specialist registrars, candidates for child and adolescent psychiatry posts will all be trained in the assessment, management and collaborative approach to the problems experienced by people with autistic spectrum disorder, and those who care for them.</p>

  <p>Two objectives govern relocation decisions. First, the location of organisations should promote efficiency and effectiveness. Second, subject to the first objective, the work of the Scottish Executive and related bodies should be close to the communities they serve. When relocation is being considered, no parts of the country are targeted, nor are any ruled out. Each relocation decision is viewed on its own merits and a decision is taken about where each organisation should be situated, based on the relevant factors in each case. Argyll and Bute will continue to be considered as a potential area for relocation.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Vandalism covers a wide range of offences and includes all forms of damage to trains. The decreases which are evidenced have been caused by changes in recording practice adopted by the British Transport Police.</p>

  <p>2. Stone throwing is a generic term and relates to any minor item thrown at rolling stock and the railway infrastructure which does not cause any damage.</p>

  <p>In September 2000, the Piping Centre in Glasgow received a grant of &#163;250,000 from the Scottish Executive. In November 2001 they were granted &#163;300,000. Both grants were offered to reduce the debt of the centre and thus help it continue to provide tuition for musicians.</p>

  <p>The company has also accessed from the council a &#163;500,000 advance of their 2002 to 2003 core revenue funding grant in order to assist in its management of cash flow.</p>

  <p>The Executive has given no direct financial assistance to the company.</p>

  <p>The Executive has awarded the Piping Centre &#163;550,000 in this period for this purpose (I refer the member to the answer given to question S1W-21105).

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally.

  <p>The draft guidance, which has been issued for consultation until March 2002, indicates that authorities do not have an automatic right of access to a home educating family's home. It recommends that where a family does not feel comfortable in allowing an education officer into their home, the authority should respect their views and arrange a meeting in a mutually acceptable location.</p>

  <p>Although it is recognised that the learning environment has a key bearing on the effectiveness of learning, authorities should, in the majority of cases, be able to assess the suitability of the education being provided without gaining access to the child&#146;s home.</p>

  <p>The draft guidance also suggests, however, that it is reasonable for authorities to be given access to the home educated child in order to adequately assess the child's progress and to satisfy themselves that the child is receiving a suitable education.</p>

  <p>Guidelines for initial teacher education courses in Scotland, which are in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 18071), require that courses prepare teachers entering the profession to be responsive to the needs of all pupils in respect of health and general well being. The guidelines are not prescriptive and each training institution develops their own programme.</p>

  <p>Good practice guidance on the administration of medicine in schools, which is in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 15847), recommends that school staff should have general awareness training of a number of medical conditions.</p>

  <p>It is the responsibility of local authorities, as employers, to ensure a wide range of Continuing Professional Development opportunities is available for teachers. This should include a range of activities that ensures teachers are well prepared to deal with pupils' health issues.</p>

  <p>The working group on the re-integration of pre-school education grant considered the recommendations of the Deferrals Working Group as part of their examination of the costs of re-integration.

  <p>Questions as to the adequacy of the provision of general medical services in any area are for the Scottish Medical Practices Committee in conjunction with Islands NHS Boards and Primary Care Trusts. I understand that the vacancy created when the GP who provided services to Helmsdale left earlier this year was filled on 1 September 2001.</p>

  <p>The variety of GM oilseed rape currently being grown in the farm scale trials in Scotland has been modified to be tolerant to glufosinate ammonium (Liberty&#212; ). The Scottish Executive does not hold details of other chemicals and herbicides used by the farmers since this is not a requirement of the deliberate release consent.</p>

  <p>Other crop treatments that the farmers choose to use will be commercially available, with necessary regulatory approvals for use in UK agriculture.</p>

  <p>The recently published research on this issue will be referred to the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE) for expert advice. When ACRE present their advice the Scottish Executive will consider it in the context of the farm scale evaluation programme and of policy development on GM crops generally.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what information it has on whether one of the genetically modified oil-seed rape plants being grown in the field trial at Roskil Farm on the Black Isle has flowered several months ahead of the normal flowering time and, if this has happened, whether it was the result of genetically instability in the plant caused by genetic engineering.</p>

  <p>Following a site visit, the Scottish Executive can confirm that a plant within the GM oil-seed rape crop growing at Tullich field has flowered, as has an oil-seed rape plant among the non-GM control crop. On the GM side of the field, this represents one plant amidst an estimated 6.7 million GM oil-seed rape plants and does not enable definitive conclusions to be drawn. Although it is premature for rape plants to flower at this time of year, this phenomenon has been experienced in many plants this winter following a period of uncharacteristically mild weather. The GM Inspectorate monitor all of the release sites in Scotland to ensure that the terms of each consent are complied with and that any developments which may pose a threat to the environment are identified.</p>

  <p>It is for health services and local authorities to work together to organise eating disorders services that meet the assessed needs of their area. To aid local considerations we have published a template for the best organisation of eating disorder services.</p>

  <p>The template guidance acknowledges the specialist support networks, knowledge and advice available through organisations such as the Scottish Eating Disorder Interest Group, Health Education Board for Scotland and other specialist voluntary and professional organisations. Planners are also encouraged to respond positively to the views of service users and carers whose insights are particularly relevant in the planning of services.</p>

  <p>As <i>Patient Focus and Public Involvement</i> requires, patients - and those that care for them - must be involved in decisions about their own care and about the health services they use. The involvement of members of family groups, many of whom play a vital carer role, is a key element of this work.</p>

  <p>In particular, the Executive also supports the development of targeted initiatives, like <i>Partners in Policymaking,</i> specifically designed to enable the families of disabled children to become fully involved in decisions about their care. The Clinical Standards Board for Scotland similarly involves family members in their work on developing standards for care in NHSScotland.</p>

  <p><i>Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change</i> makes clear that every NHS Trust is expected to have in place an infection control policy. In addition, the NHS will adhere to infection control standards established by the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland (CSBS). The board will arrange regular reviews of performance against these standards, and the results will be published.

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally. However, NHS Scotland has contingency plans in place in every NHS board for dealing with major emergencies, and these plans are reviewed and exercised regularly. They include arrangements for making available hospital beds for treating casualties and for mutual assistance where the resources of more than one NHS board area would be required to deal with a particular incident.</p>

  <p>A distinct self-employment route has been available through New Deal 18-24 since its inception and through New Deal 25 plus since April 2001. The route consists of three stages with Stages 1 &amp; 2 delivered in the Gateway and Stage 3 as part of the Employment Option or Intensive Activity Period (IAP) respectively. Prior to April individuals joining New Deal 25 plus and seeking to be self-employed could be referred to Training for Work (TfW). Clients participating in other New Deal programmes are also supported in moving into self-employment.</p>

  <p>Data is not available across all New Deals detailing the total number of individuals who have received New Deal self-employment support and returned to benefits. The information below may be helpful in giving an indication of outcomes.</p>

  <p>Three hundred and sixty six young people had followed the self-employment route through New Deal 18-24 up to the end of September 2001. Of these, 145 (45%) had returned to claiming JSA within 18 months.</p>

  <p>Published figures for the enhanced New Deal 25 plus are available from April 2001 &#8211; September 2001. Fourteen New Deal 25 plus clients have started mainstream self-employment provision and 20 clients have started New Deal for Musicians IAP self-employment provision. Data is not yet available regarding New Deal 25 plus clients returning to benefits from self-employment provision.</p>

  <p>Nine per cent of New Deal 50 plus clients, 557 individuals, claiming the employment credit on the basis of being of being self-employed (end September).</p>

  <p>One hundred and ninety three self-employed job entries in TfW in 2000-01. (96 to end September 2001).</p>

  <p>The poundage supplement for ratepayers occupying property with a rateable value in excess of &#163;25,000 will be fixed when the poundage figure is set for 2003-04. A provisional poundage figure for 2003-04 is likely to be announced in December 2003 and confirmed the following February.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what information it has on the percentage of children under five years old in nursery places in each education authority in each year since 1994.</p>

  <p>The following table shows the percentage of children under five years old in nursery places in each education authority for 2001. This was the first year for which an integrated census covering both pre-school education and daycare centres was carried out. Prior to that, figures for pre-school education centres were collected separately, and annually, from the figures from daycare services, which we collected on a three-yearly cycle. From previous data sets it is not possible to consistently identify nurseries and bring together the pre-school and daycare data for the period in question.</p>

  <p>Percentage of children in each local authority attending centres describing themselves as nurseries in the week of 29 January 2001</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Participation figures are taken from the January 2001 Census of Children's Daycare and Pre-School Education, as reported by individual centres. In order to give the most complete picture possible, figures from the census have been grossed up to take account of non-response. Some alterations and imputations were also made to compensate for problems caused by incomplete or incorrect data.</p>

  <p>2. Centres were asked to select the facility type (one only from nursery, playgroup, playscheme, out of school care club, cr&egrave;che or family centre) which <i>best</i> suited them. Centres included here are those which described themselves as nurseries; these centres may also offer other services e.g. nurseries with cr&egrave;che facilities. Centres offering nursery services which have <i>not</i> described themselves as predominantly nurseries are not included here.</p>

  <p>3. Centres reported all children attending at any time during census week. As the census was carried out at individual centre level, any child attending more than one centre during census week will have been counted more than once. For example, if a child attended two centres, that child will have been counted once by each centre. For this reason, actual participation rates may be lower than they appear here.</p>

  <p>4. The local authority figures relate to the geographical location of each centre, rather than the area in which attending children live. Children may attend centres in local authority areas away from their homes. For example, a child living in a rural area may attend a nursery in the city in which a parent or guardian works.</p>

  <p>5. Population figures are taken from the General Register Office (Scotland) mid-year estimates for 2000.</p>

  <p>The pay and conditions of nursery nurses are a matter for their employers, whether local authorities or operators in the private or voluntary sector. The Executive has no role in these negotiations. As part of wider discussions on childcare workforce development issues, COSLA has recently updated officials on the review of pay and conditions of nursery nurses being carried out under the Single Status Agreement.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer given to question S1W-20777 on 3 January 2002.</p>

  <p>Under the Single Status Agreement negotiated between local authority employers and relevant trades unions, the pay and conditions of almost all local government employees are being reviewed. A consequence of the agreement is that terms and conditions, including hourly rates of pay, will be set locally, taking account of the relative value placed upon jobs and the pay budget set by individual authorities.</p>

  <p>The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) now plans to undertake follow-up work to look more closely at individual worker histories at National Semiconductor (UK) Ltd in Greenock. The Scottish Executive has already expressed a willingness to help with that research, which will have to take account of factors unrelated to work.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive recognised that NHS staff throughout Scotland, particularly GPs in and around Greenock, might be consulted following the publication of the Health and Safety Executive&#8217;s report <i>Cancer Among Current and Previous Workers at National Semiconductor (UK) Ltd, Greenock</i> . As such, the Scottish Executive ensured that they were aware of this study, and had the information they might need to deal with specific concerns or symptoms presented by patients.</p>

  <p>NHS Boards do not need to make special arrangements for healthcare delivery based on this report. <i>Cancer in</i> <i>Scotland</i>, published in July 2001, sets out a comprehensive range of measures designed to provide swifter, better diagnosis, treatment and care.</p>

  <p>The information provided in response to question S1W-5623 was collected from reports in the daily Scottish newspapers. In November 2001, we reviewed the robustness of this information and considered that as the Executive could not vouch for its accuracy or completeness it should not form the basis of the responses to questions S1W-19322 to 19330. But I apologise for not explaining that in the answers.</p>

  <p>We published two reports on Scotland&#8217;s renewable energy resource on 10 December. The first outlined the huge scale of that resource, including onshore and offshore wind, marine energy and biomass. The second, related, report, into the Scottish electricity grid, found that there is enough existing capacity to allow our renewable energy targets under the Renewables Obligation (Scotland) to be met. Both reports are available on the Scottish Executive website.</p>

  <p>The Performance Audit Group (PAG) carries out auditing and monitoring of the activities of the Operating Company, BEAR Scotland Ltd, across the entire North East Unit, which includes Fife. However, the auditing and reporting is not carried out on a local authority boundary basis. A report, prepared by PAG, covering the first year of operation of the trunk road maintenance contracts will be published in summer 2002.</p>

  <p>In the week ending 7 December 2001 PAG was asked to report on the mobilisation by BEAR Scotland Ltd of the new operational depot at Lochgelly from which operations in Fife are undertaken. This audit was prompted by Fife Council&#8217;s decision to terminate its sub-contract to undertake winter and other operations for BEAR on 7 December 2001. The PAG report confirmed BEAR&#8217;s capability to undertake those winter maintenance activities previously sub-contracted to Fife Council.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is aware of only a limited number of representations regarding the performance of BEAR Scotland Ltd in respect of the trunk road maintenance contract in the Fife area. These are as follows:</p>

  <p>Early in the contract Fife Council raised concerns about the level of liaison between themselves and BEAR. Measures were implemented to improve liaison.</p>

  <p>An MSP wrote about unfinished work at the Bankhead Interchange. BEAR addressed this work.</p>

  <p>Several maintenance problems, including verge maintenance and street lighting, were identified by a local councillor in the <i>Dundee Courier</i>. All these issues have been resolved.</p>

  <p>A resident north of Glenrothes wrote in October to complain about the maintenance of a footpath. It was not possible to identify the footpath in question.</p>

  <p>The time taken to process motorways and strategic roads schemes from inception to delivery depends on a number of factors, including the complexity of the proposals, the number of objections received, the time taken at any public local inquiry and the need for any subsequent discussion, for example with landowners. Information on the time taken in all such cases is not held centrally.</p>

Recently there were public exhibitions of proposals for the Eastern Relief Road at Kincardine and the Fochabers- Mosstodloch Bypass on the A96. Business, industry, local enterprise companies and community interests are also closely involved in the transport corridor studies on the A8/M8, A80/M80 and the M74.</p>

  <p>There have been a limited number of relatively minor changes to the trunk road maintenance contracts since 1 April 2001. The one alteration to the specification resulted from a requirement of the Scottish Executive to enhance the quality of driver information feeding into its National Driver Information and Control System (NADICS). In respect of the provisions dealing with media contact, revised procedures were agreed in writing between the Executive&#8217;s Director of Road Network Management and Maintenance Division, BEAR Scotland Ltd and Amey Highways Ltd and were put in place in October 2001.</p>

  <p>Prior to the 2000-01 round, applicants to the Scottish Rural Partnership Fund (SRPF) were not required to provide details of their local authority area to the department. This detail, coupled with the fact that electronic recording of application data was not undertaken, means that the information requested could only be obtained at disproportionate cost. However, it is possible to give an answer that refers to the successful bids submitted by Stirling and Clackmannanshire districts for the 2000-01 and 2001-02 rounds.</p>

  <p>No. It would not be appropriate for the Executive to disclose information which would harm the frankness and candour of discussion and advice, including between the Scottish Executive and UK Government and between the Executive and the Scottish Transport Group and the Trustees of the Scottish Transport Group pensions schemes.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive recognises the level of public interest regarding this matter. In this respect the Scottish Executive is therefore maintaining a website (<a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/transport/stgpf" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/transport/stgpf</a>) with information on the matter of the ex-gratia payments and will update this when there are substantial developments to report.

  <p>The recent teacher recruitment advertising campaign had the twin objectives of improving the perception of teaching as a worthwhile and rewarding career and increasing the numbers of talented people entering the teaching profession.</p>

It should be noted that 70% of callers responding to the most recent campaign in October this year were in the 25 to 44 age group.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not currently fund these services and has no plans specifically in relation to befriending and mentoring services. However, national voluntary organisations are free to seek financial support from the Scottish Executive&#8217;s direct grant schemes. Details of how voluntary organisations can apply for funding can be found in the leaflet <i>A Guide for the Voluntary Sector to Scottish Executive Grants</i> , which is available from the Scottish Executive and the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre. General advice on funding for the voluntary sector is available from the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations.</p>

  <p>The water authorities have estimated that it would cost the generality of their customers just over &#163;11 million a year at today&#8217;s prices were they to continue to provide reliefs on water charges for the voluntary and charitable sectors. It follows that the phased withdrawal of reliefs will ultimately result in these sectors paying increased charges of just over &#163;11 million a year at current charge prices.</p>

  <p>Premises receiving a free supply of water are generally farm properties connected to aqueducts running between water sources and treatment works. Such supplies were often provided to land owners when aqueducts were being constructed as part of the deal for allowing the aqueduct to cross their land. The annual cost of providing these supplies is a matter for the water authorities. This information is not held centrally.</p>
