  <p>The Executive is highly supportive of the work of Young Enterprise Scotland in its efforts to promote enterprise in schools and support the development of &quot;core&quot; skills. We are particularly encouraged by the degree of private sector involvement in the organisation. Education for Work and Enterprise in schools is delivered in a variety of ways and by a wide range of bodies. The agenda includes programmes offering practical work experience for secondary school pupils, curriculum guidelines on delivering enterprise education and support for the National Centre: Education for Work and Enterprise which provides strategic direction to the agenda.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the evidence by the Minister for Rural Affairs to the Rural Affairs Committee on 3 December 1999 that &pound;2.5 million of European funding was lost to the Highlands and Islands agricultural programme between 1995 to 1999 due to currency fluctuations, whether it will provide details of the funding lost due to currency fluctuations on all European programmes for each of the last five years listed by programme.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-06-05.7.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80155" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa0605.htm#e5">

  <p>I apologise for the delay in answering this question.</p>

  <p>The aggregate sterling value of individual EU programmes is dependent on the euro/sterling exchange rate at the time that money is drawn down from the European Commission. These draw-downs will continue over the next two years as grants are paid out under the 1994-1999 EU programmes. The impact of currency fluctuations will not therefore be known until 2002. The &pound;2.5 million figure quoted at the Rural Affairs Committee meeting represented an interim estimate of the effects of exchange rates on the sterling value of EU resources drawn down, at various exchange rates, and in several instalments since 1994, which have been allocated to the Highlands and Islands Agricultural Programme. This figure will be subject to change depending on exchange rates between the time that the &pound;2.5 million was calculated and 2002.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to say that significant progress has been made. I have placed a copy of the progress report in SPICe. It details the items where work has been completed, where action is currently in hand and where longer-term action is required because of the need for UK co-ordination or EC approval. <br /></p>
