  <p>The evaluation report which was published in 1998 certainly paints a very positive picture. The vast majority of the communities in which the initiative operated were very supportive of its aims and effectiveness. It is, of course, an operational matter for individual Chief Constables in association with their local authority to determine whether such measures provide the means to address issues of particular concern in their areas.</p>

  <p>It is standard practice for all of the emergency services themselves to review any major incident and thereafter make any necessary amendments, additions or enhancements to procedures. Outcomes will be notified to the Scottish Executive either through the Strathclyde Emergencies Co-ordinating Committee &#8211; on which all of the emergency services are represented - or through the Association of Chief Police Officers (Scotland) Standing Working Group on Emergency Procedures. The Executive attend both of these groups. Account will be taken of any lessons for major incident planning generally.</p>

  <p>Building standards have been reviewed and proposals for improved standards to conserve fuel and power were set out in a consultation paper issued on 24 July 2000. Responses were requested by 27 October 2000. Over 60 responses have now been received and are to be considered by a working party of the Building Standards Advisory Committee.</p>

  <p>To implement the proposals, which will require significant changes in construction practice, supporting technical guidance has to be prepared. When the standards are complete a three-month standstill period is required while the EC consults other member states to ensure the proposals do not represent a barrier to the trade in construction products. The amendments, which form part of a large set of changes proposed for building standards, will be introduced by Scottish Statutory Instrument, probably in August 2001 to come into force in November 2001.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive recognises the high importance of ensuring businesses have access to the telecommunications they need to help them achieve maximum competitiveness. This will largely be achieved through the promotion of competition.</p>

  <p>There are, however, actions falling to the Executive which may contribute. These will include building on public sector demand for higher bandwidth services to encourage the spread of appropriate infrastructure. The Executive is now in discussion with UK departments on these issues.</p>

  <p>Details of expenditure by Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) on Management Agreements for Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) made under section 15 of the Countryside Act 1968 are available in <i>Facts and Figures</i> published annually by SNH and held in SPICe. The table below sets out that information, which includes expenditure on SSSIs that are also classified as Special Protection Areas or have been proposed as Special Areas of Conservation. The higher level of expenditure in 1991-92 to 1993-94 reflects a small number of large compensatory management agreements, which paid land managers for <i>not</i> going ahead with damaging operations. Additional funding provided from SNH grant aid and from other Scottish Executive agri-environment programmes and from the Woodland Grant Scheme has also helped to secure beneficial management of protected areas. It is not currently possible to disaggregate from these schemes the amount of money spent on protected areas. SNH also offer management schemes targeted at particular habitats and species. Their intended expenditure on these schemes in the current year is &pound;804,722 and principally supports the management of protected areas.</p>

  <p>This information is not available. Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) consults all those with interests in land affected by a proposed designation but does not require proprietors to specify the nature of their tenure of that land. A project to record centrally information on owners and occupiers for each Site of Special Scientific Interest, including total numbers, is currently being undertaken.

All applicants are notified of the outcome of their application and the reasons for its success or failure. Details of successful applications for next year were announced last month and are available on the Scottish Executive website.</p>

  <p>Two Social Inclusion Partnerships (SIPs) have been established specifically to address the exclusion of people from minority ethnic communities. The Glasgow Anti-Racist Alliance Social Inclusion Partnership and the Frae Fife Social Inclusion Partnership receive funding of &pound;781,000 and &pound;165,000 respectively in 2000-01 from the Scottish Executive&#8217;s Social Inclusion Partnership Fund. These funding allocations were based on the bids for Social Inclusion Partnership status which were approved by an independent advisory group. There are no plans to establish any new Social Inclusion Partnerships at this stage.</p>

  <p>However, <i>all</i> of Scotland&#8217;s 48 Social Inclusion Partnerships are important vehicles for addressing injustice and discrimination wherever it occurs. Area-based SIPs are already required to monitor their impact on women, people with disabilities, and people from minority ethnic communities. We are currently undertaking research to review the extent to which this has been achieved and whether more needs to be done.</p>

  <p>We recognise the importance of ensuring that retained units are kept up to strength. The Scottish Central Fire Brigades Advisory Council (SCFBAC) will shortly be considering the plans of HM Inspectorate of Fire Services to carry out a thematic review to assist in the development of strategies to improve the recruitment and retention of retained, auxiliary and volunteer firefighters. The improvement of fire services in rural areas is an ongoing process which will be greatly assisted by the increased provision for the fire service announced in the recent financial statement.</p>

  <p>The conference being held in Lyon between 18-19 December is not an Inter-Governmental meeting and the Executive will not be represented.

We are fully aware of the significance of the information society to Scotland&#8217;s economic and social development.

  <p>Community councils do not have statutory duties or powers. They are intended to act as a voice for their local community, representing the views of the community to local authorities and other public bodies operating in their area.</p>

  <p>A policy was introduced on 1 April 1998, whereby individual health boards and NHS Trusts in Scotland were given the opportunity to benefit directly from capital receipts resulting from the disposal of surplus assets.</p>

  <p>The policy introduced the general principle that health boards and NHS Trusts retain capital receipts as follows:</p>

  <p>For receipts up to &pound;500,000, the full value;</p>

  <p>For receipts over &pound;500,000 but less than &pound;1 million - &pound;500,000;</p>

  <p>For receipts over &pound;1 million but less than &pound;8 million &#8211; 50% of the value;</p>

  <p>For receipts over &pound;8 million - &pound;4 million</p>

  <p>The retention of a greater share of a capital receipt, up to the full value, may be permitted following the approval of a business case by the Scottish Executive Health Department. The Health Department is currently examining how further improvement can be achieved in the disposal of surplus NHS land or other assets.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has already demonstrated its belief that an investment in staff is an investment in patient care. Last year&#8217;s pay award for nurses was implemented in full, without staging with particular targeted awards for 8,500 of our most experienced nurses who received 7.8% or more than &pound;100 per month.</p>

  <p>We realise that pay is not the only factor in encouraging skilled and experienced nurses to remain in frontline work in the NHS in Scotland and that is why guidance on family friendly policies which will address issues such as flexible working, childcare and breast feeding will be issued in the New Year. Through the Education and Training Strategy we are also investing in the skills of staff to help them perform their roles and duties and develop their full potential.</p>

  <p>In addition I have announced the creation of nine new consultant nurse posts bringing the total to 12 in Scotland. This will enable highly skilled experienced and motivated nurses to move up the career ladder whilst remaining in frontline work.</p>

  <p>The last evaluation of the extended interview process was carried out in 1995 by the Home Office Assessment and Consultancy Unit. A number of changes were made to the 1996 extended interview process including the introduction of two new exercises and eight new competencies. The extended interview process is used to select officers for attendance on the Strategic Command Course (SCC). Attendance on that course is a requirement for appointment to chief officer rank in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It is not presently a requirement in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is working in partnership with local authorities and transport operators to implement a multi-modal public transport information system covering the whole of Scotland, and with connections to other GB services, by 31 December 2000. The Scottish Executive is contributing up to &pound;1 million towards the capital and set-up costs of the new system.</p>

  <p>I announced a five-point Action Plan on Through Ticketing at the Scottish Association for Public Transport AGM in Edinburgh on 18 March. The Action Plan charted the way ahead by building on the joint ticketing arrangements included in the Transport Bill and the commitment to establish a link with the National Public Transport Timetable. The plan has been subsumed by the Transport Direct Initiative announced by DETR in their 10-Year Plan in July, in which the Scottish Executive is committed to playing a full part.</p>

  <p>Revenue support for current expenditure at the five Scottish Agricultural and Biological Research Institutes is provided through the payment of grant-in-aid. Support for capital expenditure is provided by means of grant. The sums actually paid to the institutes in 1998-99 and 1999-2000, the allocations for 2000-01, and the provisional allocations for 2001-02 are shown in the table, together with the actual or expected total staff numbers (full-time equivalents) at each institute at 1 April in each year.</p>

  <p>Tackling debt is a key element of the Scottish Executive&#8217;s Social Justice agenda and we have been working in partnership with a wide range of organisations to improve the financial services available to people on low incomes. Measures being developed or under consideration include:</p>

  <p>- Arrangements to provide free, high quality money advice for all who need it;</p>

  <p>- Encouragement of the provision and use of basic bank accounts;</p>

  <p>- Delivering wider access to low cost credit through the development of credit unions;</p>

  <p>- Provision of low cost insurance with rent schemes.</p>

  <p>The Executive is also providing active support to moves by the Department of Trade and Industry to improve lending practices of credit providers and transparency of information provided to consumers.</p>
