  <p>Neither we within the Scottish Government, nor officials within NHS boards where car parking charging schemes are in place, have any evidence that staff are leaving posts at such hospitals to work at other NHSScotland locations where car parking charges have not been introduced.</p>

  <p>It is clear that car parking spaces cannot be provided for everyone and we must strive to achieve an appropriate balance between the needs of patients, visitors and staff in the use of car parking spaces, especially where these are limited because of the constraint of a particular site. We shall continue to ensure that charges are only introduced where appropriate and necessary and that the level of charge is reasonable, with provisions in place for an appropriate allocation of staff car parking permits. Discussions and decisions on car parking policies will continue to be taken forward on a partnership approach to ensure that car parking schemes are applied consistently, fairly and transparently.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what proportion of NHS staff at hospitals where car parking charges have been introduced have been granted parking permits and on what basis applications for such passes are judged.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-04-09.S3W-10958.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80396" speakername="Nicola Sturgeon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa0409.htm#2">

  <p>The following table shows the proportion of staff with car parking permits at those NHSScotland hospital sites where car parking charges have been introduced.</p>

  <p>The criteria used in the allocation of staff car parking permits has always been a matter to be determined locally and the revised guidance issued in January supports this approach but emphasises that such criteria should only be developed and agreed in discussion on a staff partnership basis. Each board&rsquo;s area partnership forum or equivalent is likely to be the best forum for such discussions, drawing upon local expertise of the relevant services, HR managers and occupational health staff as appropriate. The criteria should take account of good employment practice, that car use may be essential to the delivery of services and personal circumstances which may justify the use of a car to travel to work, including ill health and disability and significant continuing domestic or carer commitments.</p>

  <p>The revised guidance also requires that the criteria used in determining who should be granted a permit is applied consistently and transparently and that staff are provided with clear, accessible and widely available information on site-specific procedures for the allocation and issue of car parking permits and any concessions available.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. When traffic management arrangements were first introduced within West Lothian all staff applications for permits for St John&rsquo;s Hospital were granted including those from community staff and staff based outwith St John&rsquo;s but legitimately and regularly visiting the site. The practical effect of this is that considerably more staff than simply those based at St John&rsquo;s have permits &ndash; the actual percentage of staff with permits equates to 138% of the St John&rsquo;s-based staff.</p>

  <p>2. Refers to &quot;priority permits&quot; only &ndash; staff who do not qualify for these permits are automatically entitled to a &quot;general permit&quot; available for use in public car parks.</p>

  <p>3. All staff are entitled to a permit but no guarantee that a parking space will be available.</p>

  <p>NHSScotland boards have for some time been required by the NHSScotland Environmental Management policy to co-operate with local authorities, regional transport partnerships and other stakeholders in the planning and implementation of local and regional transport strategies. By engaging in this way, we seek to ensure that through integrated transport policies NHSScotland facilities, in particular new developments, are accessible to all by public transport, as well as by other means such as walking and cycling.</p>

  <p>Boards are also required to develop site-specific travel plans as a requirement of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s national transport strategy. These plans are required by the end of April 2008, although many have been in place for a number of years, and seek to comply with the Scottish Government&rsquo;s long-term vision, objectives, priorities and plans for travel management.</p>

  <p>For those boards where car parking charges are currently in place, we shall be reviewing their current car parking schemes against the principles and criteria set out in the revised guidance.
