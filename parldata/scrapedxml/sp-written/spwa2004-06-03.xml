  <p>All the agencies involved should focus on early identification of young carers and protecting them from undertaking inappropriate caring roles. Effective multi-agency support should be available, where that is needed. To underpin this general approach, the Executive is undertaking a range of health and social care policies that are already impacting on young carers. These policies aim to improve the support and protection available to this particularly vulnerable group.</p>

  <p>The primary aim of the waterborne freight grant (WFG) scheme is to encourage the development of new water freight routes which take lorries off roads by contributing to possible revenue short fall during the first three years of operation. In exceptional circumstances WFG may also be available where, without grant support, a service which currently takes lorries off our roads by transporting freight by water will cease. In both these circumstances applicants will be required to demonstrate that after a maximum of three years the service will be capable of operating without grant support.</p>

  <p>Detailed guidance is currently being developed and every application for grant will be considered on its merits in terms of eligibility for grant assistance.</p>

  <p>The actual level of funding support available for individual waterborne freight grants will depend on a number of factors including the projected cash flows of the proposed service (applicants will need to demonstrate that the proposed shipping route will be commercially viable after three years). In addition EC state aid approval was on the basis that there would be an upper limit of grant support of 30% of the operating costs together with maximum funding of &#8364;2 million over the three years of the shipping operation. These limits were based on those already in place for a similar scheme in operation within the EU.</p>

From my meeting last week on this issue with the Chief Executive of the Further and Higher Education Funding Councils, I am satisfied that the process is now in place to ensure that all relevant concerns are being taken on board by Heriot-Watt in the run-up to any final decision on their part.</p>

  <p>Our policy aim is for pervasive, affordable broadband coverage across Scotland and we are making substantial progress. Some 82% of Scotland&#8217;s population now have access to broadband services and coverage is expected to reach around 95% by next summer.</p>

  <p>We intend to build on this success.

  <p>All prisoners undergo a health care assessment on admission to custody to identify any health care needs or problems. If a prisoner reports that they have a drug or alcohol problem this will be noted in the health care records for further assessment by a doctor who will prescribe medication if this is considered appropriate. This can include medication for detoxification, stabilisation or maintenance.</p>

  <p>Prisons also offer a range of programmes and approved activities addressing alcohol and drug addiction problems and a number of agencies work in prisons providing support and advice to prisoners. Additionally all prisoners serving under four years can access the addictions services provided by prison staff and under contract to Cranstoun Drug Services and avail themselves of the transitional care arrangements which provide for support in the community for up to 12 weeks following release.</p>

  <p>This work involves many different elements, one of which will be a campaign to promote Scotland internationally, which the First Minister announced on 25 February. Visual imagery will be a part of this effort, but no decisions have yet been taken about the role a logo might play.</p>

  <p>The Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) is required, under section 73 of the Railways Act 1993 to maintain a public register which must include copies of all franchise agreements. The SRA public register is kept at the SRA and may be viewed by appointment with the SRA Secretariat. Elements of the franchise agreement are removed as set out in section 71(2) of the Railways Act 1993. The percentage removed from each franchise agreement tends to be small and varies in each case.</p>

  <p>These arrangements apply to the current and the next franchise agreements.</p>
