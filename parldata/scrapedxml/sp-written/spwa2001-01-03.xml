  <p>The Farm Business Advisory Service is designed to meet English needs. The Scottish Executive provides resources, amounting to around &pound;5 million per annum, to the Scottish Agricultural College for the provision of advisory services to the agricultural sector on a wide range of services. Business advice to farm co-operatives is also provided from the Executive&#8217;s annual grant of &pound;0.370 million to the Scottish Agricultural Organisation Society, and Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise through individual LECs help farmers with business advice. Future priorities for the provision of advice to the agricultural sector are being considered as part of the development of a Forward Strategy for Scottish Agriculture.</p>

  <p>I hope to announce shortly the launch of a new grant scheme to assist farmers and their immediate family members who wish to create new income-generating enterprises or expand existing diversified activities, either on-farm or off-farm. The scheme will apply to the Clydesdale constituency area, and to all rural areas in lowland Scotland. A separate scheme for the Highlands and Islands was launched at the end of October.</p>

  <p>Three new schemes of financial assistance for farmers opened for applications in December. These are the Less Favoured Area Support Scheme, the Rural Stewardship Scheme and the Pig Industry Restructuring Scheme (Outgoers element). The Agricultural Marketing and Processing Scheme, the Pig Industry Restructuring Scheme (Ongoers element) and a farm diversification scheme will open early next year. All of these schemes are available within the Clydesdale parliamentary constituency area.</p>

  <p>The provision of compensation, under Article 16 of the EU Rural Development Regulation, for farmers who are operating under environmental restrictions is not mandatory. Responses to our consultation exercises did not identify this measure as a priority for investment, and I have no plans to introduce it in Scotland. Instead, support is provided from the agri-environment programme for producers who wish to adopt farming practices compatible with environmental conservation and improvement.</p>

  <p>The Joint Council for Clinical Oncology recommended maximum waiting time for radiotherapy involving complex treatment planning is four weeks.</p>

  <p>At present waiting times for radiotherapy &#8211; the time between treatment being agreed and starting &#8211; ranges from less than one to a maximum of eight weeks.</p>

  <p>Cancer Centres give high priority to starting treatment as soon as possible after clinical decisions on treatment options have been made. Clinical need is the most important factor in deciding priority. Additional investment of &pound;13.2 million in new and replacement linear accelerator equipment for radiotherapy is already being made. The first of the new equipment will come into use in April 2001. In August I announced a further &pound;15 million for new MRI scanners and other equipment to help with the treatment of cancer.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Cancer Group is preparing a cancer plan for Scotland which will be published by March 2001. The plan will include new national targets for maximum waiting times.</p>

  <p>There are no figures for the period concerned. However the 1996 Scottish House Condition Survey estimated that 88,000 pensioner households did not have any form of central heating system. We estimate that about 18,000 of those will since have had central heating installed.</p>

  <p>The need for concerted action in this area was highlighted in the House of Lords Select Committee on Science and Technology&#8217;s Report <i>Resistance</i> <i>to</i> <i>Antibiotics</i> <i>and</i> <i>other</i> <i>Microbial</i> <i>Agent</i> . In response, the UK Government gave a commitment to develop a comprehensive UK Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy and in line with this, a UK strategy document was issued earlier this year.</p>

  <p>In order to provide further focus on action in Scotland, a draft Action Plan for Scotland was issued for consultation at the same time. This covers three key inter-related elements namely surveillance, prudent antimicrobial use in human, animal and agricultural practice, and infection control. The Action Plan is currently being reviewed in the light of the comments received as part of this exercise and a revised version will be issued to a wide range of interests in due course.</p>

  <p>Also, in December 1999, as the first phase of an education campaign, the Executive launched publicity materials to further raise awareness of this issue. These included posters and leaflets that were circulated widely to GP practices, dental practitioners and pharmacists to help bring the issue to the attention of the general public. On 20 December this year, this message was reinforced at a press conference to increase public awareness of the problem.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive Health Department is advised in this area by the Advisory Group on Infection. The Advisory Group has set up a sub-group on Hospital Acquired Infection and Antimicrobial Resistance, which is currently considering a framework for antimicrobial resistance surveillance systems in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Combination antiviral therapy using interferon alpha and ribavirin is proving a successful treatment in certain cases of hepatitis C infection.

  <p>Pay negotiations are a matter for employers and the representatives of employees in the higher education sector. The Scottish Higher Education Funding Council is not an employer body nor does it take part in pay negotiations for the sector. I have had no discussions with the Secretary of State for Education and Employment on this matter nor has guidance on the handling of the current pay dispute been issued by the Secretary of State or the Executive.</p>

  <p>In my guidance letter of 23 November to SHEFC, I emphasised the need for the sector to improve human resource policies and management recognising that staff are our key resource. I believe the funding proposals for SHEFC provide sufficient headroom to increase the unit of funding to institutions to help them address modernisation issues such as management and leadership, progressive human resource policies and maintain the quality of teaching and learning.</p>

  <p>The Medicines Control Agency has advised that of these two vaccines, MMRII (PL 10592/0110) is identical to that supplied by the manufacturer Merck to the USA market. As far as they can ascertain, Priorix is not authorised for use in the USA at the present time.</p>

The New Deal aims to help unemployed people to move as quickly as possible from welfare into unsubsidised employment.

  <p>Since the franchise was let in April 1997, ScotRail has reported an eight million increase (15%) in annual passenger journeys (53.4 million in April 1997 to 61.4 million in September 2000). There has been a significant number of service enhancements across the Scottish network. Some, like the introduction of the 15 minute interval service between Edinburgh and Glasgow (leading to a 23% increase in passengers during the first year of operation), are franchise commitments. Others, such as additional services on the Nith Valley line, have been the consequence of commercial decisions made by the company. In addition, the Scottish Executive has provided revenue support to Fife Council to secure an increase of 300 seats at the morning peak on the Fife Circle.</p>

  <p>Under the last round of the Scottish Renewables Obligation in 1997, special provision was made to encourage the development of small, community-scale clusters of wind turbines. I recently launched a consultation document on a new renewables support mechanism for Scotland, the Renewables Obligation (Scotland). This will place an obligation on all electricity suppliers to supply a specified proportion of electricity from qualifying renewable sources, subject to the cost to the consumer being acceptable. We wish to explore the possibilities for more community-scale renewable energy schemes in Scotland, and have asked for views on this point.</p>

  <p>Under the Roads (Scotland) Act 1984, a road (which by definition is any way over which there is a public right of passage) can either be a public road or a private road. If it is a public road, responsibility for managing and maintaining it rests with the relevant local authority and it will be included on a list of roads which the authority is required to keep under this Act. Where a road is private, and thus unadopted by the local authority, responsibility for its maintenance rests with the owners of any land or property situated alongside the road (the frontagers).</p>

  <p>Details relating to the ownership of land, including unadopted roads, are contained in the property registers administered by the Registers of Scotland Executive Agency.</p>

  <p>Prior to 1996, the A68/A7 trunk roads provided a route between Dalkeith and the historic City of Edinburgh boundary which lay within the A720 Edinburgh City Bypass. Following a review of the trunk road network in 1996 the bypass was trunked and all the roads within the bypass became the responsibility of the new councils. This was in line with the principles of the review that the road user should be provided with a coherent and continuous system of routes which serve destinations of importance to industry, commerce, agriculture and tourism and that those roads which were of predominantly local importance should be managed locally.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no function in relation to the condition inserted in BT&#8217;s licence that mandates local loop unbundling. However, the Executive holds discussions with the UK Government and other organisations, including OFTEL as necessary. The Executive also has regular meetings with BT Scotland on a range of issues, including local loop unbundling. We anticipate that the effect of local loop unbundling for Scotland, as in the rest of the UK, will be a significant increase in the level of competition in the marketplace, resulting in more choice, improved services and reduced costs for residential and business customers.</p>

  <p>The number of households that will qualify for assistance under the proposed scheme will depend on the charges levied by each of the water authorities in the coming year and the level at which any cap is set. As the charge levels have yet to be set and proposals for the scheme are still out to consultation it is not presently possible to identify the actual number of households that will qualify. It is however anticipated that at least 100,000 households throughout Scotland will receive assistance under the proposed scheme.</p>
