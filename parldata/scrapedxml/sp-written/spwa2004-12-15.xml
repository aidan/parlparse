  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether a person subject to a closure order under the Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004 will be considered by the local authority to be intentionally homeless.</p>

  <p>Closure orders apply to premises, not individuals. However, the relevant local authority has the responsibility for deciding whether or not a person made homeless as a result of a closure order is intentionally homeless in the light of that person&rsquo;s individual circumstances. Prior to an application for a closure order the police and the local authority should work together, especially where children or vulnerable people may be affected, to help prevent homelessness. The court is also required, when deciding whether or not to make an order, to consider the ability of the person(s) to find alternative accommodation and the vulnerability of any such person(s).</p>

  <p>From April 2005, Architecture and Design Scotland will become the nation&rsquo;s champion for good architecture and design in the built environment, taking over and expanding the present activities of the Royal Fine Art Commission for Scotland. The aim of Architecture and Design Scotland will be to inspire higher design quality across the public and private sectors, so as to improve the overall quality of our built environment.</p>

  <p>Historic Scotland is responsible for safeguarding the nation&rsquo;s historic built environment, and the Executive&rsquo;s investment in Historic Scotland will increase from &pound;39.6 million in 2004-05 to &pound;47.7 million in 2007-08. Part of this increased funding will be used to boost Historic Scotland&rsquo;s spending on Historic Building Repair Grants, which support the repair of Scotland&rsquo;s most important historic buildings and areas, and the enhancement of the quality of Scotland&rsquo;s historic city centres.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what plans it has to amend its central heating installation programme, in order to take into account the need for emergency replacements so that elderly people are not without heating for five months over the winter period.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2004-12-15.S2W-12822.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80018" speakername="Malcolm Chisholm" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-04/wa1215.htm#3">

  <p>Waiting times, along with all other aspects of the customer service provided by Eaga, who manage the contract on behalf of the Scottish Executive, are kept under constant review. The popularity of the programme inevitably means that recipients have to wait, sometimes over the winter months. Delays can be caused for a number of reasons. For example, metering and pipe connections take time to arrange and other companies have to be called in to provide them, which can take months to arrange and finalise. Nevertheless, we are determined to ensure that waiting times are kept to the minimum achievable.</p>

  <p>A wide range of strategic policies are being deployed to this end across the Executive and its cultural and enterprise agencies. In addition, the Cultural Commission has creativity as a central concern and will make its recommendations to Scottish ministers in summer 2005. However, improving the climate for creativity is an activity that is not time limited but rather needs to be continuously addressed in the light of changing social, cultural, technological and economic circumstances.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-12289 by Cathy Jamieson on 30 November 2004, whether it intends to routinely collect statistics on the number of convictions relating to cases of domestic abuse.</p>

  <p>Offence aggravator codes for domestic abuse were incorporated into the Integration of Scottish Criminal Justice Information Systems (ISCJIS) data standards in 2002. In future it will therefore be possible separately to identify convictions where such an aggravator has been recorded against the offences involved, though the availability of complete data will depend upon the rollout of ISCJIS to cover all courts and on consistent recording practices being followed by the police, procurator fiscals and the courts.</p>

  <p>The Regional Selective Assistance (RSA) offer &pound;5.16 million is focussed on helping the company grow the service side of its business. The grant will be paid in instalments as new jobs are created and capital expenditure targets are met. The company estimates that the project, when complete, will lead to the creation of 860 new jobs. There is no safeguarding element to this RSA offer.</p>

  <p>The Supermarket Code of Practice is currently the subject of an audit by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT). Since the OFT is independent of ministers, it would be inappropriate for Scottish ministers to have input before the results become available. Although a reserved matter, Scottish ministers take an interest in competition issues and will make their views known about the audit findings once they become available.</p>

  <p>&pound;19 million of the &pound;26 million per annum Health Improvement Fund was directed to NHS boards, including the then Health Education Board for Scotland (now NHS Health Scotland). The balance was invested through a number of national initiatives, such as the establishment of the Public Health Institute for Scotland (now also part of NHS Health Scotland), the provision of toothbrushes/toothpaste for pre-school children, enhancing flu surveillance and raising awareness of the need for immunisation and the early work of both the physical activity and sexual health task forces.</p>

  <p>Health Improvement money allocated to NHS boards is no longer ring-fenced but boards are expected to maintain and increase their support for health improvement as part of their continuing commitment to being public health organisations.</p>

  <p>A number of NHS boards have used health improvement monies to fund additional public health posts. The department has no plans to interfere with any local decisions.</p>

  <p>The NHS Quality Improvement Scotland standards for renal services include as a desirable criterion &quot;Within constraints of population density and geography, a unit is available within half an hour&rsquo;s travelling time for patients.&quot; This is intended to ensure that renal units are considering the possibility of satellite units where appropriate, to minimise travelling times. The NHS QIS report, <em>Adult Renal Services: National </em> Overview recognised that the impact of travelling is greatest in remote and rural areas, but noted that many units were developing plans for more satellite dialysis units.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive when it will publish an updated statistical bulletin on motor vehicle offences and what the reasons are for its position on the matter, and why there has been no publication of the bulletin since 2000.</p>

  <p>The statistical bulletin on motor vehicle offences was discontinued after publication of the figures for 2000. Since then, the information involved has been incorporated into the annual statistical bulletin on criminal proceedings in Scottish courts. This provides a more comprehensive statistical overview in a single source document and reduces publication overheads. The next edition of the criminal proceedings bulletin, which will include summary data on motor vehicle offences for 2003, is currently planned for publication in February 2005.</p>

  <p>The following table shows the destination of graduates from Scottish Medical Schools taking up their first NHS appointments as Pre-Registration House Officers (PRHOs) in each of the last three years. It is not possible from this data to differentiate between type or category of medical graduate.</p>

  <p>The number of students who graduate in any given year will fluctuate due to factors such as variables within university selection procedures, drop-out rates and the proportion of graduating students who have taken an intercalated degree mid-way through their undergraduate medical education. There are currently 876 students in their final clinical year in Scottish medical schools.</p>

  <p>Information on the number of GPs who use NHS 24 is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>Under the terms of the new General Medical Services contract, GPs can transfer their responsibility for providing out-of-hours services to NHS boards. In such circumstances, boards have until 31 December 2004 to put in place alternative out-of-hours arrangements which must meet mandatory accredited standards to ensure a safe and quality service for patients. Under these new arrangements NHS boards are using NHS 24 to triage initial calls.</p>

  <p>GPs who decide not to transfer their out-of-hours responsibility will have their own arrangements in place which may or may not involve NHS 24 to triage calls.</p>

  <p>NHS 24 staff will pass a caller&rsquo;s details to the relevant local out-of-hours services when it is assessed that the patient&rsquo;s needs will be met most appropriately by contact with a GP. The out-of-hours service will in turn pass the call to the GP covering the local area.</p>

  <p>If the clinical presentation of the symptoms does not require referral, but the patient insists on being referred to a GP, NHS 24 staff will ask the local out of hours service to call the patient back.</p>

  <p>Now fully operational, NHS 24 has achieved its key business plan objective of providing ready access to health care assessments, advice and information for the whole population of Scotland. In addition NHS 24 is providing a vital call handling service for patients who may require a GP out of hours at a time when many GPs are exercising their right to opt out of providing such services. The Executive is continuing to monitor the performance of the organisation. Early findings from the Scottish Executive's independent evaluation of NHS 24 demonstrates a rise in patient satisfaction.</p>

  <p>The table below indicates the number of nurses who have left and joined NHS 24 over the past 12 months. A number of the nurses who have left have done so to take up promoted posts in other parts of the NHS and to utilise the new skills they have learned with NHS 24 in relation to nurse triage. The number of nurses joining the organisation has been phased to match the planned roll-out of the service and is continuing.</p>

  <p>The following table sets out the membership before and after the transition to single system working on 1 April 2004. The rationale behind the dissolution of NHS trusts and the introduction of single system NHS boards was that there were too many separate statutory NHSScotland organisations planning and providing health services. It was therefore intended that this reduction in the numbers of health bodies would lead to more streamlined operations and better use of resources rather than a significant decrease in the numbers of non-executive board members.</p>

  <p>National guidance on the use of Availability Status Codes (formerly Guarantee Exception Codes) has been in place since their introduction in 1992. Decisions on the application of Availability Status Codes rest with NHS boards and the use of particular designations is at their discretion.</p>

  <p>The designation of Availability Status Code 3 (low clinical priority) is a matter of clinical assessment. Patients given an Availability Status Code 3 will typically include those awaiting tattoo removal, reverse vasectomy and cosmetic surgery. The use of Availability Status Code 4 (highly specialised treatment) in practice would tend to mean that only a very small number of specialists in the country are able to carry out the particular procedure.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2O-4240 by Mrs Elish Angiolini regarding the four prosecutions under the New Roads and Street Act 1991, what the nature and location of each offence was; whether convictions were obtained in each case and, if so, what sentence was imposed.</p>

  <p>Of the four cases in which criminal proceedings were taken under the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 between 2002 and 2004, three were for contraventions of section 38 (1) (which relates to refusal to pay a toll) and one was for a contravention of section 124 (1) (a) &amp; (b) (which relates to failure to ensure adequate guarding or lighting around road works).</p>

  <p>The location of the three offences under section 38(1) of the act was the Skye Bridge and all three cases involve allegations that the accused deliberately refused to pay the toll on the bridge. In one case the accused was found guilty and was fined &pound;50. One case has been marked &quot;no further proceedings&quot; by the Procurator Fiscal and the remaining case has been continued without plea until 20 December 2004 at Dingwall Sheriff Court.</p>

  <p>The case involving a contravention of section 124 of the act was heard at Banff Sheriff Court and related to an allegation of inadequate use of warning signs around a section of the A98 road under redevelopment. The accused pled guilty and was fined &pound;400.</p>

  <p>This assessment has already been undertaken. <em>Scotland&rsquo;s Renewable Resource 2001</em> , undertaken by Garrad Hassan on our behalf, identified a potential total renewables resource of 59.1 gigawatts of capacity, all of which was available outwith existing environmentally designated areas. This is many times more than we need to meet our current targets for renewable generation. The study can be found on the Scottish Executive website at:</p>

  <p>No. Transmission issues, other than consents, are reserved. However, the Executive discusses network infrastructure in relation to the UK renewables targets with all of the transmission companies through the aegis of the Transmission Issues Working Group (TIWG). The TIWG has identified the scale of transmission upgrades required for increased renewable generation in Scotland.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-11453 by Mr Jim Wallace on 10 November 2004, what the (a) output of all hydro schemes was prior to down-rating, (b) estimated output will be following down-rating and whether it will explain the statement that &quot;down-rating does not necessarily mean that output will also reduce&quot;.</p>

  <p>Information is available only in respect of calendar years. In 2001, the last year before down-rating, the output of all hydro schemes, including pump storage, was 4,258 GWh. The figure for 2002, the last year for which information is available, is 5,077 GWh.</p>

  <p>Scottish and Southern Energy decided to down-rate a number of schemes and to use the income subsequently generated from Renewable Obligation Certificates to refurbish existing large hydro stations which might otherwise have ceased operating, thus retaining or increasing total hydro output. Actual total output over a year will of course depend on a number of factors, including the number of hours over which the schemes are operated and rainfall patterns.</p>

  <p>The Lisbon Agreement set a target for 3% of GDP to be spent on R&amp;D across all EU member States by 2010, with two thirds of this financed by business. The Executive does not have a specific 2010 target for R&amp;D expenditure relative to GDP, but recognises the importance of R&amp;D in both stimulating innovation and as an important source of economic growth. As such, the Executive has identified R&amp;D as a key priority in its <em>Framework for Economic Development in Scotland</em> . The Executive is committed to increasing business expenditure on R&amp;D relative to GDP in Scotland in order to close the gap with the OECD average, as set out in <em>Building a Better Scotland - Spending Proposals 2005-2008</em> .</p>

  <p>The Smart, Successful Scotland Strategy confirms our focus on targeting inward investment of a high value nature, including research and development (R&amp;D) projects. Figures collected by Ernst &amp; Young suggest that Scotland is succeeding in attracting more such projects than the UK and European averages. In 2003, more than 10% of the inward investment projects they recorded for Scotland had an R&amp;D focus, against an average rate of just over 6% of projects both at UK and Europe-wide levels.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive and its agencies have developed a pipeline of public sector support mechanisms to assist all stages of the development process from idea generation to full-scale production. This includes a company support programme for which Scottish Enterprise has gained approval from the EU known as R&amp;D Plus which is intended to encourage innovative research and technological development with global commercial potential in order to stimulate growth, strengthen competitiveness and sustainability in Scotland.</p>

  <p>None.

  <p>The fundamental aim of public sector procurement legislation and policy is to ensure that goods and services are purchased on the basis of fair competition and represent value for money. Buyers must satisfy themselves that specifications are justifiable in terms of need, cost effectiveness and affordability.</p>

  <p>The Executive does not buy food other than through its catering contractor. Major public sector food purchasers in Scotland are the NHS, schools (local authority) and Scottish Prison Service, who are responsible for their own purchasing decisions.</p>

  <p>The Executive has, however, published guidelines on food procurement which underline the need for those taking purchasing decisions to take full account of quality factors such as freshness, seasonality and relevant farm assurance standards.</p>

  <p>The Executive has also commissioned a research project which will:</p>

  <p>estimate the value of the public sector procurement market in Scotland,</p>

  <p>identify the incentives and constraints currently faced by the public sector in its purchasing decisions and</p>

  <p>discuss how any incentives enhanced and constraints overcome.</p>

  <p>The work is being carried out by DTZ Pieda and is a research project and not part of a public consultation. Liaison has therefore been with industry contracts and Executive policy colleagues. The project cost is in the region of &pound;50,000</p>
