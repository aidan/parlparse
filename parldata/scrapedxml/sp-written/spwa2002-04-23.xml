  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will ensure that the painting &quot;The Birth of Venus Boy&quot; by Edward Baird has a permanent home on public display in Dundee and whether it will implement a more open and transparent process of decision-making in respect of the disposition of Scottish works of art that have been acquired by the Inland Revenue.</p>

  <p>Decisions by ministers on the allocation of works of art accepted in lieu of inheritance tax are based on the recommendations of a panel of expert advisers. Following their recommendation, we announced on 22 March that the painting was to be allocated to the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art. The Scottish Executive encourages the national institutions to lend items from their collections to local and other museums, providing the correct security and environmental conditions are in place. I will urge the National Galleries of Scotland to look sympathetically at any request for temporary exhibition, from Dundee, given the strong local connections with the artist and the estate.</p>

  <p>It is not appropriate for ministers to seek to interpret case law or comment on statements made in court cases or on the authority of sheriff court opinions.</p>

  <p>The law in relation to boundary walls has been considered over the years by the courts, the Scottish Law Commission, the Westminster and Scottish Parliaments and both the former Scottish Office and the Scottish Executive. Details of that consideration were set out in my letter of 11 March 2002, a copy of which I have placed in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 20516). The issues have received exhaustive examination and the Scottish Law Commission and the Executive are of the view that the existing law in this area is satisfactory and that there is no need for legislation to restate or reform it. The only representations received on this subject are those from the member and one of her constituents.</p>

  <p>I would, however, be happy to meet the member, together with a representative of the Scottish Law Commission.</p>

  <p>The range of measures is set out in our Diversity Strategy, launched in November 2000. Our efforts in the last year have been concentrated in three main areas: awareness raising within the organisation; diversity proofing personnel processes with the aim of removing unnecessary barriers, and outreach work with under represented groups. With regard to monitoring, we produce regular reports against targets for the Executive's Management Group and for Cabinet Office.</p>

  <p>Last year the Scottish Executive piloted the Zero Tolerance Charitable Trust&#146;s &quot;Respect&quot; package in schools and youth groups in Edinburgh and Glasgow. The aim of this package is to raise awareness amongst young people of the issues around domestic abuse, and to encourage them to build relationships based on respect and equality. We are currently considering an evaluation of the Respect pilot.</p>

  <p>More generally, there is a range of resources available to support schools in dealing with issues relating to personal safety. Of particular relevance is the report<em>, Promoting Personal Safety and Child Protection in The Curriculum</em>, issued by the Scottish Office in 1998. This report stressed the need for all pre-school centres and schools to be proactive in helping children and young people to develop their knowledge and understanding of personal safety issues and the skills to deal with them.

  <p>The number of any job reductions cannot be confirmed until Babcock Naval Services has reviewed its requirements. However, Scottish Enterprise Dunbartonshire (SED) is currently considering the potential impact on the local economy and will meet shortly with representatives from the Clyde Base.</p>

  <p>Once the scale of any job losses is known, SED will assess the likely cost of the assistance offered to any employees affected. Support will be provided for those affected through dedicated local response teams in conjunction with the Executive's PACE framework.

  <p>The national response to large-scale redundancy situations is the Executive's PACE (Partnership Action for Continuing Employment) framework. This initiative provides a national strategic framework for partnership working across key public sector agencies.</p>

  <p>Local response teams have been set up in each local enterprise company area, involving key local and national agencies. These teams have responsibility for implementing a wide range of early interventions to alleviate job losses where possible and, in the event of a redundancy situation arising, for implementing a local action plan targeted at finding alternative employment or training opportunities for those affected.</p>

  <p>Under the auspices of the PACE framework, a wide variety of interventions are used to support a redundancy situation and are tailored to meet individual needs and local circumstances. There are no restrictions in terms of age limit to receipt of this support.</p>

  <p>The membership of each team varies from area to area but the key agencies involved are the local enterprise company, local authority and Jobcentreplus. Other agencies (such as Careers Scotland, Benefits Agency, etc.) are called upon as required. All agencies involved are committed to ensuring sufficient resources, experience and knowledge to support the process.</p>

  <p>Given the wide range of agencies involved, information on job titles, grades, work patterns, pension and salary details of each member of the local response teams is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>Each local response team is tasked with putting in place an effective system across all agencies to allow for the tracking of individuals affected. As each redundancy situation is unique, the local response team will assess individual circumstances and sets its targets accordingly.</p>

  <p>Following the report of the 2001 Review of PACE, work is in hand to develop a monitoring and evaluation framework to learn from the experience of the PACE teams and continue to improve PACE performance.</p>

An audit of all tonsil and adenoid surgery performed with single-use instruments since July 2001 was undertaken, and routine surgery re-commenced with effect from 11 March 2002.

The programme is based on a three-level approach: improving the life circumstances that impact on health, addressing the lifestyles that lead to illness and early death, and working directly on priority health topics. The White Paper, <em>Towards a Healthier Scotland</em> (Bib. number 3036), and the Scottish Health Plan, <em>Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change</em> (Bib. number 10298), provide further details and are available in the Parliament's Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the current estimate is of the level of resources that would be freed up in its annual budget over the next ten years by the transfer of housing stock from those local authorities actively considering wholesale stock transfer and whether it will utilise any such extra resources for the provision of social rented housing nationally or in individual local authority areas.</p>

  <p>Resources will continue to be required to meet breakage costs, and it will not be clear until the point of transfer what these costs will be. It is therefore not possible to estimate the level of resources that may be freed up. In the year of transfer, Glasgow's resources will be used by the Scottish Executive to contribute towards the costs of &quot;breakage&quot; on Glasgow&#146;s existing debt. Thereafter, some of the resources will be used to fund demolition and the costs of additional new build housing. In the longer term there may be savings and any decisions on how these are allocated will depend on Scottish Executive priorities and will fall to cabinet.</p>

  <p>Residents in Anderston have been considering a range of regeneration options for the estate, and are due to make a decision later this month. Proposals will then be developed to transfer the houses in the spring of 2003.</p>

  <p>Scottish Homes only owns 11 houses in Cumbernauld, five of which are vacant. These properties are in blocks which have structural problems. Options are currently being considered for the blocks which will include the 11 houses owned by Scottish Homes.</p>

  <p>There are no plans to transfer the houses in Govan, where a management contract is being arranged.</p>

  <p>Evidence from pilot schemes in the west of Scotland has shown that the group lending model is suitable for women, and women are expected to be the main beneficiaries of the extended scheme. Evaluation of the programme will, however, assess carefully the impact of the scheme on any mixed gender groups established.</p>

  <p>The Executive has no plans to introduce a wheelchair voucher scheme similar to the scheme operated in England.</p>

  <p>Initial evaluation of the English scheme indicated that relatively few wheelchair users benefited from it and it was both expensive and time consuming to operate.</p>

  <p>The Rehabilitation Technology Information Service (ReTIS), jointly funded by NHS boards, was established to provide a national information service in the field of Rehabilitation Technology (this includes the wheelchair and seating service). The information collected by ReTIS will be used to assist in the planning and management of services with the aim of improving performance.</p>

  <p>A copy of the ReTIS progress report published in August 2001 (Bib. number 20692) has been placed in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre together with an aggregated data service profile report for the wheelchair and seating service for the period April 2000 and March 2001 (Bib. number 20754).</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive when it proposes to introduce legislation to amend the Standards in Scotland&#146;s Schools etc. Act 2000 in order to establish an appeals process for pupils refused a placing request on the grounds that any remaining places in the school are reserved for families who move into the school catchment area after the beginning of the school year.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-04-23.S1W-24562.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80243" speakername="Nicol Stephen" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0423.htm#25">

  <p>Where a placing request is refused on the grounds that places are to be reserved in the specified school for families who move into the catchment area after the beginning of the school year, parents may use the existing appeals process under section 28C of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980. Amendment of the Standards in Scotland's Schools etc. Act 2000 is not, therefore, required.</p>

  <p>It has, however, recently come to light that there may be an omission in earlier legislation following the introduction by the Education (Scotland) Act 1996 of an additional ground for refusal of a placing request at section 28A(3A); that is, to allow the reservation of places in the school for pupils likely to move into the catchment area.</p>

  <p>Under section 28C of the 1980 act, a parent may appeal against an authority's decision to refuse their placing request, in the first instance to an appeal committee (under section 28E) and then to a sheriff (under section 28F). Under sections 28E and 28F, appeal committees and sheriffs have the power to confirm an authority's decision to refuse a placing request on one of the grounds specified in section 28A(3) of the 1980 act. Otherwise, they must reject the authority's decision and require them to place the child in accordance with the placing request. No mention is made in those sections of the ground for refusal introduced in at section 28A(3A) by the 1996 act.</p>

  <p>A sheriff in Aberdeen recently took the view that, where the sole ground for refusal was section 28A(3A) of the 1980 act, he could not consider that ground in deciding whether to confirm the education authority's decision. He indicated that, as he could not confirm the decision on that ground, he believed he had no option but to reject the authority's refusal of the placing request on that ground and require them to place the child in accordance with the placing request.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive will be taking the first appropriate legislative opportunity to address this issue.</p>

  <p>Not for the first time, widespread publicity has been given to an erroneous story about our new building. No trees have been chosen or purchased. The tender documents for this landscaping have not yet even been issued and they do not include a requirement for Red Oak &#150; a native of North America. European procurement rules require open competition, and the contract will be awarded on the basis of quality and cost for the whole package. Market advice suggests that the required trees should be available at a fraction of the suggested cost and that Scottish companies should be well placed to compete to supply them.</p>

  <p>Members should know that one of our press officers gave this correct information to a journalist from a Sunday title who obviously decided not to allow the facts to get in the way of a good story because that information was not included in the subsequent report.
