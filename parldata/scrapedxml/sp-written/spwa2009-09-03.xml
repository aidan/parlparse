  <p>The Scottish Government fully recognises the important contribution the music industry makes to Scottish life and our economy. A wide range of support is provided to the music industry through its publicly funded agencies such as the Scottish Arts Council, the enterprise agencies, Skills Development Scotland and the Scottish Funding Council and through local authorities. This includes funding and assistance for artists and projects, business support and advice; facilitating industry networks; supporting the new Scottish Music Industry Association and Glasgow as UNESCO&rsquo;s City of Music, and through skills, training and qualifications.</p>

  <p>The spend on Education Maintenance Allowances (EMA) is recorded in financial years rather than academic years. The total amount spent on the scheme was &pound;37.2 million in financial year 2007-08 and &pound;36.5 million in financial year 2008-09. These figures include both payments made to EMA recipients and additional expenditure related to the scheme e.g. administration costs.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-09-03.S3W-26473.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80330" speakername="Fiona Hyslop" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa0903.htm#3">

  <p>The Scottish Government does not hold exact details of the level of income for all households that contain a 16 to 19-year-old in school or further education. As such it isn&rsquo;t possible to calculate a precise figure for the number of young people who would qualify for an Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) in 2009-10.</p>

  <p>However, based on an analysis of recipients of EMA in academic year 2007-08, it is estimated that around 34,000 young people will receive an Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) in academic year 2009-10. This estimate does not account for any potential increase in numbers due to population change, the economic slowdown or the availability of EMA payments to those participating in the pilots of Activity Agreements in 10 local authorities.</p>

  <p>Under the provisions of the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Act 1993, determinate sentence prisoners may be released on licence between the half-way point and two-thirds point of sentence on the recommendation of the Parole Board. Such individuals are liable to be recalled to custody up to the expiry of their sentence. Life sentence prisoners who are released on life licence on the direction of the Parole Board are liable to recall to custody for the rest of their lives.</p>

  <p>Where an offender&rsquo;s behaviour gives cause for concern, leading to a revocation of licence conditions, officials of the Criminal Justice Directorate issue the order for the recall to custody to the police in order that they take steps to apprehend and return the offender to custody. The local authority is not involved in the process of returning the individual to custody.</p>

  <p>While responsibility rests with the police to enforce the order, Criminal Justice Directorate continually monitors progress in relation to the enforcement of the order and liaises with the police until the individual is returned to custody.</p>

  <p>Our records indicate that there are presently 14 offenders in Scotland subject to a recall order who have not yet been returned to custody. The table below shows the number recalled in each year.</p>

  <p>There were 4,041 persons proceeded against in Scottish Courts for handling an offensive weapon in 2007-08. This relates to 3,874 individuals, as some people have been proceeded against on more than one occasion.</p>

  <p>Information about whether or nor individuals had a criminal record at the time of prosecution is not held centrally. However, the following table shows the number of these individuals who had a previous charge proved in court at least once in the previous 10 years. The previous charge has been identified as having a date of sentence which is earlier than the date of sentence for the latest charge of handling an offensive weapon.</p>

  <p>The source of this information is the Scottish Government Court Proceedings database, which is derived from data held on the Criminal History System. Prosecution in court is only one of a range of possible options for dealing with an individual who has been charged with an offence. Other actions include the use of fiscal warnings, diversion to social work, fixed penalty notices and fiscal fines. However, these alternatives to court prosecution are not currently held on the Scottish Government Court Proceedings database and are not included in the following data provided.</p>

  <p>Number of individuals proceeded against for handling an offensive weapon<sup>1,2</sup> in 2007-2008 who had a previous charge<sup>3</sup> proved in court, by Police Force and by main crime<sup>4</sup> for that offence:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to its duty as a public authority to take positive action to eliminate gender discrimination and to promote equality under the Equality Act 2006. This should ensure that we treat men and women with equivalent respect according to need. In some cases this will mean that services need to be designed to meet the specific needs of women.</p>

  <p>I undertook during my appearance at the Equal Opportunities Committee on 23 June 2009 to ensure that our work with COSLA and other agencies in taking forward the framework of Protecting Scotland&rsquo;s Communities, Fair Fast and Flexible Justice included the application of the Gender Equality Duty.</p>

  <p>Sentencing in individual cases is a matter for the judiciary. The Scottish Executive recognises the need to develop further our understanding of the complex needs of women offenders and to ensure that the criminal justice system is equipped to respond to those underlying needs as well as to their offending behaviour.</p>

  <p>I undertook during my appearance at the Equal Opportunities Committee on 23 June 2009 to ensure that the Gender Equality Duty was applied to the work being taken forward with COSLA and other agencies within the framework of &quot;Protecting Scotland&rsquo;s Communities, Fair, Fast and Flexible Justice&quot; to design disposals and services which meet the specific needs of offenders.</p>

  <p>Section 58 of the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004 defines the term &quot;management agreement&quot; for the purposes of that act. This encompasses management agreements made under the following legislation in the circumstances stated:</p>

  <p>section 16 of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 to secure the management of the land as a nature reserve</p>

  <p>section 49A of the Countryside (Scotland) Act 1967 to secure the conservation and enhancement or to foster the understanding and enjoyment of the natural heritage of Scotland</p>

  <p>section 15 of the Countryside Act 1968 for the purpose of conserving the flora, fauna or geological or geomorphological features of an SSSI;</p>

  <p>SNH may also offer management agreements under regulation 16 the Conservation (Natural Habitats, &amp;c.) Regulations 1994 (&quot;the 1994 Regulations&quot;) for the management, conservation, restoration or protection of a European site, or any part of it or land adjacent to it. Regulation 21 of those regulations applies the provisions of Chapter 3 of Part 3 of the 2004 act (which includes section 29(3) of the 2004 act) for the purposes of management agreements made under regulation 16 of the 1994 regulations.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government places great importance in ensuring all of Scotland&rsquo;s communities receive effective policing. The government recognises that many police forces in Scotland therefore retain tied housing stock to help support operational policing in areas where housing would otherwise be difficult to obtain. The on-going management of police housing stock is a matter currently being discussed with police authorities.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS), to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>A Core Screen assessment is undertaken within 72 hours of admission to prison. This assesses prisoner&rsquo;s needs including the issue of appropriate accommodation.</p>

  <p>Those with identified accommodation or homelessness issues are referred to housing advice services to facilitate accommodation arrangements prior to release. Where time constraints prevent this, for example where a prisoner is serving a very short sentence, an appointment with external housing services is made prior to release.</p>

  <p>Prisoner induction programmes, including those for remand prisoners, also include information on housing advice services and how prisoners can access these during their time in prison. Where necessary prison based housing advice services will assist prisoners in making application for accommodation.</p>

  <p>SPS has also worked with Scottish Government to develop policies to address this issue: The National Accommodation Strategy for Prisoners and The National Accommodation Strategy for Sex Offenders.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Prison Service was part of a project instigated by the Financial Services Authority and funded by the Scottish Government to create a flexible teaching resource for use with offenders in custody or the community. This resource is now available to deliver within all prisons as a compliment to the current services being provided.</p>

  <p>While there are currently no services at Shotts prison, a couple of officers have been trained to deliver this new teaching resource and delivery will commence before the end of 2009.</p>

  <p>HMYOI Polmont is developing a new independent living unit. Money and debt support will be available as part of the new unit. Polmont has previously run a money management course funded by the Bank of Scotland. This has now stopped due to bank cut backs.</p>

  <p>Scottish Government has provided local government in Scotland with record levels of funding, &pound;23 billion over the period 2008-10.</p>

  <p>Local authorities have a responsibility to fulfil their statutory obligations and agreed national and local priorities. One of the national priorities is to work with Scottish Government to deliver Zero Waste policy.</p>

  <p>To help deliver that policy the Scottish Government has allocated &pound;42 million to local authorities over the period 2008 to 2010 from the Zero Waste Fund and intends to allocate further funding for 2010-11.</p>

  <p>Future spending allocations have yet to be confirmed. We are however working with budget cuts of around &pound;500 million imposed by Westminster.</p>

  <p>In May I attended and spoke at a meeting of COSLA Leaders at which North Lanarkshire Council were represented.</p>

  <p>At that meeting I gave assurances that Scottish Government will continue to work closely with COSLA and local authorities in the development of the Zero Waste Plan, and the delivery of the Zero Waste agenda.</p>

  <p>The Zero Waste Plan for Scotland is presently out to consultation. Scottish Government looks forward to receiving a wide range of responses, all of which will be carefully considered.</p>

  <p>I encourage everyone with an interest to respond to this consultation including North Lanarkshire Council.</p>

  <p>I am also more than happy to have a bilateral with North Lanarkshire Council if they want to do so.</p>

  <p>The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) have just carried out a study on the amount of household food waste in Scotland. This will be launched today, 3 September, and shows that the average family wastes &pound;8-10 of food per week. WRAP have also commissioned a research project on waste in the hospitality sector. This report is due to be published later in 2009. WRAP is currently undertaking a survey of food waste within the supply chain which covers the transfer, processing and packaging of food from the farm gate to the back of store.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) plans to carry out work to estimate the amount of commercial and industrial waste produced in Scotland for the years 2008, 2009 and 2010 using existing survey data. In addition, the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), with Scottish Enterprise, are commissioning work on commercial and industrial organic waste arisings, to understand better the amounts, types and geographical spread. This will aid plans for future waste management infrastructure.</p>

  <p>Section 79 of the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 empowers Ministers to make regulations requiring persons of the kinds specified to provide SEPA with information on waste. The section lays down that draft regulations must be laid before Parliament no later than 12 months after the day on which this section comes into force.</p>

  <p>To achieve this there is a discussion of how to improve commercial and industrial waste data Sections 1.5 and 1.6, and Annex C, of Scotland&rsquo;s draft Zero Waste Plan</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Environment/waste-and-pollution/Waste-1/wastestrategy" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Environment/waste-and-pollution/Waste-1/wastestrategy</a>.</p>

  <p>The plan was issued for consultation on 20 August 2009 and one of the questions asked relates to the proposals outlined there.</p>

  <p>Depending on the results of this consultation we will consult next year on the details of what regulations under this section should lay down, and what information on waste should be sent to SEPA.</p>

  <p>Scottish Government has set out a range of measures to deal with food waste, and other kinds of waste, in <em>Scotland&rsquo;s Zero Waste Plans.</em></p>

  <p>We are currently consulting on this plan and a draft may be found at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2009/08/19141153/2" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2009/08/19141153/2</a>.</p>

  <p>However, the reduction of food waste, as well as any other kind of waste, is not a matter solely for the Scottish Government. Public and private organisations of all types have a responsibility to reduce their own waste, including food waste, also to ensure any waste that is produced is handled responsibly.</p>

  <p>Sir Neil McIntosh is conducting the examination of the Reimbursement of Members&rsquo; Expenses Scheme on a non-payment basis, although the SPCB will meet any travel expenses incurred by Sir Neil.</p>

  <p>There may also be some costs associated with gauging public confidence in the Scheme and with the publication of a report, but we would expect these to be minimal. Any administrative support required by Sir Neil will be provided by the SPCB.</p>
