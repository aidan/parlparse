  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the cost to individual NHS boards of sending patients with chronic pain to pain management centres outside of Scotland was in (a) 2008-09 and (b) 2009-10 and has been in 2010-11.</p>

  <p>The cost of sending patients with chronic pain to pain management centres outside Scotland was:</p>

  <p>(a) 2008-09 - &pound;229,559</p>

  <p>(b) 2009-10 - &pound;184,937</p>

  <p>(c) 2010-11 - &pound;206,685 for the first six months.</p>

  <p>These costs are shared across all NHS boards as part of the national risk share arrangements administered by National Services Division. A board&rsquo;s contribution is calculated on its percentage share of the baseline allocation.</p>

  <p>There has been an increase in the referrals of patients being treated in 2010-11 in comparison to previous years. This is due to outreach clinics now being held in Scotland where the consultant can see a greater number of patients for assessment which has led to an increase in patients being referred outside of Scotland.</p>

  <p>Note:*Figures do not add exactly due to roundings.</p>

  <p>Due to changes in the way that the 2009-10 figures have been collected, these are not directly comparable with those published in previous years. The main changes relate to the exclusion of some senior medical and nursing costs and the inclusion of costs for a number of functions such as pharmacy, catering, property maintenance and transport which have now been reclassified as administration costs.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland assesses the safety performance of the A76 trunk road as part of the annual screening of all locations across the network where three or more injury accidents have occurred in the preceding three year period. Further investigations are carried out and where appropriate, mitigation measures are prioritised and installed. This ensures that the limited funding available can be targeted at those locations that provide the greatest accident savings.</p>

  <p>In the last two years Transport Scotland has spent approximately &pound;700,000 on road safety schemes on the A76, these measures include high friction surfacing, signing, lining, bend assessment works and vehicle activated signs. This year&rsquo;s safety assessment is underway and a report from the trunk road operating company, Amey, is to be submitted by the end of the year.</p>
