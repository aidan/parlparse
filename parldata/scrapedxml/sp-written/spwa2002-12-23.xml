  <p>The Scottish Executive announced the results of the Scottish Budget 2003-06 on 12 September, including its spending proposals for the three years, in order to meet the written agreement with the Parliament to present a draft budget by 20 September 2002.

  <p>The Executive is working in partnership with the UK Government to deliver greenhouse gas emissions reductions required by the Kyoto Protocol and in moving towards the UK domestic goal of a 20% reduction in CO <sub>2</sub> emissions by 2010.</p>

  <p>Local authorities have an important role in delivering this commitment and can contribute in a number of ways. Along with COSLA and SOLACE, the Executive published last year <i>Community Leadership and Climate Change in Scotland,</i> which offers guidance to chief executives of Scottish local authorities on action they can take to tackle climate change. The Executive is happy to work with local authorities to develop the response strategies outlined in that document. In this respect, I was pleased earlier this year to have been able to support publication of Aberdeen City Council's Climate Change Action Plan.</p>

  <p>Another avenue which local authorities may explore is through the Scottish Energy Efficiency Office (SEEO) which works with public and private sector organisations to improve their energy efficiency. Local authorities are eligible for a free energy audit and can also benefit from the Scottish Clean Energy Demonstration Scheme. This scheme offers <strong>grants </strong>to assist and encourage the development, demonstration, application and replication of energy efficiency measures and renewable energy technologies within Scotland. SEEO is also assisting local authorities in their investigations into innovative measures to improve energy efficiency.</p>

  <p>We will continue to look for opportunities to deliver our climate change commitments through working in partnership with local authorities and others in Scotland.</p>

  <p>We have today published the Executive&#146;s 3rd Electronic Service Delivery Progress Report. Over all, 80% of services provided by the Executive, its agencies and non-departmental public bodies are now available online to some degree. This represents a significant increase since the last report which was published in May this year and is partly due to the inclusion of a number of services which were logged from the outset as being at second stage or above, and were therefore originally omitted from the count. This third report now also includes a column indicating the stage of development these services have reached. Copies of the report have been placed in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre. It is also available on the 21st Century Government website and the OpenScotland website.</p>

  <p>I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that the varieties of maize referred to in the question do not currently have consent for food use in the EU, nor for commercial planting.</p>

  <p>The enforcement of food law is primarily a matter for local authorities, who also conduct food sampling programmes. In 2002, the UK element of the EC Food Sampling Programme included checks on certain foodstuffs to ensure that if they contain GM ingredients that they comply with appropriate labelling rules.</p>

  <p>Proposals on the traceability and labelling of GMOs have recently been agreed by the European Council, whereby operators will be required to provide a list of all GMOs which are in a shipment on its arrival in the EU. If adopted, these rules are likely to come into force late in 2003.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to implementing the Habitats Directive in Scotland and 229 sites have already been submitted to the European Commission.</p>

  <p>In June 2002 the Commission undertook an assessment of the lists of candidate SACs put forward by the UK and other member states in the Atlantic Bio-Geographic Region. Out of a total UK list of 76 habitat types and 41 species, our lists were judged to be sufficient for 54 habitats and 27 species. This compares favourably with the Commission&#146;s initial assessment in 1999, where 40 habitats and 12 species were held to be sufficient. The Commission has requested that the UK examine the need for a limited number of additional sites for those habitats and species lists judged insufficient, some of which relate to Scotland. Scottish Executive officials have been working with Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) to examine the need for additional sites in Scotland. In a number of cases, this work has demonstrated that no appropriate sites can be identified and further proposals will not be made to the Commission. I have, however, requested SNH to consult on eight new sites and two extensions to existing sites to address the gaps identified by the Commission in the following habitat types:</p>

  <p><table border="BORDER" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="100%">
<tr>
<td>
<p>Habitat Type 
                  </p></td>

<tr>
<td>

                  </p></td>
</tr>
</table></p>

  <p>Once SNH has completed the consultation, Scottish ministers will decide whether or not to put these sites forward to the European Commission with a view to completion of the Scottish list of terrestrial SACs. In order to meet a strict EC timetable for submission of sites by 30 April 2003, it is important that SNH initiate public consultation as early as possible, and Scottish ministers have requested that this is taken forward as a matter of priority.</p>

  <p>The European Commission has made the decision to delay consideration of member states&#146; lists of sites within the marine environment in view of the work that is currently under way to extend the network beyond 12 nautical miles. This is a matter for the UK Government, and the list of sites for these habitats and species will be assessed at a later date in light of this work.</p>
