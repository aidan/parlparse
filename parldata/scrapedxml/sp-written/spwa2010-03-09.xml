  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many acute occupied bed days in hospitals in NHS Tayside were directly connected with alcohol-related conditions in the last year for which information is available.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-03-09.S3W-31621.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80379" speakername="Shona Robison" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa0309.htm#1">

  <p>Information on the number of acute occupied bed days which are directly attributable to alcohol-related conditions is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>Information on acute occupied bed days is recorded on the SMR01 dataset. SMR01 has space for up to six diagnosis codes to be recorded, a main diagnosis and up to five secondary diagnoses. Alcohol-related problems will be recorded as either a main or a secondary diagnosis, so it is not possible to identify the cases where alcohol was directly attributed to the length of the admission.</p>

  <p>Table 1 shows the total length of stay of patients treated in acute hospitals in NHS Tayside for alcohol-related conditions, recorded in any diagnosis position, 2008-09; the most recent year for which information is available. Due to the way alcohol-related conditions are recorded, it is not possible to determine whether the reason for admission is directly attributable to alcohol. Therefore this figure may be an overestimate.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Excludes mental illness hospitals, psychiatric units and maternity hospitals.</p>

  <p>2. Figures in this table relate only to those individuals who are treated as inpatients or day cases in an acute hospital. They do not include individuals managed as outpatients.</p>

  <p>3. Note that these figures include residents from other health boards that were treated in Tayside hospitals but do not include Tayside residents treated in other health boards.</p>

  <p>4. Discharges where alcohol-related diagnosis is recorded as primary or secondary reasons for admission to hospital.</p>

  <p>5. Diseases recorded using the World Health Organization&rsquo;s International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD10).</p>

  <p>- Alcohol-related: F10, K70, X45, X65, Y15, Y90, Y91, E24.4, E51.2, G31.2, G62.1, G72.1, I42.6, K29.2, K86.0, O35.4, P04.3, Q86.0, T51.0, T51.1, T51.9, Y57.3, R78.0, Z50.2, Z71.4, Z72.1. These codes were defined in a recent in-depth review of ISD&rsquo;s core alcohol related code set. Further information about the review and resulting consultation process is available at:</p>

  <p>In his Budget Bill speech of 3 February 2010, John Swinney announced &pound;2 million in 2010-11 for a Scottish boiler scrappage scheme. This will support the forthcoming Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Scotland, which will be published in late spring.</p>

  <p>Exact details of the scheme, including launch date, delivery mechanism, level of incentive, and number of households the scheme will support are now being developed and will be announced in due course.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is already helping householders upgrade to a more energy efficient boiler through the &pound;2 million Energy Saving Scotland Home Loans pathfinder initiative and through the &pound;60 million Energy Assistance Package, aimed at tackling the causes of fuel poverty.</p>

  <p>Information on the number of (a) crimes and (b) violent crimes, recorded by the police in the Lothian and Borders police force area in 2008-09 is given in table 4a of the statistical bulletin Recorded Crime in Scotland, 2008-09 which can be obtained at:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Crime and Justice Survey (SCJS) collects information from victims of crime regardless of whether they reported the incident to the police and therefore provides an estimate of victimisation which is complementary to that collected by police recorded figures.</p>

  <p>The SCJS can provide an estimate of the number of victims of (a) crimes and (b) violent crimes by police force area. Estimates for Lothian and Borders police force area calculated from the 2008-09 SCJS are given in Table 104 of Volume 4 of the SCJS data tables at:</p>

  <p>The short-life working group has not yet reported. The revised template is, however, broadly complete and the short-life working group will shortly be consulting infection control experts and Patient Focus Public Involvement groups. The purpose of this consultation process is to ensure that the revised HAIRT is suitable for all NHS boards and is structured in a way which can be understood by the general public. It would not be appropriate for me to advise on the content of the revised HAIRT until this important consultation process is complete.

  <p>Scottish Government has engaged in a programme of research activity throughout 2009 to inform the development of draft guidance on social care procurement. This involved national surveys of local authorities and service providers; meetings with local authorities, service providers, service users and carers and regulatory bodies, and consultation with members of a reference group of interested parties.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the revised guidance on adult social care procurement will make it clear that retendering is not obligatory if existing services are of good quality and highly rated by users.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-03-09.S3W-31648.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80379" speakername="Shona Robison" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa0309.htm#12">

  <p>The draft guidance on social care procurement states that a commissioning organisation should take account of feedback from service users and other information about the quality of an existing service when deciding if that service should be maintained.</p>

  <p>If the commissioning organisation decides that a service should be maintained, it must then determine whether the existing contract provides an option to extend the contract. If there is no extension option, the commissioning organisation must determine if it is required under procurement legislation to re-tender the service.</p>

  <p>The draft guidance confirms that social care services are subject to regulation 8(21) of the Public Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2006 under which a local authority &quot;must, if required by its general community obligations, for the benefit of any potential economic operator, ensure a degree of advertising and follow a procedure leading to the award of the contract which is sufficient to enable open competition and meet the requirements of the principles of equal treatment, non-discrimination and transparency&quot;. The continuation of an existing services that does not take place in accordance with an extension option may risk breaching regulation 8(21). Any decision to extend an existing contract in these circumstances should be taken after careful consideration of the treaty principles and the associated risk of challenge.</p>

  <p>The draft guidance can be accessed on the Scottish Government&rsquo;s website:</p>

  <p>The Midlothian Snowsports Centre at Hillend, which is owned and operated by Midlothian Council, is regarded by the Scottish Government as important to the future development of snowsports in Scotland. Sportscotland is working with Midlothian Council to examine options to ensure that the centre has an economically sustainable future.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has not been involved in discussions with South Ayrshire in connection with the closure of Girvan Swimming pool as we believe that Local Authorities are best placed to address and meet local needs and priorities and the future of Girvan Swimming Pool is a matter for South Ayrshire Council.</p>

  <p>As part of its strategic relationship with local authorities, sportscotland meets regularly with council officials to support them in the development of strategic plans for sport in their local area.</p>
