  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will report on the outcome of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council held in Brussels on 17, 18 and 19 December 2003.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2004-01-19.1.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80032" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-04/wa0119.htm#se_Minister">

  <p>I attended the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels on 17, 18 and 19 December 2003 together with Margaret Beckett, Ben Bradshaw and Ian Pearson.</p>

  <p>On<strong> fisheries</strong>, the Council agreed the Total Allowable Catches (TACs) and Quotas for 2004.</p>

  <p>The TACs for Scotland's pelagic fisheries remained broadly stable &#8211; increases of 15% for North Sea Herring and 95% for Western Blue Whiting were balanced by a sensible precautionary reduction of 8% in the Mackerel TAC.</p>

  <p>The TAC for North Sea Nephrops (prawns) increased by 15%, with a further 15% increase to follow (automatically) when suitable management arrangements have been agreed. The West of Scotland Nephrops TAC was rolled over, but new scientific evidence has emerged since the advice was offered and we intend to revisit this in the course of the coming year.</p>

  <p>Our efforts ensured that most of the TACs for Scotland's key whitefish stocks including North Sea cod, whiting and anglerfish were rolled over, despite vocal efforts to introduce quota cuts. The main exceptions to this were Northern Saithe (coley), where a 15% increase was secured and North Sea haddock, where a 55% increase was secured.</p>

  <p>The very large increase in the North Sea haddock TAC represents an increase of 66% in the quota available to the UK and following technical discussions on the science and on the basis of the introduction of special licensing and control conditions. These arrangements provide new incentives for fishermen to move away from cod rich areas will help compensate for continued effort controls and the need to change past fishing patterns.</p>

  <p>The Council also agreed by qualified majority a long term recovery plan for cod stocks, setting a mechanism for deciding on multi-annual catch limits, and providing for annual limits on fishing effort as in Annex V to the TAC Regulation. It explicitly enables the Council to adjust the mechanism for fishing effort during 2004 should it so wish and we have assurances from the commission about plans to discuss further, during 2004, more flexible effort control measures.</p>

  <p>Restricting fishing effort is a key element in the approach to ensuring sustainability of fishing. The effort control arrangements provide for limits on fishing time in 2004 for vessels which can catch cod, which operate in the North Sea and west of Scotland waters and, for the first time, for vessels in the Irish Sea and the eastern English Channel. Annex VI introduces an effort management scheme for the North Sea sandeel fishery, for which the regulation also sets significantly reduced quotas.</p>

  <p>Discussions to clarify the details of the agreement are still on-going. However, taken with the rest of the package we negotiated in December, this represents a fair outcome. It takes full account of our decommissioning activity and balances conservation concerns and aims with the commercial interests of fishermen.</p>

  <p>Finally the Council agreed the guide prices for fish species for 2004.</p>

  <p>On<strong> agriculture</strong>, the Council adopted by qualified majority the Presidency's compromise text for a regulation reinforcing the current requirements regarding identification of sheep and goats. The UK welcomed this proposal which met the main concerns we had registered during negotiation. The arrangements now take account of the unique structure of our sheep sector. Subject to approval by the Commission, our current national sheep and goat identification system of movement tags backed up by the animal movement licensing system will remain until 2008 and will be followed thereafter by the introduction of Electronic Identification (Electronic ID).</p>

  <p>The Council noted progress made in discussions on the proposal to update rules governing the welfare of animals during transport. The proposal was remitted for further official discussion, in particular as regards the establishment of maximum journey times.</p>

  <p>The Council took note of progress on a draft regulation harmonising official controls on food and feed. There was no discussion and a number of issues, notably the scope of regulation and the charges to be made in connection with its enforcement, remain to be settled.</p>

  <p>The Council also took note of progress which had been made in discussions on a draft regulation setting maximum residue levels for pesticides. There was no discussion.</p>

  <p>The Council discussed the package of proposals to reform the CAP regimes for tobacco, olive oil, cotton and hops. The UK reiterated its support for the Commission in extending the principles of CAP reform to these sectors but argued for greater decoupling of subsidies to the olive oil and, particularly, cotton sectors. We expressed support for full decoupling in the tobacco sector, as the Commission has proposed, and called for the shortest possible transition period. Detailed negotiation on these proposals will resume under the Irish Presidency.</p>

  <p>Under Other Business, the Italian Presidency tabled a written report outlining progress on specific hygiene rules in the animal feed sector. The Presidency also reported on progress in negotiation of a veterinary equivalence agreement with Russia. Austria pressed for early action to deal with low prices in the pigmeat sector: the UK and several other member states cautioned against reliance on export refunds in this sector. The UK raised the problems caused for Pakistan by recent changes in the concessionary import terms applicable to Basmati rice. The Commission took note and reported that it was consulting with Pakistan and India over the latest information available on prices and varieties.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has been committed to providing support for out of school hours learning activities since 1999. The &pound;69 million referred to in a recent media article is the amount of funding being made available to local authorities up to 2005-06 by the Scottish Executive (&pound;34 million under the National Priorities Action Fund) and the New Opportunities Fund (&pound;35 million from the Activities Programme of the PE and Sport in Schools Initiative), as part of that on-going commitment. It is for the local authorities to determine how best to use that financial support in the light of local needs and circumstances.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the number of staff and staff costs within its Environment and Rural Affairs Department will decrease over the next three years as a result of the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and, if so, by how much in each case.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2004-01-19.4.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80032" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-04/wa0119.htm#4">

  <p>It is too early to estimate to what extent staff costs within the Environment and Rural Affairs Department will change as a consequence of CAP reform because we have not yet decided how the reforms will apply in Scotland. The consultation exercise on CAP reform finished on 6 January and decisions will be made shortly.</p>

  <p>A reduction in the number of direct support schemes should lead to reductions in staffing and staff costs. But this will depend on exactly which options are chosen. In the short term there are likely to be additional costs associated with developing the new system at the same time as continuing to make payments under the old system.</p>

  <p>For a proportion of its haddock quota, the UK will be subject to additional constraints not applied to other member states (a special permit system and limited access to a cod sensitive area). This reflects the fact that the haddock fishery in this cod sensitive area is an almost exclusively UK fishery. Other member states were not willing to agree a 66% increase in the UK haddock quota without additional controls to protect cod in that area.</p>

  <p>Transitional support grants totalling &pound;4.8 million have been paid to the owners of over 150 Scottish fishing vessels. Further payments of &pound;0.6 million are currently being processed for payment to cover the September 2003 aid period. Further payments in respect of October to December will follow.</p>

  <p>Decommissioning grants of over &pound;25.5 million have been paid out so far under the 2003 fishing vessel decommissioning scheme. The current deadline for vessel owners to complete the decommissioning process and claim their grant is 29 February.</p>

  <p>Neither of these schemes are open to further applications.</p>

  <p>To date (8 January 2004) the total amount of hardship relief granted by local authorities to harbours and businesses affected by the reduction in whitefish catches is a little under &pound;200,000. Some applications are still being considered. Businesses can still apply to their local authority for relief as a result of hardship being suffered between 1 April &#8211; 30 September 2003.</p>

  <p>The &quot;view and grant&quot; procedure is a mechanism whereby pathologists are able to certify unsuspicious deaths based on an external examination and consideration of medical records, without the need for an autopsy examination. It is a matter for the professional assessment of the pathologist whether s/he is in a position to certify a death in this way and for the procurator fiscal to determine in each case whether it is appropriate to accept a certificate so issued. Currently around 15% of deaths reported to procurators fiscal across Scotland are certified in this way. The figures are not available by local authority region.</p>

  <p>A discussion paper circulated following a consultative forum held last year involving discussions among pathologists, service providers, procurators fiscal and other interests from across Scotland, makes a number of recommendations aimed at future arrangements for training of, and accreditation and standards for, forensic pathologists and how services should be structured and overseen. We are considering the responses to those recommendations and planning how we can work together with interested parties to take forward the issues raised with a view to securing high quality forensic pathology services for the future.</p>

It is possible to identify cases of deep vein thrombosis linked to travel generally, but not cases specifically linked to air travel. In 2002, 10 such cases were recorded, and the provisional figure for 2003 is 13. However, caution is necessary in interpreting these figures.

  <p>It is not possible to distinguish the symptoms of deep vein thrombosis which may have been triggered by air travel from those of deep vein thrombosis in people who have not flown recently or at all, so it would not be possible to issue such specific guidance. Though the Executive does not issue clinical advice to medical professionals directly, the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN), which is funded by the Executive, has issued advice on what may be done to prevent or reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism, including deep vein thrombosis, developing in the first place. The good practice clinical guideline <em>Prophylaxis of Venous Thromboembolism</em> was published in October 2002 and includes a section on long distance travel.

  <p>All acute hospitals throughout Scotland will be able to treat DVT. The treatment is not normally complicated, however, and many cases are managed by the patient's GP or self-managed by the patient after instruction. In cases of recurrent DVT, which require investigation for an underlying predisposition to form clots (thrombophilia), screening is widely available across NHS Scotland.</p>

  <p>In December 2000 the UK National Screening Committee recommended that there was no evidence to support the introduction of a population-based thrombophilia screening programme. Screening for individuals considered to be at high risk is available throughout NHSScotland.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what advice is given to women (a) under 50 and (b) over 50 who currently receive hormone replacement therapy for menopausal symptoms.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2004-01-19.39.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80018" speakername="Malcolm Chisholm" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-04/wa0119.htm#14">

  <p>The UK Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) and its expert working group on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) have kept the safety of HRT under constant review and have provided advice to health professionals and women in response to important new evidence as it emerged. The latest advice was cascaded to health professionals and women in December 2003.</p>

  <p>At that time, the CSM advised that, for women of all ages, the benefits of short-term use of HRT for the relief of menopausal symptoms outweigh the risks for most women.</p>

  <p>For women who are over 50 years of age, HRT should no longer be considered as a first-line therapy for the long-term prevention of osteoporosis. In women who are under 50 years and have experienced a premature menopause, HRT may be used until the age of 50 years.</p>

  <p>Prescribers are advised that each decision to initiate treatment with HRT should be made on an individual basis and that women should be made aware of the increased risk of adverse effects. Each treatment decision should take into consideration the known risks and benefits of HRT, the contraindications for use and each woman's individual circumstances. Importantly, the treatment should be re-evaluated at least annually in light of any new knowledge and any changes in the woman's risk factors.</p>

  <p>Product information provided with each pack of HRT reflects safety information. In addition, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and CSM website <a href="www.mhra.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.mhra.gov.uk</a> contains comprehensive information about the known risks associated with HRT use.</p>

  <p>As with all licensed medicines, the CSM keeps the safety of HRT under close review, and would take appropriate action if further evidence relating to its safe use became available.</p>

  <p>At present women under 50 are not offered routine breast screening due to the density of their breast tissue which makes it difficult to detect small breast cancers by mammography. The findings of a UK trial looking at the benefits of screening women from the age of 40 are expected in 2005 and will be considered in due course.</p>

  <p>The information, in the form requested, is not available. An average of the two years 2001-02 gives a total number of cancellations of 1,141 per annum, with 149 of these attributed to a lack of beds.</p>

  <p>There are many explanations for the cancellation of operations, other than a shortage of beds. They range from surgery no longer required, surgery done elsewhere, patient not fit, and patients not turning up. Others are cancelled perfectly legitimately, and in advance.</p>

  <p>We attach the highest importance to gaining the views of all professional staff and local communities in evolving community health partnerships (CHP) and this includes the issue of boundaries. The consultation paper on the development of CHPs issued on the 18 July emphasised that NHS boards must ensure that local authority partners are fully involved in the development of CHPs and that all proposed schemes should be developed through a bottom up inclusive process and demonstrate that the views of all stakeholders have been taken into consideration.</p>

  <p>A Chief Surveillance Commissioner is appointed by the Scottish ministers under section 2 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers (Scotland) Act 2000, for a term of three years. Under this legislation, removal of the Commissioner from office before the end of this term would require a resolution to be passed by the Scottish Parliament.</p>

  <p>A Chief Surveillance Commissioner is also appointed by the Prime Minister for a term of three years under section 91 of the Police Act 1997, after consultation with the Scottish ministers. Under this legislation, removal of the Commissioner from office before the end of this term would require resolutions passed by each House of Parliament and also by the Scottish Parliament.</p>

  <p>While the 2000 and 1997 Acts allow for 2 Chief Surveillance Commissioners, the two roles are presently carried out by the same person, Sir Andrew Leggatt.</p>

  <p>It is the duty of the Chief Surveillance Commissioner to keep under review the performance of functions under Part III of the 1997 act, and the exercise and performance of the powers and duties conferred or imposed by the 2000 act. In performance of this duty, the Commissioner reports annually to the Prime Minister and the Scottish ministers and a copy of this report is laid in the Scottish Parliament. His most recent report was laid in the Scottish Parliament on 9 September 2003 and a copy is available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 29152).</p>

  <p>3. Trust reports 10 neonatal special care cots outwith neonatal unit.</p>

  <p>4 Data for 1999 has been revised to exclude 17 incorrectly classified neonatal cots at Royal Hospital for Sick Children.</p>

  <p>General Notes:</p>

  <p>(a) The table shows information on average available staffed beds. This indicates the average daily number of beds which were staffed and were available for the reception of in-patients and day cases. Borrowed and temporary beds are included; beds in day bed units are excluded.</p>

  <p>(b) The figures presented in the table are averages; due to rounding, certain totals and sub-totals may not equate to the sum of the component figures shown.<a name="Title"></a></p>

  <p>(c) A neonatal unit is a facility which provides neonatal special care and/or neonatal intensive care for sick babies. Neonatal special care usually, but not always, takes place in a neonatal unit. Neonatal cots providing special care and which are located outwith a neonatal unit cannot be explicitly identified from the national dataset and so are excluded from the table.</p>

  <p>(d) ISD Scotland has contacted a number of trusts to gain more information about changing cot numbers over the period.</p>

  <p>(e) Local practices differ and this has an impact on the comparability of the number of cots between hospitals and between years. Stirling Royal Infirmary, for example, has 10 neonatal special care cots outwith their neonatal unit. These are not explicitly identifiable from the data and do not appear in the table.</p>

  <p>(f) Recent hospital closures and re-organisation of services has also had an impact on bed numbers. At Cresswell Maternity hospital in Dumfries and Galloway, some cots in the neonatal unit were used for babies whose mothers were unable to care for them immediately after birth. After closure of the Cresswell and transfer of services to the Royal Infirmary, these cots have been moved outwith the neonatal unit so reducing the number of cots recorded in a neonatal unit in Dumfries and Galloway from 12 to five between 2002 and 2003.</p>

  <p>(g) Similarly, the shift of services in Lanarkshire from Law and Bellshill hospitals and the reduction in cot numbers from 43 in 2001 to 20 in 2003 is accompanied by an increase in occupancy from 38% to 71% during the period (the trust reports current occupancy levels of 90%+ with regular occurances of 100%).</p>

  <p>(h) Raigmore Hospital in Highland NHS board area report the reduction from 18 cots to 12 in 2003 is associated with an increase in occupancy.</p>

  <p>(i) Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow report the incorrect classification of cots in a neonatal unit in 1999. These have been excluded from the table. The 17 cots at Rutherglen Maternity Hospital were special care cots for moderately sick babies or those waiting to be transferred. After closure, mothers went to the Southern General and Princess Royal hospitals and the Lanarkshire maternity units.</p>

  <p>(j) The general fall in average available staffed beds in neonatal units is accounted for by two reasons.</p>

  <p>The closure of maternity hospitals due to the falling birth rate. The falling birth rate has also reduced the need for special care beds in neonatal units.</p>

  <p>Developments in technology and care mean that fewer sick babies need to be admitted to neonatal units for special care.</p>

  <p>The information requested is shown in the following table.</p>

  <p>The out-patient mode value of 0 days accounts for around 4% of cases and includes, for example, patients who attend &quot;drop-in&quot; out-patient clinics and urgent same day referrals from General Medical Practitioners.</p>

  <p>The in-patient mode value of one-day accounts for around 4% cases and includes, for example, patients where a clinical decision has been made to treat them urgently and a session is available at short notice.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the annual (a) actual and (b) additional cost would be of providing free prescriptions to (i) the whole population and (ii) those people who are currently not eligible and who have (1) a terminal illness and (2) long-term health problems.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to produce firm estimates of the actual or additional costs to the NHS of providing free prescriptions for the whole population of Scotland or for the patient groups specified.</p>

  <p>The NHS currently receives around &pound;47 million per year from prescription charge income. This income would be lost if prescriptions were provided free. In addition NHS spending on GP services, the drugs bill and pharmacists' remuneration could rise if people obtained on prescription items that they would previously have bought over the counter. Such increases, though likely, cannot be quantified. Cost reductions are unlikely to exceed &pound;1 million per year, made up of administrative savings on certain prescription fraud prevention measures, prescription charge refunds and pre-payment certificate services which would no longer being required.</p>

  <p>The costs or savings which would arise from providing free prescriptions for people suffering from a terminal illness or long-term health problems cannot be estimated. The number of people that fall into these groups is not known, neither is the number required to pay for their prescriptions under the current prescription charging arrangements. Consequently, it is not possible to identify and cost the drugs prescribed or the number of prescriptions written for these patients. People suffering from a terminal illness who are receiving palliative care in hospital or in a hospice do not pay for their prescribed drugs.</p>

  <p>Where a main contractor has been placed in administration, payments due to the main contractor will usually form a part of that contractor's assets and it is for the administrator to determine whether any further sums are due from the consortium.</p>

  <p>The Executive does not consider that any new provisions are required. In a public private partnership situation it is important to preserve the transfer of risk to the consortium which lies at the heart of the public private partnership contract and is the basis of value for money for the taxpayer. Direct payments to sub-contractors would not be consistent with these fundamentals.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it still intends to require (a) all new adult care homes to meet the standards for en suite facilities and (b) an end to shared rooms in 2007 and how many care home places it estimates will be lost as a result of such requirements.</p>

  <p>There are no plans to alter the requirements in the National Care Standards for the provision of en suite facilities in all newly built adult care homes and the offer of single rooms in existing care homes, to those who want them, by 2007. There is some flexibility for interpreting the standards for existing homes; in particular it can be agreed between the provider and the Care Commission to allow good quality rooms and en suite facilities in existing homes that do not meet the standards to remain in use.</p>

  <p>The Executive has no evidence to suggest that any care home places will be lost as a result of the requirements in the standards.</p>

  <p>Training in relation to the non-numeric standard would be broadly the same as for the numeric standard. Additional training on the court presentation of non-numeric evidence would, however, be required.</p>

  <p>The fingerprint experts at the Scottish Criminal Record Office will continue to be trained at the National Training Centre, Durham. They will also continue to have annual competency tests and be subject to a Continuous Professional Development Programme.</p>

  <p>The performance target for the quality of fingerprint evidence would continue to be that every identification opinion given would be the product of an authorised expert, trained to the highest standards, subject to annual competency testing, using processes subject to external audit and operating within an internationally recognised Quality Management System.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The figures for the staff cost spend in 2001-02 and 2002-03 exclude expenditure which was reimbursed from DEFRA to meet the Scottish Executive costs of the foot and mouth outbreak.</p>

  <p>2. The 1999-2000 and 2000-01 programme budget figures were published in <em>Serving Scotland's Needs, The Government's Expenditure Plans 1999-2000 to 2001-02</em> and the 2001-02 and 2002-03 programme budget figures were published in the 2003-04 Annual Expenditure Report.</p>

  <p>3. Following the introduction of Resource Accounting and Budgeting the programme budget figures for 2001-02 and 2002-03 include non-cash resource adjustments to reflect capital charges and are not therefore directly comparable with the programme budget figures for 1999-2000 and 2000-01 which are reported on a cash basis.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-4498 by Ross Finnie on 10 December 2003, whether it will now comment on the Water Customer Consultation Panel's report <em>Affordability of Water and Sewerage Charges for Low Income Households</em> and specifically on the recommendations that the Executive's current water and sewerage charges reduction scheme, due to expire in April 2004, should be extended in scale, scope and time, that Scottish Water should consider assuming responsibility for collecting water and sewerage charges and that the policy of selective household metering should be pursued with more vigour across the country.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to securing substantial efficiency savings at Scottish Water as the principal means of easing pressure on water and sewerage charges for all customers, including those in low income and vulnerable households. In addition, particular assistance to low income households is provided through the link between water charges and the council tax banding and discount arrangements.</p>

  <p>The Executive is assessing the impact that ending the current Water and Sewerage Charges Reduction Scheme will have in light of harmonisation of charges. A decision on whether any further action is required will be made in light of this assessment.</p>

  <p>In terms of collecting water and sewerage charges, local authorities are currently responsible for collecting charges for domestic customers. This is an efficient and customer friendly way of charging. It enables customers to pay for two services with one bill; and it avoids them having to meet, through higher water bills, the costs that otherwise would arise from having to establish and maintain a separate billing system for water and sewerage services.</p>

  <p>The practice of local authorities collecting water and sewerage charges is also the basis of the crucial link between charges and the council tax banding and discount arrangements. Giving Scottish Water responsibility to collect charges would not only result in increased bills for customers, it would undermine these arrangements to the detriment of low income and vulnerable households.</p>

  <p>The Executive has no plans of directing Scottish Water to pursue a policy of household metering.</p>

  <p>None.</p>

  <p>Under current legislation, land managers have powers to deal direct at all times with incursions of deer onto arable land, improved pasture or enclosed woodlands where the occupier believes that serious damage will be caused to woodland, crops, pasture or human or animal foodstuffs.</p>

  <p>We have not ruled out future updating of deer legislation in Scotland to improve effective management and welfare. However, the Executive is yet to be convinced that existing compulsory powers will not work particularly when underpinned by robust, sound evidence of damage. Meanwhile, the Deer Commission for Scotland will use the powers already at their disposal if that becomes necessary to achieve change.</p>
