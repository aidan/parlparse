  <p>We are in the process of consulting the fishing industry to ascertain their views on the development of trade in fish quotas and the need for guidance on legal entitlement to quotas and licences under present legislation.</p>

  <p>The first meeting of a working group established to consider these issues was held on 11 April. I have arranged for a full copy of the papers tabled for discussion by the group to be made available to the Parliament&#8217;s Information Centre. As I have already indicated in my reply to Mr Lochhead&#8217;s questions on this issue (S1W-5315 and S1W-5316), I shall consider the working group&#8217;s findings and recommendations and report to the Rural Affairs Committee in due course.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-6410 by Mr John Home Robertson on 11 May 2000, what amounts of fixed quota units for the North Sea and west of Scotland fisheries which are administered by its Rural Affairs Department Fisheries Division have been, for the past two years (a) attached to fishing vessels&#8217; licences, (b) attached to producers&#8217; organisations&#8217; &quot;dummy vessels&quot; and (c) held on producers&#8217; organisations&#8217; &quot;dummy vessels&quot; on behalf of an individual or company.</p>

  <p>The number of North Sea and West of Scotland fixed quota units in groups (producer organisations, the Lunar group, and Scottish-based non-sector vessels, but excluding the under 10 metre group), administered by the Rural Affairs department was as follows:</p>

  <p>Since three new quota stocks were introduced this year, the figures for the two years are not directly comparable.</p>

  <p>Information on ownership of units attached to dummy vessels is held by producer organisations and is not available centrally.</p>

  <p>Scottish Ministers have instructed that proposals are developed to prevent an accused person charged with a sex offence from cross-examining a victim personally and to strengthen provisions restricting cross-examination on sexual history. Ministers will immediately begin the process of taking advice on how this can be done while ensuring that the accused receives a fair trial.</p>

  <p>I have replied today, and apologise for the delay in doing so. As a result of the raised profile we have given to carers&#8217; issues and the number of initiatives underway, a backlog of correspondence built up. This has now been cleared.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, <a name="QuestionText"> further to the answer to question S1W-2555 by Ms Wendy Alexander on 26 November 1999, whether it will indicate the proportion of (a) children, (b) working age people and (c) older people who are living in households with (i) less than 50%, and 60% and 70% of median GB income and (ii) less than 50%, and 60% of mean GB income, both before and after deduction of housing costs, living in West Dunbartonshire, East Dunbartonshire, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Dundee local authority areas.</a></p>

  <p>The information requested cannot be provided at sub-Scotland level. The answer to question S1W-2555 was drawn from the Households Below Average Income dataset using the Family Resources Survey which does not have sufficient sample size to produce the required level of detail at Scottish local authority level.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Household Survey will provide information on household income by local authority area after the first full sweep of the survey (i.e. after two years) &#8211; the results of which are not likely to be made available until summer 2001.</p>

  <p>Work is also underway to investigate new methodologies and to consider boosting existing samples to give better coverage for Scotland to try to overcome this problem.<br /></p>
