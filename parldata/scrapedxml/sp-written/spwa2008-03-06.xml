  <p>Average journey time information for the Forth Road Bridge is not available. However, the Scottish Government and FETA collect data on traffic flows.</p>

  <p>There are a variety of factors that can impact on traffic flows on the Forth Road Bridge, including school half-term, and other seasonal factors.</p>

  <p>While it would be premature to come to conclusions about changes in traffic flows due to the abolition of bridge tolls, initial analysis shows that overall average weekday traffic flows across the bridge have increased by around 1% from pre toll levels. Indications are that northbound only traffic flows increased by almost 3%, with southbound traffic flows showing a slight decrease over the same period.</p>

  <p>The operation and maintenance of the Forth Road Bridge is a matter for the Forth Estuary Transport Authority (FETA). There are several examples of bridges where wind shielding has been incorporated and as a result vehicles are unaffected by inclement weather. However, wind shielding cannot be retrofitted on the existing Forth Road Bridge for structural reasons.</p>

  <p>Planning for major works involving possible lane closures on the Forth Road Bridge is at an early stage. No assessment has been made at this stage of the need for possible traffic mitigation measures.

  <p>The Financial Memorandum to the Abolition of Bridge Tolls (Scotland) Bill explained that the overall cost to the public purse of abolishing the tolls is the annual loss of net toll income. Net toll income on the Forth Road Bridge is estimated at &pound;10.8 million at current prices and traffic volumes.</p>

  <p>In addition there are transitional costs relating to the removal of tolling equipment, remodelling of the toll plaza for road safety reasons, and the costs of staff redundancies. These costs are estimated at between &pound;3.5 million and &pound;4 million which will fall partly in financial year 2007-08 and partly in financial year 2008-09.</p>

  <p>The responsibility for the management and delivery of the Scottish curriculum is a matter for education authorities and head teachers, or in the case of independent schools, the boards of governors and head teachers. The Scottish Government&rsquo;s concordat with COSLA includes as a national outcome that our young people are successful learners, confident individuals, effective contributors and successful citizens. It is, therefore, the responsibility of each local authority and schools to consider the contribution that study opportunities such as Holocaust education will make to the national outcome and make them available to pupils within their own funding allocations.</p>

  <p>We do not hold data on the number of schools which teach or do not teach pupils on the Holocaust. Currently, schools are encouraged to deliver education using the National 5-14 guidelines, published by Learning and Teaching Scotland (LTS). These programmes offer a number of opportunities for young people to learn about citizenship education, which includes learning about the Holocaust. Curriculum for Excellence will provide opportunities for teachers to use the cross curricular theme of Citizenship education in a variety of different curriculum areas throughout the curriculum. There will also be rich opportunities through the social studies outcomes including the emphasis on the rights and responsibilities of individual and nations, and through the impending Religious Moral Education outcomes to foster the development of values, beliefs and attitudes.</p>

  <p>There are no plans to update the Holocaust teaching packs prepared by LTS in 2000 and 2002. However, there are support materials and information on a number of LTS websites which support teaching about the events of the Holocaust. In particular, a key aspect of effective education for citizenship is developing the ability to recognise and respond thoughtfully to values and value judgements that are part of political, economic, social and cultural life.</p>

  <p>Holocaust Memorial Day is included on the Enterprise wall planner which is sent to every school in Scotland. The date is also highlighted in e-bulletins which are sent to teachers and local authorities and <em>The Times Educational Supplement Scotland</em> and the LTS online service publicise good practice.</p>

  <p>I raised this issue with Scottish Power when I met with them on 17 December 2007. Scottish Power advises that they operate the same &quot;back-charging&quot; policy across the UK. They assure me that they make every effort to gain access to homes to recalibrate meters and if they are not satisfied that proper procedures for meter reading and timeous re-calibration of meters has been carried out they will waive back-charges. The company is pushing ahead with their programme of replacing their prepayment meters with meters that can be re-calibrated remotely. I understand that it has now replaced 220,000 meters. I urged Scottish Power to complete the meter replacement programme as quickly as possible.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not routinely collect statistical information on the turnover of businesses by the ethnic profile of their owner. This issue was however examined in the research report <em>Minority Ethnic Enterprise in Scotland</em> . The report has been published on the Scottish Executive website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/06/20132742/28083" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/06/20132742/28083</a> . The report found that in 2005 ethnic minority businesses contributed between &pound;500 million and &pound;700 million to the Scottish economy.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what its response is to the European Commission&rsquo;s outline proposals to prohibit the use of patio heaters by restaurants and bars as part of an emissions reduction programme.</p>

  <p>The European Commission has not outlined any proposals to prohibit the use of patio heaters. The European Commission has, however, published an action plan for energy efficiency to realise significant savings in EU annual primary energy consumption by 2020, the scope of which could include products such as patio heaters.</p>

  <p>The UK Government leads on the energy efficiency of products and the Scottish Government works closely with them to ensure that this is in line with our policies. We support the UK Government&rsquo;s commitment to reducing energy wastage in consumer products and the lobbying of the EU to press for improvements in efficiency, particularly through Directive 2005/32/EC on the eco-design of <br /> energy-using products.</p>

  <p>We want the Commission to concentrate its initial efforts on the Directive to drive improvements in the major energy-using products such as lights, household appliances, consumer electronics, air conditioning and electric motors. While patio heaters are wasteful, they account for a relatively small amount of energy use in comparison. We would not therefore see them as the highest priority for EU legislative action, but would support work to look at them in due course.</p>

  <p>At the same time we continue to urge all consumers and businesses to think carefully about their CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and how to reduce them, from all sources, including the use of appliances for outdoor heating.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is delivering on a manifesto commitment to carry out a study into Road Equivalent Tariff (RET) with a pilot on the Western Isles to mainland routes. Mr Swinney announced details of the RET study during his visit to Stornoway on 13 August 2007. That announcement made it clear that we would carry out a study into RET in the context of ferry fares in Scotland and that it would include a pilot exercise on one or more of the Western Isles to mainland routes.</p>

  <p>The consultants concluded that all the Western Isles to mainland routes should be included in the pilot. Focussing on the Western Isles to mainland routes initially will allow us to reach a view on the potential benefits of the scheme and to take informed decisions on the potential impacts across other routes.</p>

  <p>Consideration will be given to the roll out of RET across the Clyde and Hebrides and Northern Isles networks once the impact of RET has been evaluated.</p>

  <p>The central purpose of <em>Scottish Planning Policy (SPP) 7 &ndash; Planning and Flooding</em> is to prevent further development which would have a significant probability of being affected by flooding or which would increase the probability of flooding elsewhere. The Association of British Insurers were a key consultee during its preparation and fully endorsed the Risk Framework approach to development planning set out in the SPP.

  <p>Section 48(6) of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 has the effect that once a reporter has issued a decision on an appeal that decision is final and neither he/she nor Scottish ministers have any further jurisdiction in the matter. This means that it is not possible for Scottish ministers, the appointed reporter or the Directorate for Planning and Environmental Appeals (DPEA) to comment on the merits of the appeals other than to say that the reporters&rsquo; decisions were based on the evidence presented at the public local inquiries and on all written submissions by the parties involved. The letter allowing the appeal and granting outline planning permission for residential development at Harbour Place, Dalgety Bay applied a condition to the consent that the detailed drawings for the scheme, particularly in relation to minimum floor levels and other protective measures, shall take into account the results of a formal Flood Impact Assessment carried out by a suitably qualified person and that this document shall be submitted to the planning authority as part of the application for approval of reserved matters. This condition was attached in the interests of public safety and in view of the location immediately next to the Firth of Forth, and of the low-lying and at least partially artificial nature of the ground at the site</p>

  <p>The General Register Office for Scotland (GROS) has provided the UK Identity and Passport Service (IPS) with limited online access to the registers of births, marriages and deaths for Scotland. Between 2000 and 2004, as part of work to detect identity theft, GROS gave IPS online access to a computer index to the Scottish birth, marriage and death registers. The index contained limited fields of information taken from the Scottish registers and was also used by the public in the family history search rooms at the GROS office in Edinburgh and at local registration offices. IPS was offered this facility to enable it to check the facts of births against potentially fraudulent applications for passports. The service was rarely used by IPS and has now been discontinued.</p>

  <p>More recently, the Registrar General has had preliminary discussions with IPS on how Scottish registration data might be provided to the IPS under section 56 of the Local Electoral Administration and Registration Services (Scotland) Act 2006.</p>

  <p>Any transfer of Scottish registration data held by the General Register Office for Scotland to the Home Office would be covered by Section 56 of the Local Electoral Administration and Registration Services (Scotland) Act 2006. Section 56 enables the Registrar General for Scotland to provide Scottish registration information to any public body or office holder, including Government departments in the UK. The information in the Scottish registers is publicly available.</p>

  <p>In addition, under section 9 of the Identity Cards Act 2006, the Registrar General for Scotland could be obliged to provide information to the Home Office for the specific purpose of verifying an individual&rsquo;s entry on the National Identity Register. This would require an Order to be made under the affirmative procedure by both Houses of the UK Parliament.</p>

  <p>The White Paper <em>Trust, Assurance and Safety - The Regulation of Health Professionals in the 21st Century</em> , published in February 2007 and endorsed by all four UK countries, confirmed that, with the exception of the new pharmacy regulator, no new statutory regulators will be established. It also confirmed that psychologists will be regulated by the Health Professions Council.</p>

  <p>Whether educational psychologists should be one of the domains of practitioner psychologist to be regulated by the Health Professions Council is a matter currently being consulted on across the UK, including on behalf of the Scottish ministers. The consultation paper on the draft Health Care and Associated Professions (Miscellaneous Amendments) (No. 2) Order 2008 confirms the seven domains considered to fit within the definition of practitioner psychologist, and asks whether all them should be statutorily regulated by the Health Professions Council and, if not, which domains should not. The consultation concludes on 22 March 2008, following which the responses will be considered for the final version of the draft Order to be laid for approval by resolution of both the Scottish Parliament and Westminster.</p>

  <p>Intensive support and monitoring will be available to all local areas from 1 April 2008. Responsibility for the effective use of these measures is a matter for local agencies. Scottish Government is taking forward a programme of work to support local areas in managing high-risk young people, including through the use of intensive support and monitoring for young people who meet the criteria and may benefit from the service. This includes updated regulations, training, good practice, events and the deployment of professional advisers to provide on-going support utilising the experience of intensive support and monitoring Phase One areas.</p>

I met the Scottish Pensioners Forum in November and with the Fife Elderly Forum in December. Next month I will chair a meeting of the Older People&rsquo;s Consultative Forum, which includes key representative bodies.</p>

  <p>It is for NHS boards to determine the levels of service provision for young physically disabled adults based on local needs. The majority of the recommendations from the NHS Quality Improvement Scotland review were for the NHS board. Implementing and monitoring the recommendations of the review is the responsibility of the board&rsquo;s Physical Disabilities Planning Group. Two of the recommendations are being progressed at national level through the wheelchair and seating services project team; and the development of neurological standards.</p>

  <p>There is a strong working relationship between the Scottish Police Services Authority (SPSA) Forensic Services and police forces. There are Service Level Agreements (SLAs) in place governing both the relationship and workloads and the SLAs are regularly reviewed through liaison meetings at operational and management level. SPSA Scene Of Crime Officers are directly tasked by police forces. At a strategic level, ACPOS has established a forensic science advisory group, chaired by the Assistant Chief Constable of Grampian Police, which includes membership of the SPSA Director of Forensic Science.</p>

  <p>Police forensic services and development of forensic science laboratories are operational matters for the Scottish Police Services Authority (SPSA). Following a facilities review of police forensic science, SPSA has recently submitted a business case, for approval by the Scottish Government, proposing the merger of the laboratories currently situated in Aberdeen and Dundee to a purpose built facility in Dundee. The Scottish Government recognises the need for investment in police forensic science facilities and is currently assessing the SPSA business case. In reaching a decision, careful consideration will be given to the impact on staff and the service provided to police forces, along with the potential efficiencies and service benefits a new facility could deliver.</p>

  <p>The decision to reduce the amount of Rape Crisis Specific Fund paid to Lanarkshire Rape Crisis Centre by &pound;50,000 was taken by the previous Labour / Liberal Democrat Executive.</p>

  <p>In November 2005, every rape crisis centre in Scotland was invited to bid for up to &pound;50,000 pa under the Rape Crisis Specific Fund 2006-08. However, newer centres, in Lanarkshire and Western Isles, were invited to apply for up to &pound;100,000 in 2006-07, extra resources being made available in year one of the fund to assist these centres to develop their services. The previous administration made clear to both centres that in 2007-08 funding of &pound;50,000 only would be available, bringing these centres in line with others across Scotland. Both centres were offered the opportunity to discuss, with Rape Crisis Scotland and officials from the previous Scottish Executive, the implications of this approach and identification of what alternative sources of funding might be available.</p>

  <p>A considerable amount of evidence, relating to a wide range of bird species is already available from existing sources, including international studies and third party research.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Government and Scottish Natural Heritage commissioned a research project in 2006 to undertake &quot;Field Studies on the effects of wind farms on Upland Birds&quot;. The work is being carried out by scientists from RSPB Scotland. This is a correlative study comparing breeding bird densities and distributions on operational wind farms across upland Britain with similar areas close to the wind farms, and will report in summer 2008.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government generally includes the requirement for developers to monitor impacts on breeding birds over a number of years as a condition of any consent under Section 36 of the Electricity Act for wind farm developments. In due course analysis of these time-series studies will be able to complement the correlative study, but only after a substantial number of wind farms have been operational for at least five years. In addition, specific studies on the effects of wind farms on red kites have been required, as conditions of consent, of two developers whose wind farms are in close proximity to red kite populations.</p>

  <p>Electricity generation from these sources qualifies for support under the Renewables Obligation (Scotland) mechanism. Onshore wind and hydro power are established technologies which do not require additional support. However, we will consult in the near future on proposals for the Obligation to provide additional support for emerging technologies, and through the Forum for Renewable Energy Development in Scotland (FREDS) we are exploring the potential for the further development of the hydro sector.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has made offers of grant totalling almost &pound;25 million to support a number of projects using wave and tidal energy, biomass and hydrogen fuel cells.</p>

  <p>Scottish Government also funds support for community and microgeneration, covering a wide range of renewable energy technologies. Expenditure was &pound;4.2 million in 2006-07 and is expected to be over &pound;5.5 million for 2007-08.</p>

  <p>Smaller scale on-shore developments below the Electricity Act 1989 thresholds are consented by local planning authorities under the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997. We do not currently maintain records of the number of applications consented by local planning authorities but arrangements are being put in place to do so.</p>

  <p>Off-shore electricity generating developments (tidal, wave and off-shore wind) which have a generating capacity below 1Mw do not require consent under Section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989. Instead all offshore developments (regardless of size or purpose) require consent under section 34 of the Coastal Protection Act 1949 for works which could cause an obstruction or danger to navigation and additionally a licence under Food and Environmental Protection Act 1985 for construction activities or depositing of materials in the sea. Figures for these consents and licences are not held centrally.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>Under section 22(1)(dd) of the Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 1986 a court can automatically appoint a solicitor to a person accused of a sexual offence as defined under section 288B of the Criminal Procedure(Scotland) Act 1995. Since April 2004 to date, we are aware of only 16 such grants. Some of these appointed solicitors may have subsequently applied for sanction to appoint counsel.</p>

  <p>It is the responsibility of the applicant to provide such information as might be necessary for the purposes of an appropriate assessment or to enable a determination to be made as to whether an appropriate assessment is required. Competent authorities responsible for decisions on applications for development (or in relation to other activities) potentially affecting a Special Protection Area or Special Area of Conservation must consult the appropriate nature conservation body which, in relation to such sites in Scotland, is Scottish Natural Heritage.</p>

  <p>It is for the European Court of Justice to determine whether member states secure proper compliance with their obligations under the EC Birds and Habitats Directives. In its application of these Directives through legislation and in its decisions, the Scottish Government takes full cognisance of relevant decisions and judgements. Details of such decisions and judgements can be accessed via the following web link: http://curia.europa.eu/en/content/juris/index.htm</p>

  <p>This government&rsquo;s overarching purpose, as set out in the <em>Scottish Budget: Spending Review 2007</em> , is to focus government and public services on creating a more successful country with opportunities for all of Scotland to flourish through increasing sustainable economic growth.

  <p>The Requirements for Teachers (Scotland) Regulations 2005 place a requirement on local authorities to employ adequate numbers of teachers with the appropriate professional skills and knowledge necessary to enable those teachers to undertake the teaching duties to which they are assigned.

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s purpose is to create a more successful country through increasing sustainable economic growth. A strong tourism industry directly supports that purpose, and also our strategic objective to realise our full economic potential with more and better employment opportunities. Our ambition is to work closely with the tourism industry to help it to grow revenues by 50% by 2015, and we continue to work to the &quot;Tourism Framework for Change&quot; blueprint which you instigated.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally. Various public sector organisations provide funding to support tourism activities across Scotland; many such activities (for example the marketing of Scotland as the Home of Golf by VisitScotland) while of great benefit to Fife will be of benefit to other areas.

  <p>The concordat agreed between VisitScotland, COSLA and the Scottish Local Authorities Economic Development Group in 2007 consists of a set of standard Key Performance Indicators for use in agreements between VisitScotland and individual local authorities to establish a common performance reporting mechanism. These indicators are set out below. However, individual authorities may choose which indicators are appropriate for their area or different indicators may be agreed depending on the local circumstances.</p>

  <p>Key Performance Indicators for Local Authority Agreements With VisitScotland</p>

  <p>The timing of engineering works on the Forth Road Bridge is a matter for Forth Estuary Transport Authority (FETA) as the bridge authority. The FETA board considered, at its meeting on 22 February 2008, proposals to limit the potential disruption from the engineering works proposed for next year.</p>

  <p>The provision of public transport services is, however, primarily a matter for the local authorities and SESTRAN, in association with private sector operators. The Scottish Government is keen to see progress on the cross Forth hovercraft project, to be considered in the context of the wider study on cross Forth travel options being undertaken by SESTRAN, Fife and Edinburgh Councils.</p>

  <p>Advice from Scottish Water is that there are currently around 600 households (out of around 2.2 million) which pay for their water and sewerage services on a metered basis.</p>

  <p>The majority of households pay for these services by reference to the council tax band of the property, a result of which is that those occupying lower banded properties pay a correspondingly lower charge.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it plans to extend initiatives such as the Highland Youth Voice model to all parts of rural Scotland.</p>

  <p>There are a range of successful local youth engagement models across Scotland, including Highland Youth Voice. While the Government is keen to encourage local youth participation, it is for local authorities to work with local young people to determine the best model for their area.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government supports the Scottish Youth Parliament (SYP) in empowering young people across Scotland to influence decisions affecting their own lives and those of their schools and communities. Young people from rural areas and the Islands are represented on the SYP.</p>
