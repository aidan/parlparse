  <p>Structural fund spending is determined by strategies drawn up by partnerships involving key public and voluntary sector agencies. These establish objectives, priorities and measures for each of the EU programmes, and therefore reflect the funding priorities of the Scottish Executive, regional and local partners.</p>

  <p>The structural funds regulations govern how EU funding can be used in the member states. These regulations cover a variety of expenditure issues, notably cost eligibility, timing of payments, and audit requirements and procedures.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2003-08-12.6.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80092" speakername="Mrs Mary Mulligan" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-03/wa0812.htm#3">

  <p>We expect all local authorities to end the inappropriate use of bed and breakfast accommodation for homeless families with children and progress is being monitored closely. As recommended by the Homelessness Task Force, existing guidance, developed in consultation with COSLA and others, requires councils to identify in their homelessness strategies actions and targets for eliminating the use of bed and breakfast for families. Strategies are being assessed at present.</p>

  <p>The Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 introduced a requirement on local authorities to have regard to the best interests of dependent children in exercising their homelessness functions. The Homelessness etc. (Scotland) Act 2003 strengthens this requirement to make clear that the final accommodation provided must be suitable for occupation by such children so far as is consistent with their best interests.</p>

  <p>The power introduced to the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 by section 9 of the Homelessness etc. (Scotland) Act 2003 would enable ministers to specify accommodation which is unsuitable for use as interim accommodation for homeless households. It is a broad power which can be exercised subject to conditions or exceptions and which can be used to make different provision for different purposes and different areas. As such regulations under section 9 could be used to specify bed and breakfast accommodation as unsuitable interim accommodation for families. The Executive will consult in due course on use of the regulatory power introduced by section 9 of the 2003 act. The timing of the consultation will be informed by the assessment of local authority homelessness strategies.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive issued, in April 2002, Guidance Circular CCD 4/2002 <em>Free Personal and Nursing Care in Scotland</em> . This clearly sets out the contractual arrangements which should apply for personal and nursing care payments for people in care homes. Arrangements require local authorities to offer individuals the choice of contracting directly with care homes or asking the local authority to do so for them.</p>

  <p>The regulation of the electricity network is a reserved matter. However, the Executive participates in the work of the GB Transmission Issues Working Group (TIWG), which has been tasked with looking at the implications for the GB electricity network of the Government&#8217;s renewable targets. A report by the group, published in June 2003, estimated that the overall cost of connecting more than 6 gigawatts (GW) of additional renewable capacity in Scotland could be around &#163;1.75 billion.</p>
