  <p>The Executive fully recognises the importance of promoting access in the arts and boosting participation, and these are areas which continue to receive considerable attention. We have allocated additional funds to the National Museum of Scotland to allow it to abolish entrance charges and to the National Institutions and National Companies for them to devote staffing and resources to valuable outreach work. The Scottish Arts Council also launched its first policy for Contemporary Popular Music in March 2001 to encourage participation and involvement in quality popular music by young Scots. A wide range of other steps, planned and being taken, are set out in the First Annual Report on the implementation of the National Cultural Strategy which was presented to Parliament in October.</p>

  <p>The Executive announced on 25 October that additional support would be given to audience development initiatives aiming to bring people into contact with the arts. I am delighted to say that this year an additional &#163;50,000 is being devoted specifically for this purpose and a further &#163;50,000 to projects which promote access and participation in the arts and culture by socially excluded groups. Plans for these initiatives are being taken forward by the Scottish Arts Council. This is in addition to the wide range of initiatives and research already funded by the council under its &#163;0.5 million Audience and Sales Development Lottery scheme and the &#163;120,000 voted funds allocated for audience development, including the maintenance of a full-time Audience Development Officer at the council. Also, the council's social inclusion scheme has given, or is about to give, support to about 30 of the 48 Social Inclusion Partnerships to establish arts projects within local communities.</p>

  <p>As part of the Scottish Arts Council's &#163;0.5 million lottery funding scheme for audience and sales development the council has funded a range of training programmes for marketing staff in arts organisations throughout the country including those in socially and economically disadvantaged communities. The most recent of these was a marketeers forum hosted by the council on 28 November where over 100 marketing officers from arts organisations attended. The council will also continue to work with local authorities to support access to the arts for socially and economically disadvantaged people and communities.</p>

  <p>The <i>National Cultural Strategy </i> includes a key priority to develop wider opportunities for cultural access. Increasing access to the arts is therefore a priority for the Executive and audience development is an important aspect of this. Scottish funding bodies and public sector arts providers are aware of this emphasis and the Scottish Arts Council, as part of its &#163;0.5 million lottery funding scheme for audience and sales development, is exploring ways to market arts events to all possible audiences including those affected by social exclusion. The local authorities' contribution is being considered by a working group of the Executive and COSLA with a view to developing guidelines setting out best practice.</p>

  <p>In awarding to the Scottish Arts Council &#163;15.2 million in additional funding over the period of the spending review, the Executive made clear the importance it attached to work in disadvantaged areas. This reflects our priorities set out in the <i>National Cultural Strategy</i> , which was launched last year. It included a key priority to maximise the social benefits of culture. The First Annual Report on the implementation of the strategy published on 25 October set out a wide range of actions taken and planned to maximise culture's contribution to promoting social justice. We will continue to work with the local authorities and the council to maximise the benefit of the arts in these communities.</p>

  <p>Under the scheme announced on 15 November, it is for the Primary Care Trust to agree with the dental profession locally how best to target the available funding. One of the areas in which we have indicated we wish to see this funding used is to make practices more child-friendly.</p>

  <p>On 21 November, there was also an announcement about the introduction of a caries prevention scheme, including fissure sealing and preventative work, for six and seven-year-olds in Scotland.</p>

We are now seeing a significant increase in the number of modern computers in every school and almost all secondary schools are connected to the internet.</p>

  <p>The Enterprise Network&#8217;s activities in the commercial and industrial sectors stem directly from the Executive&#8217;s <i>strategy A Smart, Successful Scotland</i> , whose key themes are Growing Businesses, Learning and Skills, and Global Connections. In addition, Highlands and Islands Enterprise discharges its responsibility for social development through the strategic theme of Strengthening Communities.</p>

  <p>Resource allocations made by the networks in response to this strategic framework are not normally specific to individual sectors. They relate to the opportunities and need for activities such as training, product development, marketing, business start-up, property provision and business development finance across a wide range of sectors.</p>

  <p>However, Scottish Enterprise currently has in place specific strategies for the following industrial sectors:</p>

  <p>We have been working with Scottish Enterprise to encourage Scottish companies to diversify into the manufacturing opportunities which are arising from development of renewable energy sources under the Executive&#8217;s proposed Renewables Obligation (Scotland). A roadshow on the subject was well attended by companies, and several of them are now pursuing opportunities for new business. We will continue to promote the renewables industry, to attract investment to Scotland and to help Scottish companies take advantage of this new business opportunity.</p>

  <p>My officials attended the council as part of the UK Delegation.</p>

  <p>The council discussed a Commission proposal to extend the fourth Multi-Annual Guidance Programme (MAGP IV) for a further year as a transitional measure pending the outcome of the Common Fisheries Policy review next year. MAGP IV sets targets for reducing capacity and effort of EU fishing fleets and is due to expire at the end of this year. The UK supported the Commission in its proposals to extend targets into 2002 and to tighten the rules on public aid for vessel modernisation and construction, in order to ensure that such aid does not increase capacity beyond the set limits. However, there was disagreement among member states about the way forward and this issue is likely to be reconsidered at the December council.</p>

  <p>The council discussed the difficult negotiations with the North Atlantic coastal states about setting a total allowable catch for blue whiting for 2002, taking account of scientific advice that this stock is being heavily over-fished and is therefore at risk of collapse. The Commission was given a steer by ministers to seek to negotiate an agreed TAC at a further meeting of coastal states next month in order to secure sustainable exploitation of this stock.</p>

  <p>The council received a report from the Commission on monitoring of enforcement of CFP rules in Community waters and noted the Commission&#8217;s concerns about variations across members states in the level of enforcement and penalties for infringements. The Commission will be bringing forward proposals to address these concerns as part of the CFP Review.</p>

  <p>The council agreed a restructuring package for that part of the Spanish and Portuguese fleets which formerly fished in Moroccan waters, following the termination of the fisheries agreement between the EU and Morocco. The UK and several other member states made it clear that they expect Spain and Portugal to ensure that any residual vessels modernised with EU funds under this package will not fish in EU waters. There was also agreement on a renewed fisheries agreement between the EU and Mauritania.</p>

  <p>The Commission reported to ministers on an outline timetable for dealing with the reform of the CFP during 2002. The commission also reminded members of the importance of ratifying as soon as practicable the UN agreement on straddling stocks.</p>

  <p>The performance targets for the agency were announced on 5 June 2001 but since then, the agency has redirected its resources to increase the level of verification of pelagic landings and to focus more effort on combating non-compliance of the landing declaration regulations.

  <p>Our policy is clear. Firstly, there should be no commercial production of GM crops until the possible effects on the environment of growing them are thoroughly investigated.

  <p>Prevention of renal disease needs to concentrate on the main causes, diabetes and hypertension (high blood pressure). In relation to diabetes, the Executive has developed a Scottish Diabetes Framework which covers prevention and early detection, as well as a section on kidney problems. Reduction of hypertension is dealt with in the CHD/Stroke Task Force report, currently out for consultation, and our national demonstration project, Have a Heart Paisley. Work on Scotland&#8217;s diet, especially reducing the amount of salt in food, also plays a significant role. Initiatives to reduce high blood pressure will be beneficial in relation to renal disease as well as to CHD.</p>

  <p>The standards being developed by the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland in conjunction with the Scottish Renal Association will ensure that the management of renal disease continues to be of the highest quality. These are currently the subject of consultation.</p>

  <p>We are planning to bring the provisions in Part V which deal with the making of regulations, registration and the code of practice into force shortly so that the registration process can start in February 2002. Thereafter, other provisions will be brought into force so that criminal record certificates and enhanced criminal record certificates will start to become available from April 2002.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not available. All applications for public appointments are considered very carefully against the criteria for the appointment in question. As the political activity declaration makes clear, neither activity nor affiliation is a criterion for appointment. Information on the political activities of applicants is not collated centrally. The Commissioner for Public Appointments does not require this information. Most applications are retained for only a very short period and then destroyed.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive was in discussion with the Department of Trade and Industry and Oftel from 8 November 2001 regarding the potential switch-off of the Atlantic Telecom fixed wireless network on 25 November 2001. As soon as it became apparent that there was no possibility of a buyer being found for the fixed wireless network, we began looking at potential options for minimising disruption to Atlantic customers.</p>

  <p>On 24<sup> </sup>November 2001, the Scottish Executive and Department of Trade and Industry agreed to pay for the Atlantic fixed wireless network to remain open until 2 January 2002. The network will continue to provide the same limited service of incoming calls, outgoing emergency and toll free calls as has been provided since 10 November 2001. This should give alternative operators, including BT, time to provide customers with a new telephone service and new number.</p>

  <p>We are also paying for a messaging service, which will give former Atlantic customers the opportunity to leave a voicemail message on their old line publicising their new number.</p>

  <p>No order has yet been placed for wash basin surrounds <strong> </strong> within the new Scottish Parliament building. Spittal stone suits the aesthetic requirements of the project however, and is tried and tested in the horizontal plane. I understand, from the Convener of the Holyrood Progress Group, that fitness for purpose of the material chosen for wash basin surrounds will need to be demonstrated by the successful contractor.</p>

  <p>I understand that Caithness Stone Industries Ltd have not yet been paid in connection with the MSP building cladding contract. The Convener of the Holyrood Progress Group has confirmed that this is due to the financial difficulties of the contractor, Flour City Architectural Metals (UK) Ltd, who have now gone into receivership. The matter is now in the hands of the official receiver.</p>
