  <p><span lang=""><strong>John Swinney: </strong>The Economic Recovery Plan (ERP) sets out a number of priorities to accelerate recovery and to stimulate lasting improvements in Scotland&rsquo;s long-term economic performance. The plan is focussed on three broad themes: Investing in innovation and industries of the future; strengthening education and skills, and supporting jobs and communities.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">The plan has been focussed on responding to both the immediate short-term pressures arising as a result of the recession, particularly in the labour market and in terms of output, investment and confidence more generally, but also about protecting and improving the competitiveness and sustainability of the Scottish economy.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">Elements of the ERP are estimated to support around 15,000 jobs in the Scottish economy, including over 5,000 jobs that are estimated to have been supported by the accelerated capital spending programme. Estimates of the impacts of some of these actions have been set out in the Economic Recovery Plan updates &ndash; the most recent update was published on 3 March 2010 - and in the answer to question S3W-33003 on 28 April 2010.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">The wider impact of some of these interventions (such as support for skills development, training and the funding of additional places for apprentices, etc.) cannot be captured in the short-term as they improve the long run capacity of the economy.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="../../../Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx</a>.</span></p>

  <p><span lang=""><strong>John Swinney: </strong>The most recent Scottish labour market statistics show that for the period March-May 2010 the ILO unemployment rate in Scotland was 8.1%, compared to a rate of 7.8% for the UK, as a whole. However, what is clear from the trends in unemployment rates during the recession is that both the UK and Scotland have followed a similar upward trajectory. However, as unemployment (and labour market performance in general) tends to lag changes in output in the economy, the different timing in terms of entry into recession in Scotland (one quarter later) can explain differences in unemployment rates at different points during the recessionary and recovery phases. Differences in the nature of the economic cycle between Scotland and the UK are also a key factor.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">For an updated analysis of the State of Economy please see the latest assessment by the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Chief Economic Adviser, which was published on 2 August 2010.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">This information is not available. </span></p>

  <p><span lang="">However, the SPS has undertaken prison-wide snapshot audits across all Scottish prisons since 2006 of prisoners being prescribed methadone on a given day. On 8 December 2006, 1,228 prisoners were prescribed methadone, being 17.1% of the prisoner population on that day. These audits have demonstrated a 1% annual increase in the number of prisoners being prescribed methadone. </span></p>

  <p><span lang="">The latest audit in respect of prisoners held in custody on 23 July 2010 shows that 1,679 prisoners were prescribed methadone, being 21.5% of the prisoner population on that day. The majority, approximately 85%, are the continuation of prescriptions commenced in the community.</span></p>

  <p><span lang=""><strong>John Swinney: </strong>Community Benefit clauses are one of a range of social clauses that can be included in contracts. They have been used to achieve targeted recruitment and training, small and medium-sized social enterprise development and community engagement. </span></p>

  <p><span lang="">The setting of a level of wage in excess of that of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 as a pre-requisite of a public contract may amount to a restriction of freedom to provide services and could therefore be in breach of EU law. Consequently, we do not envisage that Community Benefit clauses will be used to set a living wage as part of Scottish Government contracts.</span></p>

  <p><span lang=""><strong>John Swinney: </strong>The Scottish Government processes travel and subsistence claims for a number of Scottish Government agencies and non-departmental public bodies.

  <p><span lang="">For journeys on official business undertaken by bicycle the rate payable is &pound;0.20 per mile. The travel and subsistence system only holds expenses data since 2005.

  <p><span lang=""><strong>Roseanna Cunningham: </strong>It is an offence under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 deliberately or accidentally to release sika deer or their hybrids into the wild.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">Sika deer are sufficiently well established in many parts of Scotland such that their eradication would be virtually impossible and it is likely that hybridisation in these areas has already occurred. Where there is local consensus about the need for control measures in an area where sika are not present or are attempting to colonise, Scottish Natural Heritage will be able to provide information, advice and support to deer managers to help with efforts to slow or halt the spread of sika deer, provided that control measures are carried out within the law.</span></p>

  <p><span lang=""><strong>Roseanna Cunningham: </strong>Scottish Natural Heritage has a duty under Section 1(1)(a)of the Deer (Scotland) Act<em> </em>1996, as amended by the Public Services Reform (Scotland) Act 2010, to &quot;further the conservation, control and sustainable management of deer&quot;. The 1996 act applies to red deer, roe deer, fallow deer and sika deer and any hybrids of those species. The Scottish Government recognises that sika are now a well-established species in mainland Scotland and that their eradication is not practicable. Decisions about sika deer management will be taken by local land managers to reflect their particular deer management objectives balanced with other needs, for example in relation to agriculture, forestry and public safety.</span></p>

  <p><span lang=""><strong>Roseanna Cunningham: </strong>The Scottish Government does not hold data recording the number of sika or sika hybrids in Scotland.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">The most recent studies show little change in the composition of hybridising populations over a 15 year timescale.
