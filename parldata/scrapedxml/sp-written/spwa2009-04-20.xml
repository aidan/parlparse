  <p>Research on the effect of mixing caffeine and alcohol is limited and inconclusive. The Scottish Government considers that the main issue is not the consumption of particular drinks or drink combinations but the sheer volume of alcohol that is being consumed in Scotland. Consumption has risen by almost 19% since 1980.</p>

  <p>That is why on 2 March we published our <em>Framework for Action </em>on Alcohol (Bib. number 47805) which contains a package of both long and short-term measures which together can deliver a sustainable change in Scotland&rsquo;s relationship with alcohol.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether there are specific standards for the education of children with an autistic spectrum disorder and, if so, how these standards are monitored.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-04-20.S3W-22421.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80331" speakername="Adam Ingram" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa0420.htm#2">

  <p>There are no specific standards for the education of children with additional support needs including autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Under section 2 of the Standards in Scotland&rsquo;s Schools etc. Act 2000 education authorities are required to secure that education is directed to the development of the personality, talents and mental and physical abilities of the child or young person to their fullest potential. This applies to all children including those with ASD.</p>

  <p>Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) inspects provision for ASD as part of its general inspection activity. The quality of educational provision for children with autism spectrum disorders is, therefore, subject to the same rigour and scrutiny as that applied to all children and young people.</p>

  <p>Any good practice which is identified whilst inspecting provision for ASD is posted on the HMIE website and is designed to help establishments to continuously improve and aspire to the best of practice for these children and young people.</p>

  <p>As a result of a request from Scottish ministers, HMIE carried out a specific task to evaluate and report on the educational provision for pupils with ASD. A report of the review&rsquo;s findings together with a literature review was published in October 2006. The report is used by the educational community to improve services to children and young people.</p>

  <p>On 3 April 2009, the Scottish Government launched <em>The Autism Toolbox: An Autism Resource for Scottish Schools.</em> This provides support and guidance to educational establishments to promote and develop high standards of provision for pupils with ASD.</p>

  <p>The free personal care policy was introduced to benefit people aged 65 and over receiving care in their own home or in a care home. Services are provided without charge to those assessed as requiring them at home. On the basis of an assessment of need, weekly payments of &pound;153 for personal care and &pound;69 for nursing care are available to people who meet their own care costs in care homes. There are no plans to extend this general provision to other care groups. For people under the age of 65, two forms of support are provided. Nursing care payments are available to care home residents who fully fund their care home costs, and people who have dementia or any other degenerative illness who require care, and who live in their own homes, can claim Disability Living Allowance. People over the age of 65 who attend day care services may be eligible for free personal care at home and Attendance Allowance.</p>

  <p>It is clear that being overweight, with a body mass index (BMI) of more than 30kg/m <sup>2</sup> means people are at much greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Measurements such as body weight and BMI therefore have an important role to play in the detection of the condition.</p>

  <p>Actions include the &quot;Keep Well&quot; programme, which assess the risk of cardiovascular disease, including diabetes, among those aged 45 to 64 living in deprived communities. A range of initiatives relating to diet and physical activity is intended to tackle obesity, and is underpinned by the provision of information through the Scottish Nutrition and Diet Resources Initiative, some of which are written specifically for people at risk of cardiovascular disease.</p>

  <p>This information is not collated or routinely held by the Scottish Government. The Enterprise Agencies, in this case Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE), are responsible for determining which businesses are considered to have high growth potential and the support they provide. In doing this, various factors are taken into account including potential revenue and employment, impact on the local economy, and market opportunity.</p>

  <p>HIE have advised the Scottish Government that they are currently developing relationships with 38 businesses and 24 social enterprises in the Western Isles which they believe have growth potential. This is a dynamic process and these numbers will fluctuate as markets change and new opportunities arise.</p>

  <p>HIE has published an Operating Plan 2008-11 which includes information on potential high growth businesses. The operating plan can be found at:</p>

  <p>The single outcome agreements (SOA) reflect the priorities and agreed outcomes for each council and include relevant supporting indicators and targets. It is for each community planning partnership (CPP) to derive its local outcomes which should be drawn from an integrated profile of the social, economic and environmental conditions of the area concerned. In reaching agreement with CPPs on their single outcome agreement, the Scottish Government will be looking for evidence that local outcomes reflect an area&rsquo;s strategic priorities and that they are capable of being linked to one or more of the National Outcomes.</p>

  <p>Copies of all 32 SOAs which were agreed with local authorities on 30 June 2008 can be obtained via the Improvement Service website by following the following link. CPPs will aim to publish revised single outcome agreements for 2009-10 at the beginning of June.</p>

  <p>Self referral to physiotherapy services are promoted by physiotherapists, community teams and through GP practices. However, we recognise that it is important that there should be a systematic approach to self-referral for physiotherapy services and work is in hand to develop this further. The centralised system, using the technologies of NHS 24, currently being piloted by NHS Lothian is considering how people access e-health and other services and work to implement the Framework for Adult Rehabilitation is also developing pathways to enable patients to access the services that they need.</p>

  <p>At present, there are no waiting times targets for access to physiotherapy services.</p>

  <p>The NHS in Scotland is working to achieve the Scottish Government&rsquo;s target of a maximum waiting time of 18 weeks from referral to treatment by the end of 2011. Earlier this year, we published the <em>18 Weeks: The Referral to Treatment Standard &ndash; Principles and Definitions</em> which was issued to NHS Boards. This guidance publication makes it clear that if a Consultant refers a patient to physiotherapy as an interim treatment, for example to alleviate pain, it will form part of that patient&rsquo;s 18-weeks pathway. The guidance also states that whilst the 18-weeks standard does not cover community/GP referrals within the extended primary care team, NHS boards should ensure that all patients have rapid access to the most appropriate health care practitioners.</p>

  <p>Physiotherapists and other Allied Health Professionals are involved in delivering patient care and treatment which has helped to cut waiting times for patients across Scotland. Treatments can include triage, assessment and therapeutic interventions in both hospital and community settings, sometimes avoiding the need for consultant referrals. Allied Health Professionals therefore have an important role to play in delivering better, faster care in a variety of roles and settings.</p>

A telehealth physiotherapy triage and referral management pilot service has already been established by NHS 24 within NHS Lothian. The aim of this pilot is to reduce the waiting time for physiotherapy advice/management by providing earlier access to screening, advice and onward referral management. This pilot is currently being evaluated with a view to national roll out. Work is also underway with NHS 24 to identify what other services provided by the Allied Health Professions can be developed within NHS 24, including musculoskeletal, dietetics and mental health services.</p>

  <p>The main functions of the Scottish Futures Trust (SFT) are as follows:</p>

  <p>To act as a focal point in Scotland for action in infrastructure investment by bringing together public and private sectors, promoting and disseminating innovation, good practice, and experience and by pursuing value for money in infrastructure investment.</p>

  <p>To take forward the workstreams identified in the SFT Business Case.</p>

  <p>To use combinations of expertise, NPD structures, programme based delivery models, hybrid funding structures, underpinning and aggregation, to be an arranger of funding that is cheaper than PFI, taking into account all factors including risk and its allocation.</p>

  <p>During 2009-10 to develop proposals setting out how private investment might be channelled for Scottish infrastructure priorities &ndash; referred to in the Strategic Business Case as SFT Finance and Investment.</p>

  <p>The Infrastructure Investment Unit co-ordinates policy work on infrastructure investment within the Scottish Government. The other functions of the Financial Partnerships Unit have been absorbed by SFT as part of its wider responsibilities.</p>
