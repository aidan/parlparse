  <p>Learning out of doors is being promoted as part of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s curriculum review. Outdoor learning has a clear contribution to make towards the Scottish Government&rsquo;s national outcome that all our young people should be successful learners, confident individuals, effective contributors and responsible citizens. HM Inspectorate of Education have also emphasised the value of well planned outdoor education experiences.</p>

  <p>Officials are currently developing proposals on how we might build on best practice and strengthen the opportunities for young people to participate in outdoor education. We have continued to fund a Learning and Teaching Scotland project which aims to encourage teachers to take children outside to learn.</p>

  <p>In March 2006 the Information Commissioner found that Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd had correctly applied the exemption in Section 33(1) (b) of the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002, that related to commercially sensitive data in a case where their competitors had sought the release of commercially sensitive data.</p>

  <p>It is considered that the information related to individual vessel leasing charges is commercially sensitive. On that basis, it is considered that the information should not be released in terms of section 33(1) of the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 where release of the information is likely to prejudice substantially the commercial interests of both CalMac Ferries Ltd and Caledonian Maritime Assets Ltd.</p>

  <p>Scotland was fortunate not to experience the widespread flooding suffered by England and Wales, but that the Scottish Government recognise that Scotland too can learn lessons from the floods. The Scottish Government has noted the interim findings and recommendations of Sir Michael Pitt&rsquo;s review into the summer 2007 flooding in England. The Scottish Government will consider the recommendations, and the final review findings published next summer, in the context of flood risk and flood response in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Figures for the number of people in fuel poverty are estimated from the results of the Scottish House Condition Survey. Figures for the individual years requested are unavailable, except for 2002. Surveys after 2002 were conducted on an annual but not calendar year basis for 2003-04, 2004-05 and 2005-06. From 2007 the survey moved to a calendar year basis. Figures for 2007 will be available in late 2008. The figures which are available are:</p>

  <p>While some social sector developments are specifically designed for wheelchair use, there is a general requirement for social sector new build to comply with Housing for Varying Needs standards. These standards supersede Barrier Free design standards, and build upon the concept of barrier free principles, which state that housing and its environment should meet the needs of almost everyone.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has made no commitment to build 30,000 affordable homes over the next three years. Our spending plans for affordable housing over the period 2008-11 are 19% higher than the spending plans of the last administration for the period 2005-08. With that additional funding, we expect to approve more new affordable houses over the period 2008-11 than will be approved over the period 2005-08. Precisely how many more will depend on how the social housing sector responds to the proposals in our discussion document, &quot;Firm Foundations: the future of housing in Scotland&quot;, for achieving better value from available public expenditure.</p>

  <p>The general privacy statement on the Scottish Government&rsquo;s main website, which includes the National Conversation pages, states that any analytical data collected will not be used to identify any user personally.</p>

  <p>Because contributors to the National Conversation are able to provide as much or as little identifying information as they consider appropriate, the Scottish Government considers IP addresses to have been provided in confidence and is therefore not in a position to disclose the origin of comments beyond what individuals have provided publicly themselves.</p>

  <p>The day-to-day deployment of police officers is a matter for individual chief constables, but we are supporting them in their various initiatives to cut bureaucracy, exploit new technology and free up officer time for redeployment to operational and front line duties.</p>

  <p>For example, Central Scotland Police is pioneering a mixed economy model which aims to challenge existing working practices and drive forward modernisation across the force. Strathclyde Police Board has recently approved plans that will free up over 100 desk jobs currently being carried out by uniformed officers.</p>

  <p>I have also asked the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland to consider efficiencies that might be released from centralising police recruitment and, as the member is aware, I continue to press the UK Government to change legislation to release police from the requirement to support VOSA (Vehicle and Operator Services Agency) in carrying out roadside checks &ndash; something which they are not required to do in England and Wales.</p>

  <p>These are examples of the good work going on in all Scottish forces to support the government&rsquo;s commitment to an additional 1,000 officers in our communities.</p>
