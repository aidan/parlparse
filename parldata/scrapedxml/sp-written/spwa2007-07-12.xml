  <p>The Scottish Executive recognises that improved direct air connections can make accessing Scotland easier and more attractive for business, investment and inbound tourism. We therefore intend to promote and encourage the maintenance and expansion of Scotland&rsquo;s international air connections which avoid the need for travellers to use connecting flights and reduce reliance on UK internal flights.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive currently provides funding towards the core running costs of the Association of Scottish Neighbourhood Watches. However, there are no current plans to introduce funding to communities that wish to become neighbourhood watch areas.</p>

  <p>Communities who wish to establish a new neighbourhood watch scheme should continue to register with the Association of Scottish Neighbourhood Watches at <a href="http://www.aosnw.co.uk" target="_blank">http://www.aosnw.co.uk</a>. In addition, local community police officers will be able to provide advice and information on setting up a scheme.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Estimates are derived from Family Resources Survey (FRS) data applied to a count of the number of properties in each council tax band. The FRS data relate to males 65+/ females 60+. Households with one pensioner and one non- pensioner adult are not included.</p>

  <p>2. A discount of &pound;750 would exceed council tax bills for single adult homes in bands A and B. Similarly a discount of &pound;1,000 would exceed council tax bills for single adults in bands A to D and exceeds the full council tax bill for bands A and B. Where the discount exceeds the current council tax bill, it is assumed that the council tax bill will be zero.</p>

  <p>We share the concerns of those worried about the level of returns being made by some milk producers. Although we cannot intervene in the market, we are pleased to note that many dairy farmers are now receiving increased prices as a result of changing market conditions.</p>

  <p>Since 2000, the dairy sector has received assistance totalling almost &pound;7 million from the Processing and Marketing Grant Scheme administered by the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>Dairy producers benefit from support from the Single Farm Payment which was introduced following Common Agricultural Policy reform in 2003.</p>

  <p>Following an analysis of responses to an earlier consultation exercise in respect of the future of fire control rooms, the Minister for Justice of the previous Executive announced on 1 June 2006 that the matter should be further considered as part of a wider review of Scotland&rsquo;s preparedness to deal with simultaneous major emergencies.

  <p>Planning Advice Note 74 on affordable housing advises planning authorities that a benchmark of 25% of new housing development should be allocated for affordable housing provision where a need has been established. The PAN was introduced in 2005 and its effects will take time to be delivered through the planning system. Monitoring arrangements are currently being put in place to assess the impact of these policies the outcomes of which will help inform any decision to revisit planning guidance on housing. The current review of Scottish Planning Policy 3 on Housing provides an opportunity to consider strengthening planning guidance to support release of land for housing.</p>

  <p>The Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland (ACPOS) are currently conducting a review and evaluation of practices and procedures in respect of the investigation of rape and serious sexual crime, the ultimate objective being to improve attrition rates and overall service delivery. This work is being conducted in conjunction with the police&rsquo;s relevant partner agencies, and no timescale has been set for its conclusion. It will be a matter for ACPOS whether to publish this review.</p>

  <p>Ministers were given information that showed the cost of the Stirling - Alloa - Kincardine rail link had more than doubled from the original estimates. At the same time, ministers were also given information on the transport programme as a whole. It later transpired that some of the costings were not presented to ministers on a like for like basis. On the basis of that information, ministers took the view in this context that it was important to get fresh clarity and that is why ministers have tested robustly the financial information they have inherited. Following that exercise, the Executive announced its capital investment programme for transport to Parliament on 27 June.</p>

  <p>Supported Bus Services are currently funded through the core local government finance settlement. The Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE) shares used to distribute the support for bus services is calculated using the population figures of each local authority in Scotland. GAE is neither a budget nor a spending target and it is for local authorities themselves to decide how they allocate their total resources to meet their own local needs and priorities.</p>

  <p>The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Regulations 2006 place an obligation on producers to provide information on the reuse of their products when placing them on the market; place an obligation on compliance schemes established by producers to fulfil their responsibilities to prioritise the reuse of whole appliances, and require persons collecting or transporting WEEE to do so in such as way as to optimise the reuse and recycling of that equipment. Failure to do so in each case is an offence.</p>

  <p>The regulations also provide for the systems by which the reuse obligation is discharged. That is, before a compliance scheme can operate it must obtain the approval of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) to its operational plan. That plan must include information on how the scheme will prioritise the reuse of whole appliances and detail the relationships the compliance scheme will develop with those carrying out reuse activities, including making use of the existing voluntary and community sector infrastructure. Additionally, a compliance scheme is required to keep records of the number of items of WEEE that are reused as a whole appliance and to provide that information to SEPA.</p>

  <p>The regulations are augmented by practical guidance to operators that contains a chapter on reuse of whole appliances. That guidance may be downloaded from <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file38209.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file38209.pdf</a>.</p>
