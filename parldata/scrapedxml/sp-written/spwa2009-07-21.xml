  <p>The exact number of GP consultations related to a rotavirus infection in Scotland is not available centrally. However, national estimates can be made based on the number of consultations for the condition at general practices participating in PTI (Practice Team Information). PTI data are obtained from a sample of Scottish general practices. This sample covers the full range of age, sex, deprivation and urban/rural classes existing in Scotland.</p>

  <p>There were an estimated 58 consultations with a member of a practice team (GP, practice-employed nurse) for a rotavirus infection in Scotland, during the financial year 2007-08.

  <p>Vaccination policy in Scotland is informed by recommendations by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), the UK-wide independent advisory committee that provides advice to all UK health departments on vaccination. The JCVI have considered rotavirus vaccination and have concluded that while rotavirus vaccines would reduce the incidence of gastroenteritis in the population, at current vaccine prices they do not meet the current economic criteria for the introduction of a new vaccine. The JCVI keep all recommendations under review.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises that there are a variety of ways in which to address the issue of child safety and is fully committed to promoting the safety of all children and young people in Scotland. This means that child safety is the responsibility of a number of Scottish Government Directorates and our commitment is expressed in a wide range of frameworks, strategies and initiatives including:</p>

  <p>The Early Years Framework, Equally Well, Good Places, Better Health, Promoting Positive Outcomes, Scottish Road Safety Framework and Don&rsquo;t Give Fire a Home.</p>

  <p>There are also a significant number of local child safety initiatives, many of which are supported by the Scottish Government. These include Child Safety Week, a safety advice resource, Fire Cadets, school travel plans, &quot;Fife Cares&quot; child safety service and &quot;Buy Wise Be Safe&quot;.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has no plans to issue specific guidance to NHS boards on the issue of multiple chemical sensitivity. In reviewing evidence relating to such concerns, UK government&rsquo;s committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT) commented in 2000 that &quot;multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) was a condition largely defined by the patient, and that there was no consistent pattern of symptoms or exposure data to define the condition&quot;. People concerned about allergies to chemicals should discuss these with their GP in the first instance, to allow for proper assessment of individual needs.</p>

  <p>Data on the average debt held by former students leaving higher education in Edinburgh is held by the Student Loans Company. This information is provided in the following table. The table includes information on students who participated in higher education at either a higher education institution or college in Edinburgh. The vast majority will have participated in higher education at a higher education institution.</p>

  <p>Average debt is calculated at the point of entering repayment (i.e. 31 March of the cohort year) rather than at the point of leaving higher education. Hence the 2009 cohort year refers to those students who left higher education in 2008, the 2008 cohort year refers to those students who left in 2007 and so on.</p>

  <p>We have increased provision for discretionary funds from the &pound;14.04 million we inherited from the last administration (in 2006-07), to &pound;14.7 million in 2007-08, &pound;16.1 million in 2008-09 and to &pound;16.44 million in 2009-10. This represents a total overall increase of 17.1%.</p>

  <p>Each institution is notified of its allocation for the forthcoming academic year in June. At this time they are also issued with guidance from the Scottish Government to assist in the disbursement of these funds. The funds are managed and distributed by the institutions themselves since they are best placed to assess the needs of the individual student.</p>

  <p>In order best to meet demand on these funds, an in-year redistribution process was introduced in January 2007, allowing institutions to return any unspent funds from previous years as part of their annual audited returns, and at the same time request any additional funds that they anticipate requiring for the current year. The total funds returned are then distributed among those institutions requesting additional funds. This process allows us to better monitor the demands on the discretionary funds, giving us an understanding of what the extent of student hardship may be in any one year.</p>

  <p>The European Investment Bank (EIB) periodically makes funds available for affordable housing across the UK through The Housing Finance Corporation (THFC). There is regular contact between officials and lenders, including THFC, as part of supporting the provision of private finance to the sector. At present &pound;50 million is available from the EIB for Scottish housing associations. The EIB money is in the form of competitively-priced loan finance and, in order to access this, housing associations have to apply to THFC and meet their lending criteria. As with all private finance this &pound;50 million is available to complement the Scottish Government&rsquo;s record investment of &pound;675 million in affordable housing in 2009-10 and will support the Government&rsquo;s target of 8,100 approvals this year.</p>

  <p>In general, the sheriff court that has jurisdiction in a repossession case is dependent on the location of the property in question.</p>

  <p>Normally, cases relating to properties in East Dunbartonshire will be dealt with at either Glasgow or Dumbarton Sheriff Courts, depending on the location of the property and the sheriff court boundaries that it lies within.</p>

  <p>Similarly, cases relating to properties in East Renfrewshire will generally be dealt with at Paisley Sheriff Court.</p>

  <p>Cases relating to properties in Midlothian will normally be dealt with at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.</p>

  <p>Cases relating to properties in North Ayrshire will generally be dealt with at Kilmarnock Sheriff Court.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-3652 by Shona Robison on 13 September 2007, for what reasons the number of prescriptions of Ritalin fell in each year between 2002 and 2007 and whether this number is expected to continue to fall in future years.</p>

  <p>Ritalin is one of a number of products containing methylphenidate hydrochloride, used for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). While the total prescribing of these products increased between 2002 and 2007 and continued to increase in 2008 and 2009, the number of prescribed items for Ritalin continued to fall in 2008 and 2009 (3,466 and 2,723 prescribed items respectively).</p>

  <p>The reason for this may be that prescribers have chosen other methylphenidate products. The decision on which product to prescribe for an individual patient is a matter for the clinical judgement of the prescriber informed by advice and evidence about the medicine.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it is satisfied that the forcible injection of a drug to a person detained under the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 prior to a tribunal hearing does not constitute a breach of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-07-21.S3W-25280.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80379" speakername="Shona Robison" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa0721.htm#11">

  <p>There are three ways in which a person may be deprived of their liberty or subjected to compulsory measures of treatment under the civil regime in the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 (&quot;the 2003 Act&quot;), namely (a) emergency detention, (b) short-term detention and (c) long-term detention or compulsory measures under the authority of a compulsory treatment order. In addition, mentally disordered offenders may be made subject to compulsory measures of treatment by the courts under the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 (&quot;the 1995 Act&quot;).</p>

  <p>The majority of compulsory measures of treatment for mental disorder are first approved by an independent and impartial tribunal, either by the Mental Health Tribunal for Scotland under Part 7 of the 2003 Act (compulsory treatment orders) or by a court under the 1995 Act in relation to mentally disordered offenders. The two exceptions to this prior authority for treatment for mental disorder by a court or tribunal are: civil emergency detention under Part 5 of the 2003 Act and short-term detention under Part 6 of the 2003 Act.</p>

  <p>In relation to emergency detention, the authorised period of detention is just 72 hours and the purpose of the detention is to determine what medical treatment requires to be provided to the patient. There is no general authority to give treatment for mental disorder under an emergency detention certificate, and this certificate therefore differs from other measures under the 2003 Act; urgent medical treatment only may be given under section 243 of the Act. Given the very short duration of the certificate and the emergency situation with which it is dealing, and by reference to the leading Strasburg case on lawfulness of detention (Winterwerp), the Scottish Government is satisfied that this measure is European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR) compliant.</p>

  <p>Short-term detention is governed by Part 6 of 2003 Act. The authorised period for detention is 28 days and the purpose of the detention is to determine what medical treatment should be given to the patient and/or to give that treatment to the patient. The detention certificate is granted by an approved medical practitioner provided that certain statutory conditions are satisfied, and treatment can be given for mental disorder in accordance with the rules set out in Part 16 of the Act. Protections are built in for the patient within the Act: the patient&rsquo;s views should be taken into account, including where these are expressed in an advance statement; the patient&rsquo;s responsible medical officer is under a duty to consider from time-to-time whether it continues to be necessary for the patient to be detained in hospital and to revoke the certificate where he or she is no longer satisfied that this is the case; and the patient and their named person has the right to apply to the Mental Health Tribunal for release. The provision within Part 6 for an appeal by a patient to the tribunal for revocation of a short-term detention certificate ensures access to &quot;an independent and impartial tribunal established by law&quot; for the purposes of article 6 ECHR.</p>

  <p>Any act of the Scottish Parliament requires to be within legislative competence, which includes its provisions being compatible with rights under the European Convention on Human Rights. Both the Scottish ministers and the Scottish Parliament were satisfied during its passage through the Parliament that the 2003 Act, which authorises compulsory measures of treatment for mental disorder, was ECHR compatible.</p>

  <p>The revised <em>Scottish Government Code of Practice on Part 5 of the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000</em> , published on 11 March 2008, notes that the use of covert medication is permissible only in certain limited circumstances, for example to safeguard the health of an adult who is unable to consent to the treatment in question and where other alternatives have been explored and none are practicable.

  <p>The code of practice refers practitioners considering the use of covert medication to guidance documents prepared by the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland (MWC): <em>Consent to Treatment</em> (2006) and <em>Covert Medication &ndash; a Legal and Practice Guide </em>(2006).

  <p>We are implementing the recommendations from <em>Looked after children and young people: We Can and Must Do Better.</em> We recently wrote to NHS boards to remind them of their responsibility to these children and young people, not just whilst they are in care but also in their transition out of care. This responsibility is to ensure that the physical, mental and emotional health needs of all looked after children and young people for whom they have responsibility is assessed and that appropriate measures are put in place to ensure that any package of care that is put in place following this assessment, is delivered.</p>

  <p>To support the child and young people&rsquo;s mental health improvement agenda, we have recently made available &pound;2 million new money each year to accelerate the development of specialist services. In addition, we recently announced &pound;6.5 million over three years to increase the number of psychologists working in specialist services in the NHS. This is staff that will be able to offer direct services and to support others such as teachers and social workers in the work that they do with young people with mental health problems.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has continued to monitor Mental Health Officer (MHO) numbers over the past four years, by means of an annual MHO workforce survey, to assess the Scottish position and assist local services to address workforce planning. This annual survey has found that the numbers of social workers practising as MHOs had steadily increased over the period since 2005 that the new Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act has been in force, starting from 553 MHOs (495 whole-time equivalents) in 2005 and rising to 691 (625 whole-time equivalents) by 2007, with a small drop to 674 (622 whole-time equivalents) in 2008. The Audit Scotland Report was based on the 2008 MHO Workforce Survey figures.</p>

  <p>However, the number of local authorities reporting a shortfall also fell in that latter period, from 23 out of the 32 local authorities in 2007, to 14 of the 32 in 2008. In addition, the survey found in 2008 that there were 105 social workers undertaking training.</p>

  <p>Progress is being made by local authorities in redesigning services and, where necessary, increasing their MHO workforce and providing succession planning.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government provides resources to local authorities by means of the Grant Aided Expenditure allocation. In order to meet the additional costs of implementing the 2003 Act when it came into force, including the costs of MHOs, the Scottish Government provided additional resources of &pound;13 million per annum to local authorities; that additional funding has continued to be made to local authorities.</p>

  <p>NHS boards and local authorities have responsibility to work in partnership and allocate resources on the basis of local needs and priorities, within the context of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s key strategic objectives and commitments.</p>

  <p>Allocation of resources from boards to local authorities are a contribution towards the costs involved in shifting the balance of care from hospital to the community, and are negotiated, agreed and monitored locally. NHS board chief executives remain accountable for ensuring that resources allocated by boards to local authorities are used for the level and type of services agreed with care partners.</p>

  <p>Discussions are taking place between the Scottish Government and COSLA to assess the current arrangements for agreeing and managing resource transfers, to ensure consistency across Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s Mental Health NHS Benchmarking Project is working to obtain more comprehensive information around both in-patient and community services; this data will enable boards, local authorities and others to compare and measure services and enhance local planning. The project has representation from the local authorities and through them we have approached the Association of Directors of Social Work (ADSW) who are working to commission core definitions around local authority services. This work has to go to ADSW and local authorities for consultation and approval.</p>

  <p>Under the GMS contract GPs are paid for maintaining a register of patients with a diagnosis of dementia. We recognised in 2007 that the number of people on the dementia register was less than we expected from survey data available. That is why we put in place a target for NHS boards to deliver agreed improvements in the early diagnosis and management of patients with dementia and specifically linked to the number of people on the dementia register. The Mental Health Collaborative is also continuing to support NHS boards in their delivery of this target.</p>

  <p>Psychiatric Emergency Plans (PEPs) set out locally agreed, multi-agency plans for the safe and appropriate transport of people assessed as requiring emergency detention in hospital. PEPs cover a range of topics including the role of the Police and other agencies in emergency detention and the provision of appropriate places of safety. PEPs are all developed in keeping with the principles of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003. Every health board has produced a PEP, agreed with the local authority, police and partner agencies. The PEP describes the procedures to be followed in identifying a suitable place of safety.</p>

  <p>In addition the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland (ACPOS) has published and distributed a diversity booklet, <em>A Practical Guide</em>, to all police staff within the Scottish Police Service. In relation to the issue of &quot;place of safety&quot;, the booklet contains a section specifically about mental health.</p>

  <p>All Scottish forces also have a place of safety policy in place which provides police staff with much more detailed information and guidance relating to local arrangements for place of safety.</p>

  <p>The ACPOS Mental Health Group continually monitors issues around the place of safety and has a strong working relationship with the Mental Welfare Commission. Indeed, work is currently ongoing to consider the reporting process for place of safety to the Mental Welfare Commission.</p>

  <p>The Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme (PPRS) is a voluntary agreement between the UK Health Departments and the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI). The scheme controls the price of branded medicines bought by the NHS.</p>

  <p>The new PPRS which came into effect in January 2009, contains a provision for any scheme member which intends to change its overall distribution arrangements in a manner likely to increase costs to the NHS being required to notify such changes to the Department of Health who act on behalf of the UK Health Departments.</p>

  <p>Work on older people&rsquo;s housing is now being taken forward through the Wider Planning for an Ageing Population workstream of the Reshaping Older People&rsquo;s Care programme. This workstream seeks to strengthen the role of housing in enabling older people to live independently for as long as possible and consider the implications of the demographic changes ahead.</p>

  <p>As part of this work, we are commissioning research to establish the feasibility of developing a modelling tool to help assess need, demand and supply for housing and related care services for older people at a local level, in the light of demographic change. This will cover the full range of housing and service options, including very sheltered housing, which can help older people to remain safely and independently in their own homes.</p>

  <p>Following the initial scoping research for the modelling tool and discussions with stakeholders as part of the Wider Planning for an Ageing Population workstream, we will consider whether separate research evaluating very sheltered housing is required.</p>

  <p>We have taken forward a number of follow-up actions to the Review of Older People&rsquo;s Housing (ROOPH), although not all were direct recommendations of the Review of Sheltered Housing. Follow-up actions have included:</p>

  <p>Establishment of three housing demonstrator projects for older people in Highland, Inverclyde and West Lothian. The projects promote joined up and preventative work across housing, health and social care services.</p>

  <p>Publication of new guidance on Local Housing Strategies (LHS) in June 2008, providing advice on the integration of physical housing planning and development, with support for people to maintain their housing. The guidance emphasised the need for LHS to be consistent with other strategies in relation to different groups, including older people.</p>

  <p>Preparation of new housing investment guidance on the funding of accommodation for people with particular needs which will shortly be subject to consultation, prior to publication.</p>

  <p>As part of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Affordable Housing Investment Programme (AHIP) we fund a range of provision for clients with particular housing needs. These include the provision of sheltered and very sheltered housing, the provision of supported accommodation and adaptations to allow people to stay in their own home when circumstances change.</p>

  <p>When housing associations are allocated funding from AHIP to build new homes these homes are generally required to meet Housing for Varying Needs standards, which ensures that the housing is designed to allow it to continue as far as possible to meet the changing needs of the occupant.</p>

  <p>A wide range of NHS staff are involved in the provision of smoking cessation services in Scotland. However, while the National Smoking Cessation Database (NSCD) set up by Information Services Division (ISD) Scotland captures information on people presenting to NHS services in Scotland for help to stop smoking, specific information on NHS staff trained in the delivery of such services is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>We are, of course, continuing to invest heavily both in the national network of cessation services which now exists in Scotland - some &pound;39 million over the current spending period - and in providing training for those delivering smoking cessation services. Latest information released from the NSCD on 26 May 2009, indicates that this investment resulted in a record number of quit attempts, 50,121, in 2008 a 14% increase over 2007.

  <p>There is no formal cut-off date after which girls born after 1 September 1990 who have commenced a course of HPV vaccination must complete the course. However, the purpose of administering the HPV vaccine to girls at a young age is to provide them with protection before they are exposed to the human papillomavirus. As girls get older they are more likely to have been exposed to the virus and there may be less benefit from completing a course of vaccination.</p>

  <p>The HPV vaccine is entirely voluntary and girls are entirely free to refuse the offer of the vaccination if they so wish.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are responsible for delivery of the HPV vaccination programme locally. It is a matter for boards to ensure all girls who are eligible for the vaccine are made aware of the vaccination and are given the opportunity to receive all three doses.</p>

  <p>The HPV vaccination is entirely voluntary and girls are free to refuse the offer of vaccination if they wish to do so.</p>
