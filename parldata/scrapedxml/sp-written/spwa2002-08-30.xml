  <p>This is the measure against which an assessment can be made of the level of risk an offender being at large presents to the public. Under the arrangements proposed in the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill, if an offender is convicted of a relevant offence and is assessed as high risk against the prescribed risk criteria then the court must impose the new sentence of an order for lifelong restriction. The bill also provides for the new Risk Management Authority to produce standards and guidelines to support the risk assessment process.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not give out information, which could identify a particular dental practitioner in receipt of a grant under the Scottish Dental Access Initiative, without consent, as this is commercially sensitive information.

  <p>The Scottish Executive welcomes the report by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. It builds on the findings of earlier reports on the environmental effects of air pollutants and provides a valuable update on the position in Scotland</p>

  <p>Earlier studies in this area identified the adverse environmental impacts of air pollutants and the transboundary nature of these, leading to action, nationally and internationally, to reduce emissions of the relevant pollutants &#150; sulphur and nitrogen compounds and ozone. Internationally, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe set up the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution in 1979 to tackle air pollution on a broad international scale. Subsequently, a number of international protocols have been agreed to cut emissions, the most recent being the 1999 UNECE Gothenburg Protocol. These protocols have formed the basis for EU action in this area. The EC National Emission Ceilings Directive for example reflects and in places reduces the emission ceilings included in the Gothenburg Protocol for the four major pollutants causing acidification, eutrophication and ozone damage &#150; these requiring to be achieved by 2010. National legislation such as the Prevention and Pollution Control Regulations will continue to be used to ensure that emissions in Scotland are reduced in line with international requirements. In addition, the Air Quality Strategy for Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland includes objectives for sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides specifically for the protection of vegetation and ecosystems.</p>

  <p>Transitional care arrangements for problem substance misusers have been made available to all short-term prisoners released from all prisons in Scotland including Kilmarnock through a national contract signed in October 2001 and which will run, initially, until April 2004.</p>

  <p>There is no requirement on the Scottish Executive to consult the European Commission on this issue since the area is not designated as being of national or international importance for bird species or habitats.

  <p>It is not possible to calculate this precisely. Coal fired generation is flexible, and varies in response to the demand on the electricity network. The Renewables Obligations Scotland sets specific targets for renewables which can be assumed to displace generation (and hence emissions) from coal fired plant.</p>

  <p>The remit of the Expert Panel on School Meals was to provide costed recommendations and a fully developed implementation strategy to establish standards for the nutritional content of school meals; to improve the presentation of school meals to improve general take up, and to eliminate any stigma attached to taking free school meals.</p>

  <p>While outwith their remit, entitlement to free school meals was one of a number of additional issues considered by the panel. They took the view that the Scottish Executive should examine how families are informed about eligibility to free school meals and also the eligibility criteria to ensure that families and young people do not fall through a gap. They also took the view that the Scottish Executive should reassure themselves that the criteria for eligibility remain appropriate.</p>

  <p>The panel&#146;s interim report is currently the subject of consultation, with a deadline for responses of 11 October 2002. The panel will then consider responses before submitting a final report to ministers.</p>
