  <p>It gives me great pleasure to honour Nigel Tranter&#8217;s 90th birthday. Through his writing over many decades he has brought alive to generations of readers in Scotland and beyond a fascinating array of people and events from our rich and varied history.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in the light of Scottish National Heritage&#8217;s calculation in 1996 that the cost to farmers on Islay from damage done by protected Greenland geese was at least &pound;14 per bird, what is the justification for the payment of &pound;10.70 in 1999.</p>

  <p>These payments are made under the Islay Voluntary Goose Management Scheme (IVGMS), which is entirely the responsibility of Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH).</p>

  <p>Under the IVGMS, SNH aims to compensate for additional impacts resulting from the protected status of the geese under the EC Birds Directive, rather than to compensate in full for all damage caused by geese. I understand that SNH have continued to increase the total funds disbursed through the IVGMS as goose populations have increased.</p>
