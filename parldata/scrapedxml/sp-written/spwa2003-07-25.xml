  <p>The Harbour Works (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 1999 define the circumstances, in relation to proposed ports and harbours developments, which would determine whether an environmental assessment is required. Such developments normally relate to an application for a harbour order to convey the powers to undertake works under the Harbours Act 1964, or an application for a consent to undertake works under section 34 of the Coast Protection Act 1949 in relation to safety of navigation.</p>

  <p>In determining whether the circumstances of individual cases require an environmental assessment, the views of the relevant environmental bodies are sought. The procedures involved are set out in the regulations.</p>

  <p>Onshore aspects of coastal zone planning are subject to the town and country planning regime but we are continually moving towards a more holistic approach where all aspects of the coast are considered in delivering a balanced approach to development.</p>

  <p>An improvement to the Shawhead Junction is now under construction as part of the on-going work to refurbish the A8. When opened early in 2004, this will improve the performance of the junction but will not alleviate congestion on the Bellshill bypass for northbound traffic constrained as the carriageway reduces from two to one lane.</p>

  <p>The delivery brief being pursued by Scottish Executive consultants for the completion of the M8 motorway will bring forward comprehensive proposals for new junction arrangements at Shawhead and Raith. I expect to receive the consultants&#39; initial recommendations for these junction improvements in the spring 2004.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how it will ensure that quality contracts in respect of transport projects are taken up and made simpler to obtain; whether additional funds will be made available to local authorities to meet the cost of the take-up of quality contracts if additional revenue is required by transport operators, and if so, from which budget such funds will be allocated and, if not, how local authorities will encourage the creation of quality contracts operators.</p>

  <p><em>A Partnership for a Better Scotland</em> commits the Executive to promoting bus quality contracts and guidance is available to help transport authorities to develop proposals. A quality contract will have a significant effect on the bus services to which it relates. It is important that the assessment of the case is robust and we have no plans to change the rules which are set out in the Transport (Scotland) Act 2001.</p>

  <p>Local authorities have substantial resources to enable them to meet the transport needs of their areas through non-housing capital and Revenue Support Grant - both of which have significantly increased in recent years. In addition, the Executive&#39;s Public Transport Fund and Integrated Transport Fund have supported a range of bus related projects throughout Scotland, with committed funding continuing into 2005-06.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will dispense with the need for a full Scottish Transport Appraisal Guidance (STAG) proposal for the creation of quality contracts in respect of transport projects and, if so, when this will take place.</p>

  <p>No. The Scottish Executive has no plans to dispense with the need for a STAG appraisal for transport policies, projects and programmes for which it provides funding, support or approval.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what action it takes to monitor, follow up and ensure implementation of local authority freight strategies and what the purpose of each current strategy is.</p>

  <p>The guidance issued to local authorities on local transport strategies reminds them of the need to consider freight issues. Separate freight strategies are not required.</p>

  <p>A report prepared for the Home Office into pilot schemes for electronic monitoring of young offenders under 16 is available at <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs/occ-tagging.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs/occ-tagging.pdf</a> , as well as from the Parliament&#39;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 28276).
