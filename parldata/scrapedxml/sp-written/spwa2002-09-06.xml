  <p>The information requested is not routinely recorded. The Executive's recent <i>Review of Modern Apprenticeships in Scotland </i> (published in January 2002) indicated that of those surveyed, 85% of those completing their modern apprenticeship were still with the same employer two years after graduation, and 70% of modern apprentices in training intended to remain with their current employer.</p>

Following discussions with COSLA about the funding implications of implementing the enhanced concessionary travel arrangements from 30 September, the Executive agreed that an additional &#163;5 million would be made available in the current financial year to be distributed on the basis of the existing GAE distribution formula, with a further &#163;10 million earmarked in 2003-04 if required.

  <p>While my officials have discussed this matter with North Glasgow University Hospitals NHS Trust, it is primarily a matter for the management of the trust and of Glasgow Royal Infirmary (GRI).</p>

  <p>The trust has acknowledged that the conditions at the GRI during the recent industrial action were, understandably, far from ideal. It has, however, advised that it is satisfied that the pictures that recently appeared in the media, and depicted clinical waste lying in corridors, were not a fair representation of conditions at the hospital and showed designated collection points.</p>

  <p>It is for the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) to determine whether it should investigate incidents connected to NHS facilities, in line with its responsibilities in ensuring the health and safety of employees or members of the public under the Health and Safety at Work Act.</p>

  <p>I understand that the HSE contacted the Head of Health and Safety at the North Glasgow University Hospitals NHS Trust on 8 August, when the allegation appeared in the media that clinical waste was being left lying in public areas at Glasgow Royal Infirmary (GRI). On that occasion the HSE was satisfied that a visit to GRI was not necessary, although the trust and HSE will continue to liaise on a range of issues as is the case throughout NHS Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive Health Department published its report entitled <i>Needlestick Injuries - Sharpen Your Awareness</i> in May 2001. This recommended that the Medical Devices Agency, Health Services Advisory Committee, Health and Safety Executive, Chief Scientists Office and the UK Health Departments prepare a co-ordinated plan to test and evaluate safer devices and safer disposal methods. The Scottish Executive Health Department is currently funding &#163;260,000 of practical projects aimed at reducing needlestick injury. Around eight NHS employers are involved in one project worth &#163;116,000 which involves a series of evaluations of sharps safety devices in a variety of clinical settings.</p>

  <p>The Common Services Agency is involved with safer needles through its divisions, the Scottish Health Care Supplies and the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health. Scottish Health Care Supplies is involved in on-going discussions with the Medical Devices Agency and with manufacturers and suppliers, including the Sharps Injury Prevention Manufacturers Alliance. The Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health is conducting a study into needlestick injuries. Its report is expected late next spring and will provide information on the proportion of injuries that could have been prevented by the use of safety devices.</p>

  <p>A consultation paper on lottery distribution policy, <i>Review of Lottery Funding</i> , was published jointly by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the Scottish Executive, the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly on 29 July for consultation until 30 October 2002. Section 3 of the consultation paper sets out issues involved in ensuring that funding is fairly distributed to all areas and communities across the UK.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for distributing proceeds from the National Lottery rests with the Lottery Distributing Bodies. In Scotland, the lottery distributors take part in joint activities, such as the publication of a joint leaflet and maintaining a web portal, to provide information on funding opportunities. All Scottish lottery distributors are taking steps to ensure the equitable distribution of their awards. For example, the Fair Share Lottery Initiative was launched in April 2002 and is a joint New Opportunities Fund and community fund UK-wide initiative targeting disadvantaged areas across Britain; resources of &#163;22 million over three years are being made available, and have been targeted to six disadvantaged areas in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is providing &#163;625,000 over two years for the Kickstart programme which employs development officers who work across area-based social inclusion partnerships to help build the knowledge and skills base of local voluntary and community groups to ensure that they can access funding, including lottery funding.</p>

  <p>Data about injury road accidents are collected by the police and reported to the Scottish Executive using the STATS 19 statistical report form. These returns cover only road accidents in which one or more people were injured: they do not cover damage only accidents.</p>

  <p>During 2001, there were eight injury road accidents identified in the STATS 19 returns as occurring on the A809 between the junction with the B8050 and the junction with the B821.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that this figure is based upon the data which are held in the central statistical database and which were collected by the police at the time of the accident and subsequently reported to the Executive. It may differ from any figure which the local authority would provide now, because it does not take account of any subsequent changes or corrections that the local authority may have made to the statistical information, for use at local level, about the location of each accident, based upon its knowledge of the road and area concerned.</p>

  <p>Other awards, made from <strong></strong>sportscotland&#146;s Exchequer funds, are monitored by budget holders which includes checking detailed expenditure reports and receipted invoices.

  <p>In line with conditions attached to Lottery Fund Awards, this can vary from awards being repaid in part or in full and future payments being stopped. For grants paid from Exchequer monies, <strong></strong> sportscotland&#146;s first step would be to write requesting repayment and thereafter normal follow up procedures to confirm receipt of repayment would apply.</p>

  <p>If fraud were suspected the matter would be referred to the police.</p>

  <p>There have been no such cases under the lottery programmes and 18 cases under Exchequer programmes (nine in 1999-2000, four in 2000-01 and five in 2001-02).</p>

  <p>There are a number of initiatives under way which actively encourage closer links between schools and their local communities. These include the School Sports Co-ordinator Programme, New Community Schools, the school and community strand of the Lottery Sports Fund Sports Facilities Programme and the New Opportunities Fund PE and Sport in Schools Programme. Local authorities and schools have responsibility to determine the nature of their relationship with the wider community including community sports clubs.</p>

  <p>The Executive is liaising with the UK Government and other devolved administrations on how best to implement the draft directive. We will not be able to announce any proposals until the terms of the draft directive have been finalised, and industry and other interests will be consulted fully before any new measures are introduced.</p>

  <p>This is a matter for Scottish Water. The chief executive&#146;s response is:</p>

  <p>There is no plan to incorporate visitor car parking at the proposed new water treatment plant. However, Scottish Water is committed to working with East Dunbartonshire Council and other local interest groups to improve public access to the existing reservoir. This may include additional parking.</p>

  <p>Any alteration to policies contained in the local plan would require to go through a public consultation exercise and possible public local inquiry before being submitted to the Scottish ministers for their consideration prior to adoption. The Scottish ministers would consider intervening only in the most exceptional circumstances, for example where major provisions of a plan were clearly incompatible with a well established national policy, or where there was clear evidence of a significant failure to comply with the proper procedures in drawing up a plan.</p>
