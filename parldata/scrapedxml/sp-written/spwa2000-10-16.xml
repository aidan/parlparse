  <p>Tender documents are commercially sensitive and it is therefore not the practice of the Scottish Executive to make them public. The terms of reference for the independent review being carried out by Deloitte &amp; Touche have been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre.</p>

  <p>I refer Mr Ewing to the written evidence submitted by the Executive to the Education, Culture and Sport Committee as part of its inquiry into this year&#8217;s exam results, in particular to paragraph 4.17 of the Education Department&#8217;s Memorandum (which is available through SPICe and the Parliament website). It is not the practice of the Scottish Executive to publish correspondence which falls outwith the Code of Practice on Access to Scottish Executive Information.</p>
