  <p>The Executive will continue to support the development of aquaculture within a framework which has proper regard for the environment and in particular the protection of wild fish. Maintaining the highest standards of husbandry, environmental protection and quality assurance are essential. The industry itself recognises this, and is actively co-operating with the Executive and other interests in such initiatives as the Tripartite Working Group, the Aquaculture Health Joint Working Group, and the recent production of the <i>Code of Practice to avoid and minimise the impact of Infectious Salmon Anaemia</i> . It has also developed, working with major customers and regulators, its own quality assurance and environmental management schemes.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not currently fund any specific voluntary organisation involved exclusively in supporting children and adults with attention deficiency disorder and/or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD/ADHD). However, the Executive&#8217;s Innovation Grants Programme of &#163;6 million over the three years from April 2000 is supporting various voluntary organisation projects, some of which will benefit children with ADD/ADHD and other social and emotional behavioural difficulties.</p>

  <p>The Executive also administers grant schemes for voluntary organisations involved in providing support and services in the areas of health and social care. It would be open to any voluntary organisation engaged in supporting children with ADD/ADHD and their families to apply for funding under the appropriate grant scheme. I understand that no application from any such organisation has been received by the Health Department for the coming financial year. Any future application received would be carefully considered on its merits, alongside competing demands. It is impossible to say what the outcome would be.</p>

  <p>We are concerned about levels of homelessness throughout Scotland. This is why we have established the Homelessness Task Force to <strong> </strong> look at the causes and nature of homelessness and to make recommendations for action. The Housing Bill introduced on 19 December incorporates recommendations from the task force, including extensions to the rights of homeless people and new statutory duties for local authorities. I announced on Monday that these recommendations would be backed by the allocation of &#163;27 million to local authorities over the next three years.</p>

  <p>Since 1997 we have made available &#163;42 million through the Rough Sleepers Initiative to assist local authorities in delivering a range of projects which tackle the problem of people sleeping rough. A further &#163;5.2 million was made available this year to assist local authorities develop more appropriate temporary accommodation and reduce use of bed and breakfast. The following tables give details of the allocations to local authorities, including councils in the Forth Valley area, in respect of these initiatives.</p>

  <p>The Executive recognises the value of employment in both preventing homelessness in the first place, and as a route out of homelessness. Through the New Futures Fund we are ensuring that intensive support is being provided to many young homeless people to help them develop their employability and work skills. We have recently announced an additional &#163;150,000 which will be channelled by Scottish Enterprise to existing projects in Glasgow that already receive funding for employment and training initiatives for homeless people through the New Futures Fund.</p>

  <p>We are also committed to the implementation of the recent report from the Glasgow Street Homelessness Review Team which recommended that work opportunities and the development of work orientated skills should be built into re-settlement programmes. Proposals for a possible pilot to move homeless people into jobs will be considered by the Homelessness Task Force in the New Year.</p>

  <p>In addition last week we announced that we would provide &#163;100,000 to co-fund the piloting of a micro-credit partnership between the Big Issue and Street UK. Loan finance will be provided by the Bank of Scotland. Through the partnership loans will be available to micro-entrepreneurs excluded from access to fully commercial business finance. Pilots will be run in Glasgow and Edinburgh offering micro-finance and support to Big Issue vendors ready to move on and those working in the informal economy to help them move into self employment.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what assistance, financial or otherwise, is available to homeowners who have difficulty in selling their home as a result of other tenants within the building which they live in being drug dealers and/or drug users.</p>

  <p>There is no financial assistance available to homeowners but landlords have powers to take eviction action, where appropriate, against tenants who are drug dealers and/or drug users. Under the Housing (Scotland) Acts 1987 and 1988, public sector landlords and private landlords can apply to the courts for possession of their property where the tenant, or anyone living with the tenant, has caused a nuisance or annoyance to neighbours or has been convicted by a court of immoral or illegal use of the premises. This legislation was strengthened under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 which brought in extended grounds for eviction which allows landlords to repossess a house where criminal conduct has been committed; anti-social behaviour has been committed or is likely to be committed, either in the locality of the tenanted property by the tenant, or someone residing or lodging with him, or by visitors to the property. This enables tougher action to be taken against drug-dealers and other criminals, and facilitates the use of professional witnesses.</p>

  <p>The forthcoming Housing Bill will seek to introduce Probationary Tenancies on a discretionary basis and to suspend the Right To Buy for anti-social tenants while eviction proceedings are taking place. A &#163;250,000 package of measures has recently been announced which is designed to tackle the problem of nuisance neighbours, including the creation of a Sociable Neighbourhood National Co-ordinator, who will promote good practice across Scotland and work with councils and others to develop successful strategies.</p>

  <p>My officials are actively working with health boards and NHS Trusts to develop effective financial planning and budgeting tools.</p>

  <p>Significant additional resources are being invested in the NHS in Scotland this year and next which, together with effective planning and budgeting, will allow NHS Trusts to balance costs against resources available.</p>

  <p><i>Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change</i> affirms that protecting the health and well being of NHS staff must be a priority and places a clear requirement on NHS Scotland employers to implement the occupational health and safety strategy for NHS Scotland employees, <i>Towards a Safer Healthier</i> <i>Workplace</i> . That strategy requires employers to implement policies aimed at reducing stress in the workplace and for the occupational health service to offer a confidential counselling and advice service to all staff as well as providing occupational health surveillance programmes. It is open to any member of staff to refer themselves to the occupational health service at any time.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will detail any representations made or to be made to promote the Scottish Police Force College, Tulliallan as the proposed training centre for senior European police officers; whether any meetings have been held with the Home Office on this matter and the promotion of the Police Staff College, Bramshill, Hampshire as the proposed centre; when any such meetings took place; who attended any such meetings, and what education and training criteria will be used to choose the eventual candidate.</p>

  <p>The European Council in Tampere agreed that the European Police College should be set up from 1 January 2001 initially for a period of three years as a network which would bring together the national training institutes for senior police officers in member states. The Scottish Police College will be part of that network. No training centre is currently proposed and the questions of the promotion of a location for such a centre and education and training criterion for attendance have not arisen. The location of the Secretariat to the College is however being considered at present. It will assist the college with its administrative tasks and manage the college&#8217;s budget. The UK bid is amongst the countries which have offered to host the Secretariat. The UK&#8217;s offer envisages the Secretariat being run jointly by National Police Training, Bramshill and the Scottish Police College who would second an officer to Bramshill. No meetings have taken place with the Home Office on the location of the Secretariat although officials are in regular contact. The intention is that the location of the Secretariat will be decided by the European Council during the Swedish Presidency.</p>

  <p>The costs projected for the period 2001-02 to 2003-04 by the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland were based on broadly maintaining current levels of service. But the Scottish Executive has made available 100% grant to specifically boost police numbers by allowing for the recruitment of up to 300 extra officers/support staff. In addition, funding is also being provided through the Scottish Drug Enforcement Agency (SDEA) to allow for 100 officers to be deployed in forces on drugs work at local level.

  <p>The appointment process for the post of Chief Executive was managed by the Education Department. It followed the procedures as set out in the Commissioner for Public Appointments&#8217; Guidance on Appointments to Public Bodies, including the involvement of an independent assessor at both the sift and interview stages.</p>

  <p>The appointment process for the Assistant Chief Executive posts was a matter for Learning and Teaching Scotland.

  <p>In 1996 the then Secretary of State took the decision that the new posts of Independent Assessor should be advertised. Advertisements were placed in the <i>Herald, Scotsman, Dundee Courier </i>and the <i>Press &amp; Journal</i>. Out of some 60 applications received only two were considered suitable. A further 20 individuals were identified by means of a departmental trawl, all but one of whom agreed to serve. None of the posts filled since 1996 has been advertised.</p>

  <p>I shall announce shortly the appointment of eight new independent assessors.</p>

  <p>An independent review of the STB found that there would be benefit in changing its name to visitscotland. This proposal provides an opportunity to re-brand the public sector bodies that support the tourism industry. The STB believes that consistency of branding, including the Scottish tourism website, which is attracting around 10,000 user sessions per day, will raise the visibility of Scotland&#8217;s tourism product.</p>

  <p>A list of postcodes defining the areas to be targeted for the additional resources for Powershift was passed to the Energy Savings Trust by the Scottish Executive on 17 November. The criterion used to determine this list was a drivetime of over 30 minutes from settlements with a population of 10,000, as I explained in my answer to S1O-2675 on 7 December.</p>

  <p>The total value of all works packages let to date is &#163;21.8 million.

  <p>The Convener of the Holyrood Progress Group has already stated that, in principle and with the agreement of the contractors involved, information concerning the value of contracts let should be put into the public domain. However, I understand that at this point in the programme, our negotiating position in relation to all future packages could potentially be prejudiced by releasing the details of earlier contracts. This position should ease in the very near future and wherever possible this information will be reported to MSPs as soon as is practicable.</p>
