  <p>Nominations for PAC membership came from the joint public sector/industry team that designed the scheme. The SERAD members reflect the Executive&#8217;s overall policy and financial responsibilities for the ABDS, and their knowledge of the agricultural sector in their respective areas. The non-departmental representatives bring expertise and experience on economic and social development, tourism and environmental priorities for the Highlands and Islands &#8211; relevant criteria in assessing grant applications. Some of the public organisations concerned may also part-fund some grants. The industry representatives have chosen to be observers rather than full members of the PAC.</p>

  <p>All members of the PAC are there in an ex-officio capacity.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to give a precise answer to this question as it is difficult to define which deaths are due to chemicals or, indeed, what should be covered by the term chemicals.

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no specific funds to help communities affected by coastal erosion.</p>

  <p>The primary responsibility for the protection of land from erosion by the sea lies with the owners concerned. However, under the Coast Protection Act 1949, local authorities may contribute towards the cost of carrying out any coast protection work which they consider necessary or expedient to protect any land in their areas from erosion and encroachment by the sea.</p>

  <p>In my statement to the Parliament on 26 October 2000, I said that the UK Government were looking to put in place financial arrangements to benefit those with vCJD and their families. Constructing a compensation scheme that is effective and properly meets the needs of those affected is not an easy task. However, I am pleased to say that the UK Government will be making interim payments of &#163;25,000 when regulations have been put in place to ensure the payments are not taken into account in the calculation of income-related social security benefits and are exempted from the provisions of the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) Act 1997. Details of the full compensation package are still under consideration.</p>

  <p>At almost &#163;660 million, planned funding for 2001-02 is some 8% (5.6% in real terms) above this year&#8217;s allocation and our spending plans for higher education. This is a significant investment and demonstrates our commitment to building a learning nation and our belief that a high quality, dynamic and diverse lifelong learning market will help to underpin the developing knowledge economy and secure Scotland&#8217;s social, cultural and economic prosperity. By the FY2003-04 we will increase the amount available to SHEFC for distribution to the sector to almost &#163;700 million. This results in an extra &#163;108 million being invested in higher education over the next three financial years.</p>

  <p>Since its inception in November 1998, the Improving Regulation in Scotland Unit has had contact with around 160 businesses. Through a series of seminars, correspondence and also its &quot;hotline&quot; and e-mail box, the unit has received over 170 enquiries and complaints to date. Of these, 67 related to reserved matters, 40 to devolved matters and 65 did not refer to specific policy areas but rather to regulatory mechanisms and principles for attention at both Holyrood and Westminster. The comments made to the unit seldom refer to any individual regulation, however the areas which give rise to the greatest number of concerns are that the development of policy should involve more consideration of the impact on business, difficulties with employment regulations and trading standards and their application. Consequently the IRIS Unit has concentrated its efforts on improving regulations and their enforcement by encouraging greater use of the Regulatory Impact Assessment process by policy makers and promoting adoption and application of the Enforcement Concordat by regulators.</p>

  <p>The unit has publicised its activities and service at conferences, seminars and meetings. A publicity &quot;flyer&quot; has been given a wide distribution and the unit also has a website accessible through the Executive website, (www.scotland.gov.uk/who/elld/iris.asp). The IRIS Unit was also featured in the publication <i>The Way Forward: A Framework for Economic Development in Scotland</i> published in June 2000. The unit also continues its dialogue with a wide number of business representative organisations, such as the Federation of Small Businesses. The effectiveness of policies and efforts in this area will be felt by business in changes to the regulatory culture and the unit will continue to work to this end.</p>

  <p>A range of studies have been, and continue to be, conducted on aspects of land use in order to pave the way for a National Park in Loch Lomond and the Trossachs. Scottish Natural Heritage, for example, have previously commissioned reviews into land use and economic activity in possible National Park areas in Scotland and the Loch Lomond and Trossachs Interim Committee are in the process of preparing a forest and woodland framework, through a steering group chaired by Sir Peter Hutchison. Also, once established we will expect the National Parks Authority to consider land use as part of the overall park plan.</p>

  <p>The most recent annual report of the Scottish Transport Group available at 15 May 2000 showed the value of the surplus at 31 March 1999 to be approximately &#163;120 million (net of tax). While there is no legal entitlement for Scottish Transport Group pension scheme members to share in the pension schemes surplus funds, Scottish Ministers have agreed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer that up to &#163;100 million is to be made available for ex-gratia payments in Scotland, so that these payments are broadly equitable with the final settlement to National Bus Company pension scheme members south of the border.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive recognises the importance to business, and in particular small business, of tackling red tape and business rates. We therefore committed ourselves to action in these two areas in <i>Working together</i> <i>for Scotland: A Programme for Government</i> . I am pleased that tomorrow I can announce the details of the Executive&#8217;s better regulation strategy. The Minister for Finance and Local Government will also announce a package of measures on rate relief.</p>

  <p>The better regulation strategy demonstrates the Executive&#8217;s commitment to improving the regulatory environment and helping Scottish businesses to thrive. New initiatives include a requirement to review regularly all regulations which have a significant impact on business and for which the Executive is responsible, and working in partnership with business organisations to improve business forms. I will also tomorrow publish the details through the Executive&#8217;s website.</p>

  <p>We are restricting the non-domestic rate poundage to 47.0p for 2001-02, a reduction in real terms.</p>

  <p>To provide further help for small businesses, we are introducing a 2p discount for business premises with a rateable value of &#163;10,000 or less. That is double the discount for this year.</p>

  <p>Tomorrow we will issue a consultation paper outlining a range of proposals for additional rates relief for small businesses, including farm enterprises and village shops. Copies will be placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Information Centre and responses are invited by 18 May.</p>

  <p>The amount allocated annually by the Scottish Executive to Social Inclusion Partnerships (SIPs) has to be spent in the year to which it is allocated. However Scottish Executive Departments can apply to carry forward unspent amounts from one financial year to the next, with success depending on the position across the Executive as a whole, and in 1999-2000 this flexibility was passed on to Social Inclusion Partnerships.</p>

  <p>In 1999-2000, 18 Social Inclusion Partnerships applied to carry forward unspent amounts to the following year. Priority was given to underspends that had arisen because of delays in setting up new partnerships and allocating funds, and to those that had arisen because of slippage in capital projects. The 18 Social Inclusion Partnerships carried forward a total of &#163;1.5 million from 1999-2000 to 2000-01.</p>

  <p>Arrangements for the carry forward of funds which have not been spent in 2000-01 have not yet been finalised, but we will be writing to SIPs shortly to provide further details.</p>

  <p>In the first instance, you may find it helpful to have a statement of the situation with regard to funding for shinty and shinty events.</p>

  <p>Shinty receives considerable funding from <strong></strong>sportscotland, nearly &#163;100,000 per annum in cash and kind in recent years.</p>

  <p>In addition to the &#163;15,000 core grant which <strong></strong>sportscotland provides to the Camanachd Association each year, the sport of shinty has received &#163;500,000 for youth sport since 1991, which includes the full-time salary of the Youth Sport Development Officer for Shinty and a financial contribution to two local development officers. It is one of only nine sports which have had the benefit of a full-time Youth Sport Development Officer.</p>

  <p>Shinty has also received over &#163;500,000 in lottery capital grants since 1995, has benefited from over &#163;5,000 of &quot;in kind&quot; staff time for the establishment of a national coaching strategy and only last year received a further &#163;15,000 from the lottery junior groups programme. More generally, the sport also benefits from the Sportsmatch Programme and has made 24 applications, 19 of which have been successful securing awards totalling &#163;43,200.</p>

  <p><strong></strong>sportscotland is unable to provide funding for the annual Scotland v Ireland shinty/hurling match. The event is a hybrid of the two sports played in Scotland and Ireland; it is not of major international standard, and shinty has no international federation under the auspices of which recognised international competitions can take place. These factors rule out the Major Events and Talented Athletes Programmes as sources of funding. At the same time, the fact that the match is between two national teams means that it does not qualify for the Sportsmatch Programme, which provides funding for grassroots sporting activity. Shinty is not unique in this respect and national team competitions in sports such as netball and judo are also ineligible for Sportsmatch funding. The Scottish Executive and <strong></strong>sportscotland recognise the cultural significance of shinty but <strong></strong>sportscotland cannot bend the criteria for funding under its various programmes to treat shinty differently and more favourably than other sports.</p>

  <p>As with other sports, <strong></strong>sportscotland staff have put considerable time and effort into helping with the development of shinty and will continue to do so. Before it can increase its investment in any sport, <strong></strong>sportscotland needs to be satisfied that the sport has a clear and realistic plan for development and an organisational structure which can implement that plan. After careful consideration, <strong></strong>sportscotland concluded that the Camanachd Association would face difficulty in implementing its development plan. <strong></strong>sportscotland has, however, offered to fund an independent review of the Camanachd Association, the aim of which would be to ensure the long-term success of the sport and viability of the association itself.</p>

  <p>The Executive hopes that the Camanachd Association accepts <strong></strong>sportscotland&#8217;s offer of an independent review as this has proved successful in the case of other sports such as athletics, swimming and curling.</p>

  <p>The bidding process devised by the Ryder Cup Committee for the 2009 event involves countries or regions of countries making bids to stage the event. That is why the Scottish Executive has led the bid to bring the event to Scotland. The bidding for the European Nations Football Championship, like most other major sporting events, is the responsibility of the national governing body which in the case of football in Scotland is the Scottish Football Association. We are already assisting the SFA with the feasibility studies it is carrying out to inform a decision on whether it should bid for the 2008 Championships.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether, if the bid for the 2009 Ryder Cup is successful, it will consider funding a bid for the 2008 European football championships on a similar basis.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer I have given to her question S1W-12949. The key factors involved in deciding whether to assist the SFA in a bid for the 2008 Championship are the realistic prospects of a bid by the SFA being successful, Scotland&#8217;s capacity to stage an event of this magnitude and the prospective economic and other benefits. There is no link with our Ryder Cup 2009 bid.</p>

  <p>Many of the initiatives referred to in our bid are already being implemented. Others are contingent to a greater or lesser extent on our bid being successful, but the Scottish Executive and its public sector partners are strongly committed to the development of golf and golf tourism.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive will not be responsible for staging the Ryder Cup but we would wish to see the general public have the opportunity to attend all or part of the event.</p>

  <p>In the last two years, Scottish Disability Sport (SDS), in partnership with <strong></strong> sportscotland, has developed a number of steps to make information on sport and recreation opportunities available to those wishing to participate in sport.</p>

  <p>These include the new SDS website, www.scottishdisabilitysport.com, which was officially launched during 2000; the SDS newsletter <i>The Changing Times</i>, which is published three times a year; SDS sport specific leaflets covering the sports of athletics, archery, boccia, cycling, swimming, table tennis, football and bowls; an A5 flyer promoting the work of SDS; a comprehensive resource pack, which acts as a one stop shop for disability sport issues, with funding through the Ready Willing and Able for Sport programme; SDS has an information stand and undertakes practical sessions as part of the annual Scottish Mobility Roadshow held at the SECC, Glasgow; and SDS is promoted at a local level throughout Scotland through its local branch structure.</p>

  <p>The SDS Marketing &amp; Communications Convenor is a voluntary post within the governing body with the responsibility of co-ordinating the above initiatives in conjunction with the Chairman and the <strong></strong>sportscotland Co-ordinator.</p>

Group meetings are chaired by the SDS Mountain Recreation Co-ordinator and attended by individuals from a wide variety of backgrounds with an interest in this area of work, including representatives from <strong></strong> sportscotland. The dissemination of the group&#8217;s minutes of meetings is a matter for SDS.</p>
