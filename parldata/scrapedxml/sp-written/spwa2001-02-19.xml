  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-4886 by Susan Deacon on 1 December 2000, why the figure for the whole of Scotland is 658 when the figures given for each local authority add up to 701 and whether the total figure for the whole of Scotland is intended to include pupils with autism in local authorities where figures have been suppressed due to there being less than five such pupils.</p>

  <p>The information contained in the table for the answer to question S1W-4886 was incorrect. An amended table is provided below with the addition of the figures for 1999. The total figure for Scotland does include the figures which have been suppressed in order to maintain confidentiality.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The data was collected by the annual school censuses in September 1998 and 1999.</p>

  <p>2. The above information includes:</p>

  <p>i. children attending special schools with Autistic Spectrum Disorder recorded as their <u>main</u> difficulty in learning, whether or not they have a formal Record of Needs. Pupil age was based on the census date of 14 September 1998 and 13 September 1999.</p>

  <p>ii. children attending mainstream primary schools with Autistic Spectrum Disorder recorded as their <u>main</u> difficulty in learning, who have a Record of Needs. Dates of birth are not available for these pupils &#8211; all pupils attending primary schools have therefore been considered as within the scope of the question whereas those at secondary have not.</p>

  <p>iii. pupils attending both publicly funded and independent schools.</p>

  <p>3. These figures do not include:</p>

  <p>i. pupils with autism that also have another learning difficulty which is recorded as their main difficulty.</p>

  <p>ii. pupils with autism attending mainstream primary schools but who have not had a Record of Needs established.</p>

  <p>iii. children with autism but who are not attending school are not included - they may be too young to attend school - they may be to young to attend school or they may be educated elsewhere.</p>

  <p>4. Where a pupil attends a special needs school in one local authority but is funded by a different local authority, the pupil has been shown under the funding authority. All pupils attending primary schools are shown under the local authority of that school.</p>

  <p>5. In order to preserve confidentiality and in keeping with normal statistical practice, figures have been suppressed for cells with less than five pupils. These have been indicated by an *.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2001-02-19.S1W-12449.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80192" speakername="Angus MacKay" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-01/wa0219.htm#2">

  <p>The Scottish Executive is continually looking at ways to develop and enhance its consultation procedures including distribution in line with its commitments to Civic Participation.</p>

  <p>Good Practice Guidance on Consultation has recently been made available to all departments undertaking consultations. It recognises that consultation is an essential in modern government to ensure policy decisions are soundly based on evidence, that they take into account views and experience of those affected by them, that innovative and creative options are considered and that new arrangements are workable.</p>

  <p>The Good Practice Guidance on Consultation derives from the Policy Unit report on Civic Participation which was published last year and is available at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library3/government/civicp.pdf">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library3/government/civicp.pdf.</a></p>

  <p>That report identified four broad themes which have a bearing on extending distribution and increasing involvement in consultations:</p>

  <p>Good Practice - to sharpen planning and execution of consultations;</p>

  <p>Reaching &quot;civic&quot; Scotland;</p>

  <p>Reaching the wider public;</p>

  <p>Making best use of resources.</p>

  <p>These broad recommendations were further broken-down into 21 actions which have now been implemented through the production of the Good Practice Guidance on Consultation. The guidance covers issues that enhance distribution such as:</p>

  <p>equality mainstreaming;</p>

  <p>SAD was launched in May 1996 as a cross-party campaign and re-focused in 1998. The current remit and funding of Scotland Against Drugs (SAD) ends on 31 March. The Executive has consulted party leaders and the Scottish Advisory Committee on Drug Misuse.</p>

  <p>The Executive has concluded that SAD has made a significant contribution to attracting business support for anti-drugs initiatives, and has widened community involvement in fighting drug misuse and its consequences locally. The Executive has therefore agreed to provide funding for SAD of &#163;1.5 million per annum for three years from 1 April 2001, from the &#163;100 million package of new expenditure on drug misuse announced in September 2000. Support for the Scottish Drugs Challenge Fund of &#163;500,000 per annum will continue within the overall core funding, which will also provide for increases in SAD&#8217;s Schools, Business and Community Programmes.</p>

  <p>Sir Tom Farmer and Professor Sandy Cameron have agreed to continue as Chairman and Deputy Chairman of SAD. An announcement will be made in March on membership of a new SAD Board of Management and the terms of SAD&#8217;s Action Plan, which will contain demanding new targets.</p>

  <p>Following on from my recent announcement on the distribution of the &#163;100 million package of new expenditure on drug misuse, this decision on SAD builds in new breadth to our efforts to harness communities and business in beating drug misuse.</p>

  <p>Virtually all of the population of Scotland has access to the electricity grid. However the grid in some remote parts of Scotland is relatively extended and it is not always straightforward for new generation capacity, for example new renewable energy projects, to be connected without costly strengthening. For that reason, we are, with the private sector owners of the electricity grid in Scotland, reviewing its capacity to support more renewable generation capacity in the years ahead.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what research it has undertaken to determine the reasons for the decline in salmon and sea-trout stocks in Scotland&#8217;s rivers and whether any such research considered whether the reasons for the decline in sea-trout were different from the reasons for the decline in salmon.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2001-02-19.S1W-12036.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80135" speakername="Rhona Brankin" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-01/wa0219.htm#8">

  <p>Research programmes undertaken by scientists at Fisheries Research Services have been developed to identify the degree to which salmon and sea trout numbers have declined. These programmes include research cruises to determine the migration, feeding, growth and survival of salmon smolts during the early part of their marine life; trapping and marking of both salmon and sea trout smolts to estimate marine survival rates; electro-fishing surveys to determine juvenile population densities; and capture of salmon and sea trout soon after their entry to the sea to assess the impact of infestation by parasites.</p>

  <p>Declines in salmon and sea trout stocks in Scotland have been broadly similar except for in the west and north west of the country. In this area, the declines have been more marked than in the rest of the country, particularly in the case of sea trout. For this reason, a research programme based at Shieldaig has been initiated to examine the survival of sea trout smolts once they leave their native river, with particular emphasis being placed on investigating the interactions of sea lice between farmed and wild fish.</p>

  <p>Although these interactions are not fully understood, sea lice from fish farms, especially in enclosed sea lochs, may have led to a reduction in the marine survival of wild salmon and, in particular, sea trout. However, a number of other factors may have affected salmon and sea trout survival, including climate change, land-use change, increase in predators and diseases. The impact of infestation with sea lice relative to the other factors affecting marine survival is not yet known.</p>

The General Register Office for Scotland (GROS) collates this information and codes the cause of death data using the World Health Organisation&#8217;s International Classification of Diseases (ICD). The Ninth Revision of the ICD, which was used from 1979 to 1999, did not have a specific code for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome.

  <p>Tackling hospital-acquired infection is an important issue for the NHS in Scotland. The Scottish Executive supports the service in its efforts. All NHS Hospitals Trusts have infection control teams which investigate and recommend action on each incidence of hospital-acquired infection, within an overall Trust policy on infection control. The action to be taken in individual cases will depend on the nature of the infection.</p>

  <p>The antibiotic Linezolid has recently been licensed for use in certain severe and life threatening bacterial infections.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no specific policy on the use of individual antibiotics. However, the Executive recommends prudent prescribing of such drugs and has produced guidance on prescribing as one of a series of measures to combat the spread of antimicrobial resistance.</p>

  <p>The recruitment of volunteer trainers for young cyclists is a matter for schools and police and local authority road safety units. The Scottish Executive intends to commission, early next year, a survey of cycle training provision in Scottish schools and the number of children trained. This will provide baseline information on cycle training in Scottish schools and will highlight areas with low levels of training provision.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Executive intends to commission, early next year, research into road safety initiatives, including cycle training initiatives, in deprived areas. Guidelines to be produced in the light of the research will advise local authorities, community councils and community groups on how to establish and run a road safety initiative. The research will contribute towards the Scottish Executive&#8217;s commitment to reduce social exclusion.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Road Safety Campaign, funded by the Scottish Executive, is developing a resource for road safety officers to use when training volunteer trainers.</p>
