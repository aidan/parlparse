  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many pensioners have (a) had a central heating system installed under its Central Heating Installation Programme, (b) qualified for a central heating system under the programme and are awaiting its installation and (c) been refused a central heating system under the programme because they already have a system or have an obsolete system, and what plans it has to alter the programme criteria so that pensioners who have systems that are too expensive to use, or are obsolete, can qualify.</p>

  <p>There are three parts to the Scottish Executive Central Heating Installation Programme. The programme for the over 60s who own their own homes or rent in the private sector which is managed by Eaga, the local authority programme which is managed by individual local authorities and the housing association programme which is managed by Communities Scotland.</p>

  <p>Ten thousand, three hundred and twenty-one households where the householder or their spouse was over 60 had received central heating under the programme managed by Eaga by 31 May 2003. The local authority and housing association programmes are not restricted to the elderly and separate information on the number of elderly people to benefit is not collected.</p>

  <p>Four thousand, nine hundred and twenty-four owner-occupier or private rental households where the householder or their spouse is over 60 have been assessed as eligible for the Central Heating Installation Programme and are now waiting for installation.</p>

  <p>Local authorities and housing associations carry out installation works in their role as landlords.</p>

  <p>The programme is kept under review to ensure that it continues to deliver benefits to elderly people and address fuel poverty. In September 2002 the Scottish Executive announced that the programme would be extended from April 2004 to offer 4,000 very elderly households with partial or poorly functioning central heating either an upgrade or a new system as appropriate and regulations to allow this will be introduced later this year.</p>

  <p>The information requested on those for whom English is an additional language or who are gifted or more able is not collected centrally. For categories (b) and (c) above, the information is not collected at all on pre-school children and is unavailable on school children until the results of the September 2002 School Census are published in August 2003.</p>

  <p>Once the September 2002 School Census results become available, information will be available on the number of pupils with Records of Needs and/or Individualised Educational Programmes whose main difficulty in learning was Social, Emotional and Behavioural Difficulties (SEBD). It will also provide information on how many pupils were recorded as being asylum seekers or refugees.</p>

  <p>Some provisional results on the ethnic background of primary and secondary pupils, as reported in the September 2002 School Census, were published by the Scottish Executive on 24 March 2003. We can report that there were 301 pupils recorded as being from an "Occupational/Gypsy/Other Traveller" ethnic background in publicly funded primary schools (excluding the self-governing school), and 61 pupils with the same background in publicly funded secondary schools.</p>

  <p>The September 2001 School Census provided results on those whose main difficulty in learning arose from SEBD for all pupils based in special schools, but only for pupils based in primary and secondary schools who had Records of Needs. This information can be found in the September 2001 Statistical Bulletin at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/stats/bulletins/00168-00.asp" target="_blank">http://.scotland.gov.uk/stats/bulletins/00168-00.asp</a>, a copy of which is available from the Parliament's Reference Centre (Bib. number 22064).</p>

  <p>The draft Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Bill was published on 17 January 2003. A commitment has been given to introduce the draft bill to Parliament during the 2003-04 session. The draft bill moves away from the traditional concept of "special educational needs" to the wider concept of "additional support needs" which is defined as all children or young people who, for whatever reason, would be unable to benefit from school education without the provision of additional support.</p>

  <p>The degree to which an individual is faced with barriers to learning will determine whether additional support is required</p>

  <p>Area Management Agreements (AMAs) are <em>voluntary</em> agreements delivered through close collaboration between industry and wild fisheries interests.</p>

  <p>Several AMAs have achieved synchronised production and fallowing. In other areas, however, synchronisation is proving more difficult to attain, for practical or technical reasons.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive-chaired Tripartite Working Group is therefore investigating ways of assisting synchronicity for some of the smaller companies, whose sites all lie within the same sea loch, and is to review the position in very large management areas, where synchronisation has thus far proved impractical.</p>

  <p>In terms of regulation 29, and part 1 of schedule 19, of the Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions 2003/3113 and section 36 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 it is an offence for any person driving a vehicle to stop within a bus stop clearway, i.e. a bus stop at certain times as may be specified. As this is an offence under section 36 of the Road Traffic Act 1988, the police may issue any offender with a conditional offer of a fixed penalty for the offence in terms of section 75 of the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988. If the fixed penalty is not accepted, the case may then be reported to the Procurator Fiscal.</p>

  <p>As with all crimes reported to the Procurator Fiscal, a prosecution will be commenced where there is sufficient reliable and credible evidence, and where it is in the public interest to do so. In addition to the usual options available to the Procurator Fiscal, section 75 of the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988 also gives the fiscal the power to issue a conditional offer of a fixed penalty for this offence. If any fixed penalty is unpaid, then the offender will generally be prosecuted in the district court.</p>

  <p>Since May 2002 it has been for the independent Judicial Appointments Board to make recommendations to the First Minister for the appointment of judges, sheriffs principal and sheriffs. Under section 95 of the Scotland 1998, it is then for the First Minister to make the final recommendations to the Queen. The sole exceptions to this are the appointments of the Lord President of the Court of Session and the Lord Justice Clerk, the two most senior judicial posts in Scotland. In their case it is the Prime Minister who makes recommendations to the Queen but he may not recommend anyone who has not been nominated by the First Minister for such appointment. There are no plans to change the present system which we consider is working well.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many pupils would be eligible for free school meals if the criteria for such meals were extended to include the children of parents who are on a new deal scheme or are in receipt of (a) disability living allowance, (b) housing benefit and (c) council tax benefit and what the annual cost of extending such meals to each of these categories would be.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not hold information on the number of additional children who would gain entitlement if the criteria for a free school meal were extended to include children of parents on a new deal scheme or in receipt of a disability living allowance. However, the Department of Work and Pensions advise that the majority of participants on new deal programmes are in receipt of income-based benefits and will therefore already be entitled to claim free school meals for their children. They also advise that figures for the number of children of adults in receipt of disability living allowance are not available. Extending entitlement to children aged five to 18 whose parents are in receipt of housing benefit and/or council tax benefit would pick-up an additional 40,000 children at an estimated cost of &#163;13 million to &#163;15 million per annum for meals alone.</p>
