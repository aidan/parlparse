  <p>In preparing the Scottish Rural Development Plan, we consulted widely on whether to introduce an early retirement scheme for farmers. In light of that consultation, we concluded against the introduction of a scheme and concentrated resources instead on measures which would help to sustain the industry. We continue to work closely with the industry to develop a range of measures to assist the recovery from foot-and-mouth disease and I will be considering all proposals which emerge during these discussions.</p>

  <p>There are specific grant schemes operating across Scotland to support farmers and their immediate families in developing and sustaining farm incomes. The schemes provide valuable assistance to farming families in supporting diversification opportunities, both within and outwith agriculture, broadening and sustaining farm incomes. More generally, we are working with the industry and Scottish Enterprise to ensure that farming families have access to expert advice to support and develop their business and technical skills to ensure that they find more ways of making a living within their communities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&#8217;s report <i>Sensing Progress </i> reported on social work services for people with sensory impairment - one of the key recommendations in the report is that Future Needs Assessments of children with sensory impairment should be reviewed.</p>

  <p>This year, the Executive has published the Report of <i>the Certification and Registration Working Group </i>(Social Work Services for People with a Sensory Impairment) which highlights that NHS Trusts and local authorities should ensure that full assessments of visual impairment are undertaken by multi-disciplinary teams, and the Scottish Executive will be supporting pilot studies to develop assessment criteria.</p>

  <p>In addition, there is a UK National Screening Committee that advises all the Government departments on screening issues, including advice on neonatal hearing screening and vision screening.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has allocated &#163;22.6 million over the next three years 2001-04 to take forward the recommendations of the Beattie Committee in relation to helping young people make the transition to post-school education and training or employment. &#163;4.5 million of this has been provided to the Scottish Further Education Funding Council to improve support for students with additional needs in further education including the development of a National Co-ordinating Access Centre, the promotion and development of Inclusiveness Policies and the provision of staff training.</p>

  <p>Students in further education who suffer from dyslexia can claim additional support under the Special Educational Needs Allowance. This provides assistance towards additional study and travel-related expenses arising from the student&#8217;s attendance at college which they incur as a result of their disability. The allowance is means-tested but there is no upper limit to the level of support available.</p>

  <p>Students in higher education who suffer from dyslexia, including both part-time and distance learning students who are studying for at least 50% of a full-time equivalent course, are eligible to claim the Disabled Students&#8217; Allowance. This is a non means-tested allowance which provides assistance towards additional expenses students incur as a result of attending their course. The amount paid will depend upon the needs of the student and the requirements of the course and can be up to &#163;1,420 for basic costs and up to &#163;10,755 for non-medical personal help each year. An additional amount, for the duration of the course, of up to &#163;4,255 for specialist equipment can also be provided.</p>

  <p>Students who receive the Disabled Students&#8217; Allowance are also exempt from liability for the Graduate Endowment.</p>

  <p>I have today written to the convener of the Education, Culture and Sport Committee and I will lodge a copy of my letter with the Parliament&#8217;s reference centre.</p>

  <p>I am grateful to all the staff at Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) and everybody throughout Scottish education for the hard work and commitment that have enabled us to secure effective delivery of certification. It is important that work continues on the completion of this year&#8217;s diet, and in particular the conduct of the appeals process. The interim appointments of the Chair, some board members, the chief executive and some staff who accepted the challenge of secondment to the SQA in this vital period were due to expire at the end of this month. I am grateful to all of them for agreeing to continue their current roles with SQA for several more months to maintain the focus and stability which is needed. I am especially grateful to the interim chief executive, Bill Morton, who has agreed to delay his return to his career with Scottish Enterprise until November. Over that period an open competition will be conducted to appoint a permanent chief executive.</p>

  <p>The appointment of a permanent chief executive will be necessary irrespective of the future status of the SQA. The Executive has begun an internal review of the options for future status. To avoid unnecessary disruption to the continuing work of the SQA, I will progress this review swiftly and announce the outcome early in the autumn.</p>

  <p>Alongside work on the future of the SQA, the Executive is committed to work on simplification of the National Qualifications Framework, building on the lessons of the first two years. The National Exams Co-ordinator is leading work on implementation of the actions already agreed to achieve that and the preparation of consultation on possible further changes; and this will be the main focus of the next phase of his work.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not appoint inspectors under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 (RSA93). The functions of the chief inspector, formerly appointed under section 4 of RSA93, were transferred to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) by virtue of the Environment Act 1995. Appointments of persons to exercise those functions are therefore now made by SEPA under section 108 of the 1995 Act.

  <p>For the future, negotiations on NHS Pay Modernisation are continuing on a UK basis.

The funding made available to the police service, which is more than a third higher in real terms than 10 years ago, is intended to sustain this level.

  <p>Expenditure on Regional Selective Assistance (RSA) is forecast using a computer model which takes account of existing commitments and the expected future flow of new cases, by financial year. The forecasting model operates on an aggregate basis, and does not project increases or decreases in expenditure by individual project.</p>

  <p>However, as revised projected spend on a small number of very large cases can influence the accuracy of the forecasts such cases are reviewed on an individual basis. One such recent revision arose from the planned closure of Motorola&#8217;s Easter Inch facility. Other projects will have been delayed&#8212;and others may have been advanced&#8212;but the forecasting model does not provide for detailed analysis.</p>

  <p>Information is not held centrally on all available public sources of further and higher education student support. A variety of sources of public funding are available to Scottish students, and students studying in Scotland, depending on the type, level, mode and place of study. Bodies from whom public funding is available include the Scottish Executive, further education colleges, higher education institutions, local authorities, the Further and Higher Education Funding Councils, the United Kingdom Research Councils, United Kingdom Government Departments and the European Commission. A wide range of public sector bodies also provide support to students from public funds in their capacity as employers.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has published information on the support available for students in higher education through the Student Awards Agency for Scotland. Copies of the booklets have been placed in the Parliament&#8217;s reference centre. In addition to detailing the funding available from SAAS, these booklets also highlight the main additional sources of support. In further education, information on the discretionary support provided by each institution is published by each further education college.</p>

  <p>In cases where applicants are not eligible for the support payable by the Student Awards Agency for Scotland, advice is always provided about other types of support which may be available to them. These include Career Development Loans, discretionary bursaries from local authorities and Individual Learning Accounts.</p>

  <p>On new loans the budget makes provision to reflect estimated future write-offs for non-recovery and the difference between the cost of capital charge and the interest earned over the whole life of the loan.
