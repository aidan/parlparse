  <p>Since the procedure became operational, 650 appeals have been received. In 2001 we received 84, in 2002, 270 and in 2003, 251. So far 45 appeals have been received in 2004. There is no record of claims in dispute prior to this period.</p>

By the end of May 2004 there will be a new high-tech heart machine in every front-line ambulance.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will draw up a national health care strategy to tackle asthma in light of recent research highlighting that it is a widespread and complex condition.</p>

  <p>A spectrum of measures is in train within Scotland which reflects the importance the Executive attaches to addressing asthma. These include:</p>

  <p>The new GP contract includes asthma as a condition, which will attract extra remuneration for doctors, if they meet standards of care. All practices are required to provide essential services, including management of chronic disease in a manner determined by the practice in discussion with the patient.</p>

  <p>The new contracts for other health professionals enable the use of their expertise to address the review and management of people with asthma in the wider primary care teams. For example, the pharmacy strategy, The Right Medicine, is developing the role of community pharmacists through model schemes. This includes pharmacists taking part in the chronic disease management of asthma.</p>

  <p>Some personal medical pilots, which are another form of GP contract, have also been funded to develop improved chronic disease management in asthma.</p>

  <p>Practice accreditation procedures look into the management of chronic diseases including asthma. This involves following protocols and guidelines and the intention is that all practices should be accredited by the end of 2004.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network, which is funded by the Executive through NHS Quality Improvement Scotland, published good practice guidelines on asthma management jointly with the British Thoracic Society in February last year.</p>

  <p>Other initiatives by the Executive which will benefit people with asthma include our efforts to reduce smoking in public places and the yearly influenza vaccination for high risk groups including asthma.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Chief Scientist Office is currently committed to funding nine research projects on asthma at a cost of &#163;783,439.</p>

  <p>Community Health Partnerships (which were signalled in the White Paper, <em>Partnership for Care) </em>will have a particular focus on delivering improvements in the management of chronic conditions. They will have a critical role as the main focus for service integration for local communities with a particular emphasis on closing the health gap and delivering improvements particularly in relation to the management of chronic diseases for adults and children. One of their strengths will be their ability to provide a holistic approach to care.</p>

  <p>The Sensory Impairment Action Plan, launched in January 2004 recognises the importance of improving training for staff who provide services for people with a sensory impairment, including those who are deaf or hard of hearing, and the Scottish Executive is now taking the work of the Action Plan forward to address issues, including training for social work and other staff.</p>

  <p>We would expect local authorities to abide by the requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act when it comes into force.</p>

  <p>We would expect the focus on a person-centred approach in single shared assessment to improve understanding of individual&#8217;s needs. Councils will determine their training needs in the light of the Scottish Executive&#8217;s guidance on single shared assessment.</p>

  <p>More social workers are being trained. There was a 25% increase in qualifying social workers in 2003, and these numbers will increase by a further 33% over the next two years. The Social Work Services Inspectorate is significantly increasing investment in training over the next three years and is keen to work closely with all service providers, including those who work with people who are deaf or hard of hearing, to improve training of staff.</p>

  <p>The Sensory Impairment Action Plan, launched by the Scottish Executive in January 2004 recognises the importance of having trained staff available to work with people who are deaf and hard of hearing, and is now taking the work of the Action Plan forward to address the needs identified.</p>

  <p>The latest gross domestic product figures available for Scotland are presented in the Office for National Statistics regional accounts. These show that in 2002 (the latest year available), Scottish Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was estimated to be &#163;73 billion at current basic prices, resulting in an average GDP per economically active person (2002 June to August Labour Force Survey) of &#163;28,950. The UK equivalent (excluding extra-regio activity) was &#163;30,760. This implies that, for the same population and workforce in Scotland in 2002, the average GDP per economically active person would need to have been &#163;1,810 higher in order to reach the same level as the UK average. This means total GDP would have had to have been &#163;4.5 billion or 6.2% higher. (Note that this would, in turn, result in an increase in the actual average UK GDP/economically active person).</p>

  <p>Based on the Scottish Executive series at 2000 prices, Scottish GDP grew by 1.6% in real terms from 2002 to 2003, whereas the UK grew by 1.8% overall (including extra-regio). In addition, between summer 2002 and 2003, the Labour Force Survey estimates that the number of economically active people in Scotland grew slightly faster than in the UK overall. Therefore we would expect the difference between Scotland and the UK in Gross Value Added per economically active person to widen by a small amount in 2003.</p>

  <p>As President of REGLEG, the First Minister has raised the profile of the demands of the legislative regions for greater involvement in European decision-making in a number of fora. He addressed the Chamber of the Regions of the Council of Europe&#8217;s Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of Europe on 23 March. He also repeated REGLEG&#8217;s demands to Romano Prodi, President of the European Commission, at the inaugural meeting on 10 May of the &quot;Systematic Dialogue&quot; organised by the Commission. Under the Scottish Presidency, REGLEG continues to press for the inclusion of the references to the role of the regions and to subsidiarity in the draft Constitution currently under consideration by the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>

  <p>In support of Scotland&#8217;s REGLEG Presidency, the Scottish Executive EU Office recently held a &quot;sub rosa&quot; conference involving senior officials and academics from across Europe to consider how the subsidiarity proposals in the draft Treaty could be made to work effectively. The report of the conference is available on the Executive&#8217;s website at:</p>

  <p>http://www.scotland.gov.uk/about/UNASS/UNASS/00015181/Home.aspx.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Presidency is also developing REGLEG as a network for exchange of best practice; in this framework the Executive is hosting a European conference on Policing Youth Justice on 5 to 6 July.</p>

  <p>The First Minister will host the 5th Annual Conference of the Presidents of the Regions with Legislative Powers on 29-30 November.</p>

  <p>The processes for issuing guidance were reviewed with NHSScotland in 2002. It was agreed that separate work on the resource implications for Scotland of NICE technology appraisal guidance was not an effective or efficient use of public resources, and led to delay in issuing NICE guidance in Scotland. As with all its work NHS QIS will, however, keep this under review.</p>

  <p>One of the main reasons for establishing NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS) was to coordinate work on clinical effectiveness and quality improvement more effectively. This has resulted in the forward work plans of all the predecessor organisations being reviewed to ensure that NHS QIS resources are used to best effect on behalf of patients. Health technology appraisals remain an important part of NHS QIS portfolio of activities, and are being targeted on areas where they have the potential to contribute most to improvement in patient care.</p>

  <p>None. The decision was based on an evaluation which was made available in the Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 32088) and published on the Crofters Commission website.

  <p>The details of the scheme have not yet been developed. We have commissioned a consultant to prepare proposals for a replacement cattle improvement scheme. We will be working closely with key interests to work up such a scheme. It is essential that these new arrangements are clearly compliant with state aid rules.</p>

  <p>The new arrangements will give crofting groups far greater control over improvement of their stock.</p>

  <p>The arrangements are likely to take the form of grants, payable on expenditure to implement plans to deliver genetic improvement. Grant levels will not exceed 50% of costs incurred. Our intention is that all those who are eligible for assistance under the current Bull Hire Scheme should be eligible to apply for grant.</p>

  <p>Aside from these basic requirements the structure of the scheme is yet to be determined.</p>

  <p>The Bull Hire Scheme preceded the Forward Strategy for Scottish Agriculture by many years and had no link to it. The proposed replacement scheme can however be expected to take account of the strategy. It is intended that it will allow crofters to control the improvement of their stock with a focus on the market in a way that is not possible under the existing scheme which allocates the limited range of bulls available on the stud farm to crofting groups. Concern at the possible loss of cattle from peripheral areas was one of the principal reasons we decided to introduce a replacement scheme. There is no reason to suppose that a scheme that will be better at enabling crofters to respond to market pressures will be any less effective than the present arrangements at combating such loss.</p>

  <p>No. Although I have announced the closure of the current Livestock Improvement Schemes, I also stated that work is underway to develop and introduce a new grant scheme for the improvement of crofters&#8217; cattle. In addition I offered training on ram selection to those within affected crofting groups who wanted it.</p>

  <p>These are transitional arrangements until such time as the Crofters Commission can be given the powers it needs to introduce the proposed Crofting Development Programme.</p>

  <p>A UK-wide risk-sharing scheme for the treatment of eligible patients with multiple sclerosis began on 6 May 2002. The scheme allows beta interferon and glatiramer acetate to be prescribed on the NHS to patients who meet criteria developed by the Association of British Neurologists. The Sheffield University School for Health and Related Research (ScHARR) is responsible for collecting and analysing information on health outcomes for patients who receive treatment under the scheme. At the end of April 2004, there were approximately 850 patients in Scotland receiving treatment with beta interferon or glatiramer acetate.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally.

Clinical decisions regarding the treatment of individual patients&#8217; are not available centrally.</p>

  <p>The UK-wide risk-sharing scheme for beta interferon and glatiramer acetate allows these treatments to be prescribed on the NHS to patients who meet criteria developed by the Association of British Neurologists (ABN). The guidance which explained the scheme, Health Department Letter (2002)6, which is available from the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 20653), estimated that the total number of patients in Scotland who fall within the ABN guidelines might be in the range 1,300 to 1,560.</p>

  <p>This planning application by Dumfries and Galloway Council was notified to the Scottish ministers in November 2002. After careful consideration of the case, the Scottish ministers decided that there were no issues of national significance that would justify their intervention and therefore deemed planning permission was granted in December 2002.</p>

  <p>The <em>Scottish Public Finance Manual</em> states that the highest standards of purchasing ethics such as honesty, integrity, impartiality and objectivity must be observed by purchasers in all dealings with suppliers and potential suppliers.</p>

  <p>It is standard practice in the Executive when dealing with higher value contracts to require suppliers to reveal details of criminal convictions in the conduct of their business. We also require confirmation that suppliers have met other legal obligations, for example payment of taxes and social security contributions.</p>

  <p>The European Commission has issued comprehensive guidance for public purchasers on integrating social issues into public procurement.</p>

  <p>Scottish Executive ministers and staff regularly meet a wide range of bodies. Well established arrangements are in place to ensure that key decisions and action points from these meetings are recorded and that arrangements are in place to ensure the necessary follow up action takes place. However, not all meetings require a formal record.</p>

  <p>Corporate training courses, online learning, and good practice guidance on the recording and reporting of meetings is available and encouraged to staff.</p>

  <p>The rules governing the acceptance of gifts and hospitality by Scottish Executive staff are at Appendix 4 of Section A10.1 of the <em>Scottish Executive Staff Handbook</em> , which is available on the intranet. All gifts which have a retail value clearly under &#163;5, and which are acceptable in terms of the other criteria, may be accepted without reference to HR Policy Team. Gifts with a retail value over &#163;5 must be reported to HR Policy Team. For hospitality there is a similar distinction on the basis of value, as between, for instance, working lunches and more expensive social or sporting functions, travel or accommodation. HR Policy Team record and monitor the information reported by staff.</p>

  <p>The rules governing the acceptance of gifts by Scottish Executive ministers are set out in chapter 9 of the <em>Scottish Ministerial Code</em>. Receipt of all gifts should be reported to the Permanent Secretary. Gifts with a retail value up to &#163;140 may be retained by the recipient. Gifts of a higher retail value should be handed over to the Permanent Secretary, but there are some exceptions with this. For example, the recipient may purchase the gift at its cash value, abated by &#163;140. Registration of hospitality would normally be required for hospitality over &#163;250 in value. The Office of the Permanent Secretary records and monitors the information reported by Ministerial Offices.</p>

  <p>I understand that Communities Scotland has not finalised its investment plans for the Highlands and Islands following its recent announcements. In these circumstances, it is not possible to comment in detail on any plans to develop water and wastewater infrastructure in specific locations in respect of the recent announcement.</p>

  <p>However, and as you will know from recent correspondence with Allan Wilson, Deputy Minister for Environment and Rural Development, Communities Scotland and the Executive are liaising over the possibility of aligning the CS investment programme and the funding specifically allocated in Scottish Water&#8217;s current programme for investment in the rural water and sewerage infrastructure.</p>

  <p>I can confirm that Scottish Water has made plans to invest considerably in water and wastewater infrastructure in the Highlands and Islands in the period up 2006. Some of the more significant developments include:</p>

  <p>Aviemore, new Waste Water Treatment Works - &#163;7 million</p>

  <p>Lairg, Water Treatment Works upgrade, &#163;900,000</p>

  <p>North East Coast Regional Scheme to improve drinking water quality for populations of North Coast of Scotland - &#163;25 million</p>

  <p>Lochaber, upgrading water treatment works at Salen, Drimnin and Acharacle - &#163;4.4 million</p>

  <p>Carbost, new Waste Water Treatment System - &#163;400,000</p>

  <p>Habost and Gravir, new water pipeline - &#163;1.6 million</p>

  <p>Hoy and Flotta, Water Treatment Works - &#163;1.5 million.</p>

  <p>All new development would be subject to the normal conditions relating to planning requirements in which availability of the relevant infrastructure would be a necessary consideration.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body, further to the answer to question S2W-7769 by Duncan McNeil on 12 May 2004, how it is decided whether any classroom-based course being offered to its staff is appropriate to MSPs&#8217; staff and who makes such decisions.</p>

  <p>Normally the decision is a joint one between the employing member and the Training and Development Manager, having regard to the particular development needs of the individual concerned.</p>

  <p>Members&#8217; staff training costs are a legitimate charge against the Members&#8217; Support Allowance. The Corporate Body has no plans at present to increase the Members Support Allowance.</p>
