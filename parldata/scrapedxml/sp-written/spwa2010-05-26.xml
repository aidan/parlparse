  <p>NHS financial plans are on a three to five year planning cycle to ensure long-term budgeting. NHS boards have a duty as set out in HDL (2005) 9 to undertake equality impact assessments for changes in policy and service developments.</p>

  <p>This year the Scottish Government instigated a change to the Local Delivery Plan process to identify issues affecting equality. A section on equalities for each target is completed by all boards which includes efficiency savings. Boards outline any risks that the delivery of efficiencies could create towards unequal health outcomes for the six equalities groups, and/or for people living in socio-economic disadvantage, and how these risks are being managed.</p>

  <p>Guidance outlining the requirements to equality impact assess all new or revised policies and strategies, including changes to existing services, was issued to NHS boards in March 2005. The guidance is available at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/02/20687/52421" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/02/20687/52421</a> . The Equality, People and Performance Directorate at NHS Health Scotland provides support to boards in relation to this work.</p>

  <p>Our recently updated Informing, Engaging and Consulting (IEC) guidance also places a duty on NHS boards to ensure that any proposed change of service is subject to an equality and diversity impact assessment (EQIA) and that the IEC process is fully accessible to all equality groups. The guidance is available at:</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-29505 which outlined committed spend from the funding allocated to implement Achieving our Potential in 2009-10 and 2010-11.

  <p>Of the funding allocated to support the implementation of Achieving our Potential, the following further commitments have been made:</p>

  <p>NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde were awarded &pound;1 million in December 2009 to provide financial inclusion and other support to vulnerable families in receipt of the healthy start benefit in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde area.</p>

  <p>Barnardo&rsquo;s Scotland You First programme was awarded &pound;214,600 in February 2010 to enhance the support that young, first time parents and their babies receive from their peers, the community and existing local services.</p>

  <p>We have no plans to provide a bypass for Mauchline.</p>

  <p>However, in the short term, major road improvement works at Mauchline involving the replacement of almost one mile of carriageway will begin this summer as part of a &pound;4 million upgrade for the A76.</p>

  <p>In the longer term, the STPR has recommended an upgrade of the A76 through a programme of active route management and targeted investment, providing both safety and operational improvements.</p>

  <p>There is no legal requirement on Scottish ministers to pay compensation to local businesses as a result of delays in the completion of major works on trunk roads. Consequently, no provision is made within trunk road budgets to compensate for any disruption to businesses.</p>
