As part of this process, the MRC will hold a meeting in April 2003 which will involve parents, carers and scientists, and will be organised jointly with the National Autistic Society.

  <p>The Rural Payments Agency (RPA) is responsible on behalf of all UK Agriculture Ministers for the operation of the Over Thirty Months Slaughter Scheme (OTMS), including disposal. RPA is committed to reducing meat and bonemeal (MBM) and tallow stocks to very low levels by the end of 2004. However, while the scheme continues to operate in its current format, there will continue to be some stocks in store. As there are no large-scale incineration facilities in Northern Ireland, Wales or Scotland, any long-term storage is likely to be in England, close to the incineration sites. As there is no end date yet proposed for OTMS it is not possible to estimate final volumes or costs for the disposal of all rendered material that the scheme will generate.</p>

  <p>The security of the stores is primarily the responsibility of the storekeeper and is covered in the contract. A strict control regime is also in place. The stores and vehicles travelling to and from them are sealed and operated on a dedicated basis. All loads are tracked, weighed at both ends of the journey and subject to documentary control, including comprehensive stock and movements records at each site. In the UK the Meat and Livestock Commission supervise activity, and they are subject to second-tier checks by technical officers. Inactive stores are also subject to regular checks.</p>

  <p>Existing statute and common law already provides protection against child abuse. The general position in law is that what is illegal offline is also illegal online. The law therefore covers the abuse of children via the internet as well as elsewhere.

  <p>The Police Service and the Crown Office have taken steps to improve their existing training on internet crime, including child abuse. The Executive joined with the Home Office in running a UK-wide Internet Child Safety campaign between December 2001 and March 2002. The aim of the campaign was to inform children, young people and their parents/carers of the potential dangers of, and allow them to protect themselves when using, the internet. Dedicated websites and a helpline have been established to offer information and advice following the conclusion of the official campaign.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to strengthening all aspects of child protection to prevent child abuse in any form. The inter-agency audit and review of child protection has been looking at ways of reducing abuse and neglect and improving services for those affected. The review report will be published at the end of the year and the Executive will respond to its recommendations.</p>

Its main features are individual pages for each organisation with an interest in community safety i.e. local authority, police force, fire brigade, health board and various national organisations; a news page publicising new initiatives; a forum allowing the sharing of best practice and advice, and toolkits providing practical information on community safety and crime prevention.</p>

  <p>Information on crimes recorded by the police is not available by sheriffdom. The requested information on crimes recorded by police force area is published in Table 4A of the statistical bulletin <i>Recorded Crimes in Scotland</i> . Copies of the bulletins for 1997 to 2001 are available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. numbers 24795, 16613, 7079, 13119 and 20798).</p>

  <p>The available information on persons proceeded against where the charge is proved is given in the following table. The statistics dealing with recorded crime and court proceedings are not directly comparable as a person may be proceeded against for more than one crime involving more than one victim, and a crime may be recorded in one year and proceedings taken in a subsequent year. Charges recorded by the police may also be altered as a result of the judicial process.</p>

  <p>Muggings are included within the Scottish Executive Justice Department crime category for robbery but cannot be separately identified in the recorded crime and court proceedings statistics held centrally.</p>

  <p>Information on crimes recorded by the police is not available by sheriffdom. The information on crimes recorded by police force area is published in Table 4A of the statistical bulletin <i>Recorded Crimes in Scotland</i>. Copies of the bulletins for 1997 to 2001 are available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. numbers 24795, 16613, 7079, 13119 and 20798).</p>

  <p>The available information on persons proceeded against where the charge is proved is given in the following table. The statistics dealing with recorded crime and court proceedings are not directly comparable as a person may be proceeded against for more than one crime involving more than one victim, and a crime may be recorded in one year and proceedings taken in a subsequent year. Charges recorded by the police may also be altered as a result of the judicial process.</p>

  <p>The available information on persons proceeded against where the charge is proved is given in the following table. The statistics dealing with recorded crime and court proceedings are not directly comparable as a person may be proceeded against for more than one crime involving more than one victim, and a crime may be recorded in one year and proceedings taken in a subsequent year. Charges recorded by the police may also be altered as a result of the judicial process.</p>

  <p>Information on crimes recorded by the police is not available by sheriffdom. The requested information on crimes recorded by police force area is published in Table 4A of the statistical bulletin <i>Recorded Crimes in Scotland</i> . Copies of the bulletins for 1997 to 2001 are available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. numbers 24795, 16613, 7079, 13119 and 20798).</p>

  <p>The available information on persons proceeded against where the charge is proved is given in the following table. The statistics dealing with recorded crime and court proceedings are not directly comparable as a person may be proceeded against for more than one crime involving more than one victim, and a crime may be recorded in one year and proceedings taken in a subsequent year. Charges recorded by the police may also be altered as a result of the judicial process.</p>

  <p>The General Register Office for Scotland paper on <i>Drug-Related Deaths in Scotland in 2001</i> shows that ecstasy was known to be involved in the deaths of 20 people resulting from drug poisoning or overdose. However, we need to be clear that this does not mean that ecstasy was solely responsible for these deaths, as implied in some recent media articles.</p>

  <p>It is likely that ecstasy, in some cases in conjunction with alcohol, was primarily responsible for only six of these deaths. There were 10 deaths involving poly-drug misuse, where it was not possible to identify the primary drug or drugs responsible. It should be noted, however, that all 10 of these cases involved an opiate, such as heroin, and/or a benzodiazepine. Whilst recorded as being present, ecstasy was not directly involved in the four remaining deaths.</p>

  <p>The media reports also compared the figure of 20 deaths in Scotland, with a figure of 40 deaths in England and Wales. We understand that the figure for England and Wales comes from a study of deaths in 2001 by St George&#8217;s Hospital Medical School. The St George&#8217;s study uses a different methodology from the GROS Paper, so the figures are not directly comparable.</p>

  <p>I believe that this question relates to a relatively new library system that is being used in two Scottish local authorities and other schools elsewhere in the UK.</p>

  <p>The system uses fingerprint recognition technology to identify pupils without taking or storing their fingerprints. Its use is a matter for individual schools and local authorities, but parents and pupils should be consulted on its use. Parents and pupils have the right to opt out of the system.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no plans to introduce a moratorium on GM crop trials. Ministers and the Executive have made clear that autumn 2002 is the final round of the farm scale evaluation (FSE) programme and that there will be no commercial growing of GM crops pending the results of the FSE research programme and the outcome of the public debate.</p>

  <p>Our Delayed Discharge Action Plan, which was launched on 5 March 2002, set out a range of short- and long-term measures for reducing the number of people experiencing a delay in their discharge from hospital. This year, we have backed our action plan with a &#163;20 million additional investment, and are requiring local authority and NHS board partnerships to use that to move 1,000 additional people from hospital to more appropriate forms of care by April 2003. As announced recently, we will increase that level of funding to &#163;30 million for each of the following three years &#8211; but only on the condition that local partnerships meet the initial targets we have set for this year.</p>

  <p>Fluoride is a chemical with many different uses. Because of this, products containing fluoride are controlled under many different regulatory schemes according to the purpose of the product. As an example of this fluoride can be found in products used by human beings as medicinal products, food supplements and cosmetic products. According to records held by the Medicines Control Agency there are 51 licensed medicines containing fluoride as an active substance and a further two which contain fluoride as an excipient.</p>

  <p>The proposals in the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill were the outcome of extensive public consultation, dating back to 1997, to which salmon fishing owners were free to respond. The Scottish Landowners Federation (SLF) has responded at every stage of consultation and made representations to ministers on several occasions about the land reform proposals. It is our understanding that the SLF represents the interests of many people who own salmon fishings.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive undertook a full public consultation on the draft bill which contained these proposals. Salmon fishing interests including owners responded to that consultation and commented on the proposals. In addition, parliamentary committees took evidence from a group representing the interests of owners of salmon fishings and from the SLF during stage 1 consideration of the bill.</p>

  <p>Salmon fishings are not the only non-croft land to be included in the crofting community right to buy. The Land Reform (Scotland) Bill provides for the acquisition by the crofting community body of additional land that is not croft land. Salmon fishings and minerals are separate tenements of land and as a consequence may be held on a separate title from the land itself. Both of these can be acquired by the crofting community body through the crofting community right to buy along with or separately from the croft land.</p>

The policy intention is that crofting community bodies should be able to apply for the right to buy salmon fishings located on or directly exercisable from the croft land which they were acquiring or had acquired through the exercise of the crofting community right to buy. It was not intended that crofting communities should be able to acquire, through the right to buy, salmon fishings on or exercisable from additional land that they might acquire or that their acquisition of salmon fishings should be subject to the additional tests found in section 74 of the bill.</p>

  <p>This legislation does not seek to emulate compulsory purchase legislation in every respect. Section 70 provides that ministers must publicise applications and seek views from those identified as interested parties in order to consider all relevant factors before coming to a decision. However, where there are matters relating to an application that are disputed, section 78 provides that these issues will be resolved by the land court. The proceedings of the land court are normally conducted in public.</p>

  <p>The powers of compulsory acquisition in the bill do not seek to emulate compulsory purchase legislation in every respect.

  <p>No. What I said to the committee has to be considered in the context in which it was said.

  <p>The Land Reform (Scotland) Bill contains no provisions that specify circumstances in which a crofting community body may or may not dispose of land acquired through the exercise of the right to buy. Any restrictions on disposal of land will be governed, where required, by the terms and conditions of the grant or loan documentation of the crofting community body&#8217;s funders, and by the crofting community body&#8217;s own Memorandum and Articles of Association.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive with what private and public organisations the Scottish Road Safety Campaign has established partnerships as part of the Foolsspeed campaign; what the specific achievements of each partnership have been, and how these achievements have impacted on the speeding behaviour of drivers.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-11-14.S1W-31144.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80189" speakername="Lewis Macdonald" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa1114.htm#29">

  <p>The Foolsspeed campaign was supported by 25 local authorities, for example through the display of the Foolsspeed logo on council vehicles, letter heads and road safety related material. Many authorities also negotiated free advertising space to display the logo, such as bus backs, parking tickets and library book carrier bags.</p>

  <p>All 22 Road Safety Units in Scotland promoted Foolsspeed in various ways, such as using the message to encourage slower speeds in the vicinity of schools in Fife. The display of the logo on wheelie bins in certain areas highlights the campaign to residents and makes it very visible to drivers when the bins are on the pavement.</p>

  <p>All police forces in Scotland have supported the campaign, partly through police road safety units, but also during periods of high profile enforcement initiatives such as Speedwatch.</p>

  <p>A number of commercial organisations, including Tesco, Safeway, Robert Wiseman Dairies and Transco have been involved in a variety of ways, for example displaying the logo on fleet vehicles and milk cartons, and promoting the Foolsspeed message with their drivers. Other companies agreed to promote Foolsspeed on their safe driving courses and to their drivers.</p>

  <p>An evaluation of the Foolsspeed campaign was published on 30 October. Copies of the research report, <i>Changing Speeding Behaviour in Scotland: An Evaluation of the 'Foolsspeed' Campaign,</i> have been placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 24874). This includes findings about the impact of the campaign on driver behaviour.</p>

  <p>The initial records showed 13,369 potential beneficiaries satisfying the conditions for an ex-gratia payment. We have been notified of a number of deaths of which the majority have led to payments to dependants.

  <p>In my answer on 7 December 2001 in response to question S1W-20308, it was noted that concerns were expressed by EMBT/RMJM Ltd in May 2001 and that is to be taken as being their corporate view. Accordingly the &quot;who&quot; within that group is not relevant. Representatives from consultants to the parliament are expected to state a view on behalf of the body concerned and therefore naming of individuals is inappropriate and may also inhibit the free and frank provision of advice and exchange of views.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer, with regard to the statement by Paul Grice that there was a reduction to the cost of works packages where no performance bond was received in cases where such a bond was to have been provided ( <i>Official Report</i> , Finance Committee, 8 October 2002, c 2231), whether he will list those contracts where a reduction in the price was achieved, giving the amount of the reduction in each case.</p>

  <p>For reasons of commercial confidentiality, I am unable to provide such a list of contracts. I can confirm, however, that payment for a bond is only authorised when the client is in receipt of an agreed and signed bond from the trade contractor&#8217;s surety; if this is not received either through choice or delay no payment is made. In the event that the client chooses not to proceed with the requirement for the bond, a net saving on the contract sum is achieved.</p>

  <p>These figures incorporate the salaries and on-costs of the four staff providing support to the Presiding Officer and Deputy Presiding Officers. The lower staffing costs in 1999-2000, and to a lesser extent in 2000-01, reflect the initial set-up of the organisation when posts had not been filled.</p>
