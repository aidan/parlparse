  <p>Consultation with carers about service planning and delivery is expected of all local authorities. The Carers Strategy made clear the importance which the Executive places on the inclusion of carers' views and expertise in the development of community care plans and services. Each local authority will wish to develop its own links with carers in its area. We plan to issue wide-ranging good practice guidance on supporting carers to local authorities and NHS bodies, which will remind local authorities and the NHS of the importance of involving carers in planning services. Carers&rsquo; organisations and statutory agencies will have a lead role in developing this guidance, which we propose should include some monitoring component.</p>
