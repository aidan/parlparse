  <p>The Scottish Government published in March <em>Towards a Low Carbon Economy for Scotland: Discussion</em> paper which draws together, for the first time, ways in which Scotland can take pole position in the drive to secure the economic benefits of greener business.</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Business-Industry/Energy/lowcarbon" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Business-Industry/Energy/lowcarbon</a>.</p>

  <p>It is designed to gather views and experiences from across Scotland and to form a clear basis for discussion with industry sectors like finance, construction and skills. The key purpose of the discussions is to highlight exactly what type of interventions are required to realise that vision.</p>

  <p>We aim to provide a clear focus to promote the transition to a low carbon economy by using the output from the consultation period to publish a low carbon strategy in autumn 2010.</p>

  <p>We are working to develop that strategy in partnership with the key bodies responsible for economic development in Scotland &ndash; the Enterprise Agencies, Skills Development Scotland, Scottish Development International, the Scottish Funding Council, Visit Scotland and Transport Scotland, as well as the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency. The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities is also working closely with the Scottish Government. In addition we are working with business, private and third sector bodies to take the work forward.</p>

  <p>As stated in the answer to question S3W-15066 on 3 September 2008 and S3W-31180 on 26 February 2010, funding for IslamFest was originally approved by Rhona Brankin, then Minister for Communities, on 19 March 2007. The commitment given was rolled forward by the Scottish Government and funding in principle was approved for IslamFest by the First Minister on 18 February 2008 subject to the submission of an acceptable project proposal. Such a proposal was submitted to the Scottish Government on 17 March 2008 and officials issued a grant offer letter to the Scottish-Islamic Foundation on 25 March 2010.</p>

  <p>It is for local authority and schools to set their own arrangements for dealing with homophobic incidents. The Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2007 makes discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation unlawful and requires schools to make sure that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) pupils or the children of LGBT parents, do not receive different and less favourable treatment to that given to other pupils. Schools need to ensure that homophobic bullying is taken as seriously and dealt with as firmly as bullying on any other ground. Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education also assess the school&rsquo;s handling of bullying within inspection as part of the pre-inspection survey of pupils, parents, teachers and school staff, seeking their views on feelings of safety and welfare. Furthermore, the Scottish Government actively promotes the health and wellbeing of LGBT pupils through Curriculum for Excellence and the <em>Toolkit for Teachers: Dealing with Homophobia and Homophobic Bullying in Scottish Schools</em> .</p>

  <p>The UK Government&rsquo;s proposal to introduce an annual limit on the number of non-EEA migrants admitted into the UK is unlikely to have a significant impact on the availability of seasonal workers in Scotland.</p>

  <p>This is because there is currently no immigration route available for unskilled workers within the UK Points Based System for managed migration, the category most seasonal work would fall within. The vast majority of seasonal work in Scotland is currently undertaken by EEA nationals whose entitlement to live and work in the UK is unaffected by this proposal.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many prosecutions have been brought under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 for offences relating to mephedrone and other cathinone derivatives since their ban on 16 April 2010, broken down by (a) type of offence and (b) police force area.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-06-01.S3W-33695.r0" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Frank Mulholland QC" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa0601.htm#13">

  <p>Since 16 April 2010 five charges under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 relating to Mephedrone have been libelled in court proceedings. Of these five, two are under section 5(2), namely being in possession of a controlled drug, and the remaining three are under section 4(3)(b), that is being concerned in the supplying of a controlled drug.</p>

  <p>Both of the section 5(2) possession charges, as well as two of the section 4(3)(b) supply charges were reported to COPFS by Grampian Police. The remaining section 4(3)(b) supply case was reported by Tayside Police.</p>

  <p>There have been no reported cases and therefore no prosecutions raised to-date under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 in respect of the other cathinone derivatives.</p>

  <p>Notes</p>

  <p>1. The information for this question has been extracted from the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service&rsquo;s Case Management Database. The database is a live, operational database used to manage the processing of reports submitted to procurators fiscal by the police and other reporting agencies. If a Procurator Fiscal amends a charge submitted by a reporting agency the database will record details only of the amended charge.</p>

  <p>2. The database is charge-based. The figures quoted therefore relate to the number of charges rather than the number of individuals charged or the number of incidents that gave rise to such charges.</p>

  <p>3. The figures quoted in this answer reflect the information recorded on 18 May 2010.</p>

  <p>The care needs assessment provided by local authorities should identify the nutritional requirements of those cared for at home. The National Care Standards require care at home providers to develop a personal care plan with each person who is using the service which sets out how their care needs will be met. Where the service includes the preparation of food the plan will include details of any special dietary requirements. It is for the Care Commission, as the national regulator, to ensure through its inspections that care at home services are complying with this aspect of the National Care Standards.</p>

  <p>Providing a visible police presence on Scotland&rsquo;s streets is a priority for the Scottish Government. We are therefore committed to a well resourced police service. Police funding is at a record level in 2010-11 but decisions on future levels of funding can only be taken when the size of the Scottish budget is known.</p>

  <p>It is more important than ever that all opportunities for making efficiency savings are taken and that any waste or duplication is removed. The Scottish Government is working closely with the police to ensure that resources for frontline policing are maximised.</p>

  <p>Chief constables are responsible for managing police budgets and decisions on the composition of the workforce in each force is a matter for them.</p>

  <p>None. Police funding is at a record level of &pound;1.4 billion in 2010-11.
