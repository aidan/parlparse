  <p>We are currently working up the details of implementing the proposals for a Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care. A seminar with a wide range of interested parties was held on 24 September, and a consultation paper is to be issued in November.</p>

  <p>Some resources will transfer from local authorities and health boards to the Commission, reflecting the shift of responsibilities. While there will be some provision for central funding of the start up costs of the Commission, the aim is for the cost of regulation to be largely paid for by regulated care providers.</p>

  <p>Some staff currently employed by local authorities and health boards are likely to transfer to this new body. Any such transfer will take account of the principles of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981 (as amended)(TUPE). We are preparing a newsletter in consultation with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities to keep staff informed.</p>

  <p>The bodies concerned are already accountable to Parliament, as described below.</p>

  <p><u>Scottish Enterprise</u></p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise is a Non-Departmental Public Body established by the Enterprise and New Towns (Scotland) Act 1990. It reports to the Scottish Parliament through Scottish Ministers.</p>

  <p><u>Glasgow Development Agency</u></p>

  <p>The Glasgow Development Agency (GDA) is one of the 13 local enterprise companies within the Scottish Enterprise area which are contracted to deliver the major part of the projects, programmes and services funded by Scottish Enterprise. The GDA is principally accountable to the Scottish Parliament through Scottish Enterprise. The GDA&#8217;s accountability to Scottish Enterprise is defined and controlled by an Operating Contract.</p>

  <p><u>British Waterways Board</u></p>

  <p>British Waterways Board is specified as a cross-border public authority under the Scotland Act 1998. Section 88 of that Act has the effect that UK Ministers must consult Scottish Ministers before making any appointment to the Board and about any functions which might affect Scotland otherwise than wholly in relation to reserved matters. Any report relating to British Waterways Board which is laid before the Houses of Parliament requires to be laid before the Scottish Parliament.</p>

  <p><u>Historic Scotland</u></p>

  <p>Historic Scotland is an Executive Agency of the Scottish Executive Education Department and is directly responsible to Scottish Ministers who in turn are accountable to the Scottish Parliament. Arrangements for the management system of Agencies in general was set out in the written answer to a previous Scottish Parliament Question S1W-696 and is contained in the Written Answers for Wednesday 28 July 1999.</p>

  <p>Meat products are defined in EC law and the labelling requirements are largely harmonised at EC level. These requirements are implemented in Scotland by the Food Labelling Regulations 1996. They require that the particulars of country of origin or provenance be provided on a label if failure to give such particulars might mislead the purchaser to a material degree as to the true origin or provenance of the food. There are currently no proposals to amend these Regulations.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive adopts a precautionary principle where hazards and the risks of these being realised are concerned.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive takes advice on this from the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB), which is, in turn, advised by its Advisory Group on Non-ionising Radiation, chaired by Sir Richard Doll. NRPB staff are in continuing contact with similar bodies worldwide.</p>

  <p>The NRPB's advice indicates that the field strength of signals from mobile telephone masts at places to which the public have access are much below recommended guideline levels and should present no hazard to health. The Board's advice is based on its own research throughout the UK and on assessments, by its Advisory Group On Non-Ionising Radiation, of biological and epidemiological work world-wide.</p>

  <p>The Board has recently been asked to set up an independent expert group to assess the extent of knowledge relevant to possible effects on health associated with the use of mobile phones and telephone communication masts. The group will be chaired by Sir William Stewart FRS FRSE. Its detailed membership and terms of reference have already been announced.</p>

  <p>My answer to Question S1W-1022 explained the work which had been undertaken by the Health Boards concerned and National Services Division as well as the thorough process of consultation which the Chief Executive of the NHS in Scotland and the Chief Medical Officer carried out at my request. In addition, I met senior representatives of both Trusts before reaching my decision. I was therefore able to draw on a wide range of authoritative advice before making my decision.</p>

  <p>The bodies whose views were canvassed by National Services Division as part of their work included providers of paediatric cardiac surgery services and voluntary bodies with a particular interest in the issue.</p>

  <p>Section 3(2) of the Act provides that &quot;In any proceedings for an offence consisting of a contravention of <strong>any such</strong> statutory instrument, it shall be a defence to prove that the instrument had not been issued by Her Majesty&#8217;s Stationery Office at the date of the alleged contravention unless it is proved that at that date reasonable steps had been taken for the purpose of bringing the purport of the instrument to the notice of the public, or of persons likely to be affected by it, or the person charged.&quot;</p>

  <p>The invitation to tender, when issued, will specify the Department&#8217;s requirements in this research. It will be for the tenderers to provide, test and modify equipment to meet the requirements. A key output of the research is a suite of technical specifications for road user charging systems for use in a wide variety of traffic and road conditions.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer how many people are employed by the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body for the purpose of conducting research on behalf of individual MSPs and Parliamentary committees; of these, how many are employed exclusively for this purpose and what proportion of each researcher&#8217;s time is allocated to providing support for (a) Parliamentary committees and (b) individual MSPs.</p>

  <p>Nine researchers are employed in the Information Centre. Their primary purpose is to provide timely, appropriate and non-partisan research support to the Parliament. Research is provided to three main client groups: committees, MSPs in general and individual MSPs (and their staff). Each researcher&#8217;s job description recommends that their time is allocated as follows: 35% for committees; 30% for research outputs for MSPs in general, and 20% for individual MSPs&#8217; requests. The remainder of their time is reserved for other duties in support of their research work and of the work of the Information Centre as a whole.</p>

  <p>The Conveners&#8217; Group has recently endorsed a proposal for managing the external research budget for committees. This includes an additional research specialist to co-ordinate and take forward committees&#8217; external research requests. This new member of staff will spend the majority of their time on committee research.<br /></p>
