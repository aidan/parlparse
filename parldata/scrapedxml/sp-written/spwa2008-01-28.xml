  <p>: Yes, we will seek to reinstate the quality assurance schemes that had to be removed from the programme. We will work with stakeholders and the commission to see which schemes can be reinstated and subject to the commission&rsquo;s agreement will modify the programme to do so later this year. Support, for any of the reinstated measures should then be available from the beginning of 2009.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The figures provided are for completed installations. The increased activity following the Cabinet Secretary&rsquo;s announcement in November 2007, of additional installations, has yet to flow through into the statistics of installations undertaken.</p>

  <p>2. Where the figures are marked with an asterisk, the current managing agent (Scottish Gas) has indicated that these are average figures for the start-up period covering its involvement on the programme.</p>

  <p>Our broadband reach project is progressing well. We are currently completing the verification of all the registrations we have received. The Scottish Government consider all registered premises without broadband access to be a priority and their details will thus be passed to potential suppliers, as part of our procurement process.</p>

  <p>We will now be entering a competitive dialogue phase with several suppliers. Over the next few months they will be asked to show, within their bids, how they propose to deliver solutions to registered premises.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has not issued any guidance to local authorities on the development of community energy plans.</p>

  <p>However, we are committed to tripling the funding for community renewables and microgeneration, and are currently reviewing what form that support should take. As part of that process we are considering what help communities may need to engage with renewables developments.</p>

  <p>We are also considering feedback from a seminar I hosted in November last year which brought together a range of stakeholders to discuss the potential community benefits from wind farm developments.</p>

  <p>In addition, the emerging conclusions of the Forum for Renewable Energy Development in Scotland (FREDS) renewable heat group include the need for guidance to local authorities to deliver local fuel and heat strategies. The group will also recommend the development of heat maps at a local level. We will take these recommendations into account in developing a Renewable Heat Plan for Scotland, which I anticipate publishing later this year.</p>

  <p>We will also consider further the opportunities for community energy plans and companies.</p>

  <p>At the time of the announcement in November 2007, the Scottish Government was already progressing its own plans to fund the Energy Saving Trust (EST) to launch an Energy Saving Scotland Advice Centre (ESSAC) network from April 2008.

  <p>Through our Scottish Government Office in Brussels, we have made plans for a series of cultural events in Brussels during 2008. The programme will include events featuring Scottish Opera and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, and a writers&rsquo; series featuring well-known Scottish writers such as Christopher Brookmyre, Iain Banks and Quintin Jardine, as well as talents like Kevin MacNeil, a young up and coming Gaelic author. The audience for these events will come from a range of member state delegations, and will encourage intercultural dialogue and cultural exchange between Scotland and its European neighbours.</p>

  <p>The Invitation To Tender (ITT) set the service specification for the Clyde and Hebrides Ferry Services (CHFS) contract as the then current timetable plus a number of specified enhancements. The ITT also required tenderers to submit a variant bid that included a Mallaig to Lochboisdale service while continuing to provide an Oban to Caslebay service and the rest of the CHFS services as specified.</p>

  <p>In response to the Invitation to Tender for the Clyde and Hebrides Ferry Services Contract CalMac Ferries Limited submitted:</p>

  <p>A &quot;base network&quot; bid that was compliant with the ITT for the minimum service specification;</p>

  <p>A &quot;variant bid&quot; for a Mallaig to Lochboisdale service that was compliant with the terms of the ITT, and</p>

  <p>An &quot;optional variant bid&quot; that was not compliant with the terms of the ITT.</p>

  <p>CalMac recognised that this proposed &quot;optional variant bid&quot; would have been a medium term option, which would have required consultation and the support of all communities affected had it been deemed appropriate by the Scottish Government. This potentially attractive solution was submitted by the company as an innovative alternative to the main proposal.</p>

  <p>The contract was awarded for the &quot;base network&quot; bid which delivered the minimum service level and some minor enhancements.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is not in a position to quantify with any certainty the overall amount of fish discarded annually in the Clyde by the small mesh Nephrops fishery. Discarded fish include small and unwanted commercial species, but also species which have no commercial value which are also taken by fishing gears.</p>

  <p>Fisheries Research Services (FRS) runs an observer programme which is directed at estimating the discarded component of the main commercial species. That observer programme suggests that quantities of landings and discards of cod made by smaller meshed vessels are small in Area VIa particularly in the Clyde. The Clyde Cod closure which has run from 14 January to 30 April in the first quarter of the year is considered to be effective in protecting cod at a time when they are aggregating to spawn. The observer programme also suggests that landings of haddock and whiting in the Clyde are also small, but discards of haddock and whiting are markedly higher than discards of cod and may be of the order of several hundred tonnes per year. The Scottish Government intends to work with the fishing industry and others to implement measures, in particular under the Conservation Credits scheme, to reduce such discards.</p>

  <p>The deal which I negotiated at the December Fisheries Council benefited the west coast nephrops fishery in a number of ways. In particular on days at sea not only was the headline cut for much of the fleet reduced from 25% to 10% but I negotiated the possibility for Scotland to design its own arrangements outwith the EU&rsquo;s days at sea regime. Under our Conservation Credits Scheme fishermen will be rewarded for steps they take to reduce cod mortality and discards. I also successfully resisted attempts by the Commission to impose a mandatory requirement for further technical measures which would have had a significant impact on all west coast nephrops vessels.</p>

  <p>As I explained to Parliament on 17 January, the Commission did not agree at the December Council to grant an additional 28 days to the derogated west coast prawn fishing fleet. My officials pursued this matter with the Commission throughout the negotiations. During the December Council, the Commission finally explained the reasoning behind the proposal which was agreed by the Council in December 2006. In particular, they explained that their criteria had been that any fleets which, in the West of Scotland, had caught more than 4,000 cod individuals or discarded more than 10,000 cod individuals would face days at sea cuts for 2007. The derogated nephrops fleet (4.a.ii/8.1.d gear) did not fall under both these thresholds and was as a result added to those fleets which faced cuts. The UK asked the Commission for copies of the papers showing where these west of Scotland thresholds were established, but Commission officials explained that they were agreed verbally.</p>

  <p>The lack of transparency in this decision was particularly disappointing.</p>

  <p>I have asked James Hynd, Acting Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Housing co-operatives, like housing associations, are also known as registered social landlords (RSLs), which means they are registered with Communities Scotland. Communities Scotland regulates and inspects RSLs. All RSLs, including housing co-operatives, are required to meet the regulatory requirements set out in Part 3 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001. Communities Scotland has a set of published Performance Standards for all RSLs in Scotland. RSLs are required to comply with the standards. They are also required to submit annual financial and performance monitoring information.</p>

  <p>We tailor our engagement with RSLs to take into account the size of the RSL. But where there are significant weaknesses or performance issues, we can use our statutory powers of intervention to ensure that these issues are addressed and the interests of tenants are protected. These arrangements will continue under the new interim housing regulatory agency which will carry out the regulation of RSLs after Communities Scotland is wound up in April 2008.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is currently providing &pound;4 million to local authorities to support modern language teaching and learning in Scottish schools. Across Scotland, we are beginning to see greater numbers of pupils studying Chinese languages and culture and increasing numbers of Chinese language assistants working in schools.</p>

  <p>Through the concordat with COSLA we are moving to an outcomes-focused approach which empowers local authorities and gives them more flexibility to meet the Scottish Government&rsquo;s national outcomes, including making Scotland the most attractive place to do business in Europe, realising our full economic potential and ensuring that we are better educated, more skilled and more successful and our young people are successful learners, confident individuals, effective contributors and responsible citizens.

  <p>We are also supporting the development of certificated courses in Cantonese and Mandarin at Intermediate 1 and 2 which will be available from August 2008, with Higher and Advanced Higher following in August 2009. Courses at Access 3 are already available.</p>

  <p>Additionally, we are sponsoring Learning and Teaching Scotland (LTS) and British Council Scotland to coordinate a number of Scotland-China educational opportunities, including summer schools for pupils and study visits for teachers and head teachers.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government continues to support the development of educational links with China and Shandong. For example, in September 2007 we welcomed a high-level education delegation from the Shandong Provincial Education Department. In November, we also supported a delegation of college and university principals on their visit to Jinan in Shandong. This delegation met the Vice Governor of Shandong and presented him with a letter of support from the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning.</p>

  <p>China is one of the emerging markets for VisitScotland with a huge potential for expansion. That is why VisitScotland is keen to take further steps to see a significant increase in Chinese visitors to Scotland including Shandong Province through targeted promotion of Scotland as a tourism destination.</p>

  <p>In particular, we hope to build on successes such as Angus Council&rsquo;s close links with Yantai City, Shandong Province to promote each others historical sites and golf courses.</p>

  <p>A range of marketing materials, brochures in Chinese etc and initiatives aimed at the Chinese market has therefore been developed by VisitScotland. VisitScotland also participate in sales missions and trade shows in China which provide opportunities to meet with agents from the whole of the China market. In particular, VisitScotland hosted over 60 representatives from Chinese travel agencies for their International Chinese Tourist Association (ICTA) Annual Leadership Summit held in Edinburgh in November 2007. The first time the ICTA have held their summit in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has also provided funding to support specific training for Chinese-speaking students to work as tour guides in Scotland. The first of these guides will qualify to coincide with Chinese New Year.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government continues to work with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government and indeed the rest of the UK as regards the introduction of electronic identification (EID). Part of that work was the submission of the UK Evidence Report which highlighted the findings of trials within the UK and urged the Commission to take account of these findings in seeking a delay to the introduction of EID on 1 January 2008 (as laid out in EU Council Regulation 21/2004). It is believed that the extensive lobbying by the Scottish Government, Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government and industry stakeholders resulted in the Commission recommending that the introduction of EID be delayed until 31 December 2009. A qualified majority vote on the implementation date of 31 December 2009 was secured by the Portuguese Presidency at EC Agriculture and Fisheries Council on 17 December 2007. The Scottish Government will continue to work with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government other UK Departments to make representations at EU Working Groups and to try find a workable and affordable EID system for the UK industry taking account of the unique stratified nature of the sheep movement system in the UK.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is working closely with NHS boards to develop the pregnancy screening programme to include the anomaly scan as a matter of routine right across the country. The introduction of fetal anomaly scans however has significant implications for the health service in terms of resources, workforce, equipment and training.</p>

  <p>Mental health is a priority for the Scottish Government. Improved mental health is an important part of the higher quality of life that we want to deliver for everyone in Scotland. There has been steady progress in developing and improving mental health services across Scotland, supported by the record levels of funding that we and our partner agencies are continuing to invest in mental health care. We want this progress to continue and we have 18 published targets and commitments relating to mental health. These are designed to address specific needs earlier and to engage more closely than ever before with people who use services.</p>

  <p>Within this framework NHS boards, working with partner agencies, are responsible for assessing local service needs and for providing services to meet these needs. It is therefore for NHS Grampian to ensure that appropriate services are in place in Aberdeen and the wider Grampian area and for NHS Tayside to do so in Angus. Both NHS boards have well-developed mental health strategies that aim to deliver services that are consistent with need throughout the areas for which they are responsible. We will continue to work closely with the boards as they implement these strategies.</p>

The standards state that health boards and staff should ensure that patients with dementia receive care appropriate to their individual needs and that staff should have relevant training to provide that care.</p>

  <p>The provision of support services for people with learning disabilities is the responsibility of local government to be drawn from the local government settlement of &pound;34.7 billion over three years.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is also committed to increasing the uptake of self-directed support for people with learning disabilities. This will enable people to have more choice about how they are supported and what services they receive.</p>

  <p>The main public sessions of the Beauly to Denny line public inquiry concluded on 20 December 2007 but hearings connected with land acquisition and the sub-station at Beauly will not be concluded until February or later of this year. Following the complete closure of the inquiry, the reporters will compile their report for the Scottish ministers who will take this into account in reaching their determination. Their report is not expected until the end of 2008, consequently it is likely to be 2009 before a decision is made by the Scottish ministers.</p>

  <p>We have set up an Independent Commission, chaired by Henry McLeish, to look at the purpose and use of imprisonment, which is due to report in June.</p>

  <p>The role of the Scottish Government is to provide courts with a sufficient range of sentencing options in dealing with those appearing before them and to ensure that the appropriate authorities and agencies are adequately resourced to deliver the sentences imposed. However, responsibility for individual sentencing decisions rests with courts having regard to the specific circumstances of the offence and the individual offender. It would therefore be inappropriate for the government to set a target for the number of custodial sentences passed on any specific offender group.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to announce today the publication of the Report on the Review of Property Asset Management and our approach to the relocation of public bodies.</p>

  <p>The main findings of the Asset Management Review are:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government occupies 709 buildings totalling, 723,054m<sup>2</sup> and there is a wide variety of management arrangements of these assets;</p>

  <p>Two-thirds of organisations surveyed do not have an asset management plan or strategy in place, and</p>

  <p>There is no single IT asset data system that holds key data about the whole estate.</p>

  <p>Based on these findings, the main recommendations are to:</p>

  <p>Ensure, by end April 2008, that all parts of Scottish Government have in place an Asset Management Plan.</p>

  <p>Ensure that, in future, we will maintain a single comprehensive database of property information.</p>

  <p>Put in place a central team that will maintain a strategic overview of the whole estate, perform a challenge function and identify the best opportunities for the future use property assets.</p>

  <p>As a result of the publication of this report, I am also announcing the Scottish Government&rsquo;s approach to the location of public service delivery organisations. The relocation policy will be taken forward within the context of the government&rsquo;s purpose and the five strategic objectives. It will seek to deliver better use of the government estate and ensure that opportunities to disperse public bodies are taken where a clear business case can be demonstrated. The policy will ensure that due account is given to the relevant environmental considerations of the Greener Scotland programme.</p>

  <p>The key principles of the relocation policy are:</p>

  <p>Achieving efficiency and best practice asset management. There will be a presumption in favour of the choice representing best value for money for the Scottish Government as a whole, providing that this meets the requirements of the organisation, unless clear reasons for an alternative are agreed and articulated by ministers.</p>

  <p>In pursuing value for money on accommodation decisions we will continue to pursue our policy of no compulsory redundancies.</p>

  <p>Major estate management decisions and all proposed changes of location will be overseen by Scottish ministers.</p>

  <p>The Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth will approve all new commitments, confirm location decisions, and arbitrate in any disputes relating to the existing estate.</p>

  <p>Location and asset management decisions will be transparent (with the exception of commercially sensitive data) and made public, and staff and unions will continue to be consulted.</p>

  <p>The full Report on the Review of Property Asset Management and our approach to the relocation of public bodies are released today on the Scottish Government&rsquo;s website.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government strategy in this and related areas was set out in the action plan for health and safety in Scotland, which was published in May and will contribute to the Smart Successful Scotland agenda, a robust strategy to deliver long-term, sustainable economic growth. Companies that have a good track record on health and safety tend to be the most progressive and successful. Further information about the plan can be found at <a href="http://www.iosh.co.uk" target="_blank">http://www.iosh.co.uk</a> . The Scottish Government also works closely with other organisations such as the Health and Safety Executive, the STUC and employers organisations to support approaches that address the promotion of health and safety in the workplace, most notably through the Partnership on Health and Safety in Scotland (PHASS) which is chaired by the Health and Safety Commission.</p>

  <p>An important element of the strategy is the Healthy Working Lives (HWL) programme which offers advice to employers in the public and private sectors on ways to improve the health and wellbeing of their workforce. Employers are encouraged to participate in the related award scheme which recognises and rewards good practice. Criteria for the Award include actions to promote good mental health. At the first Healthy Working Lives Awards ceremony on 15 January, the public sector was well represented amongst those gaining awards. The Scottish Government itself holds the silver level of the Scotland Health at Work award (the previous version) and is working towards obtaining the gold level of the new award.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government accepts the findings of the Care Commission&rsquo;s report <em>Pressure for Change</em> , which includes important recommendations for care providers, NHS boards and local authorities.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers do not provide direct guidance to staff in care homes. It is the responsibility of the providers of care home services to ensure that staff are appropriately trained and that care is provided in line with the National Care Standards. Other professionals also have important roles in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of pressure sores amongst residents.</p>

  <p>However, we are keen to ensure a national approach in responding to this issue. The Scottish Government will, therefore, establish a National Programme Board shortly, to be chaired by the Chief Nursing Officer. The board will involve relevant representative bodies and will oversee and quality assure a programme of work on pressure ulcers and skin care.

  <p><em>Older and Wiser</em> centres on findings from unannounced visits to NHS Continuing Care Wards, not care homes. However, the Scottish Government places the highest importance on maintaining standards in care homes, including ensuring that residents are provided with adequate nutrition.</p>

  <p><em>The National Care Standards &ndash; Care Homes for Older People</em> address the issue of help with eating and drinking. The Standards require care home staff to arrange whatever help residents need in order to be able to eat and enjoy their food and drink. For example the provision of liquidised food, adapted cutlery or crockery, or help from a staff member.</p>

  <p>Care homes are regulated by the Care Commission, which takes the National Care Standards into account in carrying out its regulatory role.</p>

  <p>To support delivery of the National Care Standards, the Scottish Government is funding the Care Commission-led <em>Promoting Nutrition in Care Homes Project. </em>This aims to improve nutrition and food and eating practices within the care home sector through the education and facilitated support of staff.</p>

  <p>We have no plans for national action to monitor noise levels within continuing care wards or care homes.</p>

  <p>It is the responsibility of NHS boards to provide an acceptable environment for patients within continuing care wards.</p>

  <p>Within care homes the responsibility for providing adequate care, including the care environment, rests with providers, care home managers and staff. The vast majority of residents have single rooms.</p>

  <p>GAE is not funding. Rather, it is a means of distributing the grant that the Scottish Government provides to local government. Generally it is the responsibility of each local authority to allocate the total financial resources available to it on the basis of local needs and priorities, having first fulfilled its statutory obligations and addressed the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities including the Scottish Government&rsquo;s key strategic objectives and manifesto commitments.</p>

  <p>It is, therefore, for South Lanarkshire Council to determine its spending priorities, including investment on non-trunk roads in its area.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has no plans to update the comparative trends data. The comparative trend data merely provided an indication of trends in expenditure over an arbitrary 10 year period and was flawed due to the complication of the introduction of Resource Accounting and Budgeting.

  <p>The &pound;2 million of savings I announced in October 2007 will be achieved by a number of measures.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will review how we produce and distribute our publications. Reducing the number of documents we print, producing smaller print runs and encouraging greater use of web-only publications will help reduce cost and environmental impact.</p>

  <p>Initial distribution of publications will continue to be free of charge to our key stakeholders and other interested parties. Additional requested copies will be subject to a nominal postage and packaging charge from 1 April 2008.</p>

  <p>We already make all of our printed publications available online. Our aim is to increase our web-only publications by up to 20 per cent (around 250) by the end of this financial year. This approach to more web-only publications will reduce the need for large amounts of printed copies, and will help us become more environmentally-friendly.</p>

  <p>From June 2008, we will stop producing large reprints of publications, except in exceptional circumstances. Access to any publication can continue to be made free of charge via our website. Where demand is substantial and continuous, we will carry out a reprint but any reprinted copies will carry a cover price to reflect the cost of the reprint.</p>

  <p>Additionally, we are introducing a print on demand service which will allow anyone to request a copy of an out of print publication. This will allow one or more copies to be printed, the cost of which will depend on the size and the number requested.</p>

  <p>We will further review these proposals to assess their impact over the next two years. At that time, we may also consider the introduction of cover prices for some publications as long as this it does not prevent people accessing important information.</p>

  <p>All documents will still be available to download free of charge from the Scottish Government website.</p>

Following these representations, the negotiating aims and conduct, including the participation of the Scottish Government, have been agreed with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.</p>

  <p>With regard to energy issues, while again we have not made any specific representations regarding Rockall, we have made clear, as part of the national conversation, that we would wish to undertake discussions with the UK Government regarding options for the transfer of responsibility of oil and gas resources to the Scottish Government in the long-term.</p>

  <p>Project costs are generally first estimated at current prices, or prices of the last full year. In the case of the Forth Replacement Crossing Study, this was 2006.</p>

  <p>Outturn costs are calculated for budgetary purposes and are based on estimates of inflation going forward. This generally results in a range of costs rather than a single estimate due to the uncertainty over future inflation.</p>

  <p>It is, therefore, more useful to use initial current prices for comparison of options, such as the comparison between the Forth Replacement Crossing options.</p>

  <p>The project costs presented at the public information exhibitions and published in the study reports are initial estimates at current prices, excluding VAT. This is standard for transport projects.</p>

  <p>It is a requirement of the Scottish Transport Appraisal Guidance (STAG) process, that all relevant fees are included, such as design fees and the costs for land acquisition.</p>

  <p>Optimism bias of 66% for the crossing itself, and 44% for the connecting roads, as required by HM Treasury Guidance, have also been included.</p>

  <p>Inflation has not been included; however the outturn costs quoted in the December Parliamentary Statement are based on estimates of inflation going forward for budgetary purposes.</p>
