  <p>VisitScotland is represented on, and contributes funding to, the Angling Development Tourism Group, which has been instrumental in the development of the FishScotland website. VisitScotland also has a section on its own website dedicated to sea angling, along with two pages about the sport in its Fishing in Scotland brochure.

  <p>Education Maintenance Allowances (EMAs) were launched across Scotland in August 2004 for eligible 16-year-olds. The national roll out to all eligible 16 to 19-year-olds will be complete in 2007-08.</p>

  <p>West Dunbartonshire took part in the pilot phase of EMAs, and therefore information is available for each of the pilot years (2001-02 onwards). In pilot areas the allowance is paid to 16 to 19-year-olds. As Argyll and Bute did not participate in the pilot, information is only available from the first year of national roll-out (i.e. academic year 2004-05).</p>

  <p>The numbers of young people in receipt of Education Maintenance Allowances (EMAs) in (a) West Dunbartonshire and (b) Argyll and Bute for the period in question are as follows:</p>

  <p>Given the distribution of staff across the Executive&rsquo;s estate, it is not possible to breakdown the measures taken by department. The Executive publishes an annual report on the environmental performance of its estate which details, among other things, actions taken to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases linked to its energy use. The most recent report, published in December 2005, is available through the Executive&rsquo;s internet site: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/12/16153024/30243" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/12/16153024/30243</a> .</p>

  <p>The Executive has also built energy efficiency into its contract for the management and maintenance of its building operations.</p>

  <p>All new IT equipment supplied on the Executive estate since 2001 is Energy Star compliant.</p>

  <p>Staff awareness campaigns have also been undertaken to illustrate the impacts of energy consumption and the need for a reduction in the related greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

  <p>There are no official statistical sources which accurately record the number of call centres operating in Scotland over the period requested. This makes it very difficult to quantify growth in terms of either turnover or Gross Value Added. However, the number of people employed in call and contact centres in Scotland can be measured using the Labour Force Survey. This data is shown in the following table. It should be noted that the estimates in the tables are based on a sample survey, and as such, are subject to sampling error.</p>

  <p>Article 4.2 of the Maritime Cabotage Regulation (Council Regulation (EEC) No 3577/92 of 7 December 1992 applying the principle of freedom to provide services to maritime transport within member states (maritime cabotage)) notes that, in imposing PSOs, &quot;Member States shall be limited to requirements concerning ports to be served, regularity, continuity, frequency, capacity to provide the service, rates to be charged and manning of the vessel&quot;. Usually the PSO approach may not be sufficient to meet essential transport needs, in particular conditions concerning quality of service. No such limitations are applicable to Public Service Contracts (PSCs) which may therefore deal with a wider range of matters and thus go further to secure certainty and security of service. The Executive is currently tendering the Gourock to Dunoon ferry service on the basis of a PSC as that approach is consistent with the Executive&rsquo;s key policy objectives.</p>

  <p>VAT is payable on infrastructure facilities, and the tax has to be paid by the client to the contractor. This is the case whether the client is the Executive, a local authority or any other public body.</p>

  <p>Some bodies, for example local authorities or (most) commercial companies, are then able to reclaim this VAT. The Executive, in common with Whitehall departments, is not able to reclaim VAT on infrastructure costs which it has incurred directly.</p>

  <p>The Rule of 85 has to be removed from the Local Government Pension Scheme by 1 October 2006 in order to comply with EC Directive 2000/78/EC. Today I am commencing a consultation exercise on removing the Rule and implementing transitional protections for existing scheme members. The consultation documents are available on the Scottish Public Pensions Agency website on the Pensions Reform and Taxation Page and can be accessed using the following link : <a href="http://www.sppa.gov.uk/pension_reform/PRLGPSConsultations.htm" target="_blank">http://www.sppa.gov.uk/pension_reform/PRLGPSConsultations.htm</a> .</p>

  <p>Following extensive discussions with representatives of the local government trades unions and COSLA, the Scottish Executive is now consulting on the terms of the protection to be provided for existing scheme members when the rule is removed. Full transitional protection to 2020 will be provided to existing members who decide to retire before age 65 if they have attained age 60 and would have satisfied the rule by that date.</p>

  <p>The consultation exercise, which also covers tax changes resulting from the Finance Act 2004, will run until 31 July 2006. This timetable will allow the regulations to be made and come into force on 1 October 2006.</p>

  <p>We will also continue discussions with trades unions and COSLA, and aim to consult widely later this year, on costed, realistic options for a new Local Government Pension Scheme specifically tailored for Scotland, with the objective of improving the benefits of those workers who retire on the lowest benefits, and having modernised arrangements in place for April 2008.</p>

The services are planned to be in operation at the end of 2010, and it is important that the final decision on exactly what is to be provided is made nearer that time. This will enable the services planned to take into account the best fit with other services that will be running then.

  <p>The Scottish Executive is currently considering research and development (R&amp;D) issues for the renewable energy sector through the Forum for Renewable Energy Development in Scotland. A task group with representatives from the Executive, industry and academia has been established to scope the existing R&amp;D capability in Scotland along with the future R&amp;D requirements of the renewables industry in Scotland.</p>

  <p>We have already contributed over &pound;3 million to establish world leading research and testing facilities at the European Marine Energy Centre, allowing performance research to be undertaken by marine technology developers.</p>

  <p>ITI Energy has also committed up to &pound;1.5 million to create an innovative low-cost hydrogen handling material that has the potential to store and release hydrogen at room temperature. This clean energy project is a collaboration between a French company who have relocated to Scotland, and several Scottish universities.</p>

  <p>Since April 2003, the Executive&rsquo;s SMART, SPUR and SCORE research and development support schemes have funded 11 projects offering almost &pound;640,000 to businesses to help them develop renewable and clean energy technologies.</p>

  <p>The STAG transport study for Maybole has been published today 29 June 2006. The delay has been due to further consideration of the report by Transport Scotland and further discussions with their consultants.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland has the operational responsibility for this area, and can be contacted for more information if required.</p>

  <p>The National Transport Strategy (NTS) consultation paper poses questions about a range of issues including how we might build a sustainable transport system for Scotland. I look forward to considering views on the paper after the closing date for comments on 13 July 2006.</p>

  <p>The numbers of men and women who are qualified to drive are not available. However, estimates of the percentages of men and women, aged 17 and over, who live in private households in Scotland and hold a full driving licence are published each year - for example, in table 1.16 of the 2005 edition of <em>Scottish Transport</em> <em>Statistics</em> . Copies are available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 37306).</p>

  <p>Scottish Planning Policy three states that planning authorities should identify suitable locations for Gypsies/Travellers sites where need is identified in the local housing strategy.</p>

  <p>In addition, we have made &pound;3 million funding available to cover the three year period from financial year 2005-06 to year 2007-08, to local authorities to create or improve sites for Gypsies/Travellers.</p>
