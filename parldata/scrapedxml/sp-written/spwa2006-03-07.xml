  <p>The report is unscientific in its methodology and has no veterinary input. It was an in-house survey carried out on German Shorthair Pointer (GSP) owners by the GSP Council in Sweden which relied solely on volunteered owner feedback. Their responses were not supported by veterinary evidence and there was no standardisation of degree of severity of damage. Fully comparative statistical material is not available throughout the two years of the survey (1990 and 1991). The statistics do not differentiate between damage occurring during hunting and by other causes. It was not a controlled study and has not been peer reviewed.</p>

  <p>The report has been regarded as unscientific by the Swedish Board of Agriculture which noted the defects in its methodology.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it plans to review the statutory framework in respect of reporting complaints upheld by the Care Commission to relevant public bodies, in light of the case of Mrs Alma Murray whilst a patient in an NHS-contracted bed at the BUPA Hatton Lea Nursing Home in Bellshill.</p>

  <p>We have no immediate plans to review the statutory framework in respect of the reporting of complaints upheld by the Care Commission to other relevant public bodies. The current framework already allows for such reports to be made when necessary.</p>

  <p>The Care Commission&rsquo;s (revised) complaints procedure was published in September 2004 under the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001 (the Act) with the approval of ministers.</p>

  <p>Under that procedure the Care Commission reports on the outcome of a complaint to the complainant and to the care provider. Beyond that the commission has the discretion to decide if and when to notify other agencies. It is currently developing agreements with local authorities and health boards which set out arrangements for sharing information including information on complaints and enforcement.</p>

  <p>The complaints procedure includes arrangements to fast-track complaints where there are indications of abuse or neglect or allegations of an offence that present a clear risk of actual or probable harm to the service user. In these circumstances the commission will inform the relevant agencies immediately on receipt of the complaint. In addition, where the outcome of a complaint &ndash; whether or not it is fast tracked - leads to formal enforcement action this will be included in the care service provider&rsquo;s next inspection report and will be followed up by the commission as part of the inspection process. The commission also has a duty under the Act to copy all formal improvement notices to the local authority where the service is provided<em>. </em></p>

  <p>Separately, as part of the Adult Support and Protection Bill, ministers will be bringing forward proposals that place a requirement on all agencies to collaborate and share information where it is thought that an adult is at risk in whatever setting.</p>

  <p>The aim of the three year child protection reform programme, now in its final year, is that children and young people get the help they need when they need it. It is for local agencies to identify the specific services required to meet the needs of children in their area and, through mechanisms such as integrated children&rsquo;s services planning, ensure these are secured and delivered.</p>

  <p>Funding is also available to agencies and the voluntary sector through the Changing Children&rsquo;s Services Fund, the Children, Young People and Families Unified Voluntary Sector Fund and the Survivors Fund to provide services required locally.</p>

  <p>In addition, in September 2005 the National Strategy for Adult Survivors of Childhood Sexual Abuse was announced. The aim of this work is to effect a step change in services responses to survivors in Scotland.</p>

  <p>A number of funding streams are available to agencies and voluntary sector organisations to support the development and delivery of local services.</p>

  <p>One of the priorities of the Children, Young People and Families Unified Voluntary Sector Fund is to protect children through effective early intervention with children and families and/or support when they need protection. The Unified Fund has been in existence since 2004-05. The fund total for 2004-05 was &pound;6.5 million and &pound;7.2 million for 2005-06.</p>

  <p>In addition one of the priorities for the Changing Children&rsquo;s Services Fund is to support packages for vulnerable children and young. Over the last three years the following have been spent specifically on child protection activities; 2002-03 &pound;1,420,426 from a total fund of &pound;27 million, 2003-04 &pound;1,537,557 from a total fund of &pound;41.5 million, and 2004-05 &pound;5,389,793 from a total fund of &pound;60.5 million.</p>

  <p>We have made two awards of grant under the Waterborne Freight Grant scheme. Neither award was made to a port.</p>

  <p>Superfast Ferries received grant support totalling &pound;519,722 to enable them to continue operating a two vessel ferry service between Rosyth and Zeebrugge during 2005. Grant support ceased once a single vessel service was introduced in November 2005.

  <p>This is a matter for police forces. The information is not collated centrally.</p>

  <p>However data does exist where a young person has been referred by the police to the Children&rsquo;s Reporter. The following table has been produced by the Scottish Children&rsquo;s Reporter Administration (SCRA) from its Referrals Administration Database (RAD). It shows the numbers of children aged eight to 10 years, 11 to 13 years and 14 to 16 years who were referred to the Children&rsquo;s Reporter in 2003-04 and 2004-05 on offence grounds where the offence category was vandalism/ malicious mischief in each police force area.</p>

  <p>Eight years is the age of criminal responsibility in Scotland and children below this age cannot be charged with offences. Information is provided for 2003-04 and</p>

  <p>2004-05. Prior to 2003 and the roll-out of RAD, SCRA did not record centrally offence categories:</p>

As NHSScotland continues to make good progress in reducing maximum waiting times, and sees more patients who have had longer waits, median waiting times will rise. A significant change in the waiting time distribution of patients seen, such as a higher number of patients who have had lengthy waits, will increase median waiting times.</p>

  <p>Information on waiting times for second and subsequent out-patient appointments is not collected centrally.</p>

  <p>NHSScotland: Median Waiting Times For A First Out-Patient Appointment At A Consultant-Led Clinic, Following Referral By A General Medical/Dental Practitioner. Quarters Ended 31 March 2002 to 31 December 2005, Median Waiting Times (Days)</p>

  <p>The impact on funding arrangements for railway policing in Scotland would depend on the nature of any decision about the future structure of British Transport Police. Officials remain in touch with the Department of Transport on progress with their review of British Transport Police.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Assessors have been monitoring the work of the Valuation Office Agency in this area.

  <p>The target date for completion of the re-development of Waverley Station is November 2007. This will increase the number of trains which Waverley can accommodate from 24 per hour to 28.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland recently asked First ScotRail to consider and estimate the implications of introducing stops at Edinburgh Park station for services operating on the Edinburgh/Glasgow route. The results of this work have been received, however more needs to be done to assess the performance and financial impact of these changes, before a decision is made.</p>

  <p>Edinburgh Park station is currently served by four trains per hour in each direction at peak times and already offers commuters a real alternative to the car. The potential for further positive impact on traffic volumes of such a stop at Edinburgh Park will form part of the appraisal of future timetable developments for Edinburgh to Glasgow services.</p>

  <p>Options to change the existing timetable are constrained by the current rail infrastructure. Transport Scotland is investing to deliver a number of rail infrastructure enhancements on this route, including the major redevelopment of Edinburgh Waverley Station. Transport Scotland will ensure that appropriate improvements to the Edinburgh and Glasgow timetable will be implemented to maximise the return from these investments as they are delivered.</p>

I have made clear that I expect the project to be completed by the end of March 2007, since there is no budgetary provision beyond then.

  <p>In developing the design for this scheme since the original announcement in March 2003, a total of eleven options have been considered. In August 2003 consultants were appointed for the development of the scheme with a project brief being issued on 3 September 2003. A Divisional review of the development work on the scheme took place on 18 February 2005.</p>

  <p>In June of 2005 following further assessment, our consultants indicated that the economic analysis of all the options failed to demonstrate the necessary value for money in taking the scheme forward. Before taking any decision, the scheme was reviewed by engineers from Scottish Borders Council in August 2005 and they confirmed our earlier findings. In the light of this and the environmental impact which the scheme would have had, the decision was made in November 2005 not to take the scheme forward at this time. My officials will keep this section of the route under review and assess any future actions which may be required.</p>
