<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2001-04-04.1.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80201" speakername="Mr Jack McConnell" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-01/wa0404.htm#se_Minister">

  <p>As part of our commitment to improve the position of children and young people looked after by local authorities, I am concerned about the place of adoption services within the range of options that should be considered when their needs are being assessed. With my colleagues, I have concluded that there should be a review of adoption law and practice in Scotland focussing initially on children and young people in the care system.</p>

  <p>Changes in adoption law were last introduced in the Children (Scotland) Act 1995. The key change was to place the lifelong interests of the child at the heart of the adoption process. The time is now right to review the operation of the relevant provisions in the 1995 Act, including their impact upon the lives and life chances of young people within the care of local authorities.</p>

  <p>We have already signalled our intention to close a number of loopholes within the legislation governing inter-country adoption. The review will concentrate therefore on domestic adoption arrangements.</p>

  <p>I propose to set up an Adoption Policy Review Advisory Group with former Sheriff Principal Graham Cox as Convenor. The group will comprise representatives of the local authorities, specialist voluntary sector agencies, children&#8217;s panels and legal interests. I will also ensure representation from adoptive parents and young people who have gone through the adoption process.</p>

  <p>The remit for the review will be discussed with the Education, Culture and Sport and with the Justice Committees of the Parliament. I am arranging for a copy of the memorandum to both committees to be placed today in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>I will finalise other appointments to the advisory group very shortly and, subject to consultations with the parliamentary committees, hope to see the advisory group start its deliberations in the course of April and submit a first report to me within six months. With colleagues I will consider the findings and recommendations together with any other points made to me by the group about possible further work that may be required.</p>

  <p>The cycletrack between Kirkpatrick Fleming and Beattock was constructed as part of a number of individual contracts during the upgrading of the A74 between Gretna and Millbank. Several of these contracts were in the form of lump sum design and build and the section between Johnstonebridge and Beattock was constructed as part of the M6 DBFO project. Consequently it is not possible to identify the contractor&#8217;s costs for individual elements of the various works such as cycleway signs.</p>

  <p>With the growing interest in farmers&#8217; markets in Scotland, the industry was keen to establish a body which would allow markets to share information, co-ordinate activity, promote best practice, etc. As part of its grant-funded activities, the Executive encouraged SAOS to investigate the potential for an association. That work showed there would be benefits in forming such a body which could be used to encourage professionalism, high standards and training, all matters which are better handled jointly. Accordingly, SAOS assisted in the formation process which led to the Scottish Association of Farmers&#8217; Markets being legally established at the end of 2000.</p>

  <p>For these patients, there are four &quot;one-stop&quot; services in Scotland: at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, Gartnavel Hospital, Falkirk Royal Infirmary and the Western General Hospital, Edinburgh. In addition, there are two neurovascular clinics, one at Borders General Hospital, the other at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, which can also assess patients who have had a minor stroke. A further clinic is operated by Aberdeen Royal Infirmary for stroke prevention.</p>

  <p>The majority of NHS Trusts have good procedures in place to deal with the management of medical equipment.</p>

  <p>In April 2000 the Medical Devices Agency issued guidance entitled <i>Equipped to Care &#8211; The safe use of medical devices in the 21st century</i>. This was distributed in Scotland by Scottish Healthcare Supplies.</p>

  <p>The aim of the guidance is to:</p>

  <p>Help nurses, midwives, health visitors, other health professionals and support workers understand their role in the safe use, purchase and management of medical devices.</p>

  <p>Provide managers with pointers to the best practices for training, purchase and maintenance of medical devices.</p>

  <p>Ensure that arrangements for purchase, use and maintenance of medical devices are firmly embedded within the local framework for clinical governance.</p>

  <p>Raise awareness about the role of MDA and how it can provide advice, guidance to support the safe use of medical devices.</p>

  <p>However, in the light of the recent baseline report by the Auditor General, <i>Equipped to Care: Managing Medical Equipment in the NHS in Scotland</i>, it is my intention that the Health Department issues further guidance to NHS Trusts in order further to improve the situation across Scotland.</p>

  <p>In response to the recommendations of the review of services for people with learning disabilities, local authorities were notified in December 2000 that additional funds of &#163;36 million over three years would be awarded as part of the Grant Aided Expenditure allocation from April 2001.</p>

  <p>The resources for 2001-02 were distributed through the Grant Aided Expenditure for services for people with disabilities. The GAE &quot;Green Book&quot;, setting out the elements for each authority, is available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. no. 12261).</p>

  <p>The distribution formula for 2002-03 and 2003-04 is based on projections of population changes in key client groups.</p>

  <p>Guidance on the change funds issued on 26 March advising local authorities that the additional resources have been included as part of the Revenue Support Grant along with the existing provision for services for people with learning disabilities. It stated that local authorities, with their partners, should use new and existing resources to achieve both short-term and longer-term improvements in services; that making better use of existing resources is a key part of delivering the review&#8217;s objectives, and that authorities are expected to apply Best Value principles to ensure maximum benefits for agencies and the best outcomes for all those who require services.</p>

  <p>In order to support and promote action at local level, Scottish Healthcare Supplies are raising the profile of procurement throughout the NHSScotland as an activity that contributes to patient care.

  <p>There is no mandatory training policy for NHS Trust staff on the use of medical equipment. NHS Trusts are responsible for ensuring that their employees are competent to use the equipment they need to use. Equally all health care professionals have a personal responsibility to ensure that they are properly trained in the safe use of medical equipment that they use.</p>

  <p>The tendering of the contracts was required by the relevant EC Directive implemented in domestic law by the 1991 regulations. Failure to award the contracts as tendered could expose the Scottish Executive to damages claims. Only the five existing Managing Agent contracts under which two private sector and three local authority consortia provide management services for the rural networks outwith the central belt, can clearly be extended. Such an extension would not deliver maintenance services of itself.</p>

  <p>Volatile substance abuse is addressed within Scotland&#8217;s drugs strategy as a whole. Drug Action Teams are asked to include it in their action plans. Efforts are focused on preventing volatile substance abuse through the education of young people, professionals and retailers, and, where practicable, restricting the sale of solvent-based products.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive provides core funding for the Scottish Drugs Forum, which considers and provides information on volatile substance abuse, through its Volatile Substance Use Working Group. Guidance on volatile substance abuse for professionals working with children and young people was recently published by the Health Education Board for Scotland, in conjunction with the Scottish Drugs Forum and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. The Executive also contributes towards the funding of the National Drugs Helpline which responds to calls about volatile substance abuse, as well as about the misuse of drugs in general.</p>

  <p>The treatment of drug misusers is one of the key objectives within the Executive&#8217;s drugs strategy. As part of the new three-year &#163;100 million drugs expenditure package, we have committed an additional &#163;10 million to provide treatment services in the community for more drug users and &#163;21 million for rehabilitation services to equip former drug users for opportunities such as employment and education. These resources are available also for the treatment and rehabilitation of those who abuse volatile substances. Assessment of need and the targeting of resources will be determined at local level by Drug Action Teams (DATs) and constituent agencies.</p>

  <p>According to the Scottish Drugs Forum&#8217;s Directory of Specialist Helping Agencies, there are over 80 treatment services in Scotland, providing a service to people who use volatile substances. The Executive has recently set a national standard to ensure that drug misusers under 16 have access to appropriate drug treatment and care services. This will include the provision of facilities for those who misuse volatile substances. For the first time this year DAT corporate action plans will contain information on the availability of services which treat volatile substance abuse clients. The plans will be analysed by the Executive, to determine whether any further action is required.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, with regard to the application by West of Scotland Water to discharge effluent into the River Clyde at Biggar, (a) which bodies or individuals were consulted by the Environment Protection Unit Water Team, (b) what information was given during the consultation process and (c) on what basis it was decided not to call in the application.</p>

  <p>Information was sought from the Freshwater Fisheries Laboratory, Pitlochry and, within the Scottish Executive, from the Veterinary Advisers and from Public Health Policy Unit. Clarification of various points was also sought from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. The advice from these bodies did not contradict the agency&#8217;s decision to approve the applications in question.</p>

  <p>The policy of the Scottish ministers has been to exercise our power to call in applications to discharge for our own determination, under section 36 of the Control of Pollution Act 1974, where the issues raised are novel or unusual, or of more than local significance, or where the agency does not appear to be sufficiently informed to allow it to make a decision on the application. Careful consideration was given to the application to discharge at Biggar, but as the case did not appear to meet these criteria, the Scottish ministers declined to exercise the power to call it in.</p>

  <p>Phasing in of water charges to all organisations affected by the decision to withdraw reliefs is being made over a period of five years. This should allow such organisations time to prepare for the changes and ease the immediate impact of increased charges.</p>

  <p>Additionally, the water authorities have offered to install water meters free where this will reduce costs. This should have the effect of reducing further any additional liability that these organisations have to face.</p>
