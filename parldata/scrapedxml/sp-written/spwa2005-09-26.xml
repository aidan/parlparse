  <p>This shows that the destination of a small number of graduates in each year was either unknown or other, than posts in the home countries, HM Forces or abroad.</p>

  <p>Of the seven graduates whose destination was listed as &quot;Unknown/Other&quot; in 2004; four were in the unknown category, and of the three that chose not to take up PRHO posts this was due to travel, further study and one did not apply for registration. We do not have evidence that any of these graduates did not have a post to go to for any reason other than through their own choice. Information prior to 2004 is not available.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the letter of 14 July 2005 from the Minister for Transport and Telecommunications in respect of the tendering costs of the first bid for lifeline ferry services currently provided by Caledonian MacBrayne, whether it will place in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre each piece of the external advice commissioned at a cost of &pound;286,000 and, in particular, the research into the application of the EU rules in other member states.</p>

  <p>Much of the work undertaken by consultants commissioned by the Executive has contributed to the development of Scottish Executive policy on this subject and has been reflected in documents that have already been published. These documents include the following:</p>

  <p>The consultation paper and draft service for the Clyde and Hebrides ferry services that were published in June 2002;</p>

  <p>The consultation paper and draft service specification for the Gourock to Dunoon route that were published in March 2003;</p>

  <p>The consultation paper and draft service specification for the Clyde and Hebrides ferry services that were published in December 2004;</p>

  <p>The Research into the application of the EU rules in other member states that was published on 12 September 2005, and</p>

  <p>The Report Clyde and Hebrides Lifeline Ferry Services Scottish Executive&rsquo;s Consideration of the Requirement to Tender that was published on 12 September 2005.</p>

  <p>In addition, I shall lodge in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre within the next few weeks, a summary paper (Bib. number 37522) on the research on the uniqueness of the CalMac fleet that was commissioned in 2001 but which has not been published. I shall write to the member to let him know when the documents has been published.</p>

  <p>At this time the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency has identified Remontowa of Gdansk, Poland as the preferred bidder for one fisheries protection vessel and it is in negotiation with the Polish yard to finalise a contract. The delays to the contract assessment process mean that a date for handover of the vessel has not yet been fixed.</p>

  <p>It will not be compulsory for participants to complete the questionnaire. However, we are taking steps to make the questionnaire easily accessible. Return rates will be kept under review and a decision made at a later date as to whether any additional work needs to be done to increase return rates.

  <p>The Executive has no plans to reduce the number of stoma care nurse positions in Scotland after April 2006.</p>

  <p>Funding and employment and working practices of all nurse posts is a matter for the employing or contracting NHS board.</p>

  <p>All funding currently provided centrally for the provision of stoma appliances, from which appliance contractors either provide sponsorship moneys or employ directly nurses working in hospitals or the community will transfer directly to NHS boards with effect from 1 April 2006.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are now reviewing the position of nurses not currently employed by them but who provide stoma care in hospitals or the community, to ensure that those affected nurses who wish to do so can continue their employment within the NHS.</p>

  <p>These new more equitable funding arrangements allow NHS boards the financial flexibility to design future stoma services which will better meet the needs of patients and be more transparent and accountable.</p>

  <p>The exact number of people diagnosed with depression in Scotland in each year since 1999, is not available centrally. However, national estimates of the numbers of people diagnosed with depression can be given based on the number of patients seen for the condition in general practices participating in PTI (Practice Team Information). PTI data are obtained from a sample of Scottish General Practices. This sample covers the full range of age, sex, deprivation and urban/rural classes existing in Scotland. The number of participating practices is too small to allow estimates for individual NHS board areas.</p>

  <p>The estimated number of GP diagnoses of depression in Scotland, based on PTI data, is shown in the following table.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has examined the report of the study carried out by the National Research and Development Centre for Welfare and Health in Finland which states that the mortality rate for women associated with abortions is three times the rate for women associated with childbirth and what comparative figures it has for Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Executive is aware of the existence of this study. All UK health departments are advised on issues relating to abortion by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, which will take all good quality published studies into account in the next review of the college&rsquo;s evidence-based good practice clinical guideline on the care of women seeking induced abortion.</p>

  <p>Abortion, both medical and surgical, is a very safe procedure and deaths following abortion are extremely rare. In the UK it is a requirement that all maternal deaths should be subject to confidential enquiry and all health professionals have a duty to provide the information required. Reports on such enquiries are published on a UK basis.</p>

  <p>The triennial report on Confidential Enquires into Maternal Deaths in the UK for the period 2000 to 2002, the last figures available, showed that three maternal deaths associated with termination of pregnancy were reported out of approximately 590,000 abortions performed. This works out at a rate of approximately five deaths per million abortions, compared with 53 deaths per million births.</p>

  <p>The current prescription charge exemption arrangements are designed to protect those who are most likely to have difficulty paying charges.</p>

  <p>A person can be exempt from payment of NHS prescription charges on grounds of age, receipt of certain passporting benefits e.g., income support, or because they suffer from one of the chronic medical conditions which confer exemption.</p>

  <p>In addition, people who are not exempt but have a low income may be able to get help with charges under the NHS Low Income Scheme.</p>

  <p>Prescription pre-payment certificates can offer savings for people who do not qualify for free NHS prescriptions if the patient needs more than five items in a four month period, and if patient needs more than 14 items in 12 month period.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the average waiting times for hernia operations have been in each year since 1999, broken down by NHS board area.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-09-26.33.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80057" speakername="Mr Andy Kerr" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa0926.htm#16">

  <p>The majority of patients who require in-patient and day case treatment, including hernia operations, are treated quickly. Nearly 55% of patients treated in NHSScotland hospitals receive immediate treatment and never join a waiting list. Of those who do wait, 41% are admitted within one month and almost 70% within three months.</p>

  <p>For those who wait longer, the current national maximum waiting time is nine months. This guaranteed waiting time will be reduced to six months from the end of 2005 and to 18 weeks from the end of 2007. On 30 June 2005, no NHSScotland patient with a guarantee had waited more than nine months for in-patient and day case treatment.</p>

  <p>The deferred waiting list was abolished on 1 April 2003. Prior to that date patients admitted for treatment from the deferred list were excluded from any analysis of published retrospective waiting time data. Consequently, as the data prior to 1 April would not be directly comparable with later years, information has only been provided for 2003-04 and 2004-05. Median waiting times are derived from information on patients treated during the year and includes patients who will have had an Availability Status Code (ASC) applied, for example because they were medically unfit or asked for their admission to be deferred for personal reasons. The table shows the median waiting time for a hernia operation for the years 2003-04 and 2004-05 by NHS board of residence.</p>

  <p>At the end of August 2005 NHS Scotland had matched 45% of its staff to national job profiles. While progress has been steady, NHS Scotland acknowledge that, in common with the other UK Health Services, not all staff will be assimilated to new pay bands by the original UK target date of end September.</p>

  <p>Partnership discussions have taken place with a view to establishing a framework which will achieve assimilation of staff to new Agenda for Change pay bands as soon as possible, while retaining the quality assurance and consistency checking which is carried out at local and national levels. In this respect, the Scottish Executive Health Department has asked all health boards to submit tightly timetabled progress plans. Progress plans, both at health board level and across NHS Scotland, will be performance managed by the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Pay Reference and Implementation Group have made a number of recommendations to health boards with a view to improving progress towards implementation. These are:</p>

  <p>Concentrating efforts, in the first instance, on the large job families and those posts which will match straightforwardly;</p>

  <p>Developing a separate timetable for Special Health Boards, and</p>

  <p>Establishing regional or national job evaluation panels for common posts requiring local evaluation.</p>

  <p>An electronic tool which will assimilate staff to the new Agenda for Change pay bands has been designed, and will be rolled out to the service in the week commencing the 26 September.</p>

  <p>NHS Scotland remains committed to implementing Agenda for Change as quickly and effectively as possible, while ensuring that the process of implementation and its outcomes are fair, balanced and consistent.</p>

  <p>Agenda for Change represents a ground breaking package of pay reform for over 90% of NHS Scotland staff. Not only will it deliver equal pay for work of equal value for staff, but will also improve personal development though wider access to training and career progression opportunities.</p>

  <p>Agenda for Change is currently in its implementation phase, so it is as yet too early to establish what the full effects of implementation on patient services are. However, when it is fully embedded it is anticipated that the new system will support the delivery of improved and modernised services to patients, with higher quality care provided to more patients, more quickly.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has recently written to all health boards in NHS Scotland asking for the submission of delivery plans which outline how pay modernisation is being used and will be used to deliver benefits realisation. Health boards have been asked to submit their initial plans by 30 September 2005, with a further six months progress report to be submitted by 31 March 2006.</p>

  <p>Patients in Scotland who require medical attention or advice during the out-of-hours period first contact NHS 24. The out of hours period are those hours between 18:30 to 08:00 Monday to Thursday, and at the weekend 18:30 on Friday to 08:00 Monday and all day on those public holidays as agreed by each board.</p>

  <p>Depending on the clinical symptoms or condition described, NHS 24 will direct patients to the most appropriate out-of-hours service. In most cases where medical attention or advice is required out of hours, NHS 24 will advise attendance at a NHS Board Out-of-Hours (OoH) Centre within travelling distance to where the patient lives for further assessment and treatment.</p>

  <p>Where attendance at a NHS board OoH centre is appropriate, NHS 24 send details of the patient to the centre. The precise arrangements for how and when the patient will attend differ from board area to board area. In some centres, the patient can attend at any time; in others, the patient might be given an appointment, within a time period appropriate to their clinical priority, need and/or condition.</p>

  <p>Upon arrival at the NHS board OoH Centre, patients will be seen in turn or by appointment unless their clinical condition suggests a more urgent need when they will be seen as soon as is necessary.</p>

  <p>Therefore, patients attending NHS board OoH centres will have already been triaged through NHS 24. However, if the patient&rsquo;s clinical condition has changed by the time they arrive at the OoH Centre, staff will ensure they are seen as quickly as clinically necessary.</p>
