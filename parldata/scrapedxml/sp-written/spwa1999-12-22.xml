  <p>I have recently announced a review of the Careers Service.

  <p>To give young carers a statutory entitlement to a direct assessment of their care needs requires primary legislation. Under the Scottish Executive&#8217;s Strategy for Carers in Scotland, approved by Parliament on 24 November 1999, a Carers&#8217; Legislation Working Group will be set up by the end of this year and will consider and report on what legislative changes may be desirable. We plan to consult on legislative proposals later next year. In the interim, we have asked local authorities to respond sympathetically to requests for help from young carers and to assess their needs, not just in relation to the care they provide, but also their need for a healthy, carefree childhood, with proper access to education, leisure and social activities.</p>

  <p>The total formula allocation, introduced with effect from 1997-98, is issued as an unhypothecated single figure in respect of all local authority non-housing capital programmes.</p>

  <p>From 1999-2000 the total is adjusted to take into account receipts raised by every council in the country and allocations are issued on a gross basis. It is, therefore, not possible to identify separately an amount attributable to any element of the formula. The new approach means that I was able to announce on 19 November a 7.5% increase in Argyll and Bute&#8217;s gross formula allocation for 2000-01. The Council will decide on its priorities for spending its allocation.</p>

  <p>Scallop white meat may be sold separately provided that it meets all the requirements of the Shellfish Hygiene Regulations which include the upper limit for amnesic shellfish poisoning defined by Council Directive 97/61.</p>

  <p>However no flesh from scallops may be sold from an area which has been closed to scallop fishing by a Food and Environment Protection Act 1985 (FEPA) Order due to the detection of algal toxin levels above the statutory limit as no part of a scallop can be harvested from such an area.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has made no prediction of business failures in the scallop industry as a result of the ASP ban. We have received information from individual businesses on levels of loss and we have been in contact with Highlands and Islands Enterprise for information from their two investigations into the impact of the closures. However, without the ability to forecast the likely duration of closures through differing levels of toxin by area and the re-opening of areas on an individual basis, and without detailed knowledge of the finances of individual businesses, it is impossible to predict with any authority, the effect of the ban on them.</p>

  <p>Treatment and rehabilitation needs vary greatly and our strategy is to ensure that a range of services is provided. The planning and provision of these services are the responsibility of local statutory and non-statutory agencies. Local Alcohol Misuse Co-ordinating Committees (AMCCs) and Drug Action Teams (DATs), who are best placed to assess local needs have a key role to play in ensuring a strategic and co-ordinated approach for their areas.</p>

  <p>The drugs strategy <i>Tackling Drugs in Scotland: Action in Partnership</i> sets out a comprehensive programme of action in the form of objectives and action priorities. Treatment is one of the four strategic aims of the strategy. Specific action priorities include the provision of shared care arrangements and integrated drug misuse services; improvements in service provision for young people, particularly the under-16s; and the provision of measures to prevent the spread of blood borne viruses.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Advisory Committee on Alcohol Misuse established in April 1999 to develop a national strategy for tackling alcohol misuse in Scotland will be advising on the development of further guidance on effective local strategies within the context of national strategic objectives and priorities.</p>

Following wide-ranging consultations, the Review makes a number of recommendations intended to result in a robust, well-supported public health function, able to secure and sustain health improvement and lead a co-ordinated effort to tackle the underlying cause of poor health and disease.
