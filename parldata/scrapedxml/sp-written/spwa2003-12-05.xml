  <p>Ministers regularly review the Care Commission&#8217;s performance against the targets in its corporate plan, in accordance with its management statement and financial memorandum. That document also requires the Health Department to conduct a financial management and policy review of the Care Commission at least every five years or at such other intervals as the department may determine. The commission was established in April 2002, and so the first review is due in 2007. The initial stages of the review will focus on the continuing need for the organisation, its constitution, organisation and delivery of its functions and whether they are being delivered and financed in the most effective manner.</p>

  <p>In my statement to Parliament on 24 September I made a commitment that a draft bill to reform charity regulation in Scotland would be prepared for consultation in spring next year. I also emphasised the Executive&#8217;s commitment to involving the full range of charity and voluntary sector interests during the preparation of the bill as well as during the formal consultation once the draft is published.</p>

  <p>A strategy for this process of engagement has now been set out, involving the establishment of a reference group, a series of specialist meetings with key stakeholders and experts, and wider information-sharing activities. Copies of the consultation strategy have been placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 30103) and an electronic version will be made available on the Executive&#8217;s website.</p>

  <p>The bill reference group met for the first time on 25 November, and further meetings are scheduled before Christmas and early in the new year. It is chaired by officials, with a remit to assist the Executive to develop effective, coherent and proportionate proposals in the draft bill.</p>

  <p>Additionally, a wide range of stakeholders will be engaged on specific issues during the process of preparing the draft legislation.</p>

  <p>Our policy has been to use recovered criminal assets to support the treatment of homeless drug misusers, and to help families affected by the hardship that drugs bring. However, the First Minister announced on 21 November that future awards would be used to support communities which bear the brunt of the crime and deprivation associated with the drugs trade.</p>

  <p>We operate a &quot;rolling&quot; programme which allows for resources recovered in one financial year to be used for good causes in the following financial year. Proposals for making use of these resources to assist disadvantaged communities, based on actual sums recovered in 2002-03, will be set out early next year. We estimate that around &#163;440,000 will be available.</p>

  <p>This is a commercial matter for broadband providers. We understand there may be commercial scope for broadband services in parts of Arran dependant on sufficient levels of demand.</p>

  <p>The Executive is, of course, pursuing a number of demand-stimulation measures across Scotland, under our broadband strategy. These include our current technology and supplier-neutral marketing campaign, which is promoting demand for broadband and thereby stimulating its provision.</p>

  <p>In addition, Highlands and Islands Enterprise are trialling alternative broadband technologies such as wireless, as well as piloting a community-based broadband scheme. These measures will develop the potential of these delivery mechanisms for taking broadband to areas unlikely to be served by the market.</p>

  <p>Enterprise Networks are responsible for supporting cluster development and details of support are an operational matter for the networks. The information requested is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>However, Forestry Commission Scotland also contributes to many of the Scottish forest industries cluster's initiatives such as events, publications, conferences and working groups such as the timber transport forum. In addition, Forestry Commission Scotland currently has a project officer on secondment in Scottish Development International within the Enterprise Transport and Lifelong Learning Department. This officer assists colleagues in Scottish Enterprise in supporting the forest industries cluster. The initiative fosters good relations and a wider understanding between the two organisations and is also a staff development opportunity. The secondment exercise has been running for just over four years and the total annual pay bill for the officer is &#163;45,000.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not centrally available. Autism or Asperger&#8217;s syndrome will often be the underlying condition and patients records may not explicitly refer to this. Information about face-to-face consultations between GPs and patients is gathered centrally as part of continuous morbidity recording (CMR) in general practice. The number of patients diagnosed with autism or Asperger&#8217;s syndrome and recorded as part of CMR is very low and will not reflect the true prevalence in the Scottish population. Further information can be obtained on www.isdscotland.org.</p>

  <p>To enable effective, innovative treatments to move smoothly into mainstream use across NHS Scotland, the Scottish Medicines Consortium is developing a &quot;horizon scanning process&quot; to allow it to identify its likely future workload, ideally 12 months in advance. This &quot;forward look&quot; will allow a national implementation plan to be agreed for effective, innovative drugs.</p>

  <p>NHS board general revenue allocations already include provision for the cost of prescribed drugs and are set to allow for the introduction of new drugs and the greater use of existing therapies. The new national planning arrangements will improve the effectiveness of this process.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-3551 by Mr Tom McCabe on 17 November 2003, how many letters about the proposed West of Scotland Secure Care Centre it has received; where such letters were sent from; what the key points raised in the letters were, and what action it will take in relation to the location of the new centre.</p>

  <p>As of Tuesday 25 November, the Health Department had received a total of 159 letters about the proposed West of Scotland Secure Care Centre. One hundred and twelve letters had been received from the Paisley area and 47 from locations in Lanarkshire. The letters raised a number of points including the perceived shortcomings of the site selection and public consultation processes.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s policy is clear in relation to medium secure units. We expect NHS boards to work together, as with the four relevant NHS boards in the case of the proposed West of Scotland Secure Care Centre, to deliver medium secure units providing safe, secure and effective services to residents of these areas.</p>

  <p>In consulting on the proposals, NHS boards are required to follow the guidance provided by the department on involving the public in services changes. This expects boards to inform, engage and consult the public in the relevant areas, and then to feed back the results of the consultation including reasons for the eventual decision and explanations of how the public&#8217;s views were taken into account. The four relevant boards have been following this guidance.</p>

  <p>As to the final decision on a site, as with decisions already made in Lothian and Glasgow on medium secure units, this is a matter for the NHS boards themselves provided they adhere to the Executive&#8217;s policies and guidelines. I have been assured by Professor George Irving, the Chair of the West of Scotland Secure Care Centre steering group, that a careful and thorough process is being followed and that all available information is being considered as they move towards a decision.</p>

  <p>When the Care Commission was established, resources were left with local authorities to allow them to pay for residual work and accommodation related to their previous regulatory role, and to meet the cost of paying registration fees for their own service provision. The Executive does not hold information on the use of these resources by authorities. The resources were included in the total distributed to authorities through grant aided expenditure. It is for individual local authorities to decide how to use the resources available to them.

  <p>The management of the relocation of its headquarters staff to Inverness is an operational matter for SNH. However, the Executive strongly supports SNH management in their aim to encourage as many staff as possible to move to Inverness. SNH have indicated that they also intend to provide staff who do not wish to move, with information and assistance to help them find suitable alternative employment.</p>

  <p>There are currently 66 applications awaiting Disclosure Scotland certificates. It takes an average of 21.6 working days for the return of a Disclosure Scotland certificate. This is an average figure based on the applications processed during September. Some were processed in less than 20 days and some took up to 58 days. Delays in processing are usually caused by the applicant having a previous address outside Scotland or Disclosure Scotland carrying out a secondary search on the applicant. They have recently recruited more staff and expect a swifter turnaround period in the near future.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Social Services Council take, on average, 24.4 working days to process an application. This includes the Disclosure Scotland check time.</p>

  <p>At present, there are two stages to the research process in support of the Choose Life Strategy and Action Plan. The first of these &#8211; a scoping exercise &#8211; is being commissioned in January 2004. The overall aim of this scoping exercise is to collect and co-ordinate information about the interests and areas of expertise of organisations and individuals specialising in suicide-related research across the UK and beyond and to establish the focus for the next stage.</p>

  <p>The second stage, commencing between the end of spring and the beginning of summer 2004, involves the commissioning of a series of reviews related to the objectives and priorities of the Choose Life Strategy. This will establish a systematic approach to understanding the extent and nature of the existing evidence base relating to suicide prevalence, risk and protective factors. This work is being undertaken in 2004-05. Once completed, we will be in a position to better identify gaps and to set about commissioning further research to meet Scottish needs.</p>

  <p>The Waste Incineration (Scotland) Regulations 2003 were made to fulfil the Executive&#8217;s obligations under the European Directive on the incineration of waste (EC 2000-76-EC). The directive defines incineration plant as a stationary or mobile technical unit and equipment dedicated to the thermal treatment of wastes. The directive has no <em>de minimis</em> threshold. The Executive believes that any piece of equipment, such as a small waste oil burner, that has been specifically designed or adapted for combustion of materials falls within the meaning of technical unit and, therefore, within the scope of the Waste Incineration Directive.</p>

  <p>The Waste Incineration (Scotland) Regulations 2003 apply only to industrial or commercial premises. Domestic waste oil burners are, consequently, outside the scope of the regulations.</p>

  <p>The Executive does not believe that small commercial waste oil burners help prevent localised pollution. These units, which are generally of very simple design and have no pollution abatement equipment fitted, have the potential to cause localised air pollution.</p>

  <p>The decision on whether it would be cost-prohibitive to upgrade small waste oil burners to meet the requirements of the Waste Incineration (Scotland) Regulations 2003 is a commercial matter for individual operators. It is expected that many small burners will close once the transitional period for existing units runs out at the end of 2005.

  <p>Operators are under a duty of care to ensure that they dispose of waste oil without harming the environment. The Executive does not anticipate an increase in localised pollution unless anyone was to dispose of the waste oil illegally. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency has powers to take enforcement action in such circumstances.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive why the Waste Incineration (Scotland) Regulations 2003 do not recognise the role of small generators and processors of waste oil in preventing localised pollution whilst the equivalent regulations proposed by Her Majesty&#8217;s Government do.</p>

  <p>The provisions in the Waste Incineration (Scotland) Regulations 2003 relating to small waste oil burners are the same as the equivalent provisions in the Waste Incineration Regulations for England and Wales.

  <p>The Waste Incineration (Scotland) Regulations 2003 bring the burning of waste oils on commercial premises into a new control regime. These regulations supersede any earlier guidance. The existing 2001 guidance from the Department of Trade and Industry warns that burning waste oil is being discouraged as a result of provisions of the Waste Incineration Directive.</p>
