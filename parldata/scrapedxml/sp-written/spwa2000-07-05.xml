  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it sought derogation from European Commission Directives regarding state aid to Caledonian MacBrayne&#8217;s operation of ferry services and, if it did not, why it did not seek a delay such as that granted to the Greek Government for services to their island communities.</p>

  <p>The information requested cannot be provided at local authority level.</p>

  <p>Information currently available on household income is drawn from the Households Below Average Income dataset and the Family Resources Survey which do not have sufficient sample size for Scotland to produce the required level of detail.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Household Survey will provide information on household income by local authority area after the first full sweep of the survey (i.e. after two years) &#8211; the results of which are not likely to be made available until summer 2001.</p>

  <p>Work is also underway to investigate new methodologies and to consider boosting existing samples to give better coverage for Scotland.</p>

  <p>At the Scotland level, the proportion of children in households with below 60% GB median income in 1997-98 was 30% (340,000 children). This represents a drop from a figure of 34% in 1996-97.</p>

  <p>As stated in the Editors Notes section of the press release issued with the Locate in Scotland Annual Review:</p>

  <p>&quot;The figures for inward investment in Scotland &#8211; both from overseas and from the rest of the United Kingdom &#8211; have been collated in accordance with strictly defined criteria, and relate only to projects handled by Locate in Scotland and the Scottish Executive Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Department&#8217;s Investment Assistance Division. There will of course have been other inward investments during the year in which neither LiS nor the Scottish Executive was directly involved.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that the planned investment and jobs figures are those provided by the companies concerned at the time of the investment decision. A significant number of additional jobs are also created indirectly in the local economy. All project figures reported in this review are based on company announcements during the year. Projects can be deferred or even cancelled because of adverse trading conditions. In the past, we have suggested a rule of thumb that around two-thirds of all announced jobs actually come to fruition. At the request of the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs, a detailed analysis was undertaken on projects announced between April 1991 and March 1998. This showed the outturn figure to be rather higher, at 73%. The success of many of the past inward investments into Scotland is further evidenced by the fact that as much as half of our cases in recent years involved expansion and up-grading projects by existing investors&quot;.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to advise that I have met personally with a number of these investing companies since their original project announcement. Most are on, or indeed ahead of, target in the implementation of their project. Others have found their initial experience in Scotland so positive that they are already discussing with my officials, the possibility of expanding their project beyond the scale originally envisaged.</p>

  <p>Expenditure financed from European Structural Funds is not allocated to Glasgow, Dundee and Aberdeen. Nor is it possible to identify actual expenditure in those cities, partly because individual projects financed from European Structural Funds may be designed to benefit wider geographical areas than the cities. Glasgow and Dundee were included in Objective 2 Programmes for the period from 1997 to 1999 whereas Aberdeen was not an eligible area for geographically targeted Structural Fund Programmes during that period. Information systems are being put in place for the new structural fund programmes which will enable a greater degree of geographical analysis of programme expenditure but, due to the nature of the expenditure, it will remain difficult to generate consistent and meaningful analyses.</p>

  <p>I will be laying regulations later this week which will require the introduction of square mesh panels into the nets of Scottish fishing vessels. These panels will allow juvenile fish to escape, thus reducing discarding of undersized fish. This is one measure in a package that we are introducing aimed at rebuilding vulnerable fish stocks.</p>

  <p>Many Scottish fishermen fish in Norwegian waters. However, under current regulations, the use of these square mesh panels would not be permitted in the Norwegian zone. My officials and I have therefore been in close contact with our counterparts in Norway. I am happy to report that we have been able to agree that Scottish vessels with these nets will be able to fish in Norwegian waters this year.</p>

  <p>We will review the effectiveness of the square mesh panels later this year and we shall keep under review the scope for further conservation measures.</p>

  <p>Similar regulations are being made for the rest of the UK by the other Fisheries Departments.</p>

  <p>Yes. The Yellow Card Scheme underpins drug safety monitoring in the UK.

  <p>Under the chronic disease management programmes, payments are made automatically to GPs for providing agreed programmes covering asthma and diabetes. Accordingly, the system is demand led and health boards are not subject to cash limited allocations for this work. Provisional figures for the 1999-2000 financial year show that &pound;2,975,000 was paid to GPs for providing such services.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-07-05.22.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80131" speakername="Ms Wendy Alexander" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa0705.htm#c13">

  <p>I am publishing today our detailed proposals for the Housing Bill. The publication of this consultation paper, <i>Better Homes for Scotland&#8217;s Communities</i> , is the next stage in the process of preparing the Housing Bill. It builds on the responses from a large number of organisations and individuals to the Green Paper published in February last year, on the responses to the other discussion papers on specific issues which we issued last December, and on the regular discussions we have had with a wide range of housing interest groups over the past few months. The closing date for the consultation is 29 September 2000.</p>

  <p>Good housing provided well is crucial in nurturing the strong and just communities within which individuals can flourish. Our aim is for a range of good quality, secure housing options to be available in every community and the legislative proposals set out in the consultation paper are directed towards achieving this goal.</p>

  <p>The Bill will lay the framework for the extension of community ownership in Scotland. It will bring together the fragmented systems of the past by introducing a new single tenancy, single local housing plans, a single regulatory framework, and strategic local housing budgets. Our aim is to guarantee the highest standards all round.</p>

  <p>We propose to introduce a new single tenancy which will be available to tenants of all social landlords. This new tenancy will build on the provisions of the existing secure tenancy to produce the best ever package of tenants rights. As part of the new single tenancy we are modernising the right to buy, giving new powers to landlords to tackle anti-social tenants, and providing tenants with new rights of succession and consultation, to achieve a better balance between the interests of individuals, landlords and communities.</p>

  <p>We intend to establish a new single framework of regulation for all social landlords, including local authorities, which will promote consistently high standards of housing management across the sector. The new regulatory framework will be overseen by a new executive agency of the Scottish Executive, building on the skills and experience of Scottish Homes in this area.</p>

  <p>The new agency will also become responsible for regulating the way in which local authorities undertake their duties in relation to homelessness. The Homelessness Task Force has made detailed recommendations for items to be included in the Housing Bill, and the consultation document sets out our proposals for taking these forward, including provisions to strengthen local authorities&#8217; duties towards homeless people; to create new rights for homeless people and improve existing rights, and to create new responsibilities for both registered social landlords and local authorities for housing homeless people.</p>

  <p>The consultation document also re-emphasises our belief that local authorities should continue to develop their strategic and enabling role in relation to housing requirements in their areas. We are therefore proposing to make them responsible for producing regular strategic housing plans which are responsive to local needs and opportunities, and to give them an increased say in the funding of housing development in their areas where they have transferred their own stock into community ownership, or where there are appropriate checks and balances in place and there is general agreement locally and on the part of registered social landlords and funders.</p>

  <p>These changes will be complemented by changes to Scottish Homes. We propose that the new executive agency will take on the current functions and powers of Scottish Homes, which will cease to exist in its current form. The agency will be responsible to Ministers for development funding until local authorities take over this responsibility, for monitoring the use of development funding once this responsibility has moved to local authorities and for monitoring local authorities local housing plans. In addition, the agency will continue to play a vital role in taking forward the Executive&#8217;s policies and programmes at the national, regional and community levels, by developing innovative housing solutions and promoting community regeneration.</p>

  <p>The consultation document details our proposals for modernising the funding arrangements for improvement and repair grants in order to better help those most in need. More generally, funding sources for the most vulnerable people in our society will be brought together to facilitate the development of an integrated policy as part of the UK-wide Supporting People project.</p>

  <p>Alongside other policies and programmes which we are taking forward without the need for new legislation, our proposals for the Housing Bill are a key part of our integrated approach to meeting the housing and community needs of Scotland. Taken together, these changes to the way in which housing provision is planned, funded and regulated in Scotland will provide a firm foundation for the radical improvement in the quality of housing which is our aim.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will be possible for local authorities to implement the McCrone recommendations if it does not meet the costs centrally and, if so, why its assessment differs from that of CoSLA.</p>

  <p>Full consideration is being given to the recommendations. When I established the committee I indicated that I would undertake consultation with the relevant parties before decisions were made on implementation. Funding decisions will be based on the outcome of implementation discussions.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive <a name="QuestionText">whether it intends to make representations to Her Majesty&#8217;s Government to ensure that fines raised from motoring offences committed within each local authority area are retained by that local authority to help finance and develop the local transport network.</a></p>

  <p>Road traffic matters and related statutory offences are reserved under the Scotland Act 1998. Fines imposed for road traffic offences are therefore remitted to the Consolidated Fund. When offences are decriminalised and fines are replaced with penalty changes (as has happened recently with parking offences in Edinburgh and Glasgow) the local authority may keep the income to maintain the relevant enforcement system and to improve parking facilities and also, if resources are still available, for transport matters generally. The Scottish Executive has no plans to make representations to the Government on this issue.</p>
