  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s Curriculum for Excellence focuses on citizenship and values which supports and encourages teaching about international education and international development. Fair trade falls within this by teaching the benefits of helping producers of goods in developing countries.</p>

  <p>The responsibility for the management and delivery of the Scottish curriculum including learning and teaching about international development education lies with education authorities. The concordat with COSLA, however includes, as a national outcome, the four aspirations of Curriculum for Excellence: that our young people are successful learners, confident individuals, effective contributors and responsible citizens. The aim of the Curriculum for Excellence is to prepare young people with a range of knowledge and skills with which to engage in today&rsquo;s increasingly multicultural and globalised society, to ensure that young people develop respect for the environment, different cultures and traditions, attitudes and in so doing, become more tolerant and understanding individuals. Learning Teaching Scotland&rsquo;s website provides information on fair trade and creative learning and teaching ideas for schools <a href="http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/citizenship/index.asp" target="_blank">http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/citizenship/index.asp</a>.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government also provides core funding of &pound;60,000 a year for three years to the Scottish Fair Trade Forum to raise awareness of fair trade across the country, including within local authorities and schools. In addition, my colleague, the Minister for Europe, External Affairs and Culture, visited a number of primary schools during Fairtrade Fortnight earlier this year to hear about their fair trade activities, to encourage them to keep up the good work and set an example for other schools to follow.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for the implementation of Community Planning sits with partnerships at community level.</p>

  <p>The Joint Improvement Team based in the Primary and Community Care Directorate of the Scottish Government supports joint working at a local level between NHS boards, local authorities and a range of other stakeholders. In July 2008 it published a National Outcomes Framework for Community Care which supports Partnerships in assessing the progress made in improving health, well-being, social inclusion, independence and responsibility. In June 2007, the Joint Improvement Team published &quot;Capacity to Change &ndash; Commissioning Effective Services for Older People&quot; a work book designed to assist local authority and health partners in capacity planning and inform local commissioning plans. A second work book, &quot;Capacity to Change &ndash; Commissioning Service Changes for People with Learning Disabilities&quot; was produced in May 2008.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-15577 by Nicola Sturgeon on 5 September 2008, how the &pound;54 million over three years to tackle all healthcare associated infection (HAI) will be allocated, broken down by (a) NHS board and (b) initiative.</p>

  <p>The &pound;54 million set aside for HAI over the next three years is not allocated in this way. Funding supports the work of the Scottish Government, NHS boards and stakeholders such as Health Protection Scotland (HPS), Health Facilities Scotland (HFS), NHS Education for Scotland (NES) and NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS). The funding allocated to stakeholders is for the benefit of all NHS health boards across Scotland in tackling key areas of HAI and introducing best practices and methods. This work is being led by the multi agency HAI Task Force.</p>

  <p>In addition, dedicated resources have been allocated to NHS boards for a range of initiatives including MRSA screening, implementation of care bundles and hand hygiene campaign and to support the employment of infection control managers, local hand hygiene co-ordinators and antimicrobial pharmacists. The initiatives are outlined in the three year HAI Delivery Plan introduced in April 2008. The delivery plan can be viewed on the Scottish Government website at:</p>

  <p>In response to the recent independent review of the Vale of Leven Hospital, the HAI Task Force is also taking charge of the work in the new HAI National Action Plan for all NHS boards (all areas to be completed by March 2009). The action plan can also be viewed on the Scottish Government website at:</p>

  <p>The source of Scottish Government reconviction rate statistics is the Scottish Offenders Index (SOI), a database of convictions in Scottish courts. The SOI is based on extracts from the Criminal History System (CHS) held at the Scottish Police Service Authority (SPSA). Details of which prison an offender is sent to, having been sentenced to a custodial sentence, is not recorded on the SOI.</p>

  <p>Reconviction rates by individual prison would not necessarily be meaningful, as prisoners can be moved mid-sentence and therefore serve their sentence in more than one prison. In addition, prisoners can be transferred to another prison prior to liberation.</p>

  <p>The funding arrangements for NHS boards regarding the proposed transfer of primary health care services from Scottish Prison Services (SPS) to the NHS is still to be determined.</p>

  <p>In recognition of the significant scope of the work involved in the transfer of these services, a National Programme Board for Prisoners&rsquo; Healthcare is currently being set up. A key focus of the National Programme Board will be to oversee preparatory work in the area of finance and funding.</p>

  <p>No specific funding is provided to NHS boards for specialist medical services for prisoners. All NHS boards receive an annual allocation of funds. It is for each NHS board to decide how best to utilise these funds to meet the health care needs of its resident population, including those in prison, taking account of national and local priorities.</p>

  <p>The National Conversation has stimulated debate about Scotland&rsquo;s constitutional future across the country. The Scottish Government does not hold information about the numbers attending events organised by others such as the universities or the media.</p>

  <p>Where information is held about the numbers attending events directly organised by or involving the Scottish Government, it is shown in the following table. The number of civil servants and special advisers attending each event varied but was the minimum considered necessary to provide effective support for ministers.</p>

  <p>In the first half of December. NFU Scotland and the Scottish Agricultural College have agreed to conduct test runs with selected farmers before the revised guidance is published. It is planned that the guidance will be put on the Scottish Government website in early November and that copies of the guidance will be sent to all farmers in the nitrate vulnerable zones in early December. In addition, the Scottish Agricultural College will conduct a number of workshops to explain the new rules and procedures.</p>

  <p>Several actions are being taken to assist farmers who may be affected by the revised Nitrate Vulnerable Zone Action Programme. In particular, they may be eligible for funding from the Scotland Rural Development Programme towards the costs of manure and slurry storage. We will be issuing guidance on the new requirements, and the Scottish Agricultural College is preparing a series of workshops. We have established the Nitrates Directive Stakeholder Group to identify ways in which farmers can most effectively make the transition from the current to the new action programme requirements. This will reduce the risk of fertiliser pollution in Scotland, and help farmers get more value from both organic and inorganic fertilisers.</p>

  <p>There are no current plans to eliminate paper prescriptions. The paper prescription services a number of purposes in addition to acting as an order for medicines, and it is the paper prescription that triggers the electronic transmission of the prescription information to the pharmacy. Only when these other functions are available through an electronic medium could paper prescriptions be eliminated.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-16220 on 22 September 2008 which explains, paper cannot be eliminated completely from the prescriptions process in Scotland at this stage. While the electronic transmission of prescriptions brings a range of benefits we do not expect, overall, to see a substantial financial saving.</p>

  <p>The abolition of prescription charges will not substantively affect the Minor Ailment Service (MAS). In April 2011 when the charge is reduced to zero we intend to redefine the eligibility criteria for MAS to ensure that the patient groups that currently qualify i.e. children, the elderly and those currently exempt on low income grounds continue to do so.</p>
