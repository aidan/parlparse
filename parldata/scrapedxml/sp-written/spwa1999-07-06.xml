  <p>As I indicated in my statement on 9 June, legislation about devolved subjects in Scotland will normally be enacted by the Scottish Parliament. From time to time, however, it may be appropriate for an Act of the United Kingdom Parliament to include provisions about such matters. That is the case, for example, for the Food Standards Bill. I also indicated that both the Scottish Executive and the United Kingdom Government intend that, by convention, the United Kingdom Parliament will not legislate about devolved matters without the consent of the Scottish Parliament.</p>

  <p>The Healthy Homes Initiative aims to tackle damp housing in Scotland. In particular, we have introduced the new Warm Deal from 1 July, under which low income households will benefit from a &pound;500 grant for a package of works to improve home energy efficiency which in turn will reduce condensation damp. The &pound;12 million budget will ensure that each year 24,000 households, in Springburn and across Scotland, will have lower fuel bills or more warmth at the same cost.</p>

  <p>Practice and policy in relation to the disclosure and discussion of reasons by the Crown for not proceeding against an accused is a matter for the Lord Advocate. In general terms, the Crown's reasons for not proceeding are confidential and will not be divulged to any third party. There may, however, be limited circumstances where a form of restricted disclosure to certain persons is acceptable or necessary because of the circumstances of the particular case or due to the nature of the offence. In light of the incorporation into domestic law of the European Convention on Human Rights by the Scotland Act 1998, this policy has been reviewed and is to remain unchanged.</p>

  <p>Since 1971, the Scottish Office has made grants available to enable local authorities to provide official sites for Travelling People. Councils, including Edinburgh, were advised early in 1997 that the grant scheme was being wound up, having been successful in providing over 30 local authority sites throughout Scotland. Councils had until the end of 1998 to apply for grant. Information on the number of privately owned and unauthorised sites is available from a twice-yearly count. Reference copies of &quot;Travelling People in Scotland: Report on Seasonal Count&quot;, July 1998 and January 1999 have been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre.</p>
