  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has concerns about any confusion that may arise for Scottish donors to English-based charities which use the term &quot;UK&quot; to describe themselves despite having no base in Scotland or locus in Scotland and, if so, what discussions it has had with HM Treasury about this matter.</p>

  <p>The Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005 addresses this issue.</p>

  <p>If the body is registered as a charity in Scotland and entered on the Scottish Charity Register the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator is able to require it to change its name under section 10 of the act if the name is felt to be misleading to the public as to the true nature of the purposes or activities of the body.</p>

  <p>If the body is not registered as a charity in Scotland, but recognised as a charity under another jurisdiction, such as the Charity Commission for England and Wales, it is required to state that it is a charity registered elsewhere under section 14 of the act. Therefore, an English based charity which fundraises in Scotland is required to state that it is a charity registered in England and Wales and is unable to refer to itself as a Scottish charity.</p>

  <p>The Executive currently has no plans to recruit dentists specifically from Canada.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for recruitment of dentists is a matter for NHS boards and independent dental practitioners who own dental practices. As a non-European Union country, recruits from Canada would be regarded as international applicants. A code of practice for international recruitment of healthcare professionals was published on 30 March 2006. This sets out the principles for recruiting from overseas which all employers are expected to follow.</p>

  <p>The commitment of a dentist who works part of the week with NHS patients and part of the week in private practice will be measured in the same way as a dentist who works full-time in a mixed practice. A dentist whose income is overwhelmingly from part-time NHS work will be considered as committed to the NHS if he or she signs a declaration to that effect.</p>

  <p>Private sector employment is calculated as total employment minus public sector employment.

Data from the QPSES was used in the answer to question S2W-24660.</p>

  <p>Data referred to in written question&rsquo;s S2W-9099 and S2W-17703 were based on estimates of public and private sector employment taken from the Labour Force Survey (LFS). The LFS was used for written question S2W-9099 as the QPSES did not exist at the time this written question was answered and was used for written question S2W-17703 as an industry breakdown was requested which cannot be provided using the QPSES.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Football Partnership (SFP) is now operational with James Clydesdale having taken up post as Chairman on 21 February 2006. The majority of its funding is earmarked for the Youth Football Action Plan and some is set aside for the Community Youth Awards and a Club Licensing Scheme which are currently being developed. The SFP is also considering how best to use the remaining funds to make the biggest impact on football. The SFP is not accepting any applications until it has agreed its programmes and finalised current initiatives.</p>

  <p>The Fostering of Children (Scotland) Regulations 1996 prohibit a person to foster where there is in the household a person of the same sex other than a relative who will not be concerned with the care of the child. These regulations were designed to prevent the fostering of children by gay and lesbian couples.

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The main factor in determining the change in Private Sector Housing Grant (PSHG) to local authorities in 2006-07 is the reduction in the level of resources available for this purpose. Councils were informed that the level of resources available for PSHG in 2005-06 (and 2004-05) was exceptional resulting from underspends elsewhere.</p>

  <p>There have been no recent prevalence studies undertaken in the UK on elder abuse, although Age Concern Scotland estimate that between 7% and 9% of older people in Scotland are victims of at least one form of abuse, with over 40% of victims suffering more than one kind of abuse. Comic Relief is currently undertaking a UK-wide study which is due to report in 2007.</p>

  <p>The Executive recognises that elder abuse is a serious problem which can too often remain hidden and it is determined that the abuse of adults, whether at risk through ageing or disability, will not be tolerated. We continue to provide financial support to Age Concern Scotland&rsquo;s Elder Abuse project to assist its efforts to tackle abuse.</p>

  <p>In addition, on 30 March 2006, the Executive introduced the Adult Support and Protection (Scotland) Bill. The bill will put in place modern and strengthened measures to afford greater protection for those adults in Scotland who are at risk from abuse. It will improve and enhance protective measures for these adults and will also, in turn, improve inter-agency co-operation and enhance preventative action.</p>

  <p>A copy of the draft bill and the accompanying documents can be found on the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s website at <a href="../../../business/bills/62-adultSupport/index.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/bills/62-adultSupport/index.htm</a>.</p>

  <p>The BBC is a key actor in the delivery of public service broadcasting, which can play a significant role both in developing the creative industries and in supporting cultural activity. Although broadcasting is a reserved matter, the BBC is engaged in a regular dialogue with the Executive, Scottish Screen and the Scottish Arts Council. The Scottish Arts Council has recently met with the BBC to explore ways in which BBC Scotland might be able to work more closely with arts organisations in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Building on the experience of Scottish Screen and the Scottish Arts Council hitherto, I shall expect Creative Scotland to work with the BBC and other broadcasters in pursuit of their shared objectives. It will be for the organisations concerned to consider whether a formal Memorandum of Understanding would be helpful in setting a framework for their future collaboration.</p>

  <p>This network of VisitScotland offices represents the organisation, in all the activities it provides, at a local level. These offices work towards achieving tourism objectives at that level, while ensuring that this work is linked to the vision and strategies for tourism at a national level. This is achieved through the development of strong partnerships with local businesses, local authorities, and local enterprise companies. In addition, the 122 tourist information offices are managed by the VisitScotland network offices.</p>

  <p>In addition, VisitScotland also operates a visitor centre and office in London, which provides an information and booking service for accommodation and tours in Scotland. The London office also plays an important part in VisitScotland&rsquo;s marketing, business tourism and public relations activities. It maintains close links with other public sector partners as well as being the main point of contact for VisitBritain and the Department of Culture, Media and Sport.</p>

  <p>The Medical Research Council is an independent funding body, the responsibility for which is reserved to Westminster. For these reasons, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the research they decide to fund. Many medical and other researchers have links to industry which wants to make use of their expertise. This has to be managed to ensure the quality and objectivity of the research undertaken, through the process of independent peer review.</p>

  <p>In relation to the specific study in question, it should be noted that the results are consistent with a number of other studies using different approaches and datasets which have similarly concluded that MMR immunisation is not linked to the development of Autism Spectrum Disorders.</p>
