  <p>Scottish ministers meet regularly with Home Office ministers and have discussed matters relating to Dungavel, including the provision of education. Since the publication of the HM Chief Inspector of Prisons and HM Inspectorate of Education reports, discussions have focused on how their recommendations can be taken forward, particularly in relation to children who may exceptionally be in Dungavel for more than six weeks. Discussions between the Scottish Executive and South Lanarkshire Council have focused on the support offered by the council to the contractors at Dungavel.</p>

  <p>In January 2002, the Scottish Executive offered a severance payment or continued employment with the Care Commission to all employees of local authority and health board registration and inspection units (R&amp;I) who met the following criteria:</p>

  <p>1. Any employee who spent 50% or more of their time on registration and inspection duties.</p>

  <p>2. Any employee on a temporary contract or secondment to an R&amp;I unit, even if their contract or secondment expired on 31 March 2002, provided they spent 50% or more of their time on R&amp;I duties.</p>

  <p>3. Any employee on secondment from an R&amp;I unit, provided they were spending 50% or more of their time on R&amp;I duties before their secondment.</p>

  <p>4. Any employee who fell below the 50% criteria before 1 April 2002 as a result of being transferred to other duties, provided they spent 50% or more of their time on R&amp;I duties on or after 31 March 2000.</p>

  <p>No staff who joined the commission, as distinct from being transferred into it, were eligible for the severance scheme.</p>

  <p>The offer of a severance payment for those who chose not to transfer to or remain with the Care Commission was open until 30 September 2002. Severance payments consisted of a one-off lump sum calculated on the basis of the number of years completed service and annual salary.</p>

  <p>Four hundred and forty-one local authority and health board staff fell within the criteria above. Twenty-two of them took up the offer of severance before the commission became operational on 1 April 2002. The remaining 419 were<strong><em></em></strong>listed in the Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care (Staff Transfer Scheme) Order 2002 as transferring to the commission. Three of these staff subsequently took up the severance offer before transferring, and 17 remained with their local authority or health board. Three hundred and ninety-nine staff transferred to the commission. One hundred and twenty of those staff took up the offer between 1 April 2002 and the cut-off date of 30 September 2002. By definition, all of those 120 staff had served with the commission itself for six months or less, although they of course had previous service with their local authority or health board. In total, 145 of the 441 eligible staff (33%) took up the offer of severance.</p>

  <p>The cost to the Executive of severance payments was &#163;3.5 million.</p>

  <p>The Executive has made no estimates of the impact of climate change on the Scottish economy. The Executive does, however, work in partnership with the UK Government to increase awareness and understanding of the challenges and opportunities presented by climate change. Arising from this collaboration, the UK Climate Impacts Programme is developing a tool to assist businesses and others to assess the costs of adaptation options. This tool is expected to be published early next year.</p>

  <p>Also, the UK Government commissioned a research study in 2000 into the cost of adapting to climate change in key sectors such as water resources and flooding. A summary of the study report produced by Environmental Resources Management Ltd can be found on the Executive&#39;s climate change website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/climatechange">www.scotland.gov.uk/climatechange</a>.</p>

  <p>The Executive acknowledges that the high cost of petrol and diesel fuel in rural areas is of considerable concern to many people. Fuel duty and how it is levied is a matter for the UK Government. However, since 1999 the Executive has provided more than &#163;32 million through its Rural Transport Fund to improve travel options for people in rural areas on projects such as new bus services and modernising petrol stations.</p>

  <p>The Department for Trade and Industry (DTI) has lead responsibility for all matters related to the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) on behalf of the UK, as the regulation of international trade is a reserved area. The DTI are in regular contact with colleagues within the devolved administrations on matters related to education as policy responsibility in that area is fully devolved. The UK has already taken GATS commitments in relation to private sector education services during the Uruguay round of negotiations. Those commitments do not apply to publicly funded education. The EC has not and does not intend to make any offer in the area of public sector education services. That position has been confirmed in a news release of 5 February 2003.

  <p>Compensation is not generally payable where persons have been acquitted at trial or subsequently on appeal within time simply because the prosecution was unable to sustain the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt in relation to the specific charge that was brought.</p>

  <p>Section 133 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 provides that Scottish ministers are required to pay compensation where a person has been convicted of a criminal offence and his conviction has subsequently been reversed or he has been pardoned, on the ground that a new, or newly discovered fact shows beyond reasonable doubt that there has been a miscarriage of justice (provided that the non-disclosure of the new evidence was not attributable to the applicant). Further, <em>ex gratia</em> payment may be made in certain circumstances to persons who have been held in custody following a wrongful conviction or charge where this has resulted from serious default on the part of a member of a police force or some other public authority and in exceptional circumstances in cases outside these categories.</p>
