  <p>The Scottish Government already has fully developed policies on flexible and home working for its staff. The extent to which flexible and home working can be encouraged in the public sector is dependent on the nature of individual posts.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government supports the expansion of flexible and homeworking policies across the public sector but believe that it is for individual organisations to decide upon the policy best suited to the needs of its staff and business environment, within the context of the existing legal framework.</p>

  <p>Scientific advice indicates that spurdog can be vulnerable to over exploitation and recommends that there should be no targeted fishing. Whilst current EU legislation prohibits such a fishery in the North Sea, the prohibition does not apply to the North East Atlantic area.

  <p>Officials are currently examining the Department of Trade and Industry&rsquo;s plans for the Post Office network to see where the Scottish Executive can add value. We will seek to do all we can within our devolved powers to secure the best possible outcome for Scotland.

  <p>The A82 Tarbet to Fort William Action Plan recommended a 10 year improvement programme at a cost of &pound;90 million. The outcome of this study will feed into the Strategic Transport Projects Review which will examine the needs of our national strategic transport corridors. This is due to report in summer 2008.</p>

  <p>Meantime, Transport Scotland is planning a &pound;16 million improvement package to be delivered over the next five years. This package includes improvements at Pulpit Rock between Tarbet and Ardlui, a Western Bypass at Crianlarich, additional road safety measures, new lay-bys and picnic sites.</p>

  <p>Road maintenance works have recently been completed on two sections of the A82 between Tarbet and Crianlarich in the vicinity of Pulpit Rock.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland has the operational responsibility for this area, and can be contacted for more information if required.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&rsquo;s general policy is that all customers, including charitable organisations and other organisations which serve a public function, should contribute to the cost of the water services that they use. Some of these organisations are currently exempt from paying water services charges under the water services charges exemption scheme.</p>

  <p>The Executive previously extended this scheme from 2006-10 to allow more time for these organisations to prepare to pay for their water services. It now intends to consult on its wider principles of charging (including its consideration of the exemption scheme) for 2010-14, which it expects to publish in the autumn.</p>
