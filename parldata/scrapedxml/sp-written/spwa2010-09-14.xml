  <p>The General Register Office for Scotland (GROS) publishes statistics of the numbers of probable suicides in Scotland. A suicide is a death which has been classified as either an event of intentional self-harm or an event of undetermined intent, and it is thought that most of the latter type are likely to be suicides. Further information about statistics of probable suicides is available on the GROS website <a href="http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/statistics/deaths/suicides/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/statistics/deaths/suicides/index.html</a> .</p>

  <p>The following table gives the numbers of probable suicides registered in each year where the occupation of the deceased was simply described on the death certificate as &quot;farmer&quot;.</p>

  <p>The latest school leaver destination statistics, published in June 2010, show that around 85% of young people who left school last year were in a positive destination nine months after leaving. This represents a small increase on the previous year and a positive performance in very challenging circumstances.</p>

  <p>The fact is that even although we have officially moved out of recession its effects are still being clearly felt on the labour market, with more limited job opportunities available to young people when they finish their courses. Nevertheless, 61.3% of Scotland&rsquo;s young people aged 18 to 24 are employed, higher than the UK average of 57.8% (LFS April to June 2010).</p>

  <p>Local authorities, Skills Development Scotland, further education colleges and their partners are on track to deliver 16+ learning choices to all young people from December 2010. We are confident that this, together with the raft of new opportunities we have put in place, more college and university places, more Modern Apprenticeships and training programmes, Activity Agreements and volunteering, will drive further improvements and help more to achieve a positive and sustained destination.</p>

  <p>Section 30 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 places a fundamental duty on the parent of every child of school age to provide education for them, either by their attendance at a public school or by other means.</p>

  <p>Section 35 of the same act requires parents to seek the consent of the local authority if they propose to withdraw a child from a local authority school and home educate them. Section 37 places a duty, this time on the local authority, to take action in respect of any child which is being home educated, where they are not satisfied that the parent is providing suitable education.</p>

  <p>Grant incentives for forestry planting for local wood burning are available through the Scotland Rural Development Programme (SRDP). These include the woodland creation option of rural priorities and the option for establishment of short rotation coppice crops of willow or poplar.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is encouraging a switch to wood burning technology, with the priority to encourage heat or combined heat power (CHP) plants sized appropriately for the local resource. In particular, it has offered capital grants for woodfuel heating systems under the Scottish Biomass Support Scheme, the subsequent Scottish Biomass Heat Scheme, the Community and Renewable Energy Scheme and the SRDP. Grants are still available under the SRDP and the recent energy statement by the UK Government indicated there would be ongoing support for renewable heat. We are working closely with the Department of Energy and Climate Change to expedite the proposed Renewable Heat Incentive, which would provide long-term support for wood burning technology.</p>

  <p>DWP have informed the Scottish Government that for winter 2008-09 (the latest period for which figures are available) there were 3,282,870 winter fuel payment recipients aged between 60 and 64 in Great Britain as a whole and 289,030 in Scotland. They expect the figures to be similar for winter 2009-10. (Figures are available in five year age bands for people between 60 and 79 and for all over 80s.)</p>

  <p>The Winter Fuel Payment is included in the annual household income which is used to calculate fuel poverty. If this is deducted from the income of all 60 to 65 year olds approximately 1,100 more households would be in fuel poverty.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Fuel Poverty Forum has considered the issue of the winter fuel allowance. In its report published in October 2008 it recommended that the Westminster Government carry out a thorough review of both Winter Fuel Payments and Cold Weather Payments to ensure a better fit with fuel poverty. This was reinforced in the findings of its first annual report published in July this year.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Fuel Poverty Forum will keep this issue under review as one of the outstanding recommendations from its <em>Towards 2016</em> report.</p>

  <p>The purpose of the National Housing Trust initiative (NHT) is to make additional private rented housing available at intermediate rent levels. It is not aimed at providing social rented homes. In some cases NHT homes may be provided on sites where there is social housing, but in others there may not be any social housing on the site. Proposed sites will be assessed by local authorities and the Scottish Futures Trust on the basis of the suitability and location of the homes for NHT and so guidance will not be required on physical integration of NHT homes with social rented housing.</p>

  <p>It is for participating local authorities, in discussion with the Scottish Government (SG), to lead on and determine the appropriate balance between the provision of intermediate rented homes through the National Housing Trust initiative (NHT) and the provisions of social rented housing throughout their area, based on evidence from their Housing Need and Demand Assessments (HNDAs).The SG does not feel that guidance is required in relation to this, beyond the guidance already provided to local authorities by the SG on the preparation of Local Housing Strategies and HNDAs. This guidance is available on the SG website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk</a> .</p>

  <p>The methodology to be used will be published once this has been agreed by the short-life working group. At its April meeting members of the working group asked Scottish Government statisticians to consult with the Care Commission to identify whether the Care Commission annual statistical return could be used to gather the information needed. The working group will consider a report back on these discussions at its next meeting at the end of September or early October. Other options are also being considered. The minutes of meetings of the working group and papers providing detailed discussions on the merits of different options are available on the Scottish Government website at:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government intends to continue its Rural Homes for Rent Pilot Scheme by moving to a second bidding round. This further round will be expanded to permit landowners in rural areas to develop proposals for the renovation of empty properties as well as the development of new build houses. It will also provide an opportunity for community landowners who were unable to participate in the first round to prepare and submit bids.</p>

  <p>The timescale and level of funding for this second round will be dependent upon the overall level of resources that will be available for social housing in future years.</p>

  <p>The &pound;9 million allocated to NHS boards for carer information strategies (CIS) is for a three year period ending in March 2011. It is not possible to determine how much of the total has been allocated for specific purposes. We have not requested that NHS boards provide information on the level of resources allocated to particular aspects of the CIS. However, their annual reports to the Scottish Government must set out progress against the minimum requirements in NHS HDL (2006) 22 (24 April 2006). Based on the annual reports for the first year, 2008-09, there has been progress across all NHS boards in the main priority areas, with more to be done. The annual reports for the second year, 2009-10 have been requested and some have been submitted. They will all be assessed for continuing progress.</p>
