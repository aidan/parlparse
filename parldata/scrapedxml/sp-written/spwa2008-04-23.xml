  <p>The Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005 overhauls the current under-age drinking offences and increases the associated maximum penalties from a &pound;1,000 fine to a &pound;5,000 fine, or a three month jail sentence, or both. The 2005 act also emphasises that licensed premises should operate on a &quot;no-proof no-sale&quot; basis - where licensees are in any doubt about a person&rsquo;s age they should refuse the sale. The act also introduced mandatory training for all staff serving alcohol and a qualification for premises managers. Both these measures ensure that staff are fully aware of the law regarding sales to persons under 18.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has also put in place regulations to allow the police to carry out test purchasing of alcohol, where police forces send under-18s into licensed premises to attempt to purchase alcohol. A failure of a test purchase can lead to prosecution and action by the licensing board to suspend or revoke a licence.</p>

  <p>Local authorities have the power to make byelaws to prohibit drinking in designated public places under provisions contained in the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, subject to confirmation by the Scottish ministers. To date, 31 local authorities across Scotland have byelaws in place, covering over 480 towns and villages, and the built up areas of Glasgow and Edinburgh.</p>

  <p>The number of teachers required to reduce primary 1 to primary 3 classes to a maximum of 18 will vary according to the class formation policies, such as the use of composite classes, adopted by individual local authorities.

  <p>In 1996, the UK&rsquo;s National Cycling Strategy target was to quadruple the average number of cycle journeys made by bicycle per person per year from eight journeys to 32 journeys by 2012. The latest figures from the Scottish National Travel Survey show that this figure currently still stands at eight, although this is a very small sample size and anecdotal evidence points to an overall increase in cycling.</p>

  <p>During the consultation for the National Transport Strategy in 2005, stakeholders said this target was unachievable and should be revised. We have a commitment in the National Transport Strategy to take this forward with Cycling Scotland which we will do this year.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is supporting a range of initiatives to encourage people to cycle to work, school and for other journeys. In the past two years, &pound;32 million per year has been available for active travel projects including extending the National Cycle Network and providing safer routes to schools. Local authorities continue to receive &pound;9 million per year for Cycling, Walking and Safer Streets projects and &pound;1 million now rolled up into the local authority block grant that can be used to support School Travel Coordinators.</p>

  <p>Since 2003, investment of over &pound;17.5 million through Sustrans has been used to maintain and extend the national Cycle Network in Scotland for commuting and leisure purposes. The government provides funding to Cycling Scotland to promote cycling in Scotland through the mass participation ride, Pedal For Scotland, and to develop accreditation schemes for Cycle Friendly Employers and Cycle Friendly Schools. These schemes help employers and schools meet the needs of those who wish to cycle.</p>

  <p>In tackling the school run, investment has created new shared walking and cycling paths and new secure cycle parking, provided various incentives to cycle or walk to school including reflective clothing and cycle training skill kits, almost all schools now have 20mph zones and over 61% of schools are working on a travel plan. In all, over 2,000 schools in Scotland have benefited from this funding.</p>

  <p>SIGN Guideline 70 on the Diagnosis and Management of Epilepsy in Adults and SIGN Guideline 81 on the management of epilepsies in children and young people each has a section dealing with the management of those with learning disabilities and epilepsy, and we expect NHS boards to implement the recommendations in these guidelines through local protocols.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to improving all aspects of women&rsquo;s (and men&rsquo;s) lives in Scotland. Our gender equality scheme annual report (March 2008) provides a comprehensive update on action taken over the last year on the high-level objectives (and related action points) in our gender equality scheme (March 2007) to promote equality of opportunity between women and men. Chapter 8 of the annual report is about mainstreaming equality to ensure that public policies, practices and services understand and respond to the different needs of women and men.</p>

  <p>The annual report is available from the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 45322). The scheme is also available (Bib. number 42934).</p>

  <p>With regard to improving women&rsquo;s representation on public bodies, the Scottish Government is working closely with the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments in Scotland (OCPAS) to ensure, amongst other things, that all possible steps are taken to address gender imbalance. This work will be taken forward through the &quot;Diversity Delivers&quot; strategy, currently being produced by OCPAS.</p>

  <p>Information on the average response times for emergency call-outs is not held centrally. With the passing by Parliament of the Fire (Scotland) Act 2005 and the creation of a fire and rescue framework for Scotland, a new locally determined risk-assessed methodology for deploying fire authority resources was introduced; integrated risk management plans (IRMP).</p>

  <p>Prior to the introduction of IRMP there were recommended standards of fire cover which originated from 1936 and were based on the characteristics of property and buildings in each area. The greater the density of buildings in an area, the greater the fire fighting resources that were provided. The effect of this was that, primarily, and for much of the time, fire service resources were targeted at protecting buildings (often unoccupied) rather than people. The previous recommended standards were also inflexible and didn&rsquo;t allow for local discretion by fire and rescue boards to take account of local circumstances.</p>

  <p>Until reporting year 2004-05, information on attendance times formed a performance monitoring measure recorded by Audit Scotland and is published on the Performance Information section of the Audit Scotland website, at the following web address:</p>

  <p>Ministerial approval is not part of the process for managing voluntary severance agreements. Under the terms of the management statement governing the relationship between the Scottish Government and Highlands and Islands Enterprise, any proposal by Highlands and Islands Enterprise to pay any redundancy or compensation for loss of office, requires the approval of Scottish Government officials.</p>

  <p>Once official approval has been granted, the implementation of the proposal as a selective voluntary severance scheme becomes an operational matter for Highlands and Islands Enterprise.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are responsible for the planning and provision of NHS services and work closely with a range of organisations, including hospices. Palliative care and end of life services are delivered through managed clinical networks and palliative care networks which seek to ensure integration of specialist and general care.</p>

  <p>Good quality, accessible palliative and end-of-life care is fundamental to those living with and dying from any advanced, progressive or incurable disease, and for their carers. An action plan will be published this year which will ensure a consistent approach in the provision of these services across all NHS boards, reflecting best practice. NHS Quality Improvement Scotland and the Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care have produced standards regarding care in the NHS and the independent sector. Monitoring of individual care plans takes place within the context of these standards, and other guidance produced by professional bodies and is a matter for NHS boards and those organisations providing palliative and end of life care.</p>

  <p>Guidance is currently being prepared for local authorities on developing their Strategic Housing Investment Plans (SHIPs).

Local authorities will be required to include information on any planned new build over the next five years in the Strategic Housing Investment Plans scheduled for submission in November 2008. This will ensure that the Scottish Government has access to reliable information on local authorities&rsquo; new build plans, on a common basis across Scotland.</p>

  <p>I have asked Karen Watt, Chief Executive of the Scottish Housing Regulator, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>When we inspected GHA in 2007, we looked at procurement of its investment programme. GHA entered a partnering agreement with a range of contractors in 2005 to deliver this programme, and we found that procurement of these contracts followed established good practice in the registered social landlord (RSL) sector.</p>

  <p>The inspection did identify other weaknesses in GHA&rsquo;s approach to procurement. We also found that GHA has been slow to understand the issues facing homeowners, and has not communicated well with them. We have now agreed an improvement plan with GHA, which sets out how it will address all of the weaknesses identified in the inspection report. We will monitor GHA&rsquo;s progress with this.</p>

  <p>We therefore have no grounds to refer matters to the Controller of Audit for examination.</p>

  <p>In <em>Firm Foundations</em> the Scottish Government made it clear that it expects registered social landlords to continue to build the majority of social housing and to be the initial lead developers in a new approach to allocating funding. Over time, it might be appropriate for other bodies to take on the lead development role. The government continues to evaluate carefully the responses received to its proposals in <em>Firm Foundations</em> . The results of this evaluation will influence development of detailed proposals for a more strategic and competitive approach to allocating funding on which the government will consult later this year.</p>

In <em>Firm Foundations: The Future of Housing in Scotland</em> , the Scottish Government made clear its commitment to the future of social housing. It expects registered social landlords to continue to build the majority of social housing and to be the initial lead developer in a new approach to allocating funding.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to ensuring that patients have rapid access to the full range of services they need from the NHS. Specific targets are in place for first out-patient appointments following referral by a general medical or dental practitioner, for acute hospital admissions following a decision to place a patient on the waiting list, and for treatment for specific conditions, including heart disease and cancer. But the government is also committed to improving access and reducing waiting times for a broader range of services, and is supporting the NHS in Scotland to drive down waiting times for services not presently covered by waiting times targets.</p>

  <p>We have published four targets for all NHS boards and 14 commitments for change and improvement in mental health services, incorporating reductions in re-admissions, anti-depressant prescribing and the rate of suicides, while also addressing increases in suicide assessment training and earlier diagnosis and support for those with dementia. The underlying commitments address specific measurable improvements across the range of mental health services, ages and needs.</p>

  <p>Currently, car parking is free at most NHSScotland hospitals and charges have only been introduced as a method of last resort as part of a planned approach to ensuring that adequate access is available to those health care sites which are congested and where the demand for parking far exceeds the supply of car spaces available.</p>

  <p>For those boards where car parking charges are currently in place, we shall be reviewing their current car parking schemes against the principles and criteria set out in the revised guidance issued to boards in January this year. We have asked for reports from these boards by 30 June 2008 and once these reports have been considered, we shall issue a full policy statement on the provision of car parking at NHSScotland facilities. In the meantime, I have applied a &pound;3 per day cap on charges.</p>

  <p>Since June 2003, every Scottish local authority has had a duty to offer people with learning disabilities and other disabled and elderly people who meet local authority eligibility criteria for community care, the opportunity to receive self-directed support (direct payments). They can receive the practical help that they need to enable them to manage the care package day-to-day. The flexibility achieved is such that those with complex needs can also have self-directed support using the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000 to safeguard their interests. The Scottish Consortium for Learning Disability has produced &quot;An easy guide to direct payments&quot; (2005) for people with learning disabilities which is available at <a href="http://www.scld.org.uk/library-publications/scld-publications.xhtml" target="_blank"><br /> http://www.scld.org.uk/library-publications/scld-publications.xhtml</a> .</p>

  <p>Current policy for statutory listing states that it will not normally be advanced in the face of a live planning application or appeal. This provides a reasonable application of the legislation within the current planning framework, particularly as unlike England the listed building legislation in Scotland has no provision for certificates of immunity, which can provide developers and owners with certainty that their building will not be listed for a five year period.</p>

  <p>The extension was the activation of a contractual provision which has existed since the franchise was let, following extensive consultation and competition in 2004.</p>

  <p>The extension was granted in furtherance of the key objectives of the <em>National Transport Strategy </em>and <em>Scotland&rsquo;s Railways</em>, both of which were themselves subject to widespread consultation.</p>

  <p>Between 1997 and 2007 there was no facility on either side of the Erskine Bridge to filter out high-sided vehicles. When the bridge was closed, it was closed to all traffic. In November 2007 signs were installed which enable closures to be restricted to high-sided vehicles. Between November and the end of 2007, the bridge was closed to high-sided vehicles on one occasion.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally by the Scottish Government. Records of traffic closures are held on paper by Glasgow City Council but are not collated electronically for statistical purposes.</p>

  <p>However, since 1997 three major structural repair contracts in 1999, 2000 and 2002 have required the closure of one traffic bore during the day for an extended period. In total these aggregate to approximately 200 days. More recently closure of one side from 7pm each night was required to allow the replacement of internal cladding which was achieved with only minor traffic flow disturbance.</p>

  <p>In addition, short closures of one side of the tunnel are required an average of four times per week for breakdowns, over-height vehicles, debris on the road and other operational issues.</p>
