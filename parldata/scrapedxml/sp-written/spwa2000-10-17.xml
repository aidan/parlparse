  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive which local authority takes financial responsibility for the care provision for elderly people when they move from one local authority area in which they have been assessed to another where the care provision is provided and what the statutory basis for this is.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-10-17.S1W-10186.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80167" speakername="Iain Gray" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa1017.htm#10186">

  <p>If a local authority decides, after an assessment of need, that a person requires care and they decide that the care should be provided in another local authority&#8217;s area, they retain responsibility for the costs of that person&#8217;s care. The person is regarded as &quot;ordinarily resident&quot; in their area. These arrangements only apply where the decision to provide the care outside their own area is taken by or agreed with the local authority who has assessed the person&#8217;s need.</p>

  <p>The statutory basis for these arrangements is founded on section 86(1) of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968. There is no definition of &quot;ordinarily resident&quot; in the Act, but it is subject to interpretation by the courts. Scottish Executive Circular SWSG1/96, a copy of which has been placed in SPICe, sets out guidance derived from relevant legal proceedings.</p>

  <p>The criteria for the creation of Enterprise Zones are a reserved matter. However, the Scottish Executive has no plans at present to promote the creation of an Enterprise Zone for Prestwick Airport. Together with other agencies, we are continuing our efforts to deepen and grow the aerospace cluster at Prestwick.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what science, engineering and other research bodies are accountable to it; what powers of direction, guidance and instruction are available to it in relation to each; what current programmes or studies are ongoing at the behest of those bodies, and what level of funding has been made available by the Executive to each body.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive commissions a programme of research in agricultural, biological and related sciences from the five Scottish Agricultural and Biological Research Institutes, the Scottish Agricultural College and the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh. The organisations are all funded by grant-in-aid and are accountable to the Scottish Executive and to Parliament for this funding through the Chief Executives who are accountable officers. Controls over the organisations are described in Management Statements and Financial Memoranda (in the case of SAC, a Memorandum of Understanding). In addition, the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh is governed by the provisions of the Natural Heritage (Scotland) Act 1985 which includes powers for Scottish Ministers to appoint Trustees to the Board and to require the board to provide such information relating to the discharge of their functions as Ministers may require. The table below sets out a brief description of the current programmes of each organisation and of the Scottish Executive&#8217;s recurrent funding in 2000-01.</p>

  <p>The Fisheries Research Service (FRS) and the Scottish Agricultural Science Agency (SASA) are, as Executive Agencies, also accountable to the Scottish Executive. Their administrative arrangements are provided in Framework Documents, as for all SE Executive Agencies. Each is run by an Agency Chief Executive.</p>

  <p>FRS aims to improve management of the living resources in the seas and inland waters of Scotland. FRS provides scientific and technical advice and information on fisheries, aquaculture and the aquatic environment. It undertakes statutory and regulatory responsibilities on behalf of SERAD, and it conducts a programme of scientific and technical activities, monitoring, surveillance and research. There is an Agency Strategy Board, chaired by the Fisheries Secretary of SERAD. Funding of FRS stands at &pound;13.6 million for 2000-01.</p>

  <p>SASA provides expert advice on agricultural crops, horticultural crops and aspects of the environment. It performs statutory and regulatory work in relation to national, European Community (EC) and other international legislation and agreements, on plant health, bee health, variety registration, crop improvement, genetic resources, the protection of crops, food and the environment. Funding of SASA stands at &pound;6.9 million for 2000-01.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Higher Education Funding Council (SHEFC) is not a science or research body, but it is the Executive Agency responsible for the funding of Scotland&#8217;s higher education institutions. In 2000-01 SHEFC support for research in the higher education sector totalled &pound;133 million.</p>
