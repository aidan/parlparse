  <p>Scottish Environment Protection Agency carries out a regular check programme of environmental monitoring around nuclear sites. Results are published jointly in the annual report <i>Radioactivity in Food and the Environment </i> (RIFE). A copy of the latest RIFE report is available in the Parliament&#8217;s reference centre, (Bib. no. 14600). To assess the effect of discharges, dose is calculated, at each site, for the group most likely to be most exposed, the so-called critical group. The dose to other members of the public at those locations will be smaller than that to the critical group.</p>

  <p>Thus the indicator that is used to assess compliance is critical group dose. A summary table of critical group doses due to discharges of radioactive waste is presented in the RIFE report. The table for the 1999 report, the latest available, shows that critical groups in Scotland received doses which were a very small fraction of the internationally accepted limit of one millisievert per year and were in no case more than 5% of that limit. The dose to other members of the public was of course even lower. Thus the target of 100% compliance with limits was met.</p>

  <p>The <strong> </strong> Scottish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) is responsible for protecting Scotland&#8217;s river quality. The agency classifies rivers based on an assessment of chemical, biological and aesthetic indicators. Chemical measures include measures of organic, toxic and nutrient pollution. Biological aspects relate to the sampling of the abundance and diversity of water borne insects. The aesthetic component refers to accumulations of litter or debris.</p>

  <p>On the basis of these three components, stretches of river length are classified annually as being:</p>

  <p>Excellent;</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive and its agencies gave a commitment in its recently launched strategy document <i>A Forward Strategy for Scottish Agriculture</i> to a partnership approach for protecting and enhancing Scotland&#8217;s environment. The document identifies action to improve advice for farmers and finds solutions which are good for the environment and farming businesses. Steps include a working group to examine environmental issues which impact on farming, a revision of the Prevention of Environmental Pollution from Agricultural Activity (PEPFAA) Code, and support for the development of a CD-ROM on environmental management for agriculture. A copy of the strategy is available in the Parliament&#8217;s reference centre (Bib. no. 14550).</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is also sponsoring a research programme examining the impact, mechanisms and transport of agricultural diffuse pollution. Initial findings were published in the report <i>Impact of Agricultural Practices and Catchment Characteristics on Ayrshire Bathing Waters</i>, published in May 2001. It is available in the Scottish Parliament&#8217;s reference centre (Bib. no. 13787).</p>

  <p>Based on this research, the Scottish Executive issued an advice note on the prevention of agricultural diffuse pollution at bathing waters to farmers in at-risk catchments on 20 July (Bib. no. 14970).</p>

  <p>To tackle nitrate pollution we shall be consulting with the farming industry in autumn 2001 on new Nitrate Vulnerable Zones and the required Action Programme measures. We are developing guidance and will discuss with the industry how best to assist farmers in complying with statutory requirements.</p>

  <p>To protect vulnerable groundwaters, farmers disposing of waste sheep dip and other agricultural chemicals to land are required to obtain authorisation from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency in order to do so, under the Groundwater Regulations 1998.</p>

  <p>The agency also has powers to serve notices, relating to the storage, transport, handling and use of listed substances under the regulations. Notice can impose conditions on or prohibit activities where there is a risk of pollution to groundwater.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive will publish a sheep dipping Code of Practice later in the year for Scottish farmers, crofters and contractors. This will offer guidance on best practice to ensure dipping does not pollute groundwater.</p>

  <p>Looking to wider diffuse pollution issues, the Scottish Executive issued <i>Planning Advice Note No. 61</i> on incorporating Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems into new developments (Bib. no. 14982), on 27 July. These systems deal in a natural, environmentally-friendly way with run-off from roads and car-parks. The technology also has a wider application, for example to farm yard drainage and septic tanks.</p>

  <p>Looking to the future, the consultation paper <i>Rivers, Lochs, Coasts: The Future for Scotland&#8217;s Waters </i>(Bib. no. 14576), published on 29 June 2001, as a preliminary to the introduction of the Water Environment Bill, makes suggestions for systematic measures to tackle diffuse pollution, and invites comment.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the ministerial statement by the Minister for Finance and Local Government on 28 June 2001, why there has been a net reduction of &#163;30 million in the 2002-03 and 2003-04 Enterprise and Lifelong Learning budgets and what impact this will have on the delivery of the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning department&#8217;s priorities.</p>

  <p>The net reduction of &#163;30 million in the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning budgets occurs within the spending plans for the Students Awards Agency for Scotland and amounts to &#163;10 million in each of the three years 2001-02 to 2003-04.</p>

  <p>This reduction will have no impact on the delivery of the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Department&#8217;s priorities.</p>

  <p>On new loans the budget makes provision to reflect estimated future write-offs for non-recovery and the difference between the cost of capital charge and the interest earned over the whole life of the loan. The data underpinning these estimates is reviewed on a regular basis. The most recent review indicates that the estimated provision should be at a rate 5% less than that previously calculated.</p>

  <p>The &#163;5.248 million was made available for flood prevention activities as a consequence of the additional funds provided for in England and Wales following the severe flooding there last autumn. This additional funding, covering the period 2000-04, will be used to strengthen flood prevention arrangements in a number of important areas. Amongst the first of the initiatives being taken forward are steps to improve dissemination of SEPA&#8217;s flood warnings, a pilot project for detailed survey work to identify low lying coastal areas that may be susceptible to sea level rise and research work to better identify assets at risk from flooding. This work, estimated to cost &#163;1.5 million, will be taken forward in parallel with the enhanced programme of flood prevention and coast protection schemes that local authorities are putting in place and will augment these efforts. Other follow on initiatives are also under consideration at present.</p>

  <p>The &#163;30 million savings announced in the justice budget by the Minister for Finance and Local Government on 28 June cover three financial years, 2001-02 (&#163;5 million), 2002-03 (&#163;10 million) and 2003-04 (&#163;15 million). These savings will be found from within two Level 3 budgets.</p>

  <p>Criminal Injuries Compensation - &#163;6 million (&#163;-/3 million/3 million)</p>

  <p>Miscellaneous &#8211; Other Miscellaneous - &#163;24 million (&#163;5 million/7 million/12 million)</p>

  <p>These savings can be delivered without compromising any of the services provided by the justice programme. On Criminal Injuries Compensation, the Home Office has projected a fall-off in the number of cases in the two forward years, thus releasing the savings identified. In the Miscellaneous category, the savings arise from unallocated provision which was previously identified to meet any costs arising from the incorporation of ECHR into domestic law. To date, this has proved unnecessary, as the provision in the areas directly concerned with ECHR, principally courts, police, prisons and Legal Aid, have had sufficient funding to cope with any increased costs arising from any challenges.</p>

  <p>The recommendations set out in Annex 3 of the <i>Third Annual Report of the Planning and Audit Unit 2001</i> are being progressed as follows:</p>

  <p><u>Performance Statistics</u></p>

  <p>A performance monitoring database has been set up and is in operation. When it has been operating long enough to yield robust statistics, targets for improvement can be set.</p>

  <p><u>Consultation</u></p>

  <p>A system to advise planning authorities where consultations cannot be dealt with in 14 days has been set up and is working well. Setting a timetable for the consultation process is likely to be misleading and better communication with planning officers is suggested as an alternative.</p>

  <p>Good progress is being made with developing electronic communications, although technical problems remain.</p>

  <p>Progress on revising the consultation forms depends on planning authorities standardising their planning application forms to include the information required by the trunk road authority. This proposal was discussed with local authorities but there has been no formal response to date.</p>

  <p><u>Pre-application advice</u></p>

  <p>Applicants are encouraged to consult the Scottish Executive Road Network Management and Maintenance Division (RNMMD) at the earliest possible stage to speed up the consultation process.</p>

  <p><u>The need for further planning advice</u></p>

  <p>It has been decided not to seek revision of the Town &amp; Country Planning Scotland General Development Procedure (Scotland) Order 1992, but revised advice is contained in Planning Advice Note 40 Development Control. Consultants have been commissioned to advise by the end of 2001 on guidance on transport assessment for development proposals in Scotland. Together with the output of other research on key development sites and on achieving sustainable mode share, the research output will inform further good practice Planning Advice programmed for 2002.</p>

  <p><u>The need for further trunk road advice</u></p>

  <p>Route strategies are under active consideration.</p>

  <p>We have effectively achieved a one-door approach to the Operating Companies. A copy of the consultation form only is sent to RNMMD to enable them to monitor performance.</p>

  <p>Consideration is still being given as to how best to keep planning authorities informed of progress.</p>

  <p>A library of standard conditions is in use, and is subject to constant revision and updating.</p>

  <p>It is the view of RNMMD that the current wording of conditions complies with the law.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, chief executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>No, but funds have been made available to upgrade one hall at Barlinnie. The funds must be expended in accordance with the terms of the SPS Financial Policy and Guidance Manual which requires us to secure best value for money from this investment. The project was granted authority to proceed on the basis that it will be delivered, as scoped, in accordance with the agreed budget and commissioning timetable.</p>

  <p>No directions have been given to the Governor. The options for ending slopping out in all Scottish prisons, including HM Prison Barlinnie, are being considered as part of the Estates Review which is currently under way.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it is still its policy, as set out in section 1.5 of <i>Strategic Priorities for Scotland&#8217;s Passenger Railway</i> , that existing rail franchises should be replaced as quickly as possible with 15-20 year franchises to maximise private sector investment; whether its current intention is to extend the present ScotRail franchise by a short period of time or to re-franchise the service for a 15-20 year period; what its current target date is in either case for the re-franchising of passenger railway services, and whether its guidance and direction to the Strategic Rail Authority on these matters have been accepted by the authority and by Her Majesty&#8217;s Government.</p>

  <p>My first priority for railways is the re-letting of the Scottish passenger railway franchise on or before 30 March 2004 when the current contract with ScotRail expires. I intend to issue directions and guidance to the Strategic Rail Authority for the next Scottish passenger rail franchise later this year.</p>

  <p>1. Franchise payments to ScotRail met from the Assigned Budget after April 2001.</p>

  <p>2. Franchise payments for 1995-96 to 2000-01 are the net outturn cash amounts paid to the private sector and include actual incentive payments and receipts. Future payments are contracted amounts restated in March 2001 prices exclusive of any incentive payments and receipts.</p>

  <p>3. RPP funding in 2000-01 relates to the re-opening of Beauly station, while funds from 2001-02 and onwards relate to Edinburgh Crossrail. Future SRA funded schemes and FFG will be awarded on the basis of individual application and therefore cannot be anticipated.</p>

  <p>4. Awards to 1999-2000 include freight services on the Scottish network. A separate breakdown for Scotland is not available. Each award is made on an individual basis and the duration of each project may differ. The amount shown is the total volume of the awards.</p>

  <p>5. The figures for GNER and both services operated by Virgin Trains are the total franchise payments. Amounts in brackets will be paid by the train operating companies to the SRA. Separate breakdowns for Scotland are not available.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is in regular contact with the Department of Transport, Local Government and the Regions on a wide range of issues, including rail franchising. Directions and guidance to the Strategic Rail Authority for the next Scottish passenger rail franchise are a matter for the Scottish Executive. Advice on any new cross-border franchises will be issued when appropriate.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what effect it anticipates extending the existing rail franchise for two years only will have on its strategy for increased investment on the East Coast Main Line and what proposed investment in rail services it expects to be deferred now that the existing franchise has been extended for two years rather than awarded for a period of 15-20 years.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether there is a need for improved road links to Turnberry Hotel and golf course to retain the course&#8217;s future Open Championship status, whether it intends to allocate funding to construct an A77 Maybole bypass in any future trunk roads budget and whether it plans to make additional resources available to South Ayrshire Council to improve related road links through and around south Ayr and north Carrick.</p>

  <p>The factors taken into account when considering a golfing venue&#8217;s suitability for the Open Championship are for the Royal &amp; Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews. Representatives of Turnberry have, however, discussed with officials from the Executive the integrated transport management plans being developed with South Ayrshire Council, SPT and the police. Those concerned are aware that the trunk roads programme announced on 27 March includes seven major improvement schemes on the A77 scheduled for completion by 2005. They also recognise that it would be inappropriate to anticipate in their planning what the trunk road investment priorities will be for later years.</p>

  <p>Following Spending Review 2000, an additional &#163;70 million over three years was allocated to help local authorities address local roads and bridges issues. This formed part of the record three-year block allocation to councils announced by the Minister for Finance in December last year. The Executive has no plans to make additional allocations to councils. Decisions on spending priorities within the block allocations are a matter for the councils concerned.</p>
