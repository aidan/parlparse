  <p>The recent report <i>The future of unpaid care in Scotland</i> arose out of a wide ranging study commissioned by the Scottish Executive to help us plan for the support needs of unpaid carers over the next 10 years. The study looked at a wide range of issues, including the financial implications of caring and financial support for carers. This led to a specific recommendation that the UK Government review benefit entitlements, tax credit and pensions for carers. On 30 September 2005, I wrote to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, as well as other relevant UK Ministers, to draw their attention to the report and that recommendation.</p>

  <p>We do not otherwise monitor incomes or savings of family carers.</p>

  <p>Whilst cities provide a focal point, they must also interact with their surrounding areas. Scotland&rsquo;s economic strength depends not only on the economic success of its cities but also on the wider city-regions. This is reflected in a number of policy statements such as the: <i>National Planning Framework for Scotland<sup>1</sup>, Framework for Economic Development in Scotland<sup>2</sup>, </i> the revised <i>Smart Successful Scotland<sup>3</sup></i> , and the <i>Infrastructure Investment Plan<sup>4</sup></i> . It is also reflected in Scottish Enterprise&rsquo;s Operating Plan 2005-08. All of these take an explicitly spatial approach to economic development.</p>

  <p>The monies assigned to the Cities Growth Fund 2003-08 have been fully allocated to Scotland&rsquo;s six cities. Decisions on funding allocations after 2007-08 will be taken in due course following the next spending review.</p>

  <p><i>Building a Better Scotland </i>is not a city specific programme; rather it is a spending strategy which sets out how the devolved administration in Scotland will allocate resources to meet its objectives of: growing the economy for the benefit of all in Scotland; delivering excellent public services for all; supporting stronger safer communities, and developing a confident, democratic Scotland.</p>

  <p>City status is a reserved matter for the UK Government. Should there be a further city status competition, the Scottish Executive would be given the opportunity to comment on any applications submitted by local authorities in Scotland. It would be premature to speculate on what future applications might be submitted, or their respective merits, in advance of any such future competition.</p>

  <p>There will be no specific measure of national well-being included in the proposed baseline report on NHSScotland&rsquo;s performance. The proposal is to produce a report similar in scope to the English NHS report <i>Claiming the Health Dividend</i> , produced by the King&rsquo;s Fund which assessed performance across a range of critical areas. By adopting this approach it is hoped to gain an insight into how NHSScotland&rsquo;s activities help underpin the sustainable development agenda and contribute to the national well-being.</p>

  <p>Three companies remain in the bidding process for operating the Gourock to Dunoon ferry service on an unsubsidised basis. The three companies submitted Pre-Qualification Questionnaires to the Executive in December last year and these are currently being evaluated. However, the Executive&rsquo;s policy in procurement exercises such as this is not to reveal the identities of the companies submitting Pre-Qualification Questionnaires. When the current stage of the process has been completed, and a suitable tender list has been identified, the names of the companies that have been selected for the tender list will be revealed. This is likely to be in the spring.</p>

Due to the variety of ways in which individuals move to Scotland, this information would be very difficult to collect, and we have no current plans to do so.

  <p><i>The same as you?</i> national implementation group is preparing a children&rsquo;s report, which illustrates how the principles of <i>The same as you?</i> apply to people of all ages including children and young people. Whilst education and the transition to adult life are major features of the report, it also has a strong focus on the importance of health, play and leisure. The report, due for publication in spring 2006, emphasises the responsibilities of all organisations and individuals in ensuring young people with learning disabilities are included and given the same opportunities as everybody else.</p>

  <p>The Standards in Scotland&rsquo;s Schools Act (2000) strengthened the rights of parents of children with special educational needs to have their children educated in mainstream schools, providing children with the opportunity to play, learn and socialise together. Furthermore the further education sector has made great efforts in recent years to make college provision accessible and inclusive to all those who wish to study and participation by students with disabilities or additional support needs has increased year on year.</p>

  <p>For details of further work to promote the inclusion of young people with learning disabilities in their own communities, I refer the member to the answers to questions S2W-22677, S2W-22678, S2W-22679, S2W-22680, S2W-22681, S2W-22682 and S2W-22683 on 13, 9, 21, 10, 7, 2 and 9 February respectively.

  <p>Information on funding allocated for spend on further education for young people with learning disabilities is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The core funding which further education colleges receive from the Scottish Funding Council goes towards meeting the needs of all students, however some students have additional support needs which may require additional funding. The Scottish Funding Council make two additional allocations which are bursary allocations and inclusiveness funding.</p>

  <p>Bursary allocations are paid to colleges to enable them to implement the National Policy for further education bursaries. In 2005-06 this allocation was &pound;52.2 million. Part of the policy enables colleges to pay an additional learning needs allowance, which may be offered to a disabled student towards study or travel-related expenses. This allowance is not means-tested as it is intended to help meet the additional costs that students have due to their disability.</p>

  <p>Inclusiveness formula funding is paid to colleges to enable them to take forward the inclusiveness agenda as defined by the Beattie report in 1999. In 2005-06, this allocation was &pound;1.6 million.</p>

  <p>Local authorities have been informed they will receive, in total, an additional &pound;18 million in 2006 and &pound;44 million in 2007 to support the recruitment of additional teachers, including PE teachers, to meet the uplift in teacher numbers to 53,000 by 2007. Of this, Glasgow City Council is to receive &pound;2.6 million in 2006-07 and &pound;6.5 million in 2007-08. Support will also be given to help existing primary teachers to gain professional recognition for specialisms in PE.</p>

  <p>In addition Glasgow University, in conjunction with Glasgow City Council, is running a course for existing primary teachers to develop PE specialisms which will help to ensure that weekly physical education targets for schoolchildren in Glasgow are met. 23 teachers with PE specialisms are expected to qualify from this course in July 2006.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Public Services Ombudsman was established under The Scottish Public Services Ombudsman Act 2002. Paragraph 2(2) of schedule 1 of this act provides that the ombudsman, in the exercise of her functions is not subject to the direction or control of any member of Parliament, any member of the Scottish Executive or the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body.</p>

  <p>Separate provision does, however, require the ombudsman to lay an annual report before Parliament and the Parliament may give directions as to the form and content of an annual report. Copies of the annual report are available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre. The ombudsman must also keep accounts and prepare annual accounts for each financial year in accordance with such directions as Scottish ministers may give.</p>

  <p>In terms of the Act, the SPCB has to pay any expenses incurred by the ombudsman in the exercise of her functions. As part of this process, the SPCB invites the ombudsman on an annual basis to prepare a budget submission which is scrutinised by the SPCB and which scrutiny may include discussions between the SPCB and the Ombudsman prior to the bid being reported to the Finance Committee as part of the SPCB&rsquo;s overall budget submission.</p>
