  <p>The games offer the potential to promote the city as a tourist destination, help develop a sense of pride in the community, encourage social involvement and improve skills for the local population. In addition they will transform one of the most deprived areas of our country and provide superb new facilities and opportunities to local people. The athletes&rsquo; village, National Indoor Sports Arena and Velodrome will all be constructed in Dalmarnock, in the heart of the Clyde Gateway, creating an on-going infrastructure legacy for the area. After the games, the village will be made available for a mix of social and private housing.</p>

  <p>Further information on how we intend to deliver a lasting legacy in much wider areas from the 2014 Commonwealth Games will be published within the first 100 days since winning the right to host the games</p>

  <p>The legacy of the Glasgow 2014 games will be seen in many areas.</p>

  <p>Around 15,000 volunteers will be needed to help run the games. All of the volunteers will have the opportunity to be able to develop new skills and gain new experiences and confidence.</p>

  <p>There will be new jobs &ndash; initial economic projections are that 1,200 new jobs will be created at a Scottish level.</p>

  <p>Scotland will welcome many thousands of visitors for the games in 2014. Many are expected to travel around the country, to experience great Scottish hospitality, and to come back again and again. Scottish businesses can bid for contracts arising from the games.</p>

  <p>But the most important legacy should be in the field of health. We have an unrivalled opportunity to use the power of sport to inspire people of all ages to lead active and healthy lives.</p>

  <p>Further information on how we intend to deliver a lasting legacy from the 2014 Commonwealth Games will be published for consultation within the first 100 days of winning the bid</p>

  <p>UK nationals or people with dual nationality with one part being British may apply for any post in the civil service. In addition, about 75% of Civil Service posts are open to Commonwealth citizens and nationals of any of the member states of the European Economic Area (EEA). The remainder, which require special allegiance to the state, are reserved for UK nationals. Non-UK candidates resident overseas are however not eligible to apply for civil service posts. Full civil service nationality guidelines are available on the Civil Service Recruitment Gateway website at: <br /> http://careers.civil-service.gov.uk</p>

  <p>It is possible for non-UK nationals to be employed on a consultancy arrangement, depending on experience or qualifications.</p>

  <p>Our general approach is to reduce &quot;ring-fencing&quot; of funding and be less prescriptive about how local authorities spend money.

  <p>There will be some costs associated with the implementation of the reforms. The amount of those costs has not yet been determined but every effort will be made to minimise them. Similarly, there will be savings achieved through more coherent and focused activity but it is not yet possible to quantify these. However, I would expect to get pay back for any efficiencies within two to three years.</p>

  <p><em>Firm Foundations</em> proposes that local authorities, developers, housing associations and other stakeholders should aim to increase the rate at which new houses are built from 25,000 a year at present to 35,000 a year by the middle of the next decade. Given the long-term nature of the goal, the document does not make any assumption about how many of the 35,000 houses will be for social rent and how many for other tenures.</p>

  <p>In the period 2008-11, the Scottish Government plans to spend &pound;1.47 billion on affordable housing, including new housing for social rent. This represents an increase of &pound;130 million over provision for 2005-08.</p>

  <p>Used efficiently, this expenditure is sufficient to ensure, as a minimum, that completion of new affordable houses in 2008-11 exceeds the rate of completions in 2005-08. The Scottish Government wishes to ensure that the expenditure achieves a better outcome than that. Its proposal in <em>Firm Foundations </em>to award Housing Association Grant on a competitive basis is intended to achieve that objective by requiring new social housing to be built much more efficiently than at present. The number of new houses built under this approach will reflect housing associations&rsquo; ability to become more efficient.</p>

  <p>Planning agreements play an important role in regulating the use of land to make development acceptable in land use planning terms and also in facilitating the provision of related infrastructure. The negotiation of agreements can be a time consuming process. In the light of the UK Government&rsquo;s decision not to pursue the proposed Planning Gain Supplement, the Scottish Government will undertake a review of the operation of the systems of planning agreements in Scotland. This review will aim to ensure that we have a system that allows the public to benefit from planning gain and enables sustainable economic development at a local and national level.</p>

  <p>Firm Foundations sets out the Scottish Government&rsquo;s proposals to make the housing system in Scotland offer an improved supply and choice across all tenures. A central aspiration in the discussion document is to see a step change in the numbers of homes of all types built in Scotland in order to meet requirements for housing. Firm Foundations also notes a number of actions already underway that will strengthen the housing and planning delivery framework. One of these actions is the current review of <em>Scottish Planning Policy 3</em> on housing, which will strengthen national policy on housing to ensure the provision of sufficient land for housing and support the creation of quality residential environments. The revised <em>SPP3</em> will continue to link with the guidance on the delivery of affordable housing (PAN 74) that has now been in place for over two years.</p>

  <p>Following the recent reporter&rsquo;s determination against the third Don Crossing as proposed in the Finalised Aberdeen Local Plan there is a requirement for the current Haudagain STAG assessment to take stock of the implications of this decision.</p>

  <p>This work is on-going with the outcomes expected early in the New Year. At that time a view will be taken by the Haudagain STAG Steering Group on how to proceed with the next round of public consultation. The Haudagain STAG Steering Group members include Aberdeen City Council, Nestrans and Transport Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Steering Group will also a take view in the New Year on whether other options may have to be considered once the implications of there not being a third Don Crossing are better understood.</p>

  <p>The Steering Group has had continuous dialogue throughout this STAG assessment. Amongst the points discussed is the regeneration of the Middlefield area of Aberdeen. It remains the position that any potential Haudagain intervention is not dependent on the regeneration of the Middlefield area proceeding.</p>

  <p>Beyond this the STAG assessment requires to be concluded before any final decision on what the most appropriate solution to the Haudagain Roundabout&rsquo;s problems is.</p>

  <p>Scotland&rsquo;s cities will benefit from the new arrangements announced as part of the Strategic Spending Review on 14 November 2007. The package of measures jointly agreed with COSLA marks a fundamental shift in the relationship between the Scottish Government and local government.</p>

  <p>One element of the package is a fair cash settlement for local government. Other elements include the introduction of a Single Outcome Agreement, a significant reduction in ring-fencing of separate capital and revenue grants, streamlining bureaucracy and reporting requirements, and the retention of efficiency savings.</p>

  <p>These new arrangements, and the freedoms and flexibilities that they afford, will give city-based local authorities greater scope to maintain their investment in city infrastructure as part of their vital role in supporting the economy.</p>

  <p>The provision of such information is voluntary. Therefore, the overall figure is calculated for all staff, while the known figure is calculated for those who have provided an answer to our monitoring questions regarding disability.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to increasing the diversity of staff within the organisation, and recognising and valuing what everyone has to offer. This includes a commitment to improving its policies and practices on disability and to fulfilling our duties under our Disability Equality Scheme. We also participate in the Jobcentre Plus &quot;Positive about Disabled People&quot; scheme. Under this scheme, all candidates who consider themselves to be disabled in terms of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, and who meet the essential minimum criteria for the post, will be guaranteed an interview.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government currently has no plans to implement a ban on the sale of tobacco products from vending machines. However, reducing the availability and attractiveness of tobacco products to young people, including through much more rigorous enforcement of tobacco sales law will be a key focus of the proposed five-year smoking prevention action plan to be published next spring. The law currently makes provision for a court order to be made stipulating precautions to be taken by the owner or operator to prevent vending machines being used by under 18s or, if necessary, for the machine to be removed altogether. In developing our proposals we will consider what more can be done within the existing legislative framework to reduce illegal sales from vending machines.</p>

  <p>Ms Jennifer Erickson was not a permanent employee of the Scottish Government. She was engaged as a consultant for a short period of time to provide continuity of advice in relation to a specific project, the establishment of the Council of Economic Advisers. The fact that she was a non-UK resident and would not, other than in exceptional circumstances, have been eligible for a civil service contract was therefore a consideration in the decision to engage her on consultancy terms on a time-limited basis.</p>

  <p>No final decision has yet been taken on the future of sportscotland. It is our aim to complete the review of sportscotland by the end of the year.</p>

  <p>However, the Royal Charter can be revoked by an Act of The Scottish Parliament or by the Sovereign. In practice, a chartered body is normally dissolved through voluntary action culminating in a Petition for Surrender. This is achieved by the body petitioning The Queen in Council to accept the surrender of its Charter. The Petition is accompanied by an appropriate Deed of Surrender together with the original Charter bearing the Great Seal (and any Supplemental Charters). All these documents are then sent to the Privy Council Office. Acceptance of the surrender is signified by an Order in Council, which usually recites the terms of the Deed of Surrender. The chartered body ceases to exist from the date on which such an Order in Council is made.</p>

  <p>The procedure, and the form of the Petition and Deed of Surrender may vary according to the body&rsquo;s constitution, and the Privy Council Office needs to be consulted in every case.</p>

  <p>There are a number of other possible options that could achieve the identified objective.</p>

  <p>The system used for ticket bookings does not record enquiries which do not result in a successful booking. The following table shows the number of times when each MSP has been able to book tickets for Debating Chamber public gallery tickets in the period from 23 May 2007 to 8 November 2007, and the total number of tickets that each MSP has received for FMQT during that period. The numbers in the FMQT column may be lower than the column showing the number of bookings, as the latter includes bookings for business other than FMQT.</p>
