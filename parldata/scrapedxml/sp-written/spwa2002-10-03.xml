  <p>A total of 148 responses were received during the consultation on <em>Assessing our children&#146;s educational needs: The Way Forward?</em> last year, including a response from the Education Sub-Group of the Cross Party Group on Autistic Spectrum Disorder. Since publication of the Executive&#146;s response to the consultation (Bib. number 19469), we have held further consultation seminars attended by over 300 delegates, including education authority staff, educational psychologists, teachers, health professionals, social workers, voluntary organisations and parents, and representatives from the Cross Party Group on Autistic Spectrum Disorder. Responses received and comments raised during these events are being taken into account as the proposals for changing the assessment and recording procedures for children with special educational needs are being developed.</p>

  <p>Iain Gray launched the introduction of free local off-peak bus travel for elderly and disabled people on 30 September.</p>

  <p>The enhanced arrangements have also been publicised by a nationwide advertising campaign including posters at bus shelters, and on and in buses. These posters advised concession cardholders of the minimum benefits to which they are now entitled.</p>

  <p>Regionalised adverts covering the impact of the new minimum entitlements on each of the existing concessionary travel schemes have been placed in 91 local newspapers.</p>

  <p>In Scotland, the Chief Scientist Office (CSO) within the Scottish Executive Health Department has responsibility for encouraging and supporting research into health services and patient care within the NHS in Scotland. The CSO is not currently directly funding any research projects into the prevalence and costs of on-going medical conditions as a result of domestic abuse but would be prepared to consider suitable research applications on this subject in the future. These would need to be of a sufficiently high standard and would be subject to the usual committee and peer review.</p>

  <p>Our Drugs Strategy is based on four pillars &#150; young people, communities, treatment and availability. The strategy is supported by &#163;130 million, in new resources, over three years. Scotland&#146;s 22 Drug Action Teams take the lead in implementing the strategy at local level.</p>

  <p>We are making steady progress. For example, new and improved treatment and rehabilitation services are being rolled out across Scotland, supported by our new resources. Our &quot;Know the Score&quot; Drugs Communications Strategy is providing factual information to the public on the risks posed by drugs, and where help and advice can be obtained. Our enforcement bodies are seizing record amounts of Class A drugs, which cause the most harm to individuals and communities.</p>

  <p>More detailed information on progress in 2002 will be provided in the Executive&#146;s Annual Report on Drug Misuse, which will be published later this year.</p>

  <p>Following the announcement of the proposed closure of Alcan&#146;s Burntisland facility, Scottish Development International officials have had on-going meetings with both local and corporate management to minimise the impact of any such action. The 90-day consultation period began on 11 September 2002 and therefore it is premature to make definitive assumptions about the outcome.</p>

  <p>However, in the event of any job losses, support will be provided to those affected through the Fife local response team in conjunction with the Executive&#146;s PACE (Partnership Action for Continuing Employment) framework. This will ensure a rapid response from local agencies in terms of offering advice, support and guidance on the range of retraining/upskilling and employment opportunities.</p>

  <p>In 1999, Scottish productivity was marginally below the UK average, according to the Office of National Statistics (ONS). According to OECD statistics, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per person employed in the UK was 92% of the OECD average in 1999. This suggests that GDP per person employed in Scotland was around 8% lower than the OECD average in 1999. However, this is an approximate figure given the problems of comparing productivity data from ONS and OECD sources. The department is presently considering how best to combine these sources to provide a rigorous comparison of productivity in Scotland with productivity in OECD competitors.</p>

This recognises the importance to the Scottish economy of ensuring that all communities are trained and ready for work.

  <p>In terms of organisation and delivery of care, it is for all NHS boards and their care partners to consider what provision best suits the assessed needs of their area. Services that are in place range from Community Psychiatric Nursing Services, Psychiatric Obstetric Liaison services to support and interventions in the community such as outreach nursery workers, home support services and parenting programmes.</p>

  <p>To help with the organisation of provision the Health Department published guidance in March 1999 on the best organisation and provision of post-natal depression services. The guidance promotes a systematic approach to the prevention, detection and treatment of post-natal depression through an Integrated Care Pathway, involving contributions and resources from all relevant skilled professionals.</p>

  <p>Further, agencies are expected to apply the best practice approaches set out in the recently published Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network evidence-based guidance on <em>Postnatal Depression and Puerperal Psychosis.</em></p>

  <p>Work is also under way to develop information systems which will allow the care of women with post-natal depression to be recorded systematically so that agencies have the information, practice and procedures to screen all women and to arrange appropriate follow-up care.</p>

  <p>The visiting Mental Health and Well-being Support Group published a national summary of current practice and innovations in the organisation of post-natal depression support and services across Scotland at: <a href="www.show.scot.nhs.uk/mhwbsg" target="_blank">www.show.scot.nhs.uk/mhwbsg</a>. The group consider and report on local responses as part of their local and national review process.</p>

  <p>The Health Department guidance is available in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 24358).</p>

  <p>A major implementation programme is well under way, involving relevant officials and agencies across the UK. Scottish Executive and Crown Office officials are represented on the Home Office Implementation Group, and a separate Scottish implementation group has also been set up.</p>

  <p>On 23 August 2002 the Executive published for consultation a draft code of practice in relation to searches for suspected cash, as required by section 293 of the act. The finalised code will be brought into effect by statutory instrument after it has been approved by the Scottish Parliament. The Executive is in the process of recruiting an &quot;appointed person&quot; to scrutinise police use of cash search powers under section 290 and 291 of the act. We intend that the cash provisions in part 5 of the act, and also the money laundering provisions in part 7, will be implemented in December 2002.</p>

  <p>The bulk of the rest of the act will be implemented by February 2003. Prior to that we will also be issuing a draft code on the use of the new investigations powers in part 8. Following consultation, it will be subject to approval by the Scottish Parliament.</p>

  <p>In Scotland, the existing Crown Office Criminal Confiscation Unit is being strengthened and a new Civil Recovery Unit set up. A major training exercise involving procurators fiscal, police, customs and excise officers and other involved in enforcing the act&#146;s provisions is under way.</p>

The SRA published their Strategic Plan in January 2002, a copy of which is available in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 18609). The Strategic Plan sets out the projects that the SRA is seeking to support in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Prosecutors will have a pivotal role in implementing the changes being introduced by the Sexual Offences (Procedures and Evidence) Act that comes into force on 1 November 2002. The act tightens up the rules about using evidence of a rape victim&#146;s sexual history and will prohibit cross-examination of sexual offence victims by the accused. We have also just completed a major review of our investigation and prosecution of serious cases and, as a consequence, are about to embark on a significant exercise to ensure that we have the most effective working practices, supervision and training possible. This will, of course, include rape cases.</p>

  <p>The review is being led by officials within the Justice Department, but is necessarily a cross-cutting exercise involving a number of interests both within and outwith the Executive. As a first stage in this process, officials will be working with ACPOS to consider how the existing guidance can be improved. The review will seek to make sure it has information about different procedures throughout the UK and that it has the benefit of the knowledge and experience of those operating and affected by these procedures, including Scottish Rape Crisis Network and Scottish Women's Aid.</p>

  <p>As part of the implementation of the National Waste Strategy, an Area Waste Plan is being prepared to establish the Best Practicable Environmental Option for waste in the Highland Council area.

In preparing the plan the strategy group, which includes the council, followed published guidance and considered physical, practical, financial, social and environmental constraints.</p>

  <p>The Highland Council is also preparing a public private partnership contract for the treatment and disposal of waste collected by the council. The Executive has been kept informed of the progress of the waste PPP scheme. However, the council has not yet submitted a bid for support from the Strategic Waste Fund. The Executive has not therefore made an assessment about what level of support might be provided to the council to assist in implementing the Highland Area Waste Plan.</p>
