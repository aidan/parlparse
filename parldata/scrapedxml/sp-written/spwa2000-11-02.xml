  <p>I am pleased to inform you that, in response to the current difficulties being faced by the arable sector, the UK Government have now decided to draw down further agri-monetary compensation, subject to EU Commission approval. The Scottish share is &pound;4 million and this will be paid to the Arable Area Payment Scheme 2000 applicants. The compensation reflects the change in the EURO sterling exchange rate in 1999 compared with 2000.</p>

  <p>Argyll and Bute Council and Argyll and the Islands Enterprise were consulted prior to the award of the contract for the provision of the air service between Glasgow and Campbeltown/Tiree. A meeting and further discussions were also held with council representatives. Individuals and organisations, including Tiree Community Council, provided comments on the performance of the air service and these were noted by the Scottish Executive. Article 4 of EC Regulation 2408/92 on access for Community air carriers to intra-community air routes sets down no specific requirements regarding consultation procedures with local organisations about Public Service Obligations for air services.</p>

  <p>The outcome of these studies will be disseminated widely, including to local authorities who have responsibility for dealing with flooding in their area. This will enable councils to take account of climate change in the development of flood prevention measures.</p>

  <p>The Food Standards Agency Meat Inspection Charges Task Force presented its final report on 26 June 2000. It recommends that inspection charges for all plants should be no greater than the EU standard charge, irrespective of the actual costs of veterinary inspection in any particular plant. The Scottish Executive is currently considering the recommendations of the task force and we will announce our decisions as quickly as possible.</p>

  <p>I have also been advised by the Food Standards Agency that a number of measures have already been put in place to assist small to medium-sized abattoirs. These include the freezing of hourly rates for Meat Hygiene Service inspections in 1999-2000 at 1998-99 levels and restricting the increase in 2000-01 to 2.2%, in line with the rate of inflation.</p>

  <p>The Food Standards Agency has advised me that the cost of implementing the recommendations of the report of the Meat Inspection Charges Task Force, assuming 100% OVS supervision in 2000-01, is estimated to be &pound;1.75 million for Scotland out of a GB total of some &pound;19 million.</p>

  <p>In general, GPs serving rural communities receive the same fees and allowances as their urban counterparts. They can also receive support through additional payments and schemes that have been introduced over the years in recognition of the particular circumstances of practice in rural areas. These include schemes to underwrite the income of practices in the most remote areas; to compensate rural GPs for extra travel costs due to the scattered nature of their practice population, and to support eligible single-handed GPs through the employment of qualified associates.</p>

  <p>In addition, the recently established Remote and Rural Resource Centre, based in Inverness, will address problems common to rural health services in all parts of Scotland.</p>

  <p>The doubling of funding for Councils of Voluntary Service will enable the Scottish Executive to support the network right across Scotland for the first time. The additional funding will enable local Councils for Voluntary Service to <strong>:</strong></p>

  <p>increase their support for voluntary organisations in their local area;</p>

  <p>provide comprehensive advice to the voluntary sector on funding;</p>

  <p>work with Local Volunteer Development Agencies and others in the delivery of the Active Communities Initiative;</p>

  <p>participate in the community planning process;</p>

  <p>contribute to the social justice agenda; and</p>

  <p>develop support for social economy activities.</p>

  <p>There are clear community benefits to be gained by increasing the capacity of the voluntary sector infrastructure in this way.</p>

  <p>I am aware of public concern about the spreading of organic waste on land. That is why the Scottish Environment Protection Agency was asked to prepare a Strategic Review of these practices. The Executive is currently considering its response to the public consultation on SEPA&#8217;s recommendations. I hope to make an announcement on this later this year. The results of the consultation are also informing a wider review of the exemptions in the Waste Management Licensing Regulations 1994.</p>

  <p>Through our social justice policy and initiatives such as Social Inclusion Partnerships, New Community Schools, the New Futures Fund and the Rough Sleepers&#8217; Initiative, we are substantially improving opportunities for excluded young people in disadvantaged communities.</p>

  <p>And we have just recently announced a new &pound;100 million drugs package which includes an additional &pound;21 million for education, support and alternative activities for young people and &pound;5 million for community-based drugs projects in SIPs.<br /></p>
