  <p>Local authorities have a duty under the Road Traffic Act 1988 to carry out a programme of measures designed to promote road safety. This includes giving practical training to road users where authorities consider this appropriate.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive provides funding to the Scottish Road Safety Campaign to enable it to produce and distribute to local authorities road safety education resources aimed at children of all ages. These include <i>Smart Moves</i>, a multimedia resource intended for children aged between 10 and 14 years old. This focuses on safer routes to school and aims to develop decision-making and risk assessment skills and a positive attitude to personal safety and responsibility.</p>

  <p>The Executive recognises the need for co-ordinated action working towards greater safety for children travelling to school. Accordingly, guidance was issued recently to local authorities and to every school in Scotland on how to run Safer Routes to School schemes.</p>

  <p>The Executive also funds the Children&#8217;s Traffic Club in Scotland, which offers free road safety education to all three- and four-year-old children in Scotland.</p>

  <p>A manual, entitled <i>Kerbcraft</i>, was issued by the UK Government in 1997 to all Road Safety Units in the United Kingdom. The manual, which provides guidance to enable adult volunteers to train children aged five to seven years old in basic pedestrian skills, is based on the results of a successful pilot project in Glasgow. The Government is also funding a study to explore the effectiveness of computer simulation for the training of five- to ten-year-old pedestrians.</p>

  <p>Access to international blue whiting fisheries is established following negotiations between the EU and other coastal states, most notably Norway under the aegis of the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC). Recent years have seen a considerable and unsustainable increase in effort on this fishery by non-EU countries, with the EC maintaining conservation measures to limit access.</p>

  <p>It would be wrong to reward such unsustainable &quot;olympic&quot; fishing by establishing a related track record.</p>

  <p>In view of this situation, at the December Fisheries Council, Ministers reserved their position on blue whiting, stating in the Council minutes "<u>the Council and Commission</u> will revert to this issue, as appropriate, if negotiations in NEAFC in early 2000 do not result in efficient regulatory measures for the fishing of blue whiting in the Regulatory Area".</p>

  <p>Scottish Executive officials have been fully involved in formulating the current EU negotiating position, and the EU team is well aware of the importance to the Scottish pelagic fleet of continued access to this fishery.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive fully supports the aim of the multi-annual guidance programmes, which is to ensure sustainability of fishing by balancing fishing capacity against resource availability. That is in the long-term interests of our industry, as is the important principle of relative stability.</p>

  <p>The multi-annual programmes are Europe-wide initiatives and the Committee's report needs to be considered, along with other relevant issues, at that level. The Scottish Executive will continue to be fully involved in such discussions, including on any successor arrangements to the current multi-annual guidance programme.</p>

  <p>The proposed increase would comprise, I understand, the second increase over a period of more than three years to reflect inflation and the economic costs of conducting marine surveys.</p>

  <p>The added costs to individual vessel owners arising out of the proposed increase would be negligible. There would seem to be no case for survey costs to the industry to be subsidised by the taxpayer. On that basis, the Scottish Executive does not intend to make representations to DETR regarding the proposals.</p>

  <p>The primary purpose of the scheme is to enhance existing financial risk-sharing arrangements and to improve risk management performance. The introduction from 1 April 2000 of the new financial risk-sharing arrangements for clinical negligence awards and certain categories of non-clinical risk will not change the way in which staff and patients pursue claims against the National Health Service in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Manufacturing industry plays a vital role in the Scottish economy, both as a direct employer and indirectly as a customer for services. The Scottish Executive recognises that the manufacturing sector in Scotland, as in the rest of the UK, faces intense global competition and that its future depends on it becoming more competitive, more innovative and more responsive to the needs of the marketplace. Manufacturing needs to take its rightful place as part of the knowledge-driven economy of the future. The Executive is determined to support manufacturers in achieving this.</p>

  <p>Last June I announced in Parliament that we would be consulting business leaders, trade associations and trade unions to help us develop a way forward for manufacturing. Today we are publishing the results of this work in a report entitled <i>Created In Scotland - The Way Forward for Scottish Manufacturing in the 21st Century</i>. The report describes the great strides forward many firms have made towards improving their performance and how the Executive, in partnership with the UK Government, is committed to improving public support. We shall make improvements in the business environment to minimise overheads on business. We shall encourage acceleration of the use of knowledge and technology to help manufacturers keep pace with new developments. We shall improve the links between the science base and companies to enhance commercialisation of new ideas. We shall enhance skills and training to help the workforce keep pace with developments. Lastly we intend to draw up a campaign to raise the image of the manufacturing sector.</p>

  <p><i>Created in Scotland</i> makes reference to the need for improvement in dealing with potential and actual redundancies, and today we are also publishing a best practice guide entitled <i>Partnership Action for Continuing Employment</i> (PACE). This report results from a wide-ranging consultation exercise with practitioners and other interested parties and identifies a number of proactive methods for dealing with potential and actual company difficulties. PACE does not set out to provide a detailed and prescriptive plan for local agencies, instead it provides a checklist of issues to be considered, a summary of best practice experience, and a toolkit of possible responses which can be adapted and tailored to suit local circumstances. It is vital that all key agencies work together to ensure a coherent and consistent approach to potential and actual job loss and closure announcements across Scotland.</p>

  <p>Copies of the two documents are available in SPICe and on the Scottish Executive website.</p>

  <p>Approximately 11% of police officers in Scotland, including detectives, are specially trained in dealing with victims of rape and 50% of those trained are women. It is more difficult to quantify those specially trained to deal with domestic abuse but all operational officers receive training in recognising and dealing with domestic violence and all forces are actively trying to raise awareness of domestic violence.</p>

  <p>80% of training is provided on a national basis by the Scottish Police College, and awareness training on rape and domestic abuse is incorporated into many of the courses they run, including probationer training.

  <p>Based on the numbers of students liable to make a contribution it is estimated that, when fully operational, &pound;16 million would be contributed to the Scottish Budget each year in resource accounting terms. The actual numbers and level of contribution in each year will depend on a) changes in the size of the student population; b) the proportion of people taking degrees, HNC/HNDs, in exempt categories; c) graduate earnings which will effect the rate of repayment and d) and the total amount of loan taken out by students.</p>

  <p>I received a report on the Postgraduate Students' Allowances Scheme in November last year which made a number of recommendations to change the current system following a review by the Miller Committee. The review took evidence from a wide range of organisations, including the NUS who also had an observer working with the Committee. The report was given to the Cubie inquiry which also made a number of recommendations in this area. We are now considering these and will consult further as appropriate. There will be no change in the current system of funding for 2000-01.</p>

  <p>It is proposed the student support and the Graduate Endowment scheme will apply to Scottish domiciled and EU students entering higher education in Scotland in 2001-02 onwards. Liability to make a contribution will commence on graduation and collection will be income contingent.</p>

  <p>Based on current numbers of EU students graduating from Scottish institutions, it is estimated that, when fully operational, &pound;1 million would be contributed to the Scottish Budget each year in resource accounting terms. The actual numbers and level of contribution in each year will depend on (a) changes in the size of the EU student population; (b) graduate earnings which will affect the rate of repayment and (c) system used for the collection of the liability from graduates whose domicile is not Scotland but other parts of the EU.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive will legislate to place a duty on local authorities (or in the Strathclyde Passenger Transport area, the Passenger Transport Authority) to determine what bus information should reasonably be provided locally. Where agreement cannot be reached with operators to provide the required level of information, local authorities and the PTA will be able to provide such information and will have powers to recover reasonable costs from operators. No additional resources should be required by local authorities from the Executive and we would expect operators to recognise the commercial benefits of providing better information to the travelling public in terms of increased patronage and revenue generation.</p>

  <p>The Executive's legislative proposals relate to joint ticketing arrangements between bus operators in Scotland. The Executive is also working with transport operators and user groups to develop better through ticketing across modes to ensure the most attractive system and maximum flexibility for public transport users. There are many initiatives, either already in place or in preparation, and we shall consider how best to disseminate best practice in this field.</p>

  <p>Our proposals for the Integrated Transport Bill, published on 10 February, state that the workplace parking levy is only likely to be appropriate for major urban centres and larger towns and where proposers can demonstrate that the scheme will achieve congestion benefits. The levy will therefore have no effect on rural employment and employers located in non-urban areas.</p>

  <p>Railtrack are currently improving infrastructure to reduce the journey time between Aberdeen and Inverness by 10 minutes by 2001. To meet the rail industry&#8217;s aspirations of an increased frequency and a further reduction in journey time, additional upgrading of the route would be necessary. I understand that Railtrack and Highlands and Islands Enterprise are considering funding options for a loop between Keith and Elgin, including the possibility of European Regional Development Funding under the Special Programme for the Highlands and Islands.</p>

  <p>My statement on 26 January identified two areas affecting the water industry where the Executive intends to consult.</p>

  <p>The first is competition in the industry and how to ensure that it benefits customers, while public health, environmental and social objectives continue to be met. I plan to publish a consultation document on this in April.</p>

  <p>The second is the standards that the water authorities should meet during the period to be covered by the next strategic charges round to be carried out by the Water Industry Commissioner. These will eventually be published in the next Quality and Standards Paper. Prior to that the Executive will consult on them in draft form in the autumn.</p>

  <p>In addition, I said in my statement that the Executive is considering whether it can improve on the protection from the full impact of water and sewerage charges already provided to the less well off by the current arrangement linking charges to council tax banding. We plan to consult on this during the course of the summer.</p>

  <p>The level of, and proposed increase in, water and sewerage charges depend on the council tax banding of a household&#8217;s property, and the water authority area within which the household is located. Water and sewerage charges are a relatively small element of household expenditure, and the overall effect on the cost of living is similarly small. Nevertheless, the Executive is concerned about the impact of charges on low-income households. It is considering whether there is any scope to improve on the protection already provided by the link between charge levels and council tax bands.</p>
