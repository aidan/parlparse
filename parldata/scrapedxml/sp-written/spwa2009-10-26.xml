  <p>The responses to this consultation resulted in the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006 being passed by the Scottish Parliament. This act revoked the Protection of Animals (Scotland) Act 1912 and its amendments and replaced these provisions with the new act which modernised and strengthened our animal welfare legislation.</p>

  <p>Table 2 shows the percentage of children and adults not registered with an NHS dentist, by NHS board as at 31 March 2009. This does not necessarily reflect the number of people accessing NHS dental treatment, as un-registered patients can access NHS treatment through occasional and emergency dental service arrangements. Other factors can affect the number of people who access NHS dental treatment, such as patient choice to have private treatment.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. NHS board area is based on the postcode of the dental practice.</p>

  <p>2. 2007 mid-year population estimates are used to calculate the percentage registered and are sourced from the General Register&rsquo;s Office.</p>

  <p>3. Registrations (numerator) are based on the postcode of the practice where the patient has registered with a general dental practitioner. The population (denominator) is based on where the patient resides. In some cases, the natural &quot;cross-boundary flow&quot; of people residing in one area but registered with a dentist whose practice is based in another area is such that the number of people registered exceeds the actual population of that geographical area (and therefore the level exceeds 100%). Conversely, a geographical area where there are few or no dental practices may appear to have a much lower number (and therefore level) of people registered.</p>

  <p>Table 2 below shows the percentage of children and adults not registered with an NHS dentist, by parliamentary constituency as at 31 March 2009. This does not necessarily reflect the number of people accessing NHS dental treatment, as un-registered patients can access NHS treatment through occasional and emergency dental service arrangements. Other factors can affect the number of people who access NHS dental treatment, such as patient choice to have private treatment.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. NHS parliamentary constituency area is based on the postcode of the dental practice.</p>

  <p>2. 2007 mid-year population estimates are used to calculate the percentage registered and are sourced from the General Register&rsquo;s Office.</p>

  <p>3. Registrations (numerator) are based on the postcode of the practice where the patient has registered with a general dental practitioner. The population (denominator) is based on where the patient resides. In some cases, the natural &quot;cross-boundary flow&quot; of people residing in one area but registered with a dentist whose practice is based in another area is such that the number of people registered exceeds the actual population of that geographical area (and therefore the level exceeds 100%). Conversely, a geographical area where there are few or no dental practices may appear to have a much lower number (and therefore level) of people registered.</p>

  <p>4. A number of constituencies in table 1 show registration rates over 100% due to cross-boundary flow. In such cases, the percentage of patients not registered with a dentist is shown in the above table as &quot;-&quot;.</p>

  <p>On 30 June 2009, the Information Services Division of NHS Scotland published its report <em>Provision of Injecting Equipment in Scotland 2007-08, </em> which detailed the findings of a survey of injecting equipment provision in Scotland in 2007-08. This survey, which was commissioned as part of the Hepatitis C Phase 2 Action Plan, found that there was a total of 169 pharmacy-based injecting equipment provision services across Scotland in 2007-08. However, this figure reflects only those pharmacies that responded to the survey, and gaps in the data does exist. Therefore, the actual number of pharmacy-based injecting equipment provision services may be higher.</p>

  <p>The information from 2007-08 survey provides a baseline of injecting equipment provision in Scotland at the start of the Hepatitis C Phase 2 Action Plan. A follow-up survey covering the period 2008-09 is planned to run in February 2010, with the results being published in November 2010.</p>

  <p>I believe that by broadening the references to active travel, as outlined in my responses to S3W-27967 and S3W-27969 on 26 October 2009, it has a higher profile in the final version of the health and wellbeing experiences and outcomes which are at the heart of Curriculum for Excellence. In addition, <em>Health and wellbeing across learning</em> summarises and emphasises those aspects of health and wellbeing, including active travel, that are the responsibility of everyone in the school community. The message to staff across the school community about supporting the health and fitness agenda has therefore been strengthened.</p>

  <p>The experiences and outcomes within the health and wellbeing strand of the new curriculum will deliver positive benefits for active travel and road safety. Partnerships will have a vital role in supporting their delivery and will include school travel coordinators, active schools and road safety officers. It is important to recognise that the outcome &quot;I know and can demonstrate how to travel safely&quot; is supported by the explanation in the appendix that &quot;This applies to all kinds of travel &ndash; whether on foot, bicycle, motor vehicle or public transport. To support the reduction of road accidents, it is the responsibility of all adults to teach and encourage good road safety practice and to reinforce this by modelling appropriate behaviour&quot;.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>*It is important to note that the table shows overall starts for each programme across lowland Scotland only.</p>

  <p>**Dumfries and Galloway local training providers will have delivered MAs outside the area classified for data management purposes. Given the important local nature of this delivery we have provided this information in the last row of each table.</p>

  <p>Creating the appropriate grid infrastructure to support future renewable energy developments in the Pentland Firth and throughout Scotland is a priority for the Scottish Government. It is also a key recommendation of the <em>Marine Energy Roadmap</em> , published by the Forum for Renewable Energy Development in Scotland&rsquo;s Marine Energy Group in August 2009.</p>

  <p>In response to this recommendation, the Scottish Government is working closely with National Grid and transmission companies through both the Marine Energy Group and the Pentland Firth Coordination Committee to help synchronise developer activity and deliver grid capacity for the projects emerging from the Pentland Firth leasing round.</p>

  <p>The carbon assessment of the draft budget provides, for the first time, an estimate of the consequences of government spending in terms of carbon emissions. The assessment highlights in which sectors of the economy the emissions associated with our spending are taking place. Raising awareness of this pattern of emissions is a first step towards taking action to reduce the carbon attributable to public sector expenditure and thereby more sustainable ways of working.</p>

  <p>In addition to direct emissions associated with expenditure by the public sector, the assessment also includes the emissions associated with related increases in private consumption spending, termed &quot;induced emissions&quot;.

  <p>High labour market participation and increased solidarity and cohesion, as well as environmental sustainability, are key targets for achieving the Government Purpose of sustainable economic growth. Reducing salaries has unpredictable impacts and could, through lowering the cost of production as a result of lower labour costs, encourage higher production and consumption, and hence emissions. The <em>Climate Change Delivery Plan</em> , published in June, sets out how we intend to reduce Scotland&rsquo;s emissions and in doing so, develop more sustainable ways of living and working in Scotland.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it considers that the inclusion of induced emissions resulting from increases in employment and salaries in the carbon assessment of the draft budget 2010-11 creates an incentive for Scottish Government departments to reduce projected emissions by reducing job numbers and paying lower wages rather than by finding more sustainable ways of working.</p>

  <p>In addition, reducing expenditure in the budget will reduce the associated projected emissions in the carbon assessment. However, in order to genuinely reduce emissions a real reduction in the carbon intensity of the goods and services used by the public sector is required. This cannot be achieved simply through cuts in expenditure but must result from a progressive decoupling of emissions from economic activity over time.</p>

The figures can therefore be reconciled to those provided by Treasury.</p>

  <p>In commenting on the 2010-11 draft budget, I made clear that the cut of approximately &pound;500 million was the net result of decisions announced in the Chancellor&rsquo;s April 2009 budget.

  <p>As noted in the answer to question S3W-11472 on 30 April 2008, under current constitutional arrangements the organisation of HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) services in Scotland is a matter for that department. However, the Scottish Government has an interest in the maintenance of an appropriate level of service across Scotland, and in the number and proportion of HMRC jobs located in Scotland. We are aware of the decisions that have been made to reduce the number of buildings HMRC occupy in the Glasgow and Edinburgh areas and that a programme of reviews is ongoing in respect of other offices, and that both impact on staffing levels.</p>
