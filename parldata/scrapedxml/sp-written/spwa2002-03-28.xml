  <p>The Scottish Executive supports the development of breakfast clubs in a number of ways.</p>

  <p>Childcare Strategy funding (&#163;16.75 million in 2002-03) is allocated to local authorities who, with Childcare Partnerships, make decisions on its disbursement to meet local childcare needs. The Executive has allocated an additional &#163;8 million to local authorities as part of the Childcare Strategy funding over 2001-04 to help support and stabilise fragile out of school care provision, including breakfast clubs.</p>

  <p>New Community Schools have the twin aims of promoting social inclusion and raising educational standards in Scotland. Many New Community Schools have been involved in setting up breakfast clubs where there is perceived need.</p>

  <p>One of the priorities identified for the Health Improvement Fund, which has allocated &#163;26 million per annum towards improving public health until 2003-04, is improving the diet of children. This includes supporting the provision of breakfast clubs.</p>

  <p>We believe that by increasing community engagement in the planning and delivery of public services we will deliver improved service outcomes that better meet the needs of communities. The Better Neighbourhood Services Fund gives &#163;90 million over three years to local authorities to work with communities to deliver services and to identify local outcome targets. We have also recently published proposals in respect of community budgeting and invited views on a requirement to engage communities in the community planning process. The forthcoming Community Regeneration Statement will say more about our policy in this area.</p>

  <p>At national level the health budget will rise from &#163;5.9 billion this year to &#163;6.9 billion in 2003-04, representing around one third of the total Scottish Executive budget. It is important that local NHS boards and trusts are able to take decisions about the allocation of the resources at local level to meet local needs and priorities.</p>

  <p>The wide-ranging review of audiology services commissioned by the Executive will monitor the extent of the implementation of the guidance, and will provide robust evidence and recommendations on how NHSScotland should address shortfalls identified. The review will provide an initial profile of staffing and training in March ahead of its final report in the autumn.</p>

  <p>The available information is given in the table.

  <p>It is likely that sections 93 and 94 do provide a power to introduce a deposit-refund scheme.

  <p>NHS boards are responsible for deciding the number of consultants employed locally. They are best placed to determine the staff needed to meet demands in their areas. However, the Scottish Executive carry out an annual review of the Specialist Registrar establishment with the Scottish Council for Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education. The review determines the number of higher specialist training posts to be made available for each speciality to fill consultant vacancies in the future.</p>

  <p>The provision of respite and palliative care is the responsibility of local authorities and NHS boards to be determined in line with local need.</p>

  <p>In 1999 the Scottish Executive doubled the funds available to local authorities for respite care and the support of carers from &#163;5 million per year to &#163;10 million through the <i>Strategy for Carers</i>. The Executive has made available additional resources, rising to &#163;11 million per year, in response to the <i>Royal Commission Report on Long Term Care</i>. By 2003-04 this should increase respite provision across Scotland by 22,000 weeks a year.</p>

  <p>In 2001 a report <i>Palliative Care for Young People Aged 13 &#8211; 24 years</i> provided guidance on helping young people through life threatening and life limiting illness. The next round of funding from the <i>New Opportunities Fund</i> will aim to further develop palliative care for children and adults. I recently announced a grant of &#163;1 million to support the development of a second children&#8217;s hospice in Scotland.</p>

  <p>In the third quarter of 2001, July to September, 3,471 letters were received for ministerial reply of which 64% received a reply within 17 working days; and 81% received a reply within 25 working days. This performance is similar to the second quarter when 64% of letters received a reply within 17 working days and 82% received a reply within 25 working days and an improvement on the first quarter of 2001 when 60% and 79% of letters respectively received replies within 17 and 25 working days.</p>

  <p>In the fourth quarter of 2001, October to December, 3,560 letters were received for ministerial reply of which 69% received a reply within 17 working days; and 86% received a reply within 25 working days. This is an improved performance on the third quarter. In the last quarter of 2000 only 39% of letters received a reply within 17 working days. There has been a continuous improvement in performance over all four quarters of 2001, but partly because of the ministerial changes in November and partly because of other pressures on some departments in the Executive the targets of 80% and 100% for the most recent quarter have not been met.</p>

  <p>I have decided to retain the same targets for 2002 and I shall continue to report performance quarterly.</p>

  <p>Additional targets, covering serious violent crime and vehicle crime, have been arrived at following detailed consultation with the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland and the Convenors of police authorities. These new targets are being set for the Scottish police to achieve by the year 2003-04.</p>

  <p>All of the police targets are intended to build on local plans and existing strategies and to provide a national focus for key areas. The Vehicle Crime target also encompasses the existing national target for car crime set by the UK Government in September 1998.</p>

  <p>These new targets are as follows:</p>

  <p><u>Serious Violent Crime </u></p>

  <p>A reduction in the number of recorded incidents of serious violent crime of five per cent.</p>

  <p>An increase in the detection rate of serious violent crime of 4.1 percentage points.</p>

  <p>Progress is reported yearly in our <i>Social Justice Annual Report</i> , which was published in November 2001. There is still much to do and it is important that we keep our approach to community regeneration under review and that we continue to learn from experience. We will set out further details of our future priorities and approach in our community regeneration statement, which we will publish shortly.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how it is tackling abuse of volatile substances.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-03-28.S1O-4962.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80216" speakername="Mrs Mary Mulligan" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0328.htm#33">

  <p>Volatile substance abuse is addressed within Scotland's drugs strategy. Drug Action Teams (DATs) are asked to include it in their corporate action plans. According to the 2000-01 DAT Corporate Planning exercise, there are 99 drug agencies in Scotland which provide a service for volatile substance abusers.</p>

  <p>The Executive's investment of an additional &#163;13 million over three years for drug treatment will ensure an expansion of services, including those catering for volatile substance abusers. Organisations supported by the Executive produce materials which address the risks of volatile substance abuse. For example, in 2000, the Scottish Drugs Forum and the Health Education Board for Scotland collaborated with others to publish <i>Volatile Substance Abuse - Guidance for Professionals</i>, produced in support of new legislation which prohibits the sale of butane gas lighter refills to under 18s.</p>
