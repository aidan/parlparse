  <p>Social security benefits including housing and council tax benefits are reserved matters and are the responsibility of the DSS.

Further to that, the Benefit Fraud Inspectorate will continue its programme of inspections of Scottish local authorities.</p>

  <p>The Ministry of Defence land at Cape Wrath is used by all NATO forces and has been in use as a bombing range since at least 1933. I understand from the Ministry of Defence that the use of the range by US Navy ships last weekend was part of the normal activity on the range.</p>

  <p>I am assured by Scottish Natural Heritage that the controlled use of the range is consistent with the maintenance of the nature conservation value of the area, which has been classified as a Special Protection Area under the EC Birds Directive in recognition of the bird life which co-exists successfully with the operation of the range.</p>

  <p>The range area is not in agricultural use.</p>

  <p>As from academic session 1999-2000, Disabled Student Allowance was extended to part-time students undertaking the equivalent of 50% or more of equivalent full time courses. Students on the fourteen-month, two-day social care course should therefore qualify for assistance. However, the rules are complex and students should approach the Student Awards Agency for Scotland for advice on their individual circumstances.</p>

  <p>All members of staff in the NHS bear some responsibility for infection control. However, Infection Control Teams within Trusts have particular responsibility for infection control. These teams are multi-disciplinary in nature and involve staff with professional backgrounds as diverse as catering and management.</p>

  <p>The majority of those in infection control teams are infection control nurses. Data on the numbers of infection control nurses is not collected separately by ISD Scotland, being included under general nursing.</p>

  <p>The medical specialty which concerns itself most with infection control is medical microbiology and virology, although it should be borne in mind that medical staff are quite a small part of the infection control team. The number of medical microbiology consultants per 1,000 acute beds in Scotland is 3.5 for beds available in the acute specialties. (<i>&quot;</i>Acute&quot; comprises the following specialty groups: acute surgical, acute medical, dental, GP other than obstetrics, radiology specialties, unspecified and excludes the following specialty groups: obstetrics, geriatric medicine, psychiatric and learning disabilities). The number for beds available to all specialties is 1.5 per 1,000.</p>

  <p>Because &quot;infection control practitioner&quot; is not a defined activity and infection control teams are diverse, it is not possible to state the ratio of infection control practitioners per acute core bed, or to project future ratios.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive which of the options offered in the discussion paper <i>A Single Social Housing Tenancy for Scotland; Rights, Responsibilities and Obligations</i> for introducing the single social tenancy, as between phasing or a &quot;big bang&quot; approach, it now proposes to pursue in the light of responses to the paper and what it proposes in relation to the extension of special needs exemptions from the right to buy.</p>

  <p>As we made clear in the discussion paper, our priority is to secure common rights, based on the single social tenancy, for all tenants provided that this does not prejudice the viability of landlords. In the light of representations that the financial wellbeing of individual housing associations could be adversely affected if their existing assured tenants were all given the right to buy at once (the &quot;big bang&quot; approach), we are considering whether, and if so in what precise financial circumstances, housing associations might be given the ability to opt out of the right to buy element of the single social tenancy for a specified period, in respect of properties occupied by assured tenants who do not have the right to buy.</p>

  <p>We are also continuing with consultations on further exemptions from the right to buy for houses built for persons with special needs. There is a strong case for exempting sales of individual houses where this would undermine the integrity of a group of houses specifically provided for persons with particular needs. We are, therefore, considering the possibility of exempting not only sheltered housing schemes with a warden service and call system but also other forms of group homes with support provided and groups of houses specifically provided for elderly persons.</p>

  <p>We will be discussing these possible courses of action with key housing interests and an announcement on the outcome will be made when these discussions and our consultations have been completed.</p>

The Scottish Executive maintains regular contact with DETR on a range of matters, including coastal waters. I understand there are no plans to regulate the use of jet skis in coastal waters.</p>

  <p>When I announced the outcome of the Strategic Roads Review on 4 November 1999, I noted that responsibility for progressing the M74 proposals would continue to rest with the City of Glasgow and South Lanarkshire Councils. At my meeting in December with representatives of Glasgow City, South Lanarkshire and Renfrewshire Councils, I indicated that I wished my officials to offer advice and assistance to the Councils as they developed their thinking on the scheme. As a result, Scottish Executive officials have since met the Councils on a number of occasions and are keeping closely in touch with progress.</p>

  <p>My officials and officials of Enterprise Ayrshire and Locate in Scotland have been working closely with Volvo since the closure announcement in an attempt to secure a continuing engineering operation on the Irvine site.</p>

  <p>Locate in Scotland, Enterprise Ayrshire and the Scottish Executive have been acting as brokers between Volvo and potentially interested parties and have also been working with Volvo and other members of the Volvo Liaison Group (including North Ayrshire Council and unions from the Volvo plant at Irvine) to market the site and its highly skilled workforce. Approximately 1,000 marketing brochures have been sent out by LiS to a wide range of manufacturing companies across the globe. Enterprise Ayrshire commissioned an industry specialist to identify opportunities for alternative manufacturing at the Volvo site that would utilise the considerable skills of the workforce. We have also been attempting to stimulate interest by approaching a number of companies directly, at home and abroad. There has been no positive outcome to any of these endeavours.</p>

  <p>I am confident that every possible avenue has been explored in terms of UK and worldwide opportunities. Unfortunately, despite these exhaustive efforts to find an alternative user for the plant, it has not been possible to identify a successor user before the closure of the plant at the end of June.</p>

  <p>Discussions with potential investors about possible financial assistance are always carried out on a commercially confidential basis. I can, however, confirm that any interested party has been made aware of the range of support potentially available. This will continue to be the case.</p>

  <p>Local agencies remain committed to providing support and advice to the workforce and supporting retraining and upskilling to meet local labour market requirements. To date some 300 employees have taken advantage of the retraining and upskilling opportunities available. Support mechanisms provided by key local agencies will remain in place until the closure date.</p>

  <p>Officials from the Scottish Executive, Enterprise Ayrshire and Locate in Scotland will continue to promote the value of the site and the skilled workforce to all potentially interested parties.</p>

  <p>The Executive and local agencies will continue to liaise with Volvo over the future of the site. Volvo has now appointed property agents to carry out an option appraisal on possible future use.</p>

  <p>PFI projects in the water and sewerage sector are essential schemes needed to meet the requirements of the Urban Waste Water Treatment (Scotland) Regulations 1994. This investment is therefore unavoidable and it is for the authorities to achieve a value for money solution. The water authorities in these cases consider PFI the most appropriate means of implementing these schemes, through a process of competitive tendering. These costs are a factor the Water Industry Commissioner will take into account in providing advice on future charges.</p>

  <p>The Corporate Body has taken account of the existing number of researchers employed by each party, for which no allowance had been made in the original design. It has also had to consider other emerging demands for space resulting, for example, from additional parliamentary staff required to meet member&#8217;s requirements. However, all space requirements will now be revisited by the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body in parallel with the review being led by John Spencely and his team.</p>
