  <p>On 20 April 2009, I announced that a new body would be established, building on the Scottish Advisory Committee on Drugs Misuse, with a clear remit to oversee the successful implementation of the drugs strategy. The new body would be named the Drugs Strategy Delivery Commission and would have a greater degree of independence from government, with an independent chair. People would be invited to sit on the Drugs Strategy Delivery Commission because of their personal expertise and experience; these would be unpaid appointments.</p>

  <p>We are currently finalising arrangements for the new commission; no meetings have yet taken place. It will be for the new commission to decide its plan of work and how that work will be reported (including the publication of minutes and findings). It is envisaged that the commission will meet approximately quarterly and that it will be able to establish sub-groups on specific subjects, as well as developing appropriate links with existing groups including the National Evidence Group and the Drug-Related Deaths Group.</p>

  <p>All public bodies are subject to the requirements of the public sector duties set out in equalities legislation. It is expected therefore that councils will have due regard to the promotion of equality and elimination of discrimination in developing their strategic plans, but it is for councils to decide how they meet the duties.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is not responsible for monitoring the implementation of the disability equality duty. It is for individual organisations to ensure that they comply with the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) and disability equality duty. The Equality and Human Rights Commission is the body responsible for enforcing the DDA and the disability equality duty.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how it is supporting investment in capital projects by businesses.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-08-12.S3W-25860.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80347" speakername="Jim Mather" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa0812.htm#4">

  <p>The Scottish Government and its agencies support businesses investing in capital projects through a number of grant schemes.</p>

  <p>Regional Selective Assistance (RSA) is our main national grant scheme to industry aimed at encouraging investment and job creation in Scotland. In 2008-09, businesses across a wide range of sectors accepted 88 offers of RSA totalling over &pound;52.1 million. These offers relate to projects with planned capital expenditure of over &pound;518.4 million and the expected creation or safeguarding of over 5000 jobs.</p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise (SE) also supports both fixed and working capital investment by businesses in a variety of ways:</p>

  <p>Helping key businesses to seek funding from investors, banks etc, through an account management service and other business advisory services;</p>

  <p>Providing investment finance through three main funds &ndash; the Scottish Seed Fund, Scottish Co-investment Fund and Scottish Venture Fund;</p>

  <p>Providing property support to businesses through a number of EC approved schemes, including the Property Support Scheme, Support for Capital Investment and the Land Remediation Scheme. Through these schemes, SE can provide capital grants, loans and guarantees and can enter into joint ventures and other partnerships or collaborative projects.</p>

  <p>A range of support is available towards capital investment in energy efficiency measures:</p>

  <p>Energy Saving Scotland Small Business Loans scheme provides interest-free loans of between &pound;1,000 and &pound;100,000 for capital investment in energy efficiency measures and, as of December 2008, renewable technologies. Such measures help SME&rsquo;s to save energy, cut carbon emissions and improve competitiveness.</p>

  <p>Our processing and marketing grant schemes for agriculture and fisheries products support capital investment by businesses involved in the food chain.</p>

  <p>From 1 April 2009, many Scottish businesses have also seen their rates bill removed or reduced through the Small Business Bonus Scheme. As noted by Andy Willox, Scottish Policy Convener of the Federation of Small Businesses, this is easing the well documented cash-flow worries for small businesses, releasing savings which can be reinvested in the business.</p>

  <p>The legislation governing private landlords (the Antisocial Behaviour etc (Scotland) Act 2004) places a duty on local authorities to provide advice on general letting issues to landlords who apply for registration, and to tenants and prospective tenants who enquire about letting practice or landlord registration. In addition, many local authorities issue regular newsletters which are intended to keep the sector informed about the law and their responsibilities as landlords.</p>

  <p>We have provided each local authority with templates of guidance and advice leaflets for them to distribute and many offer this information on their websites. Most local authorities also provide their own publicity of the scheme.</p>

  <p>We will consider the options for increasing general awareness of the scheme through appropriate publicity and other means.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of the publication of the Inclusion Scotland report, <em>Freedom of Information Research into Accessible Housing for Disabled People in Scotland</em> , in June 2009, what is being done to ensure that local authorities hold adequate information on (a) the number of disabled people living in their area and (b) average waiting times for adapted homes.</p>

  <p>In March 2008, the Scottish Government published new guidance for local authorities on housing need and demand assessment. This provides a step-by-step approach to assessing housing need and demand across all tenures and includes advice on how to produce an estimate of need and demand amongst household groups who have specific housing requirements. Data and evidence on the housing needs of disabled people will be collected as part of this assessment.</p>

  <p>Local authorities are not required to record information on average waiting times for adapted homes, but some find it helpful to do so as part of their own monitoring processes.</p>

  <p>The National Strategy for Offender Management highlighted communication as one of its key themes. <em>Protecting Scotland&rsquo;s Communities</em> , published in December 2008, continues this theme. In particular, we are working with the Community Justice Authorities to develop, in partnership with a range of key agencies, ways of engaging with communities in order to present factual information about what community sentences involve and how well they are performing. The Fife and Forth Valley Community Service Visibility project is one such initiative, one successful aim of which was to increase the number of requests from the community for projects.</p>

  <p>Sentencing decisions are a matter for the sentencing judge, who hears all the facts and circumstances surrounding the offence and the offender, and is able to take into account any factors which he or she considers to be relevant.</p>

  <p>While Scottish ministers can neither comment on nor intervene in the sentences imposed in individual cases, we do want to see greater consistency and transparency in the decisions of our courts. We believe that government has a responsibility to ensure that Scotland has the appropriate framework in place to promote fairness and justice in sentencing. In light of this, we have taken forward proposals for the creation of a Scottish Sentencing Council which will develop a system of sentencing guidelines. The provisions for the creation of the Sentencing Council are included in the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Bill, which was published on 6 March 2009.</p>

  <p>Our proposals in the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Bill, which was published on 6 March 2009, include provisions for a flexible new Community Payback Order to tackle the causes of offending behaviour as well as responding to its effect. Courts will have the opportunity as part of such an order to impose one or more of a range of requirements on an offender, including any unpaid work and other activity requirement, which will provide opportunity for an offender to make payback to his or her local community and to get his or her life back on track. Different approaches will work best in different areas, but these are the underpinning principles on which we are seeking to develop the use of payback.</p>

  <p>In March 2008, all Community Justice Authorities (CJAs) were invited to submit bids for challenge funding to support the delivery of innovative community service visibility projects. Three CJAs received the following funding for six months pilot exercises:</p>

  <p>Fife and Forth Valley - &pound;13,530.</p>

  <p>Glasgow - &pound;35,000.</p>

  <p>South West Scotland - &pound;20,000.</p>

  <p>In addition, all CJAs have been provided with additional funding to support the delivery of credible and robust community service orders. In the 2009-10 financial year, injection of an additional &pound;2 million for this purpose has been followed by a further &pound;1.5 million. The additional funding broken down by individual CJA is as follows:</p>

  <p>Sheriff Tierney&rsquo;s comments arose from the circumstances of a specific community service order for which Aberdeen City Council was responsible. In addition to the particular circumstances of this case, the authority has encountered a number of operational difficulties in recent months arising from staffing shortages. We understand that additional staff have now been recruited and that a reduction in waiting times is anticipated.</p>

  <p>We remain committed to the development of community penalties. That is why earlier this year revised guidance was issued for the management of community service schemes and performance by local authorities against the new guidance will be monitored. We have also allocated an additional &pound;5.5 million over the current and next financial years, specifically to allow improvement in the delivery of community service and in preparation for the introduction of Community Payback Orders.</p>

  <p>In 2006, the Scottish Government published a <em>Planning Advice Note (PAN) 78: Inclusive Design</em> to promote awareness of the benefits and means of delivering a more inclusive, accessible built environment. This document outlines roles and responsibilities in this respect and identifies sources of information, including British Standards (BS) 8300, which can assist in this process.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government was also involved in the development of guidance on the provision of Changing Places toilets that now forms part of BS 8300: 2008, and remains involved in the ongoing development of this document and other sources of good practice guidance on accessibility of the built environment.</p>

  <p>Provision of Changing Places toilets is identified as a further good practice issue within the 2007 Scottish Building Standards. Whilst there is no statutory obligation to provide such facilities under building regulations, such information is highlighted to developers and owners for consideration in the planning of facilities within buildings.</p>
