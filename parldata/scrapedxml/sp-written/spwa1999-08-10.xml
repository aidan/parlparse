  <p>Civil servants from the Scottish Executive are being loaned to the Scotland Office rather than being transferred. Those staff involved will have a guaranteed right of return to the Executive once the 3-year loan period has expired. The number of civil servants on loan to the Scotland Office at the present time is 56. A number of further loans seem likely as the Scotland Office&#146;s staffing needs are firmed up.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no proposals at present to increase the number of identified bathing waters in Scotland. As recently as February 1999 an additional 37 identified bathing waters were designated in Scotland.</p>

  <p>However, I will keep this matter under review and a further identification exercise will be undertaken when it is appropriate to do so.</p>

  <p>Entry requirements for the Scottish Premier Division are a matter for the Scottish Premier League. Government Ministers would not normally seek to intervene in matters that are the responsibility of the relevant football authorities.</p>

  <p>The then Secretary of State did, however, grant Falkirk Football Club planning permission in May 1996 for the development of a 15,000 all-seater football stadium and associated facilities at Westfield Farm, Falkirk. Following a recent meeting with Falkirk Council I understand that Falkirk FC now intends to build a 10,000 seater stadium. This would require Falkirk FC to submit a fresh planning application to the local authority.</p>

  <p>Investigations into the circumstances of the death of Ian Godley in February 1998 are not considered to be closed.

  <p>The UK Government have been kept fully aware of the Scottish Executive&#146;s recognition of the potential benefits to the Scottish economy which could arise through the further liberalisation of airfreight services. They are also aware that we are keen to ensure that economic development generally and inward investment are not disadvantaged by unnecessary restrictions on air services.</p>

  <p>Roadside digital imaging sensors are being provided and installed on some sections of the Scottish trunk road network by Trafficmaster plc at no cost to the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>These sensors will be used by Trafficmaster plc to provide up to the minute traffic information to subscribers of in-car units.

  <p>These figures are based upon 1999-00 rates.</p>

  <p>MSPs&#146; salaries for the current year are based on the period from 8 May 1999 to 31 March 2000. The figures are based on the salary rates set out in The Scotland Act 1998 (Transitory and Transitional Provisions)(Salaries and Allowances) Order 1999 and take account of reductions for Members who hold dual mandates. Annual uprating is provided for in the Transitional Order but the rate is not yet known.</p>

  <p>The figure for MSPs&#146; allowances is based on the Members&#146; Allowances Scheme agreed by the Parliament on 8 June and includes provision of &pound;5,000 per Member for information technology and office equipment. For the current year, figures are based on the period from 8 June 1999 to 31 March 2000. Figures for the following years are estimates. While some allowances are capped and the maximum amount can be reliably estimated, others, such as the Members&#146; Travel Allowance, are demand-led and totals are more difficult to predict. The Allowances Scheme makes provision for annual uprating of allowances on 1 April each year by the amount of increase in the Retail Price Index for the previous financial year.</p>

  <p>The running costs provision for the Scottish Parliament in 1999-00 is &pound;29.320m. This figure was agreed in early 1998 during the UK Government&#146;s Comprehensive Spending Review and was based on the information available and assumptions made at that time. Given the lapse of time, a number of items and costs have changed. Experience of operating the Parliament has also shown that some estimates, including that for Members&#146; allowances, were over-optimistic. Parliamentary staff are keeping the budget and expenditure against it under constant review and it is likely that additional resources will be required. Once a further review of budgets &#150; which will include identifying savings - has been completed, the SPCB will be invited to consider seeking additional resources.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Parliament Corporate Body&#146;s budget has been disaggregated only for 1999-2000 at this time. The Directorate budgets for 2000-01 will be set before the start of that year and will be informed by the projected budgetary spend of the Directorates during this first year. The table below sets out the current disaggregation of the 1999-2000 budget. The budget for committees is within the total for the Clerking Directorate. Budgets have not been set for individual Committees but the expenditure incurred by each will be reported at the end of the financial year when actual expenditure is known.</p>
