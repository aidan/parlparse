  <p>The strategy seeks to address the challenges facing beekeepers, and provides a plan of action that will sustain the health of honey bees and beekeeping in Scotland for the next decade.</p>

  <p>The Dentists Act 1984 restricts the business of dentistry to dentists and dental bodies corporate so the question does not arise in relation to commercial companies in general. The position of dental bodies corporate in particular is set out in my answer to S3W-16357 on 30 September 2008. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at: <a href="../../../webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a> .</p>

  <p>Currently, only individual general dental practitioners can be listed with NHS boards in order to provide NHS general dental services (GDS) and be eligible for financial support in their own right. Dentists employed by dental bodies corporate can apply individually to join NHS board dental lists in order to provide GDS in an area but the body corporate itself cannot currently join the list. Provisions in the Smoking, Health and Social Care Act 2005 that have yet to be commenced would enable dental bodies corporate also to be listed with NHS boards for the provision of general dental services and therefore access financial support in their own right.</p>

  <p>No. The Dentists Act 1984 already restricts the business of dentistry to dentists and dental bodies corporate and, at present, only individual general dental practitioners can be listed with NHS boards to provide NHS general dental services.

  <p>Responsibility for the overall provision of NHS general dental services in the area rests with NHS Highland.</p>

  <p>The board has already expanded its salaried service and have a number of additional projects planned across Highland for the further expansion of this service. The above will result in the creation of an additional 29 dental surgeries and the registration of a minimum additional 29,000 patients under NHS arrangements.</p>

  <p>In addition, the board is trying to encourage more independent dentists into the area by raising awareness of the grants which are available under the Scottish Dental Access Initiative.</p>

  <p>The Environmental Protection Act (EPA) 1990 places a duty on various bodies to clear litter from their land. For public beaches, the duty body is the relevant council. How local authorities go about fulfilling that duty and what resources they use is entirely up to them, provided they meet the cleanliness standards in the Code of Practice on Litter and Refuse (COPLAR).</p>

  <p>A local authority&rsquo;s duties only extend to the high-water mark and only on public land - although they can require private owners to take appropriate action through declaring a Litter Control Area under the EPA 1990. Below this level, duties are generally reserved, although the Scottish Government has now extended local authority responsibility to areas designated as bathing waters under the Bathing Waters (Scotland) Regulations 2008 (from 2011).</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not hold information on local authorities who take on responsibility for the cleaning of beaches in their areas. However, several local authorities are confirmed as cleansing their &quot;Amenity&quot; and &quot;Recreational&quot; beaches, as part of the beach award programmes administered by Keep Scotland Beautiful. These are: Aberdeen; Aberdeenshire; Angus; Argyll and Bute; City of Edinburgh; Dundee; East Lothian; Fife; Highland; North Ayrshire; Scottish Borders; Shetland, and South Ayrshire.</p>

  <p>In March 2006, Scottish ministers published the strategy, &quot;Better bathing waters: meeting the challenges of the revised Bathing Water Directive in Scotland&quot;. This included proposals for tackling litter pollution at designated bathing waters. Designated bathing waters are those beaches most heavily used by the Scottish public.</p>

  <p>Measures proposed in the strategy have since been implemented through the Bathing Waters (Scotland) Regulations 2008 and through the launch of a grant scheme to fund community support of local designated sites.</p>

  <p>I am aware that Stena Line&rsquo;s proposed move from Stranraer to Old House Point is critical to the regeneration of Stranraer and can assure you that Scottish Enterprise and the Scottish Government will continue to engage closely with the company in respect of its proposed relocation. I understand that the outline timeframe for the development indicates that work on the new terminal could be complete and services operational by mid 2010.</p>

  <p>As the lead responsibility for the redevelopment of Stranraer waterfront lies with Dumfries and Galloway Council, it would be for the council to advise on progress in this regard. However, the Scottish Government and Scottish Enterprise will be following developments closely and will continue to work with Dumfries and Galloway Council to help exploit the opportunities arising from the regeneration of Stranraer and its wider area.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is keen to see the proposed redevelopment of Stranraer waterfront succeed and deliver benefits for the community and the wider region. Lead responsibility for the project lies with the local authority and the funding package is therefore primarily a matter for Dumfries and Galloway Council.</p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise however remains involved to support aspects of this project where there is a close fit with its remit and priorities. While any assistance that might be considered would be an operational matter for Scottish Enterprise, I am aware that in the past four years its investment to date in the strategic vision of Stranraer and Loch Ryan is some &pound;2.5 million towards site investigations, market research, business planning and contributions towards early action projects including removal of redundant infrastructure, installation of new infrastructure and facilities such as pontoons and a breakwater. I am also aware that Scottish Enterprise is currently giving consideration as to how it might assist Stena Line&rsquo;s proposed relocation which, as I understand it, is seen locally as integral to the regeneration.</p>

  <p>The proposed redevelopment of Stranraer waterfront has long been regarded as a local regeneration priority and there are no plans for that to change.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does however wish to see the proposal succeed and deliver benefits to the community and the wider region. It will therefore continue to engage with Dumfries and Galloway Council, which has lead responsibility for local regeneration issues, along with Scottish Enterprise and other local partners to help progress this important project.</p>

  <p>The Gordonbush consent granted by Scottish ministers comprises both section 36 conditions and deemed planning conditions. The section 36 conditions are enforced by Scottish ministers. In the event that a breach of a section 36 condition is anticipated or occurs, the Scottish ministers can take action in the courts to prevent or require the discontinuance of the offending activity.</p>

  <p>In the case of planning conditions, Highland Council, as the planning authority has primary responsibility for ensuring compliance. Breaches of these conditions can be considered in accordance with the enforcement powers available under the planning act and procedures highlighted in Scottish Planning Policy Guidance.</p>

  <p>In addition the planning authority or Scottish ministers can look to prevent an actual or apprehended breach of condition, through an application for interdict in the courts.</p>
