  <p>Limited information on cases of alcohol poisoning, classified under ICD8 codes, is available for 1968 to 1980, and no information is held on cases prior to 1968 (ICD6 and ICD7 codes).

  <p>Information on the number of deaths from alcohol poisoning in each year since 1950 is available from the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 46491).</p>

  <p>However, it is important to note that information is based on the causes of death coded using the international classification of diseases (ICD). However, due to changes in ICD categories over time, the figures are not always consistent. For most years it is not possible to distinguish between non-accidental poisoning by alcohol and by other substances.</p>

  <p>The new traffic management arrangements at the Forth Road Bridge came into effect at the end of May 2008. It is therefore too early to make any realistic assessment of the journey time impacts of the abolition of tolls. We will continue to work with the Forth Estuary Transport Authority to monitor traffic flows across the bridge, and to see how any impacts arising directly from the abolition of tolls might be addressed.</p>

  <p>In line with the requirements set out in <em>Health for All Children</em> , health visitors determine the nature and frequency of contacts with children and families beyond the core programme on the basis of each individual family&rsquo;s needs. Additional support, as agreed with the family, can be put in place as necessary.</p>

  <p>The early years framework, developed jointly by the Scottish Government and COSLA, will be published later this year and will cover the issue of building the capacity of parents, families and communities to contribute to giving children the best start in life.</p>

  <p>We fully recognise the vital contribution of unpaid carers as key partners in the delivery of care and are already taking a number of steps to help make sure that carers can access the support they need to care effectively, while looking after their own health. Future priorities will be set out in a new carers strategy, based on a review of progress against the recommendations of the Care 21 report, <em>The Future of Unpaid Care In Scotland</em>.</p>

  <p>Progress is being made to reduce class sizes to 18 in P1 to P3 without legislation. We signed a concordat with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities last year under which local government undertook to reduce primary 1 to primary 3 classes to a maximum of 18 as quickly as possible. Local government also agreed to make year on year progress towards the delivery of the class size reduction policy. We have always acknowledged that progress on class size reduction would vary across local authorities depending on local circumstances and needs. We will continue to monitor the situation as to whether legislation would be required to cover this and the last administration&rsquo;s policies.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will support the reintroduction of an LPG grant scheme to help reduce the burden of escalating fuel costs.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-09-08.S3W-15215.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80393" speakername="Stewart Stevenson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa0908.htm#16">

  <p>The previous LPG grant scheme was introduced as a means of reducing CO <sub>2</sub> emissions from cars. The scheme was set up to contribute towards the cost of converting vehicles to enable the use of LPG, at a time when LPG offered clear CO <sub>2</sub> reductions in comparison with conventional fuel. However, the scheme ceased in 2006 and we now know that as a result of improvements in the efficiency of conventional engine technology, LPG no longer offers CO <sub>2</sub> reduction benefits on the same scale.</p>

  <p>While the price of LPG may seem attractive in light of increases in the cost of fuel, LPG is a less efficient fuel and LPG vehicles use more litres of fuel per kilometre and depending on a range of other factors e.g. driving style, may offer little benefit. This is reflected in the fact that no manufacturer now produces LPG vehicles. In terms of conversion, estimated costs range from c&pound;1,800 to &pound;3,400, depending on engine size and the type of tanks fitted. It is therefore unlikely that the benefits of a new LPG grant scheme would outweigh the cost and in addition, any such scheme would be subject to state aid rules.</p>

  <p>However, individual drivers can make use of a zero-cost means of increasing the fuel efficiency of their vehicles. Eco-driving techniques can demonstrate savings of around 15% per year. Advice on this can be found on the Energy Saving Trust website:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/what_can_i_do_today/smarter_driving" target="_blank">http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/what_can_i_do_today/smarter_driving</a>.</p>

  <p>Finally, Scottish Government remains concerned about recent rise in fuel prices and recognises the impact this has across the economy and on individuals. As a result, we have held discussions with the energy supply companies urging them to give the maximum assistance to those in fuel poverty and called for a delay in the planned rise in fuel duty in October, which has since been announced. We have also announced additional help such as the development of an action plan for the fishing industry to adapt to rising fuel prices, and will continue to act where necessary.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is concerned about the impact of rising fuel costs on rural communities and on businesses where fuel represent a significant cost burden and on the wider economy.</p>

  <p>Ministers have written to the UK Government seeking action to try to minimise the impact of the rises. In particular we have asked the UK Government to introduce differential fuel duty rates for rural areas, and pressed for the introduction of a fuel duty regulator to protect against high fuel prices. We have also introduced a Road Equivalent Tariff pilot study in October 2008 to investigate the introduction of affordable ferry services that will facilitate the social and economic wellbeing of the communities served.</p>

  <p>The Independent Review Team (IRT) met and was briefed on 26 June 2008 with a remit to report by 31 July 2008. The IRT requested and reviewed all relevant documentation regarding cases of CDAD at the Vale of Leven Hospital over the six month time-frame and the circumstances contributing to these cases. The IRT visited the Vale of Leven Hospital on five occasions and interviewed a wide range of staff from the hospital and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. An open invitation was made through the local press for patients and their families to submit written and oral evidence to the review and meetings were held with representatives from 10 families.</p>

  <p>Full details of the process followed by the IRT are set out in the report, <em>Independent Review of Clostridium difficile Associated Disease at the Vale of Leven Hospital from December 2007 to June 2008, </em>which was published on 7 August 2008.</p>

  <p>A record level of resources of over &pound;1.5 billion has been committed from the Affordable Housing Investment Programme (AHIP) over the next three years. This is sufficient to deliver the units planned if efficiencies are achieved. Efficiencies in the level of grant per unit are anticipated as a consequence of the changes recently made to the Housing Association Grant (HAG) financial assumptions. In the longer term the implementation of the proposed Housing Investment Reform project should generate further efficiencies. It should be noted that the target unit approvals and actual spend in any given financial year do not correlate directly as units approved in any given year may only spend a proportion of the grant allocation in that year with the remainder being carried forward to subsequent years.</p>

  <p>It is the responsibility of individual registered social landlords (RSLs) to ensure they strictly apply tenancy conditions and where necessary take action to stop antisocial behaviour.</p>

  <p>We do not collect information about the application of tenancy conditions by RSLs. However, evidence from Scottish Government research, <em>Use of Anti-social Behaviour Orders in Scotland</em>, published in September 2008, suggests that RSLs are using a range of measures to address antisocial behaviour, including antisocial behaviour orders, antisocial behaviour contracts, down-grading of tenancies to a short Scottish secure tenancy and eviction. This research is available on the Scottish Government&rsquo;s website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/09/19160705/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/09/19160705/0</a>.</p>

  <p>To support social landlords to appropriately manage tenancies we have provided social landlords with model tenancy agreements for the Scottish secure tenancy and the short Scottish secure tenancy. These include a section entitled &quot;Respect for Others&quot; which sets out detailed behavioural conditions which tenants must meet. They also make clear that landlords can bring actions for eviction against tenants who have breached their tenancy conditions.</p>

  <p>In addition, RSLs are regulated by the Scottish Housing Regulator within a framework of nationally agreed performance standards, including standards relating to the management of antisocial behaviour. An RSL&rsquo;s performance against these standards, and its responsiveness to its tenants, may form part of an inspection by the regulator.</p>

  <p>The cost of building new homes for rent or low cost home ownership is largely dependent on local factors such as land price, building costs, site conditions etc. The figures quoted are average costs per unit across Scotland and do not take into account house sizes or local factors.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-13317 by Stewart Maxwell on 3 June 2008, whether the figures given for building affordable homes for rent and low-cost ownership, uprated for inflation and multiplied by the relevant number of homes for rent and low-cost ownership the Scottish Government claims will be built using public funds in 2008-09, equals the amount of funding the Scottish Government is making available in the current financial year and, if not, how these figures match up.</p>

  <p>There is no direct correlation in any given financial year between the cost of units approved and spend. Expenditure in any given year will pay for a range of costs associated with projects approved in previous years, projects approved in the current year and costs to acquire sites for development in future years. Targets for approvals and completions for 2008-09 are achievable with the funds available.</p>

  <p>Since 2004-05 it has been for local authorities to determine their prudential borrowing capacity. In making this determination a local authority is required to have regard to <em>The Prudential Code for Capital Finance in Local Authorities</em> issued by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA).</p>

  <p>The number of houses that a local authority is prepared to fund through prudential borrowing will depend on its assessment of the affordability of building new houses and its assessment of the need for new council houses relative to other spending priorities.</p>

  <p>The &pound;25 million announced by the Scottish Government is intended to encourage local authorities with prudential borrowing potential to consider using it to fund new council houses.</p>

In Strathclyde the average speed of traffic at the camera site has dropped from 69mph down to 66mph.</p>

  <p>In addition to the deployment of safety cameras, the police constantly patrol the full length of the M74 and the A74 (M) in both marked and unmarked vehicles to enforce a wide range of traffic legislation, including those laws relating to speeding.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the introduction of average speed cameras on the A9 has been considered in order to reduce the incidence of traffic accidents, given the positive outcomes in terms of improved road safety following their introduction on the A77 since June 2005 and on similar roads in other parts of the United Kingdom.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is developing a strategy to improve road safety over the next 10 years and has set up a Panel of Experts to advise on possible measures. It is due to publish a report in the autumn.</p>

  <p>The potential to introduce more average speed cameras, and at what trunk road locations, will be informed by an assessment of the A77 average speed camera system (SPECS) and of any identified speeding problem where accidents occur. The effectiveness of the A77 average speed camera system will be fully assessed once three full years of data is available. Accident statistics for the A77 for the three year period from July 2005 to July 2008 are expected to be published in October 2008.</p>

  <p>In June 2005, the Scottish Government published the <em>Scottish Road Network Climate Change Study</em> . This examined the potential impact of future predicted climate conditions on the operation of the Scottish road network. Rainfall was one of the six broad categories of weather considered in the study. Transport Scotland is implementing the recommendations from the study, including changes to the design standard for surface drainage systems, which has now been modified to account for a 20% increase in rainfall intensity.</p>
