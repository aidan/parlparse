  <p>The Scottish Executive has no plans to produce publicity material to promote the production of the <em>Codes of Practice for the Welfare of Dogs, Cats and Equidae</em> ; however, copies of the Codes were sent to relevant animal welfare organisations, including the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, who promote them and issue them to the public. Copies of the codes have also been sent to local authorities, veterinary practices, various members of the public and, in the case of equidae, to riding schools, pony clubs and livery yards.

  <p>In February, Scottish Ministers approved a late application by Machrihanish Airbase Community Company (MACC) to register an interest in land on land that includes the ex-RAF Machrihanish Airbase using the community right to buy provisions of the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003. This has allowed MACC to proceed to submit a community right to buy application to Scottish Ministers. As ministers are currently considering this application, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further at present.</p>

  <p>Information on the specific number of pregnant women in Scotland who received treatment for drug addiction or drug abuse in 2009 is not held centrally and never has been by previous administrations.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Drug Misuse Database (SDMD) does, however, collect information on the number of new patients/clients receiving a specialist assessment of their drug misuse care needs and whether, at the time of presenting, the client or their partner are pregnant. In 2008-09, 226 new female patients/clients reporting that they or their partners were pregnant were recorded as having received an assessment on the SDMD. It should be noted that this is the number who were assessed for their drug misuse care needs, not necessarily the number who went on to receive treatment.</p>

  <p>The development of a follow-up reporting system for the SDMD, currently being rolled-out across Scotland, will allow patients to be tracked through the treatment system and reveal more information on the number of individuals engaging with treatment provision at any given time. It is also anticipated that this follow-up information, collected at set points throughout an individual&rsquo;s care episode, will provide a fuller picture of the number of individuals, who self-report that they or their partner is pregnant.</p>

  <p>From 2001, Scottish Morbidity Record 24 (SMR24) forms were completed by voluntary organisations, statutory NHS teams and a limited number of primary care providers. SMR24 submissions were not received from the Scottish Prison Service. In April 2006, SMR24 was replaced by the Scottish Morbidity Record 25 (SMR25) form.</p>

  <p>The SMR25 form is an expanded version of the information that was previously collected using SMR24. From August 2008, there has been an incremental move from paper to web-based data collection. When the web system was introduced, the SMR25 dataset was expanded as follows:</p>

  <p>SMR25a &ndash; Initial assessment data (the same as previously submitted on paper forms)</p>

  <p>SMR25b &ndash; Follow-up data (only available to services once they begin using the web data collection system).</p>

  <p>At present, Information Services Division (ISD) Scotland gather SMR25 submissions from all services that provide a comprehensive or specialist assessment of a client&rsquo;s care/treatment needs in relation to drug misuse. For those services that meet this definition:</p>

  <p>(a) Voluntary organisations &ndash; SMR25a submissions are received from all, and SMR25b submissions from those using the web data collection system.</p>

  <p>(b) Statutory NHS teams &ndash; SMR25a submissions are received from all, and SMR25b submissions from those using the web data collection system.</p>

  <p>(c) Primary Care Providers &ndash; SMR25a submissions are received from a limited number of Primary Care Providers and only on paper forms.</p>

  <p>(d) Scottish Prison Service &ndash; From 1 April 2010, the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) began submitting both SMR25a and SMR25b data to ISD Scotland using the web data collection system. All SPS drugs services are submitting data, but at present the private prisons are not submitting data.</p>

  <p>Curriculum for Excellence will ensure that our children and young people receive a broad, general education which will equip them to become successful learners, confident individuals, responsible citizens and <em> </em> effective <em> </em> contributors to society. This includes having opportunities to raise their awareness of future choices and aspirations. Their learning in Health and Wellbeing promotes confidence, independent thinking and positive attitudes, and encompasses learning around risk taking behaviour and how to assess and manage this. This strategy is strengthened by Section 1 of the Gambling Act 2005 which protects children and young people from being harmed or exploited by gambling.</p>

  <p>Education authorities and schools can support young people to deal with problem gambling using advice and information available to them from organisations such as Gamble Aware and GamCare which provide advice and information for those affected by gambling.</p>

  <p>The implementation of our Scottish Action Plan for Child Internet Safety will go some way to addressing the dangers associated with online gambling by ensuring that our children and young people have the knowledge and confidence that is necessary in order for them to use the internet both safely and responsibly. A key strand of the activity outlined the action plan will again be delivered through Curriculum for Excellence.</p>

  <p>Problem gambling is likely to affect a child or young person&rsquo;s welfare and may be a child protection concern, but is unlikely to be an isolated issue. Schools and education authorities have structures and services in place to provide advice, guidance and support to children and young people. The guidance documents <em>Happy, Safe and Achieving their Potential, </em>and <em>Safe and Well </em>provide advice and guidance to schools on the 10 standards for personal support in schools and the protection of children respectively. Parents also play a vital role in educating their children on keeping themselves safe.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s role is to provide policies, frameworks and resources to NHS boards to enable clinicians and service planners to deliver high quality, safe and sustainable services to local communities.

  <p>In respect of 2009, the Government paid out &pound;687 million in support for farming, funded from both the EU and Scottish Government budgets. The Government has streamlined application procedures under the Scotland Rural Development Programme, and also brought forward into 2009 and 2010 around &pound;25 million of support for farm business development, from the later years of the programme. Around &pound;330 million supporting 4,500 projects has now been committed under the Rural Priorities scheme, for farms and other rural businesses and organisations. 325 farms have taken advantage of a government-subsidised strategic review of their business under the Whole Farm Review Scheme. For hill farms, the government has introduced successive changes for 2009, 2010 and 2011 which will increase payment rates to active farmers in the most vulnerable areas by 38%. For the longer term, the government has appointed a committee of inquiry chaired by Brian Pack OBE to make recommendations on the future shape of farm support in Scotland. The government has also introduced a range of complementary measures under our food and drink policy, seeking to enhance consumer demand for, and the premium status of, Scottish produce.</p>
