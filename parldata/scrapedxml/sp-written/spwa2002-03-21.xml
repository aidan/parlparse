  <p>The decision to make &#163;3 million available, to enhance money advice provision, was informed by an assessment of need.

  <p>The Executive funds 48 Social Inclusion Partnerships (SIPs) across Scotland, to tackle existing social exclusion and prevent future exclusion in regeneration areas. SIPs use the funding allocated to them in pursuit of their own locally defined strategic objectives, one of which may be tackling financial exclusion through debt advice. Firm funding allocations for 2002-03 have been communicated to SIPs, along with indicative allocations for 2003-04.</p>

  <p>Support to local advice services is primarily provided by local authorities, SIPs and other non-statutory sources. From April 2002, the Executive will make an additional &#163;3 million annually available, through local authorities, to enhance money advice provision across Scotland. This will not affect funding for SIPs.</p>

  <p>The latest available information from ISD Scotland, indicates that there were three consultant vacancies and no staff grade vacancies in the specialty of cardiothoracic surgery, at 30 September 2000.</p>

  <p>The number of higher specialist training posts available in Scotland is regularly adjusted to meet the projected number of new consultants needed to meet known and anticipated turnover and local service developments. In March 2001 the specialist registrar establishment for cardiothoracic surgery was increased from 10 to 13.</p>

  <p>As a result of the recent consultation exercise, an additional 75 areas of Scotland are to be designated under the Shellfish Waters Directive. These areas are in Argyll, Dumfries and Galloway, the Highlands and Islands, North Ayrshire, Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles, and take account of the views expressed in the consultation exercise.</p>

  <p>Seventy-five waters - stretching from Shetland to the Solway Firth - are to be designated for protection, and take account of the views expressed in the recent consultation exercise.</p>

  <p>These designations will be good for the industry and good for the wider environment and I am pleased to acknowledge the support of Scotland's shellfish industry in achieving the new designations.</p>

  <p>The new designations are:</p>

  <p>The Project Agreement covers the provision of catering facilities for staff, patients and visitors within the main restaurant in the hospital (and the food court which will be provided in Phase II of the development). All aspects of the catering service are covered by an Assured Safe Catering programme and the food service will provide Recommended Nutritional Intake for all nutrients and Estimated Average Requirements for food energy for the patient groups it is planned to serve. All menus provide an identified healthy choice, which complies with national and local food policies. The catering service also reflects the dietetic needs and preferences of cultural and minority groups.</p>

  <p>The charges made within the main restaurant are in line with the current charges at the old Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. Any increases in restaurant charges will be made in consultation with the trust to ensure consistency of prices across the wider trust. The lease issued by Consort Healthcare (Edinburgh Royal Infirmary) Ltd to the operator of the food court ensures that the operator will not charge any more than High Street prices.</p>

  <p>The Executive is working closely with the UK Government and enforcement agencies, to produce a comprehensive action plan to help deter and detect illegal imports. Already, action has been taken to publicise UK import rules overseas, and more effective posters are now on display at our ports and airports to underline the need for increased vigilance. Efforts have also been stepped up to improve detection and prosecution of deliberate attempts to bring illegal imports into the country. There is a greater emphasis on sharing intelligence and increased powers for local authorities to search and seize meat etc. at the point of sale where such products could not have been imported legally. The Veterinary Laboratory Agency has been asked to carry out a detailed risk assessment, so that effort and resources can be targeted to areas which are thought to represent the greatest risk.</p>

  <p>The Executive works closely with local authorities and the Scottish Arts Council to promote all aspects of music tuition in schools. We are in the final stages of planning a pilot programme of cultural co-ordinators to maximise the potential contribution of culture to children's education and will make an announcement shortly. The Scottish Arts Council has also been allocated &#163;1.5 million over this and the next two years to promote excellence in the traditional arts, and last year the Traditional Scottish Music School at Plockton was opened by Mr Jack McConnell with &#163;535,000 from the Excellence Fund.</p>

  <p>Schools can make provision for instrumental tuition in a range of instruments, and musical styles, in line with the resources available to them and local need. They are free to decide which instruments they support within their school, and can opt to make provision for pipe tuition. The Scottish Executive does not hold centrally information on the range of instruments for which local authorities provide instrumental tuition.</p>

  <p>There are 1,042 people on the waiting list for a first appointment at the Sleep Centre. The Scottish Executive is concerned about long waiting times and is determined that the NHS should reduce them.</p>

  <p>Under the School Premises (General Requirements and Standards) (Scotland) Regulations 1967, there is a requirement for every school to have available to it playing fields of an area related to the school roll.</p>

  <p>Town and country planning legislation provides certain safeguards in relation to proposals to develop playing fields, including school playing fields. National Planning Policy Guideline (NPPG) 11: Sport, Physical Recreation and Open Space sets out the planning policy framework that planning authorities should have regard to when considering proposals for the redevelopment of playing fields. <strong></strong>Sportscotland must also be consulted on all planning applications and developments likely to prejudice or lead to the loss of playing fields. Planning authorities are required to notify the Scottish ministers where they are minded to grant planning permission for any proposal which would involve the loss of a playing field where <strong></strong>sportscotland have advised against the proposal.</p>

  <p>Following consultation on the report from the Expert Panel on Sex Offending entitled <em>Reducing the Risk: Improving the response to sex offending</em> , I am pleased to announce our decision to accept the four recommendations which will improve the information provided to courts. These aim to ensure that the court's decisions in relation to sex offenders are founded on the best available information; that report writers have adequate time to prepare reports, and that they have objective information about the nature of the offence on which to found their assessment of risk. Provision for these recommendations will be included in a Criminal Justice Bill to be introduced shortly. We will be announcing our response to the other recommendations and publishing a full analysis of the consultation exercise in the next few weeks.</p>
