  <p>The number of incidents in the Cowal area attended by ambulances from Inverary and Arrochar has increased against the background of an overall increase in the number of incidents in the Cowal Peninsula (579 in 2002-03 and 826 in 2003-04). This increase also meant that the ambulance based at Dunoon was out of the area more often; transferring patients to hospital in Paisley, Greenock and Glasgow.</p>

  <p>This risk has largely been addressed following recent investment in the area which has seen the ambulance service, on 4 April 2005, introduce an additional accident and emergency unit into Dunoon, which will help support patient transfers out of the area.</p>

  <p>The number of overall incidents in the Cowal area has increased over the past<br /> three years (579 in 2002-03 to 826 in 2004-05). This increase meant that the ambulance based at Dunoon was out of the area more often; transferring patients to hospital in Paisley, Greenock and Glasgow. As a result, the Inverary and Arrochar ambulances have had to travel much further down the Cowal Peninsula to attend incidents which has resulted in a lengthening of response times.</p>

  <p>This risk has largely been addressed following recent investment in the area which has seen the ambulance service, on 4 April 2005, introduce an additional accident and emergency unit into Dunoon, which will help support patient transfers out of the area.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-05-09.S2W-15858.r0" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Colin Boyd QC" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa0509.htm#3">

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S2W-10095 on 17 September 2004 which presented this information by procurator fiscal office.</p>

  <p>The same information is shown below for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) Areas which correspond to each police force area in each of the complete financial years since 1999. The 11 COPFS Areas were introduced in 2002-03 and replaced six regions which did not correspond to police force areas. For ease of reference, the figures are presented before 2002-03 according to the corresponding new COPFS Area.</p>

  <p>The information is not available to present in this format prior to 1999.</p>

  <p>The information for 2004-05 will be available by the end of July 2005 and I will write again at that time with the additional information.</p>

  <p>The figures given under &quot;Total Reports Received&quot; relate to all reports received by procurators fiscal and include criminal reports, complaints against the police and reports of sudden deaths.</p>

  <p>Cases can be marked &quot;no proceedings&quot; by procurators fiscal for a number of reasons including a lack of sufficient admissible evidence, mitigating circumstances, lack of jurisdiction over the offence, the fact that the suspected offence is not a crime or that a civil remedy is more appropriate than criminal proceedings.</p>

  <p>A consultation on the future arrangements for the supply of appliances currently available on prescription was conducted in 2003 and the Scottish Pharmaceutical General Council (SPGC) was one of the bodies that responded.</p>

  <p>The way forward was announced in January 2005. An action plan for the development and implementation of the new arrangements will be published shortly. This will include the establishment of a steering group that will include community pharmacy contractor representation. Additionally, negotiations on the new community pharmacy contract are on-going with the SPGC; these will cover the contractual arrangements in respect of any dispensing by community pharmacists of prescriptions for appliances.</p>

  <p>When we received the first letter on this issue in February we felt that, as the Health and Safety Commission (HSC), the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), the Better Regulation Task Force and CORGI (the Council for Registered Gas Installers) had all been contacted by the Scottish and Northern Ireland Plumbing Employers&rsquo; Federation (SNIPEF) and other UK installer bodies, the best course of action would be to contact HSE and find out what the position was in respect of the claim that SNIPEF had not received any response to their representations. We were informed that the Chair of the HSC had responded to the Association of Plumbing and Heating Contractors (APHC) which had written on behalf of itself, SNIPEF and two other trade bodies. A response was due to be issued by the Better Regulation Task Force. On this basis and the fact that health and safety is reserved, we felt that it was sufficient to respond setting out this information.</p>

  <p>Medical equipment replacement, including CT scanners, is a matter for NHS boards who receive capital allocations by Arbuthnott Formula adjusted for cross boundary flows and weighted for the provision of regional specialities. This means that NHS boards can determine, based on their local knowledge or the local needs of the local area how this money should be spent.</p>

  <p>Source: ISD Scotland</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. WTE (whole-time equivalent) adjusts headcount figures to take account of part-time staff.</p>

  <p>2. The number of consultants is drawn from the annual medical and dental census undertaken each year by ISD Scotland.</p>

  <p>3. The &quot;Date Appointed to Grade&quot; and &quot;Start Date&quot; have been compared when identifying the numbers in each year. Only where these two dates fall within the same year is the consultant included in the table.</p>

  <p>4. The definition for &quot;Date Appointed to Grade&quot; is the date on which the doctor took up his/her first appointment to a substantive post in the present grade. Earlier service in the grade with any other trust/health board should be reflected by that date.</p>

  <p>In 1998-99, &pound;44 million for waiting times initiative funding was made available nationally, &pound;3.2 million of which was given to NHS Tayside. The data for 1999 reflects the additional consultants who were appointed through this funding stream. Not only did NHS Tayside see a larger than normal increase in consultant numbers but nationally the number of consultants within NHS Scotland grew by 4.3% in 1999. This compared to growth varying between 1.8% and 3.2% in the other years in question.</p>

  <p>Centrally held information does not explicitly identify those staff eligible to retire at 60. However, information on the ages of staff in post (in five year age bands) in NHS Scotland is published on the Scottish Health Statistics website under Workforce Statistics, at <a href="http://www.isdscotland.org/workforce" target="_blank">www.isdscotland.org/workforce</a> .</p>

  <p>National workforce planning takes into account a number of factors including the age distribution within staff groups.</p>

  <p>A number of recruitment and retention initiatives are underway with others under consideration to ensure that NHSScotland continues to attract and retain the staff it needs.</p>

  <p>It might be helpful if I restate our position on staffing issues and the use of NHS capacity in the independent sector to benefit NHS patients. Where the NHS signs contracts for new facilities with the independent sector we will insist on including contract terms that will enable financial penalties to be imposed on a contractor who takes on staff recently employed in the NHS to fulfil the contract. These arrangements will also apply across the rest of the UK. However, we will be flexible and will not discourage recruitment of NHS part-time staff who wish to undertake some additional work in the independent sector, nor will we wish to penalise any joint venture arrangements where staff with the prior agreement of NHS board work flexibly across the NHS and independent sector.</p>

  <p>The department is aware of the difficulties that some NHS boards are experiencing in securing some specialist staff to undertake the various duties within the health service across whole of Scotland. The workforce shortages are being addressed rigorously and NHS boards as employers are pursing several initiatives on behalf of the health service that will make the NHS in Scotland, as an exemplar employer, an attractive career option so to recruit and retain more staff.</p>

  <p>We have strengthened Scots law in this area by creating a new offence of trafficking in prostitution as part of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2003. The offence is committed if a person arranges or facilitates the arrival in or departure from the UK of another person and intends to control that other person in prostitution or in the production of obscene or indecent material (or believes that a third person is likely to exercise such control over the trafficked person). Conviction for this offence on indictment could result in 14 years imprisonment.</p>

  <p>An expert group has been considering the broader legal, policing, health and social justice issues surrounding prostitution in Scotland. Stage 2 of this review will focus specifically on indoor prostitution and trafficking. It will get underway in the next few months.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive awarded &pound;100,000 from 2004-06, under the Violence Against Women Service Development Fund, to a pilot project offering support services to women who have been trafficked. Glasgow City Council is the lead agency and its funding proposal was drawn up after discussions with the Glasgow Inter-Agency Group on Trafficking, including Criminal Justice Social Work, Scottish Refugee Council, Strathclyde Police and Greater Glasgow NHS Trust. The Inter-Agency Group guides and monitors the work of the project.</p>

  <p>The overall aim of the project is to develop expertise around the issue of trafficking for prostitution and to ensure appropriate and sensitive services are in place. A development worker has been recruited to take this work forward and the post holder took up the position on 27 September 2004. Since then the post holder has carried out research on the issues, investigated work happening elsewhere, met with key players, undertaken preliminary work on analysing the indoor sex industry, and drawn up a draft action plan.</p>

  <p>The National Group to Address Violence Against Women, chaired by the Deputy Minister for Communities, is also considering strategic links between different forms of violence against women, including commercial sexual exploitation. This work is at an early stage and is being taken forward with advice from an Expert Committee on Violence Against Women.</p>
