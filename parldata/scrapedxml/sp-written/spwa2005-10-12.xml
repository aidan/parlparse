  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what action it is taking to reduce the unemployment gap between non-EU and EU nationals in Scotland in accordance with the European Commission&rsquo;s Integrated Guidelines for Growth and Jobs (2005-2008).</p>

  <p>The Executive has a range of policies, in conjunction with the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP), aimed at increasing employment opportunities for nationals of all countries in Scotland.</p>

  <p>In Scotland the DWP through Jobcentre Plus offers a range of services to help unemployed people into work. The Scottish Executive remains committed to equality of opportunity for all, in all aspects of life, including labour market activity. The Executive is developing an employability framework which will help the most disadvantaged in the labour market move towards and into sustained work.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has any plans to introduce targets for renewable heat generation analogous to the targets for renewable electricity generation.</p>

  <p>There are no immediate plans to introduce targets for renewable heat. The development of a successful biomass sector in Scotland will play a significant role in delivering increasing amounts of renewable heat. The Department of Trade and Industry and Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs very recently published their review of the UK heat sector, which is available at: <a href="www.dti.gov.uk/renewables/policy_pdfs/heatreportfinal.pdf" target="_blank">www.dti.gov.uk/renewables/policy_pdfs/heatreportfinal.pdf</a> .</p>

  <p>The Forum for Renewable Energy Development in Scotland has plans to re-convene its biomass subgroup to consider the conclusions and recommendations of that review and what specific action might be appropriate in Scotland. Once we have had the opportunity to consider its recommendations and those of the UK heat sector review, the Executive will be better placed to form a view as to how we best encourage the development of this sector.</p>
