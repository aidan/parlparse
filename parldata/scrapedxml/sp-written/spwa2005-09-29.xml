  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-18320 by Mr Andy Kerr on 31 August 2005, what measures will be put in place to prepare for the impact on workload in secondary care, including increased demand for non-screening colonoscopy and pathology services, as identified by the UK cancer challenge pilot screening programme.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Bowel Cancer Framework Group was established in 2004 in order to co-ordinate strategic planning and development to secure implementation of the Scottish Bowel Cancer Framework. The group will oversee service development in readiness for the national bowel cancer screening programme.</p>

  <p>We are investing in the expansion of the endoscopy workforce in Scotland. An extra 25 nurse endoscopists will commence training from January 2006 at Glasgow Caledonian University. We are also expanding medical endoscopy training from 2005 by funding 50 &quot;train the trainer&quot; courses and 100 skills courses which will result in improved on the job support for new nurse endoscopists. In addition, we are maximising existing endoscopy capacity through the redesign of endoscopy suites and current working practices.</p>

  <p>We have provided &pound;60,000 to fund the establishment of a Scottish Pathology Network and the recruitment of a network manager. A colorectal sub-group of the network will focus on the bowel screening programme, with a view to sharing knowledge and experience gained during the pilot, providing a network wide approach to education, training and development and ensuring value for money by maximising the efficient use of existing pathology resources. We have also invested &pound;600,000 to support PathAlba, a Scottish pathology telemedicine initiative, which will ensure that specialist pathology expertise is available for the benefit of patients across Scotland irrespective of geographical location.</p>

  <p>Professor Aldgate&rsquo;s research on kinship care in Scotland was commissioned by Social Work Services Inspectorate as part of a review of services and outcomes for children and young people looked after by local authorities in Scotland. The kinship care study informs the findings of the wider review and any recommendations arising from it.</p>

  <p>In April 2005, responsibility for the review was incorporated into the work of the Social Work Inspection Agency. The demands of the agency&rsquo;s performance inspection programme has meant some delay to the intended timetable for publication. The review is now in final drafting stage and is expected to be published in November. The full kinship care report written by Professor Aldgate will also be published at this time.</p>

  <p>Support for kinship carers is a matter for local authorities. Further, when announcing an extra &pound;12 million support for foster care, the Scottish Executive made clear that local authorities could use this additional money to improve support for kinship carers if this was deemed to be a local priority.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive continues to support carers under the &quot;Strategy for Carers in Scotland&quot; and has increased resources from &pound;5 million per annum in 1999-2000 to &pound;23 million this year.</p>

  <p>Yes. Consultants have been commissioned to carry out research into the operation of the scheme and have already carried out a preliminary evaluation of its operation. Phase 2 of the evaluation will begin in October 2005 and last for about six months. An interim report is expected during November 2005, when a review of the scheme will begin.</p>

  <p>It is thought that 150 approved advisers will provide the necessary support for expected demand for the Debt Arrangement Scheme. To date, 36 money advisers have been approved. This is disappointing, and I am not satisfied that there are enough advisers to support the scheme. My officials are, however, continuing to work with the money advice sector to identify and overcome obstacles to take up. I am encouraged by the fact that 200 money advice workers have been trained on the Debt Arrangement Scheme and can therefore go ahead and complete the approval process.</p>

  <p>The Debt Arrangement Scheme is intended to help both debtors and creditors. I am aware that some creditors have not agreed to proposed debt payment programmes, as is their right. The scheme, however, provides for the consent of creditors to be dispensed with in some circumstances provided that a proposed programme is fair and reasonable. I am also aware that programmes have been approved where a creditor has refused to consent. The operation of the scheme will be reviewed by my officials from November 2005, and the issue of creditor consent will be considered in the round at that time. No action is planned at present.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. There are various ways of calculating the number of dentists working in the NHS General Dental Service. Classification of counting dentists has been revised from 2004 to ensure a consistent way of recording dentists. A dentist is counted once for each NHS board where he/she has a contract to provide NHS General Dental Services or where he/she is employed to provide such services. As a result, the sum of the number of dentists in each NHS board will exceed the number of dentists in Scotland.</p>

  <p>2. Headcount of non-salaried principals, salaried principals, assistants and vocational trainees active in the NHS General Dental Service at 30 September 2005.</p>

  <p>3. Mid-year population figures.</p>

It is for each local authority to decide whether or not it pays for the check or passes the cost on to job applicants.</p>

  <p>We are working towards the implementation of a new vetting and barring scheme for those who work with children and vulnerable adults in response to the recommendations in the Bichard Report. The proposed scheme will include continuous updating of an individual&rsquo;s status as new information comes to light. This should remove the need for further full disclosure checks when an employee moves within an organisation.</p>

  <p>The Sea Fisheries (Shellfish) Act 1967 under which Regulating Orders are made and which makes provision for the inquiry procedure does not stipulate a timeframe for the completion of an inquiry or the provision of advice to ministers by the inspector appointed to make an inquiry. The length of the inquiry is a matter for the inspector and it is not possible to say exactly when it will be complete. I am however aware of the need to resolve this issue as quickly as possible. We are taking steps to be in a position to do so. If I decide to approve the application, I would therefore expect to lay the Order very shortly thereafter.</p>

  <p>A pilot project was carried out in 1998 in Kincardine O&rsquo;Neil through the Scottish Homes Research and Innovation programme, where funding was provided to a private rural landowner to build new houses for rent to local people in need.</p>

  <p>I have already announced my intention regarding Argyll and Clyde.</p>

  <p>NHS Grampian have in place an agreed financial recovery plan which will see them returning to financial balance in 2006-07.</p>

  <p>The Lanarkshire deficit is from an earlier period and is planned to be managed using profit on a land sale.</p>

  <p>The new Director of Finance of NHS Western Isles is currently working through the board&rsquo;s financial recovery plans to address the deficit. This is due to be submitted to the department by the end of September.</p>

Information for staff who joined or left part way through the year have been excluded. Ambulance staff have been excluded due to incomplete data.</p>

  <p>2. Total cost: gross salary (basic salary plus overtime, enhancements and allowances etc) plus employers' national insurance and superannuation.</p>

  <p>3. Whole time equivalent is calculated by dividing the number of contracted hours/sessions by the normal conditioned hours for a particular group of staff.</p>

  <p>4. Numbers have been rounded to the nearest pound.</p>

  <p>NHSQIS has taken account of the NICE decision in making plans for the future publication of appraisals. NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS), the Scottish Medicines Consortium and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network all have work programmes independent of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Commenting on NICE appraisals forms only a small part of NHS QIS&rsquo;s work.</p>

  <p>The existence of the Scottish Medicines Consortium will ensure that Scottish patients will see no delay in the introduction of effective new drugs and treatments.</p>

  <p>Our strategic framework for healthy eating sets out our plan to increase demand for healthier choices, supported by action to supply that demand with improved access to healthier food.</p>

  <p>Our strategies begin from the earliest stages with parenting support and encouragement for breastfeeding, we have consulted on nutritional guidance in early years settings, we have set nutritional standards for school meals, and have announced that we will consult on a Health Promotion and Nutrition in Schools Bill during this parliamentary year.</p>

  <p>Beyond schools, we are developing nutritional standards in hospitals, care homes and prisons. We are targeting workplaces through the Scotland&rsquo;s Health at Work scheme, which results in healthier food choices in canteens, tuck shops and vending. We have made advice available to any member of the public who wants it through the Healthyliving campaign website, and advice line and we are working through the Scottish Community Diet Project and our neighbourhood shops initiative to support communities to improve access to and take up of a healthy diet.</p>

  <p>the group will meet on a quarterly basis, during which time a remit for this group will be developed, and</p>

  <p>future meetings should focus on sharing information on best practice, and should encompass other equality strands, such as disability and gender.</p>

  <p>We remain committed to the &quot;One Scotland. Many Cultures&quot; campaign and those projects we are funding as part of the campaign. We are currently developing the next phase of media activity for the campaign, and as in previous phases, have sought views from stakeholders at national and local level. It is an important part of the development of our campaign that we consider contextual issues. We realise that recent events are bound to influence public attitudes but rather than diminish the need for a national campaign, it makes it all the more necessary that positive signals are sent to all communities that racism will not be tolerated and that Scotland is place in which all are welcome. We are clear that the campaign and associated projects are part of a long-term investment strategy to tackle the causes and effects of racism in this country.</p>

  <p>These freight grant schemes are successful, having removed at least 60 million lorry miles from Scotland&rsquo;s roads since 1999. The Freight Facilities Grant scheme has had a significant and positive impact on the freight infrastructure of Scotland as a catalyst to the building of over &pound;70 million of new rail and water freight facilities across the country.</p>

  <p>A fully effective monitoring and audit system for freight grants is in place. Each Freight Facilities Grant project is monitored annually to track the actual level of freight transferred from road to rail and water and the corresponding environmental benefits which have been generated. Track Access Grants are paid in arrears based on actual freight carried by rail; these claims are audited by independent accountants annually. All Scottish Executive freight grant schemes are audited both internally and by Audit Scotland.</p>

  <p>We recognise that the long-term solution for this junction maybe a grade-separated junction. However, in the meantime, other measures have been considered and action has been taken to implement a range of safety initiatives including the installation of CCTV cameras, a 50mph speed limit in the vicinity of the Laurencekirk junction, advance warning signs, anti-skid surfacing and renewed road markings. We will continue to monitor safety around the junction and take further action as necessary. The forthcoming Strategic Transport Projects Review will provide the future framework for decisions on competing priorities for investment in schemes to improve the trunk road network, including proposals for grade separation at junctions such as the A90 at Laurencekirk.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is aware that some of the residents in the Camphill Communities suffer from hyperacusis. The Scottish Executive is also aware that there are no standards for maximum noise levels for special-needs individuals. It is for this reason that the noise assessment for Camphill is going beyond the <em>Design Manual for Roads and Bridges</em> (DMRB) methodology by, for example, exploring noise levels at greater than normal assessment distances and by utilising World Health Organization guidance. Attempts are also being made to agree noise assessment parameters with the Camphill Communities based upon speech frequency ranges.</p>

  <p>Scottish Borders Council receives additional support of &pound;1.164 million in 2005-06 as a result of a redistribution of the Primary School Teaching Staff Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE) allocation which is based on the 11.2% of Scottish Borders&rsquo; pupils who are educated in small schools i.e. where the pupil roll is 70 or less. In 2006-07 and 2007-08, this redistribution reallocates &pound;1.150 million and &pound;1.198 million respectively, based on a percentage of 10.1%. Any current or future changes to this percentage will not now be made until the next spending review, currently scheduled for 2007.</p>

  <p>These GAE allocations are neither budgets nor spending targets. They are a component of the more complex local government funding formula which is used to calculate a single revenue grant figure for each council. It is then a matter for each individual council to decide how best to deploy these resources based on local needs and priorities.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-09-29.S2W-19249.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80125" speakername="Andrew Welsh" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa0929.htm#31">

  <p>The SPCB did not have a dedicated outreach services team prior to September 2004 when a new team was created.</p>

  <p>The four staff members cover outreach to communities, educational organisations and the Gaelic community. However, other staff and teams within the Parliament are also involved in our wider participation and engagement work, for example the Scottish Parliament Information Centre have responsibility for the Partner Libraries.</p>

  <p>Community Outreach sessions are attended by a mix of the general public, representatives of organisations, workers and volunteers from voluntary sector organisations and community councils.</p>

  <p>Sessions have recently commenced for local council staff and elected members. An interfaith project to encourage engagement of faith communities with the Parliament will commence in October 2005.</p>

  <p>In January to March 2005, an &quot;MSPs in Schools&quot; scheme was piloted with eight schools across Scotland. Following the successful pilot, the project was launched in August 2005 and will provide the main focus for educational outreach.</p>

  <p>The following table outlines activities since September 2004 and planned activities:</p>

  <p>A dedicated outreach team was created in September 2004. The number of people participating in the sessions provided by the Outreach Services team is given in the table supplied in the answer to question S2W-19249 on 29 September 2005.</p>

  <p>However, this is just a part of the Parliament&rsquo;s wider programme of engagement and participation. A range of other activities take place for example the Scottish Parliament and Business Exchange and the recently created Futures Forum. We have also engaged with people through a wide range of parliamentary events, and</p>

  <p>E-democracy initiatives and continue to support the engagement with committees held outside of Parliament.</p>
