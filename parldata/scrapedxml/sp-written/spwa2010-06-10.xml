  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what steps have been taken to limit any damage to the soil on the farm near Coupar Angus where potato seed infected with Dickeya solani imported from the Netherlands via a farm in England has been found.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-06-10.S3W-33954.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80340" speakername="Richard Lochhead" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa0610.htm#1">

  <p>Dickeya infection is most likely to persist in the soil if potato material remains. For this reason the planted potatoes were ordered to be lifted immediately, before they could rot or produce new tubers. No potatoes are to be planted in the field until 2012, and any re-growth which emerges must be destroyed, to ensure that all potato material has been removed. This will minimise any risk of infection to future crops in that field. All machinery used in the field must also be cleaned and disinfected to avoid spreading infection to other crops.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>*Information provided by the Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS).</p>

  <p>**SAS systems record data under the previous structure of 15 geographic health boards.</p>

  <p>***&quot;All&quot; emergency is defined as Category A, B and C calls.</p>

  <p>****The Scottish Ambulance Service completed the roll-out of the priority-based dispatch system across mainland Scotland in March 2004, so 2004-05 is the first year in which average Category A and &quot;all&quot; emergency responses can be measured across Scotland. Figures for earlier years are not available as the information held is not comparable. Orkney, Shetland and Western Isles are subject to different performance management measures so figures are provided at an all emergency level.</p>

  <p>The licences are permitted under Section 16(1)(k) of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. The act requires that licences are to prevent serious damage to livestock, and that there should be no other satisfactory solution. The Scottish Government would also not issue any licence that threatened the conservation status of the species concerned. No further detailed guidelines were published in conjunction with the legislation provisions. The Scottish Government is currently in the process of consulting with stakeholders to establish what, if any, guidelines might be required before any such licences could be granted. This process has not been concluded.</p>

  <p>The emissions projections used by the Scottish Government and the Committee on Climate Change take account of the recession based on the 2009 growth forecasts. These show emissions falling by 0.4% between 2007 and 2008, by 1.2% between 2008 and 2009, and by 0.1% between 2009 and 2010. It is not possible to say how much of the decrease in greenhouse gas emissions projected for 2008 and 2009 is due to the recession and how much is due to UK and Scottish Government policies.</p>

  <p>There is a significant degree of uncertainty when projecting emissions, and the Committee on Climate Change acknowledged this when giving advice to the Scottish Government.</p>

  <p>NorthLink Ferries Ltd.</p>

  <p>Hjaltland and Hrossey.</p>

  <p>The timetable prescribed by Northlink&rsquo;s contract with the Scottish Government requires the vessels to operate at a range of differing speeds and the vessels were therefore designed for this with four main engines and a number of other features which can be used in combination to optimize the fuel used for the different operating speeds.</p>

  <p>The main engine rate of fuel consumption varies from 900 litres to 1,100 litres per hour depending on loading and therefore the vessels have a fuel consumption rate that varies between 900 litres and 4,000 litres per hour depending on speed, loading, the combination of engines in use, and whether shaft alternators are being used.</p>

  <p>Hamnavoe.</p>

  <p>The vessel was designed to meet the Scottish Government&rsquo;s service specification in terms of classification, carrying capacity and journey time on the defined route. The vessel main engines consume about 1,500 litres per hour</p>

  <p>Hildasay and Clare</p>

  <p>Both vessels are Time Chartered freight vessels.</p>

  <p>Hildasay consumes about 840 litres per hour and Clare consumes about 700 litres per hour.</p>

  <p>CalMac Ferries Ltd</p>

  <p>CalMac Ferries Ltd has commissioned a carbon footprint study to identify options to reduce carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions from its operations.</p>

  <p>The objectives of this project were to:</p>

  <p>1. Calculate a carbon footprint of CalMac&rsquo;s shipping and onshore activities</p>

  <p>2. Identify potential options for reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from CalMac&rsquo;s shipping and onshore activities</p>

  <p>3. Assess the feasibility of options in light of CalMac&rsquo;s operational restraints</p>

  <p>4. Recommend the next steps to reduce CalMac&rsquo;s carbon footprint.</p>

  <p>The programme has commenced with plans to change the propeller blade types on four of the ships from the major vessel fleet which is calculated to reduce fuel and save 2000 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> per year.</p>

  <p>The project is ongoing.</p>

  <p>NorthLink Ferries Ltd</p>

  <p>Hamnavoe was converted to allow the main engines to run on 40cSt (centiStokes) fuel instead of the more expensive Marine gas oil (MGO).</p>

  <p>This change of fuel type is on track to deliver significant benefits in terms of lower fuel costs and lower fuel volume consumption given the higher energy content.</p>

  <p>Hascosay and Clare were both moved from MGO to lower cost 40cSt which also has a higher energy content.</p>

  <p>In 2010 Hildasay replaced Hascosay and this vessel operates on 220cSt fuel.</p>

  <p>Hjaltland and Hrossey are designed to minimize the fuel used for the different design speeds. An example of this is the ability to run on one or two engines through a single propeller with the second propeller fully feathered and stopped with two of the blades aligned with the propeller shaft A-frame &ndash; hence minimizing the underwater drag.</p>

  <p>In 2009 NorthLink replaced the underwater antifouling paint on Hjaltland and Hrossey with a newer Teflon type product which has an improved environmental action and which through reduced drag reduces the volumes of fuel used. Indications to date suggest that the percentage fuel volume saving claimed by the paint manufacturers is being exceeded.</p>

  <p>Shore procedures have been tightened to ensure that vessels are able to depart quickly after the last check-in time and maximize the time available for a crossing. This ensures the minimum engine power and fuel consumption is used to achieve an on time arrival.</p>

  <p>Currently it is not possible to give average fuel usage per operation for this vessel as the relevant timetable set out the Scottish Government&rsquo;s contract with CalMac is under discussion and still to be finalised.</p>

  <p>Average fuel usage will depend on the speed the vessel needs to operate at to meet the requirements of the timetable.</p>

  <p>We are always seeking opportunities to promote the Energy Assistance Package in the most targeted and effective way. Identifying those in receipt of tax credits is important data, but as this is only one of a number of criteria for eligibility at stages 3 and 4 of the Energy Assistance Package it may have limited value. In addition, we will consider the results of the DWP data sharing pilot in shaping any future approach along these lines.</p>

  <p>Over 2009-11 we have made &pound;7.5 million available to local authorities and housing associations to install Energy Assistance Package Stage 3 measures in their properties, provided they partnered this with funding from a CERT provider. Fifty-six Housing Associations have benefited from this resource.</p>

  <p>Measures at stage 1 and 2 of the package are available to both social and private sector households and we would encourage tenants of social sector landlords to apply for this help. These sources of help are available across the country.</p>

  <p>We will provide advice and clarification to rural housing associations on how best to implement the energy efficiency requirements of the Scottish Housing Quality Standard which they are expected to meet, in full, by 2015. Achievement of the Scottish Housing Quality Standard means that rural tenants will have effective insulation and full efficient central heating and their homes will have to meet a minimum energy efficiency level.</p>

  <p>Ministers have no role in setting the budgets of individual colleges. That is the responsibility of the Scottish Funding Council, which for 2010-11 has increased by 6.2% (&pound;4.9 million) the resources it provides to colleges for the purpose of providing bursaries and other student support.</p>

  <p>The Data Protection Act 1998 gives individuals, the right to apply to see information that NHS organisations hold about them, including health records and obtain a copy should they wish. There are a small number of circumstances where information within the health record may be kept from the individual.</p>

  <p>All NHS organisations have procedures in place to enable patients to exercise this right.</p>

  <p>It remains our longer term aim to consider how best we might support the delivery of technology which would enable patients to have greater access to their own information.

  <p>The provision of police forensic science services is an operational matter for the Scottish Police Services Authority (SPSA). SPSA is currently undertaking a forensic modernisation project looking at all aspects of the service provided to police forces across Scotland and to the Crown Office Procurator Fiscal Service. This project will generate a service model which could have an impact on how the current facilities are used.</p>

  <p>SPSA intends to give staff, customers and stakeholders an opportunity to review the recommended service model and provide comment before presenting the proposal to the SPSA Board.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will consider the SPSA recommendations contained in the service model when they have been provided.</p>

  <p>It is the responsibility of public authorities to decide on the content of their Gender Equality Schemes. It is not the role of Scottish Government to ensure that Schemes include specific proposals to tackle violence against women or any other issue. However, we have a joint approach with COSLA to tackling violence against women, which recognises that violence against women is a consequence of continuing inequality between men and women and also a barrier to achieving equality.</p>

  <p><em>Safer Lives: Changed Lives</em> <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2009/06/02153519/1" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2009/06/02153519/1</a>.</p>

  <p>Tackling violence against women is therefore essential in meeting the Gender Equality Duty and this is why it is a gender equality ministerial priority. Ministers will be publishing a report in July 2010 giving an overview of progress across Scottish public authorities in tackling this problem.</p>

  <p>The sample of public authorities selected for the document review stage of our work included 10 local authorities (and 10 education authorities, eight of which were different from the local authority sample) and Gender Equality Schemes were one source of information scrutinised.</p>

  <p>The Zero Waste Scotland Programme funds a large number of projects that contribute to waste reduction and recycling targets. In the last year it has funded projects to tackle food waste and construction waste and it has provided funding support for third sector organisations and provided technical support to local authorities.</p>

  <p>All projects are funded on a competitive application basis, with funding decisions made by assessment panels based on ability to deliver and value for money. Applicants who are refused funding have a right to appeal any decision. Successful projects are funded on a contractual basis with performance assessed against agreed milestones. Funding may be reduced where milestones are not met, for a variety of reasons.</p>

  <p>There is no right to appeal against funding reductions once projects are up and running, but any reductions are only made following detailed discussions with projects.</p>
