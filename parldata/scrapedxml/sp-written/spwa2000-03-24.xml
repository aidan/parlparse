  <p>Following representations, the Chancellor announced in his pre-Budget statement that he had decided to exempt &quot;new&quot; renewables from the Climate Change Levy (CCL). Only non-domestic energy consumers will pay CCL, and they will be able to obtain exemption by purchasing electricity from all renewable sources excluding large hydro schemes. A certification system will be put in place to ensure that electricity for which exemption has been sought has in fact been sourced from qualifying renewable generation capacity. Exemption will be available to any company which purchases qualifying renewable energy, no matter where in the UK the company is located or the whereabouts of the renewable generation.</p>

  <p>Fisheries Research Services in Aberdeen is actively engaged in research on ocean climate and fisheries. However, it is currently not possible to predict the effect of climate change on fish stocks due to the complex nature of the interaction between climate and marine ecosystems. The observed warming of waters around the UK might be expected to favour species of southern origin at the expense of northern adapted species &#8211; though it is not clear whether this trend will continue or is merely a temporary phenomenon.</p>

  <p>I am fully aware of the recent flooding in Kilmarnock and Loudoun and of the concerns of those affected. Scottish Executive officials have been consulted informally on East Ayrshire Council&#8217;s proposed programme of works for reducing flood risk in its area and, in principle, are satisfied with the council&#8217;s proposals.</p>

  <p>It is for the council, in conjunction with its consultants, to take forward these proposals and to submit formal Flood Prevention Schemes to the Executive to seek the necessary powers and resources to proceed with the work. It is also for the council to decide on the timing of any work it intends to carry out and to obtain the agreement of the parties concerned.</p>

  <p>We are determined that nobody should be left behind as we move into the information age. Last November, when we set out our social justice targets, they included a milestone of accelerating the number of households in disadvantaged areas with access to the Internet. The Scottish Household Survey produces quarterly statistics indicating the number of Scottish households with Internet access from home. In disadvantaged areas, Social Inclusion Partnerships are required to monitor the percentage of households with Internet access from home and also the percentage of households with at least one adult who has Internet access elsewhere.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no plans to make representations to the UK Government. If using a mobile phone results in failure to exercise proper control of a vehicle, then that is already an offence under the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986. The police in Scotland consider these existing powers adequate. The Highway Code also recommends that drivers never use a telephone while driving.</p>

One of the main tasks of Pilot is to seek partnership solutions that will extend the life of the UKCS by means of greater international competitiveness.

  <p>Since Professor Kennedy submitted his recommendations for alternative arrangements to the existing system of quarantine in September 1998, the Scottish Executive has worked in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and other British Isles authorities, in putting together procedures to replace the existing six month quarantine arrangements, all on a UK basis. The pilot scheme introduced on 28 February this year will test the operational effectiveness of the proposed full scheme arrangements prior to these coming into force throughout the UK, this being planned for April 2001.</p>

  <p>The entry points under the pilot scheme were chosen on the basis that they met the requirements of rigorous testing, while at the same time ensuring close supervision of practical operation. Under the full scheme arrangements, entry points are expected to be limited to the existing points of entry under the present six month quarantine legislation, this being in line with Professor Kennedy's recommendations. There are no restrictions on exit points from the UK either under the existing arrangements or under the proposed new arrangements.</p>

  <p>Enquiries received about facilities for entry/exit points in Scotland have been answered on the above basis.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) carries out a comprehensive programme of monitoring of environmental radioactivity in Scotland. The programme includes monitoring of the Ayrshire coastline around the Hunterston A and Hunterston B nuclear licensed sites as well as monitoring the Solway coast to assess the impact of liquid radioactive waste from the Chapelcross nuclear licensed site. SEPA also carries out monitoring on the Solway coast to determine the impact of discharges from Sellafield on the Scottish environment.</p>

  <p>The materials sampled on the Ayrshire and Solway coastlines include sediment, seaweed, and turf samples. In addition, SEPA takes measurements to assess dose rates.</p>

  <p>Full details of the monitoring and assessment of radioactive pollution around the Scottish coast are published annually in the <i>Radioactivity in Food and the Environment</i> (RIFE) report. A copy of the current report (RIFE-4) is in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-03-24.S1W-5231.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80205" speakername="Henry McLeish" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa0324.htm#5231">

  <p>It is not possible to provide information on the number of small shop closures specifically, as these data are not collected. The best official guide to the pattern of business closures are VAT de-registrations data. These provide an annual assessment of the number of businesses de-registering from VAT. Many of the smallest businesses are excluded, as only those with a turnover above the VAT threshold (currently &pound;51,000 as of April 1999) are required to register.</p>

  <p>Figures are available for VAT de-registrations in Scotland for the retail and wholesale sector from 1980 onwards. These figures can only be considered to provide a <i>guide</i> to the number of small shop closures. All retail outlets are included in this category, irrespective of size, as well as businesses in the wholesale industry. Analysis at a lower industry level is not available.</p>

  <p>Given the above caveats, the table below shows the number of VAT de-registrations in the retail and wholesale sector in Scotland from 1980 to 1998:</p>

  <p>Note: There are breaks in the series in 1991 and 1993, due to the significant rises in the VAT threshold in these years, and in 1994, due to the adoption of the 1992 Standard Industrial Classification (SIC92) and the change from VAT registered unit to VAT registered enterprises. From 1994 onwards de-registrations are for the SIC92 industry sector of wholesale, retail and repair.</p>

  <p>I am today placing in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre details of the main rates of loans and grants, including various supplementary grants, which will be available to eligible undergraduate and postgraduate students in full-time higher education in 2000-01.</p>

  <p>The total support available to eligible students in 2000-01 will be 2.5% higher than in 1999-2000, thus maintaining its value in real terms. We are also increasing by the same factor the standard rates of payment made to institutions by the Student Awards Agency for Scotland.</p>

  <p>These changes are consistent with those for England and Wales announced by the Secretary of State for Education and Employment.</p>

  <p>Glasgow City Council will submit regular reports to Scottish Ministers on decriminalised parking enforcement in its area. The report will include, among other things, details of Penalty Charge Notices issued and when they were paid, details of cases going to adjudication, cases where no further action is taken and the number of vehicles the council has removed from the street because they were in breach of parking rules.</p>

  <p>As the parking authority, the council is also required to keep an account of income and expenditure in respect of designated parking places. Statute requires that details of this account are submitted to Scottish Ministers as soon as is practicable at the end of each financial year.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Parking Appeals Service will submit an annual report to Scottish Ministers on the discharge by the parking adjudicators of their functions in the Glasgow area.</p>

  <p>Most parking offences for most roads in the City of Glasgow area were decriminalised with effect from 4 October 1999. As a result, the relevant parking rules on these roads are now enforced solely by parking attendants employed by Glasgow City Council rather than by traffic wardens or the police as was the case previously. The only roads in the Glasgow area where these offences have not been decriminalised are motorways. On these roads, parking offences will continue to be a matter for the police, who are also responsible for the enforcement of all non-decriminalised traffic legislation throughout Glasgow.</p>
