  <p>I am aware that ITV has recently announced plans to reshape the delivery of their regional news programmes as part of their wider five-year plan. This is a commercial matter for ITV and the broadcasting regulator Ofcom, who are also looking at the future of news and public service broadcasting post digital switchover. The Broadcasting Commission will look at a number of issues, including the provision of news, as part of its wider role considering the economic, cultural and democratic importance of broadcasting to a modern, outward looking Scotland.</p>

  <p>While Scottish Gas is currently forecasting that it will install enough systems to ensure that the contract commitment of 12,000 installations is achieved, the Scottish Government recognises that more can always be done to improve performance, particularly in view of the low number of installations undertaken in island and rural areas. Communities Scotland and Scottish Gas hold regular meetings aimed at improving this and other aspects of programme delivery.</p>

  <p>In the last session, the Scottish Parliament voted to withdraw what was then Part 3 of the Protecting Vulnerable Groups Bill, which had outlined a statutory requirement to share information when there are concerns about a child, including young people living with parental drug and alcohol misuse.</p>

  <p>A draft Code of Practice for Sharing Information on this topic was widely circulated for comment earlier this year. The purpose was to gain early detailed feedback from stakeholders on its principles and general fitness for improving information sharing relating to the protection of children. Responses to that exercise are currently being analysed.While the draft code is at present on a non-statutory basis, this does not preclude information sharing to protect children being underpinned by legal duties at some point in the future.</p>

  <p>I admire the member&rsquo;s dedication and erudition in identifying two exceptions to the broad and unarguable historic trend which I identified previously and am happy to be guided, in terms of detail, by his further research.

The position of the Scottish Government is that it is committed to removing those barriers.</p>

  <p>I invited a range of organisations with an interest in ticks and tick-borne disease to a meeting on 20 September. At that meeting the group assessed the scale of the problem and potential impact on human health, the rural economy and on biodiversity. The group agreed to take action to promote awareness among the public, in particular among those who spend time in the countryside. Strategies for mitigation and control would be explored in areas with particular tick-related problems. The group also agreed to review the current state of research into ticks and tick-borne diseases and land-management policies that may affect tick numbers and distribution. The group will meet again early in 2008.</p>

  <p>Voluntary sector bodies are one of the three main categories of eligible organisations able to register, apply and compete for European Social Funds (ESF) under the 2007-13 Lowlands and Uplands (LUPS) and Highlands and Islands (H&amp;I) programmes. These main categories are - Voluntary or Charitable Organisations; Public Sector Organisations, and Joint Ventures (Public/Private Partnerships)</p>

  <p>The on-line registration process is now open for all organisations wishing to compete for ESF funding towards the cost of eligible projects. So far 48% of the registrations for LUPS, and 36% of the H&amp;I registrations are from voluntary sector bodies. More information on the very simple registration process is available at <a href="http://www.esep.co.uk" target="_blank">www.esep.co.uk</a> for the LUPS programme and at <a href="http://www.hipp.org.uk" target="_blank">www.hipp.org.uk</a> for the H&amp;I programme.</p>

  <p>If it is subsequently decided to make any adjustments in health boards&rsquo; relative funding these would be phased in over a number of years as has been the practice under both the SHARE and Arbuthnott formulae and no health board would receive less funding than it does at present.</p>

  <p>No assessment has been made by the Scottish Government on the impact of hospital car parking charges on residents living near hospitals.

  <p>Yes. The methodology used to calculate the distribution of funds to Scotland&rsquo;s police forces takes into account the increased costs of policing area of lower population density.

  <p>The Scottish Government discusses a range of issues, including firearms licensing, with the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland (ACPOS) on a regular basis. While the National Firearms Licensing Managers System (NFLMS) was being developed in England and Wales, ACPOS concluded that a national firearms register for Scotland could be achieved by augmenting the Scottish Criminal Record Office criminal history system and relevant information can now be accessed and exchanged by all GB forces through the Police National Computer (PNC). ACPOS is currently evaluating the potential business benefits to Scottish police forces from joining the National Firearms Licensing Managers System.</p>

  <p>We support the principles of the Scottish Compact, last reviewed in 2004, which was explicit that we should apply best practice in funding and in the administration of grants. We support the practice of three-year funding for the voluntary sector across the public sector and encourage the use of longer term funding agreements, where possible, to provide a stable and efficient operating environment for the sector.</p>

  <p>It is a matter for the police and the prosecution authorities to draw inferences from evidence of criminal activity. The Scottish Government considers that grouse shooting makes an important contribution to the rural economy of Scotland and also helps to maintain biodiversity on Scottish moorland. Poisoning of wild birds is not acceptable anywhere or in any circumstances. The Scottish Government believes that partnership between moorland managers and conservation bodies offers the prospect of establishing shared objectives and that is why we welcome the Langholm Moor project. Such initiatives provide the best approach to discouraging irresponsible actions; eliminating wildlife crime affecting moorland species, and encouraging responsible and sustainable management.</p>
