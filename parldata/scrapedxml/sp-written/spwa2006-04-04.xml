  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to reply. Her response is as follows.</p>

  <p>Communities Scotland guidance produced for use by local authorities on the preparation of Local Housing Strategies lists a range of people and organisations who are likely to have a contribution to make to the development of a local housing strategy.</p>

  <p>The list is not intended to be exhaustive or prescriptive and includes other local authority departments, registered social landlords, tenant representatives, neighbouring local authorities (given housing market area boundaries) and the private housing sector (e.g. house builders, solicitors property centres, landlords, rural landowners who provide housing for rent, letting agents and lenders). It also includes the NHS boards, Homes for Scotland, Scottish Water, the enterprise network and voluntary sector bodies (e.g. in areas of advice, ethnic minority communities, homelessness, young people and older people).</p>

  <p>The guidance can be found on the Communities Scotland website at: <a href="www.lhs.communitiesscotland.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.lhs.communitiesscotland.gov.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>I can confirm that, in light of concerns raised during the course of the appeal, Crown Counsel have instructed that a full investigation be carried out into the gathering and reporting of information to the Crown by Fife Constabulary.</p>

  <p>Fife Constabulary have consulted with the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland (ACPOS) and it has been determined that Lothian and Borders Police will conduct this enquiry, and report to the Area Procurator Fiscal for Lothian and Borders, Mr Frank Mulholland QC.</p>

  <p>The creation of a new street prostitution related offence is only one aspect of the Executive&rsquo;s policy on street prostitution.</p>

  <p>The new offence will focus on the nuisance or offence caused by street prostitution related activity, whether caused by the purchaser or the seller.</p>

  <p>In addition, we have committed to produce guidance for local authorities and their community planning partners on how they should address street prostitution within the context of an overarching approach to tackling violence against women and of building safer stronger communities. The guidance will outline how they should tackle the demand for prostitution, prevent vulnerable individuals from becoming involved in prostitution, reduce the harm to those who are involved, assist those ready to leave prostitution to do so, and ensure the safety of local communities.</p>
