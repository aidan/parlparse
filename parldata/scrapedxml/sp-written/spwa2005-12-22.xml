<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-12-22.3.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80064" speakername="Lewis Macdonald" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa1222.htm#2">

  <p>We remain committed to the fundamental principles of the full-cost recovery policy for the Care Commission. These are that the cost of regulating each care service should be identified and that the costs should either be met by the services concerned or explicitly be subsidised by the Executive where there are policy reasons to do so, as we do in the case of childminders and children&rsquo;s day care services.</p>

  <p>We are, however, aware of the impact of that policy on care service providers. That is why we have been working closely with the Care Commission on identifying the inputs and costs associated with the regulation of the individual care service sectors they regulate.</p>

  <p>We are also mindful of the Health Committee&rsquo;s review of the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001. That review will look at the Care Commission and the wider inspection regime, including funding issues.</p>

  <p>After carefully considering the implications of the commission&rsquo;s work on fee levels, and in recognition of the Health Committee&rsquo;s review, we have decided to freeze maximum registration and annual continuation fees at their current level in 2006-07. This means that fees for services currently regulated by the commission will remain below full cost recovery levels.</p>

  <p>The exception to the freezing of fee levels will be care homes. The fees charged by the Care Commission will be reduced by around 10% on current levels to around &pound;148 per place. This change reflects the input now required by the commission to regulate these services in light of its experience since 2002.</p>

  <p>In order further to reduce the administrative and financial burden on care service providers I have asked the Care Commission to set the fee levels for variation, cancellation and a new certificate at nil for all services.</p>

  <p>The Care Commission will continue to strengthen its evidence base on the activity needed to regulate care services. This will help inform our thinking on future fee levels.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive guidance for community learning and development (CLD) <em>Working and Learning Together to Build Stronger Communities</em>, was published in January 2004, a copy of which is available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre(Bib. number 38409). This guidance indicated that the overall responsibility for planning for CLD strategies rests with community planning partnerships, with local authorities expected to take responsibility for ensuring that arrangements are in place to set up and maintain partnership working at both strategic and operational levels.</p>

  <p>On behalf of the Scottish Executive, Communities Scotland, through its Learning Connections team, has responsibility for supporting the establishment of strategies. The guidance was issued to local authority Chief Executives with the expectation that community planning partnerships would develop strategies in the most suitable manner taking into consideration local community planning processes. Whilst timescales of development and delivery have differed there has been no indication of non-compliance with the guidance request. Thirty partnerships have delivered final strategies to Communities Scotland with a further two strategies awaiting final endorsement by their council and/or Community Planning Partnership.</p>

  <p>The definition of efficiency is the relationship between outputs and inputs. Of course outcomes are important, and as I have said before, the Executive pursues them across the whole range of its activities. However, it would be very difficult for us to separate out which improvements in outcomes were directly and solely attributable to our Efficient Government initiative. All progress towards our efficient government targets is being measured against the 2004-05 baseline.</p>

  <p>Community Health Partnerships, with devolved responsibilities from NHS boards, will have a central role in co-ordinating and delivering multi-agency services to address the assessed needs of their population, supported by the provisions available to them in the new General Medical Services and pharmacy contracts.</p>

  <p>The Executive has a long-term commitment to cutting premature deaths from coronary heart disease and stroke in Scotland, and has a clear strategy to achieve this. We aim to reduce under-75&rsquo;s mortality in coronary heart disease by 60% and in stroke by 50% by 2010. We are currently on target to achieve this &ndash; coronary heart disease mortality in the under-75s has fallen by 38% and stroke mortality in under 75s by 40% since 1995. The strategy also includes action to reduce the number of people who develop coronary heart disease or have a stroke, and to ensure that there is rapid access to high quality treatment for people who do. For instance, strategy funding has enabled all mainland boards to set up stroke units providing multi-disciplinary care for stroke patients.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive will introduce legislation this session to establish a new independent body to handle such complaints. Our policy is that complaints from clients should be dealt with wherever possible by the law firm or lawyer who provided the service in question. The new body, the Scottish Legal Complaints Commission, will act as a gateway to receive those complaints about lawyers which cannot be resolved at source. The new body will take over the handling of complaints about inadequate professional service from the legal professional bodies, the Scottish Legal Services Ombudsman and the Scottish Solicitors Discipline Tribunal.</p>

  <p>The legal professional bodies and their discipline tribunals will retain responsibility for professional discipline. The commission will accordingly refer complaints about the conduct of lawyers to the professional bodies for investigation, but will have powers to oversee the way in which conduct complaints are handled. The commission will be led by a board which will have a non-lawyer majority and a non-lawyer chair.</p>

  <p>The arrangements we propose recognise the strong message from the response to our consultation that there should be an independent complaints handling body and that its powers should be vested in a board rather than a single officeholder. The new system aims to build public confidence in the system for handling complaints against lawyers while the commission will also have the role of promoting good practice in complaints handling by law firms and practitioners. The commission will be funded by the legal profession through a general levy on legal practitioners and a levy on complaints. Vexatious or frivolous complaints will be sifted out and will not be the subject of a levy.</p>

  <p>Article 1 of the UN Convention Against Torture states that; &quot;torture means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions&quot;.</p>

  <p>The enactment of section 134 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 incorporated the offence of torture into UK law. Section 134 replicates Article 1 of the Convention and provides that a public official or person acting in an official capacity, whatever his nationality, commits the offence of torture if in the United Kingdom or elsewhere he intentionally inflicts severe pain or suffering on another in the performance or purported performance of his official duties. The offence is committed regardless of the nationality of the official, the country in which the torture takes place, whether the suffering is physical or mental, and whether it is caused by an act or an omission. It is punishable by a maximum period of life imprisonment.</p>

  <p>Conduct as described in Article 1 may also constitute the common law crime of assault, which is also punishable by a maximum period of life imprisonment.</p>
