  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what consideration it has given to the impact of the developing market in Single Farm Payment entitlements on the ability of new entrants to farming to access such entitlements.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2007-03-19.S2W-32304.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80032" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-07/wa0319.htm#1">

  <p>Entitlement trading is required by EC regulations; it facilitates the development of farm businesses, for example, following mergers, splits or inheritance of farms. The Executive recognises that access to entitlements would help new entrants by providing a stream of income through Single Farm Payments. There are, however, other significant barriers to entry, including the price and availability of land, and access to working capital. New entrants who entered farming immediately after the reference period (2000-02) were eligible to apply to the National Reserve for entitlements. When it is approved, the Scottish Rural Development Plan will contain a series of measures that will be attractive to new entrants.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it intends to introduce voluntary modulation of single farm payments and, if so, at what level if voluntary modulation is adopted by the Agriculture/Fisheries Council on 19 March 2007 and includes the adoption of the Article 3 proposal for a council regulation laying down rules for voluntary modulation of direct payments which allow member states to apply differentiated rates of modulation, so long as they are already using existing voluntary modulation and are applying single farm payments at a regional level.</p>

  <p>Voluntary modulation will be used in Scotland in order to deliver a credible Scotland Rural Development Programme that supports our priority outcomes for rural Scotland. I cannot confirm the rate until the European voluntary modulation regulation has been finalised. If the final version of the regulation permits, I confirm that Scotland will set its own rate of voluntary modulation.</p>

  <p>Information on average available acute staffed beds is given in Average available acute staffed beds by hospital; Financial years ending 31 March 1998 - 2006 a copy of which has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 42281).</p>

  <p>The Executive does not set target numbers for beds. These are local planning decisions taken by NHS boards who have the information necessary to make the correct judgements.</p>

  <p>There are good reasons for reductions in acute bed numbers:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>Medical advances continue to reduce lengths of stay associated with many planned procedures, and some are now routinely carried out in a few hours without the need for any overnight stay.</p>
<p>Numbers of acute in-patient beds do not include beds in dedicated day surgery units. Around 65% of elective admissions are day cases where there is no need for an overnight bed.</p>
<p>There are more beds targeted where they are needed. For example, the number of intensive therapy unit beds has increased by over 11% since 1999. These are by far the most expensive beds to staff and equip.</p>
<p>NHSScotland is making better use of available beds in acute specialties. Average bed occupancy has risen from 78% in the year ending March 1998 to 82.2% in the year ending March 2006.</p>

  <p>Including the pay rise for 2007, this represents a cumulative rise since 1997 of over 37% for all nursing staff and significantly more for those staff groups identified above as receiving additional uplifts. It should also be noted that many nurses will have gained financially as a result of having been assimilated onto the new Agenda for Change pay, terms and conditions package.</p>
