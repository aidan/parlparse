  <p>The first phase of the Executive&#8217;s adoption policy review published its report in June 2002 and made a number of recommendations aimed at reducing delay and drift within agencies. These include improving information sharing between agencies, making plans for permanence as soon as a child is looked after away from home and having one panel in an agency to consider all decisions on permanence.</p>

  <p>The Executive is currently working with colleagues in local authorities and the voluntary sector to consider how best to take forward these recommendations. A contract is being let to the British Association for Adoption and Fostering to undertake a scoping exercise on how to improve information sharing and matching of children and families in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Phase II of the adoption policy review is currently under way and is considering the legal framework for adoption and fostering. Among the issues that are being considered are ways in which the legal processes can be speeded up where that would be appropriate.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answers to the supplementary questions to question S2O-862 by Cathy Jamieson on 27 November 2003, what the timetable is for the proposed future bill on animal welfare and whether any such proposed legislation will affect the transportation of young companion animals.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive plan to introduce an Animal Health and Welfare Bill to the Parliament during Session 2004-05. It is not currently intended to legislate on the transportation of young companion animals in this bill as new regulations on the transportation of animals are currently being considered by the European Council. The Scottish Executive is in the UK negotiating team in Brussels and we hope to secure a prohibition on the commercial movement of puppies and kittens younger than eight weeks unless accompanied by their mother.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is in regular contact with the UK Government on a wide range of issues, including the implications for devolved matters in Scotland of its legislative programme. This contact reflects the approach, set out in Devolution Guidance Note 1 in accordance with the principles set out in the Memorandum of Understanding, that the administrations normally consult each other from an early stage on the development of relevant legislative proposals.</p>

  <p>On 28 November, Wales hosted the fifth British-Irish Council summit meeting at the Museum of Welsh Life, Cardiff, attended by the Deputy First Minister and Peter Peacock, minister with responsibility for Gaelic. The main role of the council is &quot;to promote the harmonious and mutually beneficial development of the totality of relationships among the peoples of these islands&quot;.</p>

  <p>The main focus of the summit meeting was indigenous, minority and lesser-used languages on which the Welsh Assembly government takes the lead in the council.</p>

  <p>The meeting highlighted the wide variety of policies, projects and initiatives supporting these languages within the various BIC administrations. The considerable commonality of goals and existing areas of collaboration between BIC members in this policy area were noted. While acknowledging that much of the work in terms of supporting and promoting indigenous, minority and lesser-used languages is specific to the circumstances of each BIC member administration, the council agreed on a number of areas where enhanced co-operation at governmental level would be beneficial. These areas include research into intergenerational language transmission; the potential for using ICT developments in facilitating and raising the visibility of indigenous, minority and lesser-used languages; and the potential for co-operating on the development of language use surveys.</p>

  <p>The summit itself enabled council members to exchange views on these important issues. The Scottish delegation fully supported the proposals for enhanced governmental co-operation in the field of indigenous, minority and lesser-used languages and drew attention to the work being undertaken to secure the status of the Gaelic language in Scotland and the commitment given in the Executive&#8217;s <em>Partnership Agreement for a Better Scotland</em> to introduce a national language strategy to guide the development of all of Scotland&#8217;s languages.</p>

  <p>As with previous summits, the meeting also received progress reports and agreed a plan for future work on the other subjects being taken forward by council members &#8211; in this case on co-operation on drugs, environment, health - the application of telemedicine, the knowledge economy, social inclusion (led by the Scottish Executive), tourism, and transport.</p>

  <p>I am placing a copy of the Communiqu&#233; issued by the British-Irish Council after the summit meeting in Wales in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 30172).</p>

  <p>Schools will continue to publish handbooks providing parents with paper copies of information including examination results. However, arrangements are now in place to significantly extend parental access to information with a comprehensive new website service and a new telephone hotline. The web service, which I will be launching next week, will allow parents to access a range of relevant information on a school by school basis. Parents will be able to access the website from home or work or from public libraries or community ICT facilities. Parents who prefer a hard copy of the material on the website will be able to ring a telephone number to request paper copies.</p>

  <p>The website allows information on all schools to be accessed and users can make comparisons with figures for two previous years. Information on each school is shown in a standard format, so comparing information between schools is straightforward. Policy makers, researchers and educationists may require information in different formats and we will handle requests for this in the usual way.</p>

  <p>The National Priorities in Education Performance Report 2003, a comprehensive description of performance across Scotland on all five priorities, will be published around the same time.</p>

  <p>Copies of the National Priorities in Education Performance Report will be placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 30161).</p>

  <p>All decommissioning grants are paid directly into the bank accounts nominated by scheme applicants. The owners of 50 of the 67 vessels currently covered by the decommissioning scheme have assigned their grants to secured lenders or mortgagees. However, we do not know what proportion of any individual&#8217;s grant is actually required to repay loans or other credit facilities that have been secured by using their vessel as collateral. That is a private matter between the applicant and their secured lender or mortgagee. The total grant covered by the 50 applications is &#163;23.7 million.</p>

  <p>The figures requested are not held centrally.</p>

  <p>Percentage of Scottish Executive expenditure allocated to higher and further education in cash terms since 1999.</p>

  <p>Total Scottish Executive expenditure and the amounts made available to the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council and the Scottish Further Education Council are contained in the Scottish Executive&#8217;s core accounts which can be found on the Scottish Executive&#8217;s website at www.scotland.gov.uk/publications. The amount of funding allocated to higher education institutes and further education institutes by the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council and the Scottish Further Education Council can be found in their annual reports. These are available on their websites at the following links:</p>

  <p>Expenditure allocated to higher and further education as a percentage of education as a whole</p>

  <p>Education is also funded through local authorities and the vast majority of resources provided to local authorities for education are paid through revenue support grant, which is largely unhypothecated. Details of how much each authority has spent on education services can be found in the <em>CIPFA Rating Review</em> publications.

  <p>This is an operational matter for NHS Greater Glasgow. However, I understand from the board that a range of services for people who self harm are in place. A liaison psychiatry and a self harm service was established in 2000. An adolescent service is also available and a children&#8217;s service is based at Yorkhill. NHS Greater Glasgow do not plan to open a resource centre specifically dealing with self harm since it is a symptom of a range of mental health problems and treatment will vary depending on the individual case. Following assessment and treatment, patients can be referred on to their local mental health resource centre where they can access a range of follow-up services.</p>

  <p>The board is developing proposals for a community network to ensure that all patients with a mental health problem receive appropriate support in the community. The Glasgow users network has a range of established fora to enable service users to become involved in the development of services.</p>

  <p>Exact information is not available centrally. Information from samples of GP records in practices across Scotland whose population is nationally representative suggests that approximately 7,200 patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis were seen by GPs in the year ended December 2002. However, this complex condition may be recorded in different ways by GPs, which might lead to some significant undercounting. The Executive&#8217;s Short Life Working Group, on the basis of published prevalence rates and population figures, estimated that at least 10,000 people in Scotland were likely to be affected by ME.</p>

  <p>The management of myalgic encephalomyelitis does not fall to a recognised medical specialty. As such, it is not possible to identify a specific number of consultants employed by each NHS board to treat this disease.</p>

  <p>Those clinicians who are involved in treating myalgic encephalomyelitis belong to a variety of disciplines and have gained their expertise by practical experience. Indeed, the best practice for the management of this disease requires a blend of different professional inputs, co-ordinated by the general practitioner and the primary healthcare team.</p>

  <p>NHS boards have been asked to consider what action could be taken in their areas to support the treatment of myalgic encephalomyelitis. Progress reports will be sought in early 2004.</p>

  <p>The high quality data collected by the Scottish Renal Registry enables the reasons for inequity of access to renal transplant waiting lists to be identified. These findings can then inform practice, such as the &quot;Guidelines for the Assessment of Patients for Transplantation&quot; recently introduced by UK Transplant, the British Transplantation Society and the Renal Association.

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS), to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>I and Ed Wozniak, Head of business and analytical services, represented SPS at the International Corrections and Prisons Association, of which we are national members, where I chaired part of the conference and Ed Wozniak delivered a paper. The costs of approximately &#163;5,200 were met fully by SPS.</p>

  <p>Telecoms regulation is reserved. It is currently undertaken by Oftel and, from later this month, by OFCOM. Oftel introduced the changes to directory enquiry services and a preliminary report on their effect is available on the regulator&#8217;s website. It is too early to assess the impact of these changes on Scottish businesses.</p>

  <p>Information on side-effects suspected to be associated with vaccines or medicinal products is routinely collected in the UK by the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) and Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The system in place to collect such data is the Yellow Card Scheme. As well as data received through the Yellow Card Scheme, the CSM and MHRA also use other sources of information to monitor the safety of vaccines and medicines such as formal safety studies, the published medical literature, information from pharmaceutical companies and other regulatory authorities throughout the world.</p>

  <p>Rare side-effects associated with vaccines and medicines may not have been identified or characterised in pre-licensing clinical trials. That is why these systems are in place to monitor safety in routine clinical practice when much larger numbers of patients will be exposed to the vaccine or medicine.</p>

  <p>The convener of the Holyrood Progress Group has informed me that EMBT/RMJM has not yet completed the contract for architectural services and continues to provide those services still required on a day to day basis. The architect is required to verify all work on site; to certify it complete, comment and approve trade contractor detail design drawings and resolution of complex interfaces, as well as carry out site inspections to determine that all the work undertaken meets the required specification. This will continue until practical completion of the building. Any outstanding design work relates to finalising detailed design issues within the remaining work packages in discussion with Bovis Lend Lease and the relevant contractors.</p>
