<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-07-25.S2W-17884.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80128" speakername="Allan Wilson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa0725.htm#1">

  <p>The drop-out rate for modern apprentices (MAs) is an operational matter for Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise. This information is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>However, the Executive did commission research in 2003 which looked at MA completion rates. The completion rates were as follows:</p>

  <p>2000-01: 48%</p>

  <p>2001-02: 51%</p>

  <p>2002-03: 48%</p>

  <p>The research pointed out that although the completion rate at that time (2003) was 48%, many apprentices who left the programme went into further or higher education, found or remained in full-time employment or changed their vocational qualification.</p>

  <p>4. Since the research, a number of recommendations have been implemented and the completion rates now stand at 55%.</p>

  <p>We are aware of the wireless network in Estonia. The Executive has of course supported a number of wireless network projects in Scotland including &quot;Connected Communities&quot; which will bring broadband coverage to parts of the Western Isles. Furthermore, our recent procurement was technology neutral and has led to a contract which will deliver broadband access to every Scottish community by the end of 2005.</p>

  <p>Should Caledonian MacBrayne decide to move to offshore employment contracts there would be no effect on employees&rsquo; tax liabilities. Employees would continue to pay Income tax and National Insurance Contributions in the UK. As a result, there would be no effect on employees&rsquo; entitlement to contributory benefits including Incapacity Benefit, Basic Retirement Pension, Second State Pension (if not contracted out), Job Seekers Allowance and bereavement benefits. Employees would also continue to be eligible for Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit. The key changes would be in relation to Statutory Sick Pay and Statutory Maternity Pay, although broadly equivalent arrangements would apply, and employees would no longer be eligible for Statutory Paternity Pay or Statutory Adoption Pay. However, CalMac has confirmed that it would ensure that there would be no financial detriment to any employee as a result of any changes and this would be included in employees&rsquo; terms and conditions.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the draft invitation to tender for Clyde and Hebridean ferry services makes any provision in respect of the successful tenderer being liable to pay UK taxes and national insurance and, if not, whether it will consider bids from companies which are registered offshore for tax purposes.</p>

  <p>The draft service specification, published for consultation in December 2004, does not make any specific reference to the liability of the operator of the Clyde and Hebridean ferry services in relation to UK taxes and national insurance. If tendering is required, the liability of the operator of the services to UK tax would be determined according to UK tax law.</p>

  <p>If tendering goes ahead the Executive would be required, by the Maritime Cabotage Regulation, to conclude the contract on a non-discriminatory basis in respect of all community shipowners (as defined by the regulation). The Executive would not be able to take into account the place where a bidder is registered, providing the bidder fulfils the criteria for a community shipowner</p>

  <p>Caledonian MacBrayne has advised its employees that should offshore crewing proceed, the company would ensure that there was no financial detriment to any employee as a result of any changes and that this guarantee would be written into employees&rsquo; terms and conditions of employment. CalMac employees would continue to be employed within the UK and on UK flagged vessels.

  <p>None.</p>

  <p>The improved or new assets constructed as a result of PPP projects will usually be accounted for on the contractor&rsquo;s balance sheet. Valuations and accounting treatment during the contract are the responsibility of the PPP contractor. When the asset is eventually transferred to the public sector client at the end of the contract, the asset will take its place on the public sector balance sheet and be valued and maintained accordingly.</p>

  <p>The increase in spend reflects the Scottish Executive corporate pay increases each year. It is also worth commenting that the spend in 2003-04 was slightly lower than expected because a number of posts fell vacant in the course of that year.</p>

  <p>To help achieve this aim training is provided in all areas of equality, diversity and discrimination to staff and managers at all levels. In addition, an intranet site provides information and guidance to staff on a range of equality and diversity issues.</p>

  <p><strong>George Reid MSP (on behalf of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body): </strong>Scottish Parliament Corporate Body staff members do not currently record exact time spent on each individual task. In the case of this particular Freedom of Information (FOI) request, times were estimates, based on either requests made of individual staff members on time spent or known time spent by/with the FOI Action Officer.</p>

  <p>These particular estimates, broken down and detailed below, were input with a high degree of confidence, on an on-going basis for the duration of the request. This particular request consumed a significant amount of resource, primarily because the originating incident on which the request was based happened five years ago, and all staff members who dealt with it have since left the organisation. As a result a fairly extensive investigation had to be undertaken to establish what happened, and subsequently, who held information about it now.</p>

  <p>The breakdown is as follows: staff time from BIT &ndash; 16.5 hours and from the Security office &ndash; 1.5 hours.
