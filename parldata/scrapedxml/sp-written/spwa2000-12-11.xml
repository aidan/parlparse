  <p>The increased local authority resources for the environment, announced by Sarah Boyack on 22 September, comprised &pound;20.4 million for capital expenditure on flood prevention and coast protection, air quality monitoring and contaminated land, and &pound;29.2 million for revenue expenditure on access to the countryside and waste.</p>

  <p>Revenue resources will be distributed through the local government finance settlement. Additional resources for contaminated land will be distributed as part of the section 94 capital consent allocations issued to local authorities. However, it is a matter for local authorities to determine their spending priorities and allocate resources accordingly.</p>

  <p>It will be for authorities to submit suitable schemes to take up the additional capital resources available for flood prevention and coast protection and air quality monitoring.</p>

  <p>The UK Government and the Scottish Executive share a determination to modernise the NHS through investment and reform.

  <p>The subject of high hedges is currently under consideration by the Executive.

Responses to the consultation are currently being evaluated so that the Executive can consider what action, if any, may be appropriate.</p>

  <p>&pound;173 million was added to this year&#8217;s Scottish Health budget following the UK budget. In line with my statement to Parliament on 22 March, the Executive has sought to target this investment to areas of greatest need and in ways which will deliver significant improvements to patient care. &pound;60 million was allocated to health boards (on a formula basis) in June to address priority areas such as reducing waiting, tackling delayed discharge and preparing for winter. As I announced on 21 September, a further &pound;12 million is being allocated to health boards to kick-start the implementation of the revised funding formula recommended by the Arbuthnott report.</p>

  <p>The remainder of these resources have been targeted to specific priority areas and have, where appropriate, been channelled through health boards. For example, &pound;26 million has been earmarked for health improvement, &pound;30 million for equipment and &pound;8.4 million for additional staff.</p>

  <p>Throughout we have sought to strike a balance between effective strategic planning at a national level while allowing scope for health boards and NHS Trusts to address local needs and priorities.</p>

  <p>Of the &pound;135 million carried forward under the end year flexibility arrangements from 1999-2000, &pound;101 million has been allocated to health boards and Trusts or has been earmarked to meet slippage in the capital programme.

Of this &pound;34 million, we have already announced &pound;10 million for local authorities to help reduce the number of delayed discharges from hospitals into the community; &pound;4.5 million will be used to address the health-related needs of rough sleepers and, as I announced on 5 October, a further &pound;5 million will be used to buy more aids and adaptations to help the elderly to live at home in the community.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what recourse an individual has in terms of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 sections 1, 12, 12A and 13A if a local authority delays providing permanent care in a nursing home once that individual has been assessed as requiring such care.</p>

  <p>If an individual believes that a council is not meeting any of its obligations adequately, he or she can pursue the matter through the local authority&#8217;s complaints procedure with the council&#8217;s Monitoring Officer or the Local Government Ombudsman, or ultimately through the courts if he or she believes that the council is not meeting its statutory obligations.</p>

  <p>There are already many activities under way to offer advice and support to sufferers of stress and their families across Scotland, including in rural areas. For example, the Executive provides funding to Stresswatch Scotland to carry out such services across Scotland. We are also in regular contact with other bodies involved in providing similar services, and are aware, for example, that many health boards in rural areas are involved in activities to offer support to those suffering stress and other emotional and mental health problems. Given the range of activities already under way, we do not consider that a further initiative targeting stress in rural areas is required at this time.</p>
