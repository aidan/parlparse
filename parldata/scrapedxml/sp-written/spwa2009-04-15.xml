  <p>No new legislation will be required to deliver the activity set out in the Scottish Community Empowerment Action Plan to support communities to own assets. The Plan recognises that communities owning their own land and buildings can have a huge impact on their empowerment, but that asset ownership won&rsquo;t be the answer for all communities and that it is complex issue. It commits to putting in place a range of practical support which will help communities to overcome barriers to asset ownership and these are currently under development.</p>

  <p>The Government currently has no plans to extend the six-month council tax exemption for empty properties. We are committed to the abolition of council tax and its replacement with a fairer local tax based on ability to pay. In the meantime we have announced our intention to fund a freeze on council tax for each of the years up to 2011-12.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is discussing amendment of the Homeless Persons (Unsuitable Accommodation) (Scotland) Order 2004 with COSLA.

Extension of the order to cover young people who have left care is being considered.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that the Support and Assistance of Young People Leaving Care (Scotland) Regulations 2003 and associated guidance are clear that a local authority providing accommodation for care leavers must ensure that this accommodation is suitable.

  <p>The statutory definition of overcrowding is contained in Part VII of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987. Local authorities have various powers and duties in relation to overcrowded houses and their occupants, including carrying out inspections to identify overcrowded houses and taking levels of overcrowding into account in the preparation of local housing strategies.</p>

  <p>The Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 (Licensing of Houses in Multiple Occupation) Order 2000 was introduced to protect tenants whose principal or only residence is a multiply-occupied house. Local authorities are responsible for identifying unlicensed HMOs and ensuring that conditions of licences are complied with, including the number of occupants allowed.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is aware of concerns that some landlords may be evading HMO licensing requirements by claiming that properties are being let on a short term basis, and that tenants have principal residences elsewhere. In doing so, some landlords may be putting tenants at risk of overcrowding.</p>

  <p>We will be considering the options for implementing new HMO provisions in the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 later this year. The issue of short term lets, and what types of accommodation require to be licensed under those provisions, will be part of our discussions with stakeholders.</p>

  <p>Those five NHS Boards which charged for car parking at NHSScotland operated car parks have implemented a range of measures to prevent abuse. My officials are working with NHS Boards and Health Facilities Scotland to prepare guidance on car park management using the experience gained since car park charges were abolished. This will be published in due course.</p>

  <p>Measures include zoning of car parks for the different groups of users (patients, visitors and staff), use of time restrictions in patient and visitor car parks during peak hours and use of civil penalty notices to deter misuse of car parks.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service, to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Prisoners who test positive on admission are assessed with a view to determining their health care and support needs. A range of responses exist for those prisoners who test positive during their sentence. These range from being punished through the removal of privileges, to the provision of assessment, support and health care interventions.</p>
