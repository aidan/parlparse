  <p>Scottish Development International does not keep records of how many jobs are created by individual inward investors in a given year. The published figures reflect the number of jobs which a company plans to create or safeguard at the time its decision to invest in Scotland was made. The published figures refer only to projects in which Scottish Development International and its partners can claim to have had a significant involvement in ensuring that the project takes place in Scotland. The following figures relate to projects where a company has made a decision to invest or expand and where the main activity of the project is manufacturing. Not all jobs created by a manufacturing project are necessarily manufacturing jobs.</p>

  <p>The requested information is not held by the Scottish Executive. The UK Government&rsquo;s Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) has collected statistics from generating companies in respect of total output across all hydro stations since 2000.</p>

  <p>Hydro output statistics for Scotland have been published in the September editions of the DTI &quot;Energy Trends&quot; publication, which may be found on the DTI internet site at: <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/inform/energy_trends/" target="_blank">http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/inform/energy_trends/</a>.</p>

  <p>Pumped storage hydro is excluded as the energy which is used to pump the water may not originate from renewable sources. Information is not disaggregated to the level of individual stations. This information is only held by the generating companies themselves.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what action is being taken to support those diagnosed with myasthenia gravis; what treatments are being offered to them by the NHS, and what research into the disease is taking place.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-08-03.S2W-17871.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80064" speakername="Lewis Macdonald" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa0803.htm#7">

  <p>The Executive does not manage the care of people with myasthenia gravis directly. We would expect NHS boards to provide treatment and, with local authorities, support services based on their assessment of local needs.</p>

  <p>The treatment given for myasthenia gravis or any other any illness is a matter for clinical judgement based on the individual circumstances of each case. There is no cure for myasthenia gravis but the effects may be alleviated by drug treatments, and it is possible in some cases for the condition to be improved by surgical treatment. Treatment by plasma exchange or an infusion of intravenous immunoglobulin, both of which would require admission to hospital, may be given when the effects of the condition have become life-threatening.</p>

  <p>The National Research Register (NRR) records three ongoing studies and 28 completed studies on myasthenia gravis in the UK. Details of these projects are available from the NRR, a copy of which is in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 17404).</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will publish a list of the (a) learning providers who have enrolled in the new Individual Learning Account scheme, (b) number of learners that each provider has so far assisted and (c) organisations that have either refused to participate or withdrawn from participation (i) since the scheme started and (ii) compared with the original scheme.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-08-03.S2W-17797.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80128" speakername="Allan Wilson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa0803.htm#8">

  <p>There are currently 183 registered ILA Scotland learning providers, including further education colleges, higher education institutions, private and community-based learning providers. This includes a number of individual outreach learning centres formally registered under the aegis of a single learning provider. A full list of the currently registered ILA Scotland learning providers is available on the scheme website at: <a href="http://www.ilascotland.org.uk" target="_blank">www.ilascotland.org.uk</a> .</p>

  <p>Since the launch of the ILA Scotland low income funding offer in December 2004 over 10,000 learners have opened learning accounts. To date 3,500 learners have booked learning and 2,500 learners have begun learning with ILA Scotland assistance. It is not intended to publish information on the number of learners being assisted at the level of each individual learning provider as a matter of course, although information on the overall number of learners assisted by ILA Scotland will be provided on a regular basis via the ILA Scotland website.</p>

  <p>Learning providers are not individually invited to participate in the scheme. The registration process is open to any learning provider to apply provided they hold one or more of the specified quality standards. Registration is also subject to additional quality checks. It is for each individual learning provider to decide whether to submit an application to participate in the scheme. There have been two applications to date from learning providers which were withdrawn before they had formally completed the registration process.</p>

  <p>The eligibility criteria for learning providers to participate differ significantly between the first ILA scheme and ILA Scotland. The registration process for learning providers is considerably more rigorous and more restrictive for ILA Scotland than for the original scheme, taking full account of lessons learned regarding quality assurance requirements. This limits the number of potentially eligible learning providers. It is thus not possible directly to compare learning provider participation in ILA Scotland with the original scheme.</p>

  <p>In January 2005 the ratio of nursery teachers to children in local authority pre-school education centres was 1:37. In private pre-school education centres the ratio was 1:69.</p>

  <p>These figures are taken from the Pre-school and Childcare Census 2005. The definition of nursery teachers used is &quot;staff delivering pre-school education who are registered with The General Teaching Council for Scotland&quot;.</p>

  <p>The ratio represents the ratio of teachers to children registered at the centre &ndash; it does not represent numbers of teachers working with children at any one time.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not hold a central register of all public sector IT projects and therefore could only provide the information requested at disproportionate cost. This answer covers IT projects approved by the Scottish Executive Information Systems Steering Group.</p>

  <p>Three Scottish Executive IT Projects budgeted to cost over &pound;1 million are currently in progress.</p>

  <p>The estimated physical area taken up by golf courses in each local authority area is shown in the following table. It should be noted that they do not include driving ranges or short &quot;pitch and putt&quot; type courses. The areas are in hectares and are calculated using the Scottish Executive Planning Advice Note No. 43 - Golf Courses and Associated Developments. Using that guidance, a set range is applied to calculate the minimum and maximum area of a course: for a 9 hole course (ie 20 - 30 hectares) and for a 18 hole course (ie 50 - 70 hectares). The table expresses the total hectare coverage as a minimum, maximum and average for all 9 and 18 hole courses in each local authority area.</p>
