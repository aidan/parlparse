  <p>A portfolio of three complementary studies has been developed and are funded by Scottish Government to drive forward this commitment. As a result of an initial scoping exercise undertaken, these studies are more extensive than previously outlined in the framework.</p>

  <p>The studies have been commissioned by Health Scotland working with the Scottish Government and other key partners such as the Scottish Prison Service. They include mapping of current plans and practice both in the prison and community justice settings. They will identify and recommend good practice as well as conducting primary research into the feasibility and effectiveness of delivering alcohol brief interventions for offenders in the community justice settings of probation and community service.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government plans to hold an event later this year to bring together stakeholders, including those from the Scottish Prison Service, criminal justice social work, and the police to share the emerging findings of these studies and discuss any recommendations.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Government is providing significant funding to a three year pilot in Tayside which focuses on the delivery of healthcare and forensic services to those people in police custody, including those who misuse alcohol, as well as linking people to the services available in the community. As part of the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Bill currently being considered by Parliament, community payback orders are highlighting the opportunities for courts to refer offenders to alcohol services.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not keep information about the number of racing greyhounds.</p>

  <p>However, the <em>Independent Review of the Greyhound Industry in Great Britain</em> by Lord Donoughue of Ashton, published in November 2007, estimated that there were about 10,000 greyhounds registered each year. The racing career of a greyhound is approximately from 15 months to about four or five years, thus at any one time there may be about 32,500 greyhounds registered to run at tracks operated under the Greyhound Board of Great Britain (GBGB) rules.</p>

  <p>In addition, Lord Donoughue estimated that there may be an additional 4,000 greyhounds which run at independent tracks. This would give a GB racing population of approximately 36,500 greyhounds.</p>

  <p>Section 24 of the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006 makes it an offence to fail to ensure that the needs of a protected animal are met. All dogs, including dogs used in greyhound racing, are protected animals.</p>

  <p>The act describes an animal&rsquo;s needs as including: its need for a suitable environment; its need for a suitable diet; its need to be able to exhibit normal behaviour patterns; any need it has to be housed with, or apart from, other animals; its need to be protected from suffering, injury and disease.</p>

  <p>Section 19 of the act makes it an offence for the person responsible for an animal to cause it unnecessary suffering, either by an act or omission.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is not aware of any assessment of the impact on greyhound racing if all racing greyhounds were required to be microchipped. However, all greyhounds registered with the Greyhound Board of Great Britain require greyhounds to be permanently identified. From April this year this identification includes a microchip.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government fully support microchipping and have advised dog owners to microchip their animals in the Code of Practice for the Welfare of Dogs (paragraph 5.12). This paragraph details the procedure, explains the many advantages of microchipping and reminds dog owners to update the data base should their circumstances change.</p>

  <p>However, whilst strongly in favour of microchipping, we believe that the decision on whether to microchip should remain voluntary and we have no plans to make microchipping of dogs compulsory.</p>

  <p>The answer to question S3W-32853 explained the reason for a &pound;20,000 underspend in the animal health and welfare publicity budget for 2008-09. This underspend was not part of the outturn efficiency of &pound;20,000 from that budget as reported in the Efficiency Outturn Report for 2008-09.</p>

  <p>The efficiency saving of &pound;20,000 was achieved by using new methods of providing information to farmers and other stakeholders on animal health and welfare matters. Making greater use of text messaging and email reduced the cost of mailshots whilst maintaining the same level of service.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it proposes to review the extent to which the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator is implementing the provisions of the Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005 stipulating that bodies, including independent schools, should enjoy charitable status only if the fees that they charge are not unduly restrictive.</p>

  <p>Under the Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005, to meet the charity test, a body must be established only for charitable purposes and demonstrate it provides, or intend to provides, public benefit. When determining whether a body provides public benefit the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator (OSCR) must have regard to how the benefit to the public compares to any private benefit or any disbenefit that may result from the activities of the particular body. OSCR must also have regard to whether there are unduly restrictive conditions, including fees or charges, on obtaining the benefit the body provides.</p>

  <p>The interpretation of these statutory provisions in the discharge of its regulatory duty is entirely a matter for OSCR, as an independent regulator. OSCR has produced guidance on <em>Meeting the Charity Test</em> which includes information on how they will assess public benefit. This is available on their website <a href="http://www.oscr.org.uk" target="_blank">www.oscr.org.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>Yes, I can confirm that HMIE will work with local authorities and schools to support their implementation of Curriculum for Excellence before August 2010.</p>

  <p>This support is included in the 10-point plan which was published on 30 March 2010 and states that: <em>HMIE work with education authorities and schools to support their implementation of Curriculum for Excellence with effective innovation promoted through inspections.</em></p>

  <p>HMIE will continue to take this forward with teachers and education authority staff through, for example, professional dialogue during inspections, capacity building work and sharing good practice in implementation of Curriculum for Excellence and other actions which are still under consideration.</p>

  <p>There is a wealth of material that has been digitised within Scotland and a massive undertaking by the National Collections and other organisations supported by the Scottish Government to ensure that cultural works are preserved and accessed through digitisation. A number of partnerships and collaborations including Digital Access Scotland exist to co-ordinate and advise on the various aspects of digitisation in national and local collections.</p>

  <p>On-line accessibility is ensured through the organisations&rsquo; own websites together with the use of sites such as Flickr and YouTube. These websites comply with the Disability Discrimination Act to ensure inclusion for all online users.</p>

  <p>Making cultural works available in a digital format widens access to the collections and also preserves the items for future generations.</p>

  <p>Scotland is involved in all four elements of the 2012 Cultural Olympiad: Ceremonies (we are working with London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games (LOCOG) to develop the route and content of the Torch Relay through Scotland); Inspire Mark (two Scottish cultural projects have so far received the Inspire Mark, making them an official part of the Olympiad); Open Weekends (we are actively engaging with a wide cross section of the Scottish cultural sector to encourage participation in Open Weekend 2010 in July), and Major Projects (including Scottish artist Craig Coulthard being commissioned to create the &quot;Forest Pitch&quot; under the &quot;Artist Taking the Lead&quot; strand; two Scottish disability arts companies receiving commissions under the &quot;Unlimited&quot; strand and Scottish composers and ensembles being commissioned to create new musical works for 2012, under the &quot;Sounds&quot; strand).</p>

  <p>In addition, The Legacy Trust UK has co-funded, with the Scottish Arts Council, Scotland&rsquo;s five cultural strands collectively known as the Scottish Project. The Creative Programmer, based at the Scottish Arts Council, is working closely with LOCOG to determine how Scotland&rsquo;s cultural organisations can be profiled within the finale of the Cultural Olympiad.</p>

  <p>In late 2009, Scottish Ministers mandated the Scottish Arts Council to co-ordinate cultural activity across all cultural sectors in Scotland in the context of both London 2012 Cultural Olympiad and Glasgow Commonwealth Games in 2014. The key vehicle for delivering on this mandate is the Cultural Operational Delivery Group, which comprises representatives from the National Collections (museums, galleries, libraries), National Performing Companies, The Cultural Alliance, British Council, Event Scotland, Architecture and Design Scotland, Festivals Edinburgh, Scottish Natural Heritage, Volunteer Development Scotland, VOCAL, Culture and Sport Glasgow and the Glasgow 2014 Organising Committee. This is a significant forum for the discussion and planning of activity relating to the Cultural Olympiad, and presents an unprecedented opportunity to galvanise and unite the Scottish cultural sector behind London 2012 and Glasgow 2014.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of the higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes among Scottish South Asians compared with the population as a whole, what steps it is taking to ensure earlier diagnosis and better access to treatment for these groups and what evidence there is that any such measures have been successful in reducing this health inequality.</p>

  <p>We want to ensure that heath care outcomes for people living with diabetes from minority ethnic communities are comparable to general Scottish population outcomes. The Diabetes Minority Ethnic Group (DMEG), a sub-group of the Scottish Diabetes Group, was re-established in 2008, in recognition of the need to address both the significantly higher prevalence of diabetes among some minority ethnic communities and ensure access to the best possible care.</p>

  <p>Part of DMEG&rsquo;s remit is to improve the dissemination of information to minority ethnic people about the prevention and early detection of diabetes. In January 2010, DMEG published a diabetes education package for minority ethnic groups in English, Urdu and Chinese. This resource will shortly be augmented by the development of a DVD focussing on diabetes in South Asians. The DVD will incorporate an educational approach which focuses on improving knowledge and changing behaviour. Healthcare professionals and community groups will be able to use these resources to help raise awareness of the additional challenges diabetes presents to black and minority ethnic communities and improve outcomes.</p>

  <p>Research from NHS Tayside shows evidence of equity of access and quality of care for South Asians, but marginally poorer outcomes. This is something which will be addressed in the revised Diabetes Action Plan due to be published in the near future, drawing on current work in NHS Fife on reviewing service provision for black and minority ethnic groups.</p>

  <p>The Prevention of Diabetes and Obesity in South Asians (PODOSA) study, being carried out by a research team from Edinburgh and Glasgow Universities, is working with people at high risk of developing diabetes to encourage weight loss and increased physical activity, in order to find out if this approach can prevent or delay the onset of diabetes. So far, over 1,300 people have been screened. The study will finish in October 2012 and is expected to report in early 2013.</p>

  <p>Our &quot;Keep Well&quot; and &quot;Well North&quot; programmes assess people&rsquo;s risk of cardiovascular disease in our most deprived communities, using the ASSIGN risk calculator, which has been designed to be as accurate as possible in Scottish circumstances by factoring in family history as well as deprivation. Those found to be at risk are offered lifestyle advice, referred on to further services, or prescribed suitable medication.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Public Health Network is, at the request of the Scottish Diabetes Group, currently looking at early detection of Type 2 diabetes.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government issued a call for expressions of interest for its new piece of research on broadband in Scotland on 12 April 2010 and, following this, will shortly be issuing an invitation to tender to short-listed candidate tenderers. We expect to be in a position to select the successful tenderer and formally commission the research in May. We envisage the research will take four to five months to complete, and that it will form part of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s evidence-base for future policy development on broadband.</p>

  <p>These targets are being met across the vast majority of Scotland. However, as in the rest of the UK, there is a small number of urban locations where the limit value for nitrogen dioxide is not expected to be met by the end of the year. The four UK administrations are currently preparing a joint submission to the European Commission for an extension to 2015 for meeting this limit value, by which time it is expected to be achieved throughout Scotland.</p>

  <p>I am not aware of any requests from British Waterways for discussion with Scottish Government ministers or officials on this specific topic.</p>

  <p>British Waterways carries out routine management and conducts surveys of aquatic plants to maintain a navigable channel and enable early response. British Waterways also carries out prioritised control of bank-side invasive non-native species where these are a problem including Japanese knotweed, knotweed hybrids, Himalayan balsam and giant hogweed on the Crinan, Caledonian and Lowland Canals (the latter includes the Forth and Clyde, Union and Monkland Canals).</p>

  <p>Where invasive non-native species downgrade the ecological status of a waterbody, the Water Framework Directive River Basin Management Planning process (co-ordinated by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency) may identify additional measures for British Waterways to take.</p>

  <p>It is for the industry to come forward with an application to amend the specification and single document. Any proposed amendment must comply with the requirements set out in Article 9 of the EC Regulation 510/2006.

  <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency has decided that its laboratory services can best be delivered through a centre of excellence model, located at two main laboratory sites based in Aberdeen and the central belt. These laboratories will be supported by a field science and scientific advisory service based in locations across Scotland.</p>

  <p>SEPA intends to implement this model over the next two to five years on a phased basis to coincide with changes to its estate in the locations affected.

  <p>The data shown are based on self-reported &quot;not smoked, or smoked no more than five cigarettes, since one month follow-up&quot;. The remainder of the quit attempts, those not recorded as &quot;successful&quot; at 12 months after quit date, will include both &quot;known smokers&quot; and cases &quot;lost to follow-up/smoking status unknown&quot;. In Tayside in 2008, for example, the cumulative percentage of cases &quot;lost to follow-up/smoking status unknown&quot; at 12 months after &quot;quit date&quot; was 60%, with 31% of cases &quot;known smokers&quot; and 9% &quot;known quits&quot;.</p>

  <p>&pound;4 million is being made available through the Scottish Government&rsquo;s eHealth programme to further expand telehealthcare services across the country over 2010-11. All 32 local health and social care partnerships are being offered &pound;120,000, subject to committing match funding of an equal or greater amount.
