  <p>The Glasgow 2014 Candidate City File (CCF) set out the environmental plans for the games. The CCF made specific commitments that all new and refurbished games associated buildings will be no or low carbon, to low emission zones around games venues, car-free venues, high technology vehicles in the games village and the use of renewable energy. The CCF also committed to the provision of a fund, by the Scottish Government, to Commonwealth countries for off-setting carbon emissions generated by the games. This will be targeted at climate change adaptation and mitigation in Commonwealth countries. Furthermore, the Scottish Government is committed to ensuring that the games village is carbon-neutral.</p>

  <p>Delivery of the measures contained within the CCF is a matter for the Games Organising Company, in conjunction with the key games partners &ndash; the Scottish Government, Glasgow City Council and the Commonwealth Games Council for Scotland &ndash; and in consultation with key environmental bodies represented on the Glasgow 2014 Environmental Forum.</p>

  <p>Research evidence from West Dunbartonshire Council&rsquo;s Early Intervention Initiative is very encouraging and provides a model of good practice. The Scottish Government has acknowledged the success of the initiative and would encourage other education authorities to look at what has been achieved. The attainment of Scottish pupils in reading is generally good with 81% of pupils attaining national levels. The Scottish Government is fully committed to raising levels of attainment in literacy and the <em>Curriculum for Excellence</em> places strong emphasis on the development of literacy across the curriculum, with all teachers having responsibility for promoting language and literacy development.</p>

  <p>Research evidence from West Dunbartonshire Council&rsquo;s Early Intervention Initiative is very encouraging. The government has acknowledged the success of the scheme and encourages other authorities to look at what has been achieved. Individual education authorities and schools are free to make their own judgements about what approaches to literacy development best meets local need. Many other authorities are also achieving good results with early intervention approaches as evidenced by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Chief Inspector of Education. Our historic concordat with COSLA emphasises that our relationship with local government should be focussed on outcomes.</p>

  <p>I have asked James Hynd, Acting Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The arrangements for handling waiting lists for central heating this winter, announced on 21 November 2007 by the Cabinet Secretary, will allow for accelerating installations for some applicants who are eligible for an installation under the private sector central heating programme. The key criterion for an installation to be accelerated on this basis is that the applicant has no heating and hot water. Since the objective is to minimise difficulty for pensioners who meet this criterion we have asked Scottish Gas to give most urgent attention to those who have no heating and hot water and are over 80, according to the length of time they have been waiting, and to those for whom having no heating or hot water could worsen a medical condition or significantly reduce their ability to live independently.</p>

  <p>The managing agent, Scottish Gas, will accelerate installations for householders who fall into this group in a way that does not slow down progress for those householders who are not in this situation, including those who already receive priority help from the programme on medical or social grounds.</p>

  <p>Officials are currently carrying out an internal review of the extent of fuel poverty in Scotland which will assess how effective current programmes have been in making progress towards our target to end fuel poverty, as far as is reasonably practicable, by 2016 and whether the resources deployed on current programmes are being used to best advantage.</p>

  <p>The annual report on the central heating programme and warm deal provides an estimate of annual reductions in carbon emissions as a result of measures installed. For example over 2005-06 programmes achieved a predicted annual reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of 66,687 tonnes. As well as improving the approach to tackling fuel poverty the current review will examine opportunities to strengthen the links between fuel poverty, energy efficiency and climate change objectives as part of our progress towards a fairer Scotland.</p>

  <p>JP courts will be established in Grampian Highland and Islands when the existing district courts come under the management of the Scottish Court Service. We expect this to happen in June 2008.</p>

  <p>Business will be transferred from sheriff courts to JP and district courts during the first half of 2008, in line with the Crown Office&rsquo;s revised marking guidance and the new power that the district and JP courts will have to disqualify people from driving in cases other than &quot;totting-up&quot; cases. As in other areas of Scotland, there will be on-going communication between the Justices&rsquo; Training Committee of Grampian Highland and Islands, the Crown Office and the Judicial Studies Committee to ensure that justices of the peace and legal advisers are properly equipped to deal with any new types of cases that are transferred to the JP or district courts.</p>

  <p>Since 10 December 2007, planning and reporting on the training of JPs in Grampian Highlands and Islands has been the responsibility of the Justices&rsquo; Training Committee for that sheriffdom. This committee is made up of justices of the peace, a sheriff and a legal assessor. The committee is currently considering the training needs of different parts of the sheriffdom, and is discussing with the Scottish Government the possibility of holding a further residential event for JPs before June 2008, when courts in Grampian, Highlands and Islands come under the management of the Scottish Court Service.</p>

  <p>Levels of investment in school infrastructure in its area is a matter for East Ayrshire Council. The Scottish Budget and the concordat signed by the Scottish Government and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities provide for significant growth in the capital resources being made available to local authorities. There is almost &pound;3 billion over the three year period 2008-09 to 2010-11 to secure investment in schools and other local government infrastructure, including an extra &pound;115 million in 2008-09 which can be invested in schools. The local government capital budget represents an average increase of 15% in each year of the settlement compared to 2007-08 figures. It is also open to authorities to maximise their capital investment in schools by utilising all available sources of funding.</p>

  <p>There is currently nothing to stop manufacturers from declaring the origin of their products provided it is accurate and not misleading for consumers. We are currently providing incentives to manufacturers to provide this information by supporting initiatives such as the NFU&rsquo;s &quot;what is on your plate&quot; and encouraging consumers to choose more local, sustainably sourced, food.</p>

  <p>In 2008, the Scottish Government plans to consult the people of Scotland on whether civil legislation should be introduced to protect those affected by forced marriage, or that there is currently sufficient legal protection. This consultation will link with the work currently underway within communities to raise awareness of this very serious issue. Members of the Forced Marriage Network are key to this activity and the network will reconvene in 2008 to further develop the Scottish Government&rsquo;s work in this area.</p>

  <p>The majority of the organisations working to support those affected by forced marriage are funded by the Scottish Government. We recently demonstrated our on-going commitment to tackling Violence Against Women by allocating &pound;40 million over the next three years to this work.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is working with partners in the public and voluntary sector to progress action in Scotland on this matter. Currently, there are a range of organisations working with those affected by forced marriage, including Shakti and Hemat Gryffe Women&rsquo;s Aid, Saheliya, Amina the Muslim Women&rsquo;s Resource Centre and the Council of British Pakistanis (Scotland). This is in addition to mainstream services offered by the police, local authorities and Women&rsquo;s Aid groups. All these organisations are members of the Scottish Forced Marriage Network which was established in March 2005, and played a key role in the joint UK Government/Scottish Government consultation on whether to criminalise forced marriage. It is planned to reconvene the network in 2008 to further develop the Scottish Government&rsquo;s work to tackle this very serious issue.</p>

  <p><em>Getting it right for every child in kinship and foster care - the National Kinship and Foster Care Strategy</em> was published on 4 December 2007. Parliamentary question S3W-7325 announced the launch of the strategy and a consultation on associated regulations. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="../../../webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a> .</p>

  <p>The strategy sets out our proposals for kinship carers. Approved kinship carers of looked after children will be given the same level of support by local authorities, including the payment of an equivalent level of financial support as that paid to their foster carers. This approach has been agreed with local government as part of the government&rsquo;s concordat with COSLA published on 14 November 2007. We anticipate each local authority will begin the process of approval during 2008-09. To support this, the expert reference group established by the strategy will recommend an approval process, which local authorities can use and adapt for their local purposes.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will fund Citizens Advice Scotland (CAS) to provide a service for all kinship carers covering advice, information and support on income, tax and benefits entitlements and relevant legal issues. We anticipate that this service will be introduced from spring 2008.</p>

  <p>In addition, COSLA has agreed to recommend to its members that they discuss their approach and criteria for the payment of discretionary support of kinship carers under the powers local authorities already have. This will ensure as far as possible that there is consistent local advice and approaches to supporting kinship carers.</p>

  <p>Gaelic specific grants are available to local authorities towards the cost of delivering Gaelic education within their area, or towards the cost of providing access to it in another authority&rsquo;s area. A percentage of this grant scheme is also directed towards St&ograve;rlann N&agrave;iseanta na G&agrave;idhlig, the National Gaelic Resource Centre. Following approval from ministers, Gaelic specific grants are allocated to those authorities who are providing, or plan to provide, Gaelic education. All authorities in Scotland, however, may submit applications for funding. The real value of this grant scheme is its flexibility to promote the development of Gaelic education in certain areas of the country or certain sectors within education in line with local requirements. In order to promote and extend Gaelic education in Scotland, this grant scheme will be retained as a ring-fenced grant scheme and it will continue to be administered flexibly so that awards of grant can be made to meet the changing pattern of need as developments are undertaken and further progress is made.</p>

  <p>As I made clear in my previous response, it is imperative that NHS boards engage with patients and the public and that their views are fully taken into account as proposals for service change are developed. The remit of the Independent Scrutiny Panel (ISP) which I set up to consider NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde&rsquo;s (NGSCC) proposals included assessing the degree to which the board&rsquo;s pre-consultation proposals appropriately took account of the views of local stakeholders. The ISP received an interim report from the Scottish Health Council on the board&rsquo;s engagement process to inform this part of their work.</p>

  <p>The ISP report was published on 4 December and is available on the panel&rsquo;s website: <a href="http://www.independentscrutinypanels.org.uk/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.independentscrutinypanels.org.uk/index.html</a>.</p>

  <p>I expect NHSGGC to take full account of the findings of the ISP in developing its proposals for public consultation. As with any proposals for significant service change, final decisions will rest with ministers. In making a decision I will take full account of all the available information, including the ISP report and the Scottish Health Council report on the board&rsquo;s consultation process.</p>

  <p>There is no legal definition of a rural school in Scotland.

These definitions form part of our urban / rural classification, the details of which are available on the Scottish Government website at: <br /> <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2006/07/31114822/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2006/07/31114822/0</a> .</p>

  <p>The Scottish Budget announcement on 14 November 2007 outlined our intention to transfer the Strategic Waste Fund to the main local government settlement. This transfer will include monies awarded via the &quot;SWF 150&quot; scheme and other resources provided to local authorities under the Strategic Waste Fund for community recycling initiatives in their area.</p>

  <p>As well as the resources transferred to the local government settlement, the Budget document outlined a zero waste provision to assist implementation of the National Waste Plan. The Budget document indicated that some of these resources would be used to support community recycling groups. The Scottish Government is currently considering with the Community Recycling Network for Scotland and the Waste and Resources Action Programme exactly how these resources should be used. In particular, we are considering targeting these resources at waste prevention, innovation in recycling, and community recycling groups seeking to become social entrepreneurs.</p>

  <p>We have a target to halt the growth of municipal solid waste by 2010. Latest figures suggest municipal waste growth is between 1% to 1.5%.</p>

  <p>We have no targets for the reuse of waste but the impact of successful programmes on reuse is to contribute to the target on halting waste growth.</p>

  <p>We have a target of recycling/composting 30% of waste by 2008. Latest figures for the year July 2006 to June 2007 show that we are recycling 29.8% of municipal waste. We estimate that Scotland needs to achieve around 40% recycling/composting of municipal waste by 2010, to meet our share of the EU Landfill Directive target on reducing the amount of biodegradable municipal waste sent to landfill.</p>

  <p>The National Waste Plan also has a target of 55% recycling/composting by 2020.</p>

  <p>Finally, there are recycling targets laid down in producer responsibility regimes, such as the producer responsibility system for packaging. The Scottish Government, and other government departments across the United Kingdom, are consulting on recycling targets for packaging for 2008 and thereafter. This consultation can be found at <br /> <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/consult/packaging-reg07/consultation.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/consult/packaging-reg07/consultation.pdf</a>.

  <p>The current National Waste Plan envisaged that energy would be recovered from 14% of municipal waste by 2020.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has received an Outline Business Case from the City of Edinburgh Council, West Lothian Council, East Lothian Council, Midlothian Council and Scottish Borders Council outlining their proposals for residual waste treatment as an alternative to landfill. This Outline Business Case is not technology specific. We are expecting another Outline Business Case from North Lanarkshire Council and South Lanarkshire Council shortly. The Scottish Government has not yet decided whether these Outline Business Cases should receive any funding from government.</p>

  <p>We are considering the way ahead on waste policy generally, following the Scottish Government&rsquo;s waste summit on 3 October 2007. Our consideration includes dealing with the question of the role of energy from waste as we move towards a zero waste Scotland. We intend to make an announcement in the New Year on waste policy.</p>

  <p>We are aware of a number of proposed energy from waste plants being built without financial support from government. Any such plants would be subject to planning permission requirements and would need to be licensed by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency.</p>
