  <p>A review of EU Directive 91/630 is already underway. As the first stage of this review, the Commission's Scientific Veterinary Committee has submitted a report which highlights the welfare disadvantages of tethers and close confinement stalls and which recommends group housing for sows in which they can turn round easily.</p>

  <p>We are continuing to press the Commission to bring forward early proposals and have made it clear that we expect them to at least match the standards which already apply in this country.</p>

  <p>Eligible students entering higher education in academic year 1999-2000, and those who entered in 1998-99, are able to apply for means-tested help with their tuition fees and for a partly means-tested maintenance loan. The need to apply the means test to both elements of assistance has involved significant changes in the application process.</p>

  <p>The students affected should apply to the Awards Agency in good time for both tuition fee and maintenance support. Details of their entitlement will be notified to the students and his or her parents or spouse, as appropriate. The information on tuition fee support will also be passed to the institution concerned and that on loan entitlement to the Student Loans Company Limited.</p>

  <p>The necessary changes to the Agency&rsquo;s computer software have been made and it is currently processing applications under the new arrangements. It has also engaged additional seasonal staff to meet the peak demand and it is accepting applications from students on the basis of conditional offers.</p>

  <p>While proposals for the new Assisted Areas to operate from 1 January 2000, announced recently, would reduce the population coverage in Dumfries and Galloway by a little more than half, substantial areas of economic development opportunity, the great majority of which have already benefited from Regional Selective Assistance, are still included. I have no reason to expect these proposals will greatly affect aid available to industry in the region.</p>

  <p>The population coverage in the UK under Objective 2 of the European Structural Funds will be reduced under the new Regulations. It is important to target carefully the areas to be nominated and identification of these areas is taking longer than had been expected. Every effort is being made to finalise the list as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>We are actively seeking to improve the standards of our bathing waters. One of our targets is that all Scotland&rsquo;s beaches will meet clean water standards by 2005.</p>

  <p>To help achieve this, over the coming months we shall be encouraging partnership approaches such as that taken by the South Ayrshire Council, the West of Scotland Water Authority and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) in relation to the problem of west coast bathing water standards. We shall continue to explore with the water authorities, SEPA and others what can be done to improve bathing water compliance. These discussions will take account of such surveys as that conducted by the Marine Conservation Society.</p>

  <p>Partnership For Scotland commits the Scottish Executive to review the effects of the reductions to discounted tolls on the Bridge made in 1998 and to freeze the tolls at their current levels in cash terms for the remainder of the contract. These measures give direct benefit to users. We do not intend to establish an inquiry into the issues referred to, but I draw Mr Munro&rsquo;s attention to the detailed examinations already carried out by the National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee.</p>

  <p>There are no legal proceedings in progress against any of the parties that were responsible for the design and construction of the Kingston Bridge.</p>

  <p>The Secretary of State inherited two court actions against the consulting engineers who designed the bridge when he took over responsibility for this structure when the M8 through Glasgow was adopted as a trunk road on 1 April 1996. The actions were settled out of court in 1997 without any admission of liability on the part of the defendants. Each party bore its own expenses. Beyond that the terms of the settlement are confidential to the parties.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no plans to commission a study on the re-opening of a railway from Perth to Edinburgh via Kinross.</p>

  <p>I understand that Fife Council has commissioned two transport studies relevant to the question. The South Fife and Forth Estuary Public Transport Study includes an examination of the feasibility of re-opening the Cowdenbeath to Kinross railway line to passenger traffic. The Fife and South Tayside Rail Study is looking at ways of improving rail services on existing lines in the Fife, Perth and Dundee area. The Scottish Executive awaits with interest the final outcome of the studies and Fife Council&rsquo;s views upon them.</p>

  <p>A preferred line for a new crossing of the Forth at Kincardine was announced in November 1998. Consultants are currently being appointed to take forward the complex issues of ecological, aesthetic and engineering design. Draft orders under the Roads (Scotland) Act 1984 are expected to be published in spring 2001 and, if there are objections to the orders, a public local inquiry will follow. The construction timetable depends upon completion of these statutory procedures and upon the availability of trunk road resources. Construction is unlikely to be able to start before 2003.</p>

  <p>The proposed new crossing will connect the existing Bowtrees roundabout at the junction of the M876 and A907 on the south bank of the estuary to the Gartarry roundabout at the junction of the A977 and the A907 on the north bank. The A977 north of Gartarry roundabout is not a trunk road and any future improvements are a matter for the relevant local authorities.</p>

  <p>Previous studies of local economic development concluded that increased tourism and the attraction and retention of mobile investment would be the principal economic benefits to the adjoining areas from the construction of the new crossing.</p>
