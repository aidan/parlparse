  <p>Information prior to 1979 is not available because the agreed definition does not cover the classification of causes of death used before 1979.</p>

  <p>The Executive is funding a pioneering new project at Aberdeen University, providing &pound;1.39 million over 2005-10, to embed inclusive approaches to teaching for pupils with additional support needs, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD), within initial teacher education. The findings and best practice will be disseminated to other initial teacher education providers.</p>

  <p>The Executive also provides education authorities with &pound;7.2 million per year specifically for the training and development of staff working with pupils with additional support needs. The priority is to tailor educational provision to meet the needs of the individual pupil. A further &pound;13.5 million is issued annually to allow local authorities to co-ordinate and provide continuing professional development (CPD) for teachers.</p>

  <p>Additionally, following recent talks with the Executive, the General Teaching Council Scotland has now added five new areas to their professional recognition framework, one of which is Additional Support Needs - Autism.</p>

The council is required to meet its statutory responsibilities for the assessment and delivery of services to older people in its area.

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Grant aided expenditure (GAE) allocations are derived from aggregating a number of sub-categories which together make up the older people&rsquo;s services GAE line.</p>

  <p>2. Revenue expenditure is sourced from Local Financial Return (LFR) 3, completed by local authorities, which covers social work services.</p>

  <p>3. Revenue spending may differ from the GAE allocation for a number of reasons. Firstly, the GAE allocations given are neither budgets nor spending targets for older people&rsquo;s services. They are components used in distributing the total block grant that the Executive provides to local authorities. Secondly, it is for each local authority to decide how best to allocate the resulting overall block grant across all its services, based on local needs and priorities.</p>

  <p>4. The LFR3 return was revised in 2002-03 as part of a review of all LFRs. Due to the changes, pre 2002-03 figures are not directly comparable with those for 2002-03 onwards.</p>

  <p>I am considering a range of measures to improve the support available to kinship carers and to children in their care. I will announce my proposals in the <em>National Fostering and Kinship Care</em> <em>Strategy</em> which will be published later this year.</p>

  <p>In addition, I recently announced funding of &pound;4 million to cover a number of matters, including:</p>

  <p>Increasing training opportunities to enhance the skills of both foster carers and kinship carers;</p>

  <p>Establishing a national information and advice service for kinship carers through Citizens Advice Scotland, and</p>

  <p>Information on the prevalence of type 1 and type 2 diabetes is available at NHS board level from the annual Scottish Diabetes Survey. The Survey, which was first published in 2001, includes data from primary and secondary care and is currently the most comprehensive source of information on diabetes in Scotland.

  <p>The Scottish Diabetes Survey draws on data from primary and secondary care and currently represents the most comprehensive source of information on diabetes at Scotland level. The most recent report (2005) includes information on the prevalence of type 1 and type 2 diabetes, nationally and at NHS board level. The report is available at: <br /> <a href="http://www.diabetesinscotland.org/diabetes/MaintainPages/pdfFiles/SDS2005.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.diabetesinscotland.org/diabetes/MaintainPages/pdfFiles/SDS2005.pdf</a> .</p>

  <p>The Scottish Public Health Observatory (ScotPHO) website provides links to international sources of information on diabetes, most commonly prevalence. Note however that variations in the source of data and completeness of recording make these comparisons unreliable.

  <p>International comparisons of diabetes prevalence have been usefully reviewed by Wild et al (Wild S, Roglic G, Green A, Sicree R, King H. Global prevalence of diabetes: estimates for the year 2000 and projections for 2030. Diabetes Care 2004; 27:1047-53).</p>

  <p>Under the Education (Additional Support for Learning)(Scotland) Act 2004, education authorities have a duty to identify, provide for and keep under review the additional support needs of each pupil for whose education they are responsible. This should ensure that dyslexia is identified as early possible.</p>

  <p>Significant funding is provided to education authorities to support the education of children with additional support needs including dyslexia. In 2007-08, this includes, &pound;61.7 million for implementation of the Education (Additional Support for Learning ) (Scotland) Act 2004, the inclusion of pupils with additional support needs in mainstream schools, the training and development of school staff working with pupils with additional support needs and accessibility to education for pupils with disabilities.</p>

  <p>In addition, HM Inspectorate of Education is undertaking a specific evaluation of dyslexia over the period 2007-08, which will provide a clear picture of identification, provision and practice across Scotland.</p>

  <p>The model which UHI Millennium Institute has based their applications for taught degree-awarding powers and university title on has distinctive characteristics which are different to any other institution in the UK. Therefore it would not be straightforward for UHI Millennium Institute to use the University of Cumbria, or any other institution, as an example in gaining university title.</p>

  <p>The power to grant consent for the use of university title lies with the Privy Council under section 49 of the Further and Higher Education (Scotland) Act 1992. UHI Millennium Institute&rsquo;s applications are with the UK Universities Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA) and its Advisory Committee on Degree Awarding Powers (ACDAP). The criteria applied by QAA to the University of Cumbria in assessing its suitability for university status will also be applied to UHI Millennium Institute.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive continues to support UHI Millennium Institute in its aspiration for university title and officials are working closely with UHI Millennium Institute, Highlands and Islands Enterprise, the Quality Assurance Agency and the Scottish Funding Council.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angelina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Discussions are currently taking place between Communities Scotland and West Dunbartonshire Council to identify unsuitable and low demand housing stock within the Clydebank area, but it is the responsibility of the council to address such stock deficiencies within their Local Housing Strategy (LHS). The Strategic Housing Investment Plan, which the council is required to develop in consultation with Communities Scotland, registered social landlords (RSL) and other partners, will set down, over the medium term, actions and investment levels to address the replacement/refurbishment of poor quality housing as identified within the LHS.</p>

  <p>A robust LHS and comprehensive Strategic Housing Investment Plan are key to determining the levels of funding required and the allocation of resources. It is the responsibility of West Dunbartonshire Council to submit these plans to Communities Scotland who will assess them in accordance with its published guidance. Clydebank will, therefore, have the same opportunities to access investment as all other areas across Scotland.</p>

  <p>Following representations about this matter from the Scottish Beef Cattle Association and others I discussed the position with the then Secretary of State for the Environment and Rural Affairs on 18 June 2006. As a consequence the UK Government raised the issue with the EU Commission the following day. I then wrote directly to Commissioner Kyprianou on 3 July 2007 underlining my concerns.</p>

  <p>As outlined in the Cabinet Secretary&rsquo;s statement in the Chamber on 6 June 2007, we have instructed the board of NHS Lanarkshire to review their original plans and to produce revised proposals that will enable accident and emergency services to continue at the three main hospital sites in the region.

  <p>Consideration of the process for the original proposals was a matter for the previous administration. As the Cabinet Secretary said in her statement on 6 June 2007, we believe that the decisions to close the accident and emergency departments at Monklands Hospital and Ayr Hospital were wrong, because in our view NHS Ayrshire and Arran&rsquo;s review of services and NHS Lanarkshire&rsquo;s picture of health review failed to address sufficiently the very real concerns of a significant proportion of their local populations.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what steps it is taking to ensure that local authorities do not use supply teachers or probationer teachers to limit the number of available new permanent teaching posts.</p>

  <p>The employment of teachers is a matter for local authorities as employers. All local authorities have agreed to offer probationers posts on the Induction year. Not all posts are suitable for probationers and it is the responsibility of local authorities to identify those that are.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive why it is allocating funding to local authorities to employ an additional 300 newly qualified teachers given the position in the market for probationer teachers.</p>

  <p>The teacher induction scheme guarantees an offer of a one-year teaching post to newly qualified, eligible probationer teachers. Since the scheme&rsquo;s inception in 2002, an offer of a place has been made for 100% of eligible probationers.</p>

  <p>An additional &pound;9 million has been made available to local authorities this year to employ a further 300 teachers with a particular emphasis being placed on the employment of teachers who have just completed their one year induction.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive funds only Volunteer Development Scotland and the network of 32 volunteer centres as volunteering infrastructure bodies.</p>

  <p>Value for money is ensured by the agreement of a business plan, a sound grant application and on-going monitoring. Regular meetings are held with volunteering infrastructure bodies to discuss a range of topics, including best use of resources.</p>

  <p>Under the EU Landfill Directive, the amount of biodegradable municipal waste sent to landfill in Scotland must not exceed 1.32 million tonnes by 2010, 0.88 million tonnes by 2013 and 0.62 million tonnes by 2020. The <em>Landfill Allowance Scheme</em> <em>(Scotland) Regulations 2005</em> ensure that each local authority has to landfill within a limit consistent with Scotland achieving these targets.</p>

  <p>The <em>National Waste Plan</em> sets out aims to stop the growth in the amount of municipal solid waste produced by 2010 and reduce the landfilling of municipal waste to 30% by 2020.</p>
