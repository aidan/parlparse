  <p>Funding support for local initiatives to reduce alcohol problems cannot be identified separately. NHS boards and local authorities fund such work from within their general health allocations and Grant Aided Expenditure respectively.</p>

  <p>The Forth Valley NHS Board area has benefited significantly from additional resources allocated by the Scottish Executive to tackle drug misuse for the period 2001-02 to 2003-04. This includes an additional &#163;0.89 million in drug treatment funding to the NHS board, over &#163;1.1 million to the three local authorities (Stirling, Falkirk and Clackmannanshire) for drugs rehabilitation and over &#163;0.83 million to the three local authorities through the Changing Children's Services Fund for work with young people and families. Funding is used not only for drugs specific work, but also for prevention, treatment and care services covering all forms of substance misuse.</p>

  <p>The Executive provides the multi-agency Forth Valley Substance Action Team with over &#163;161,000 support funding. This supports the strategic and co-ordinating function of the team on all substance misuse issues. In particular it includes assessment of local needs and drawing up a local strategy to address alcohol problems, in response to the national <em>Plan for Action on Alcohol Problems</em>, launched earlier this year.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for employment and industrial relations, including employment rights, is reserved to the UK Government.</p>

  <p>The Department of Trade and Industry advises that whether an employee in Scotland is required to work on Sundays is a contractual matter for negotiation and agreement between the employer and employee, or the employee's representatives.</p>

  <p>If employees in Scotland are required to work on Sundays against their will, or are dismissed for refusing, they may be able to seek redress under common law or unfair dismissal legislation.</p>

Local authorities' homelessness strategies will provide the framework for ensuring that these resources are used in the most effective manner.</p>

  <p>An updated <em>Code of Guidance on Homelessness</em> was published in 1998. It now requires further updating to reflect various changes both in legislation and good practice, including changes arising from the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001. Work to produce a fully updated code will begin later this year and will be completed following the passage of the forthcoming Homelessness Bill. Publication, following consultation, is expected by the end of 2003. If there is a need for any interim guidance to be issued on an earlier timescale then this will be prepared in consultation with the Homelessness Monitoring Group which has been established to oversee implementation of the recommendations of the Homelessness Task Force.</p>

  <p>Under clinical governance NHSScotland is expected to implement evidence-based guidance from bodies such as Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN). SIGN Guidelines are an integral part of the development of condition-specific standards by the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland.

  <p>I have made clear to NHS Chairs that action must be taken to address this issue. NHS Chief Executives have received the same message from the Head of the Health Department. The Clinical Standards Board for Scotland (CSBS) is currently visiting individual NHS trusts to confirm its assessment of performance against the standard, including planning arrangements.</p>

  <p>Following up the CSBS interim report was discussed at the recent HAI convention. A detailed action plan based on that discussion will be issued later this year. When the CSBS has completed its detailed assessment of individual trust's performance further action appropriate to local circumstances will be agreed.</p>

  <p>Delegates were chosen in a variety of ways to achieve a balance of established leaders and fresh faces with particular commitment and dynamism. The civic delegation will make their own arrangements regarding travel, accommodation and programme for the Summit. The Executive has offered to pay the travel, accommodation and subsistence costs of four of the members of the civic delegation, and it is estimated that this will cost &#163;7,000 in total.</p>

  <p>Each member will arrange their own programme to gain the greatest benefit possible from the Summit for their sector. Therefore the role of individual members will vary, but in general the delegation will raise awareness in their sector about the Summit and the issues it seeks to address, attend the events at the Summit most relevant to their particular sector, and be available to advise the First Minister and the Executive at the Summit. Most importantly these civic delegates will act as catalysts for concrete action to further sustainable development in their sector on their return.</p>

  <p>By supporting the civic delegation in this way, we believe that the Executive can help civic society in Scotland play their full part in building a Sustainable Scotland.</p>

The First Minister chose to attend personally to represent Scotland at the highest possible level and to show the importance that the Executive places on sustainable development. The officials chosen to support the First Minister are the Principal Private Secretary to the First Minister, a Special Adviser and the Head of Environment Group.</p>

  <p>A Scottish civic delegation will also attend the United Nations World Summit on Sustainable Development. Details of this civic delegation are given in the answer to question S1W-27506.</p>

  <p>Much of the preparatory work, which included two comprehensive public consultations, is described in a report which is available in the Parliament's Reference Centre (Bib. number 22146).</p>

  <p>In addition to the work summarised in that report, we have outlined our vision for a Sustainable Scotland and indicators to measure progress towards that vision in <em>Meeting the Needs&#8230;</em> which is available in the Parliament's Reference Centre (Bib. number 20879).</p>

  <p>In preparation for the Summit we are sharing our work with others - the Deputy Minister for Environment and Rural Development spoke to the Stakeholder Forum conference on the World Summit on Sustainable Development on 16 July, 2002 in Birmingham. We have also brought together business, unions, public sector, voluntary organisations and interested members of the public for the first Scottish Sustainable Development Forum to discuss how we can take sustainable development forward in Scotland.</p>

  <p>We are also helping the young people's civic delegate, Stephanie Wiseman, to collect views about the Summit and sustainable development in preparation for the Summit.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive's objectives in attending the United Nations World Summit on Sustainable Development are:</p>

  <p>to show that Scotland takes sustainable development seriously. Whilst the focus of the summit is the sustainable development of poorer countries, this means that developed countries must set their house in order too. Sustainable development is a devolved issue and we shall not shirk from our responsibility to the planet;</p>

  <p>to show that sustainable development matters to the people of Scotland. We have listened to what ordinary Scots have to say and will represent these views in Johannesburg, and</p>

  <p>to inform our actions. The Scottish Executive and civic Scotland will act to ensure that sustainable development here reflects the decisions and discussions in Johannesburg.</p>

  <p>The answer to question S1W-27593 explains that the programme for the United Nations World Summit on Sustainable Development has not yet been finalised. Therefore we cannot estimate costs for some of the categories requested. The costs we can estimate at present for the Scottish Executive delegation total is &#163;10,420. This comprises:</p>

  <p>accommodation per delegate: 10,550 Rand (approximately &#163;675)</p>

  <p>total accommodation costs: 42,200 Rand (approximately &#163;2,700)</p>

  <p>All hotel rooms must be booked through the Johannesburg World Summit Company (JOWSCO), a non-profit company wholly owned by the South African government. JOWSCO have imposed a 10-day minimum charge for each room for the duration of the Summit, so the high charge is unavoidable.</p>

  <p>JOWSCO will charge approximately &#163;40 per person to provide shuttles for travel from accommodation to summit venues for delegates.</p>

  <p>total cost: &#163;160</p>

  <p>return flights to Johannesburg per delegate including tax: &#163;1,890</p>

  <p>total cost: &#163;7,560</p>

  <p>Accreditation to the United Nations World Summit on Sustainable Development is free.</p>

  <p>The cost of supporting the Scottish civic delegation is outlined in the answer to</p>

  <p>question S1W-27506.</p>

  <p>A Scottish Executive official was part of the UK preparatory visit at the end of July in order to organise the programme for the Scottish delegation. This is estimated to have cost &#163;2,100.</p>
