  <p>The measures to enable closure of the Erskine Bridge to high-sided vehicles only have been very successful since first implementation on 11 October 2007.

  <p>I refer the member to the Public Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2006 which can be found at the following website: <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/scotland/ssi2006/20060001.htm#12" target="_blank">http://www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/scotland/ssi2006/20060001.htm#12</a> .</p>

  <p>The thresholds for application of the Public Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2006, which give effect to EU rules, are set out in regulation 8 of those Regulations and are summarised on the Scottish Government website:</p>

  <p>Our national approach to managing long-term conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis is outlined in our Better Health Better Care Action Plan. Our aim is to draw on personal experience to develop services which address each person&rsquo;s needs and which recognise people with long-term conditions, and their carers, as equal partners in the management of their condition.</p>

  <p>SIGN Guideline 48 on the management of early rheumatoid arthritis is currently being updated with a focus on drug therapies, exercise therapies and diagnosis. Publication is due in autumn 2009. NHS boards are expected to implement the guidelines through local protocols.</p>

  <p>NHS Quality Improvement Scotland is working on a clinical audit of care in rheumatoid arthritis (CARA), to implement key SIGN guideline recommendations. The outcomes of the audit are intended to inform the process of the generation of clinical standards of care and the final report is due later this year.</p>

  <p>The trunk road operating companies who maintain the M8 have been asked by Transport Scotland to prepare 21 provisional maintenance schemes for the M8 in the next year. The final programme will be drawn from these and the actual number will depend on the availability of funding and spending priorities. Routine and cyclic maintenance will also be undertaken at regular intervals during this period.</p>
