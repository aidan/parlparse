  <p>Offences involving tobacco smuggling are prosecuted under the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 and the records of prosecutions under that Act do not distinguish between different types of contraband. Customs and Excise estimate that cases concerning the smuggling of &quot;personal use&quot; quantities run at about 35 a year and these typically do not result in custodial sentences. So far as smuggling of commercial quantities is concerned, all cases reported by Customs and Excise have been prosecuted and the figures are as follows:</p>

  <p>There were no cases completed in 2000 but three cases are to be tried early in 2001. It should also be kept in mind that, under the wide jurisdictional provisions of the 1979 Act, some cases with Scottish elements have been prosecuted in English courts. Figures are not available for such cases.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has played a full part in the negotiations to date on all aspects of the proposed revisions to the Large Combustion Plant Directive and has been in regular contact with the UK Government and the European Commission as negotiations have developed. Under the Common Position adopted by the Council in November 2000, the Directive would not apply to plants used on off-shore platforms. This was also the case in the European Commission&#8217;s original proposal for a revision to the Directive. We will continue to monitor the progress of the proposed revision and play a full part in the remaining stages of the negotiating process.</p>

  <p>As negotiations on the proposal to amend the Large Combustion Plants Directive have only reached the Common Position stage, it is not possible to gauge accurately the costs to the Scottish economy of the proposal until the final text is agreed and adopted by the Council and the European Parliament. This is expected to occur in the second half of 2001. However the Common Position included the option of a national plan approach for &quot;existing plant&quot; (i.e. plant licensed prior to July 1987) rather than the mandatory application of emission limit values to each individual plant. The national plan approach could provide the option of more flexibility in implementing the Directive through controlling emissions where it is most cost-effective to do so.</p>

  <p>The Post Office and postal services are reserved matters. Ring-fenced funding has been set aside by the UK Government in the Spending Review for new investment over the next three years to start the implementation of the Performance and Innovation Unit report on the Post Office network. Included is provision for modernisation of the urban network.</p>

  <p>The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry has stated that the UK Government will require the Post Office to maintain the rural network.</p>

  <p>Policy on the Universal Bank is reserved to the UK Government which supports universal banking services accessible at post offices as the best way forward for bringing those people who do not currently have bank accounts into the financial mainstream. The Post Office and the high street banks are working together to develop the concept of universal banking services and the Government is closely monitoring developments. The Government has made a firm commitment to contribute towards the costs of universal banking.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive will continue to work with the Scottish financial institutions and others, such as the credit union movement, to improve the choice and accessibility of appropriate financial products available to those on low incomes. The Scottish Executive will also look at delivery of online public services through post offices in due course alongside other options. The proposal to establish a fund to support post offices and their retail facilities in deprived urban areas is for England only. Under the Scottish Executive&#8217;s Digital Government agenda, a target has been set to have 100% of public services available online by 2005. The Executive will wish to consider options for delivering these services with various partners e.g. post offices, banks and supermarkets.</p>

  <p>Information on the volume of motor vehicle traffic in Scotland is contained in <i>Scottish Transport Statistics no. 19 - 2000 Edition</i> , copies of which are available from SPICe. Table H1 in that publication gives estimates of the volume of motor vehicle traffic on major roads for each year from 1975 to 1999. Estimates of traffic on all roads, including minor roads, are available only from 1998 and are given in Table 6.1 of the same publication.</p>

  <p>Because of changes in methodology and small sample sizes, the estimates indicate only the broad level of traffic and may not provide reliable information about year to year changes. Chapter 6 of the publication describes the methods used to compile the estimates and identifies key discontinuities in the series.</p>

  <p>The 50% limit relates to public sector investments in the processing and marketing of agricultural products under Article 28 of Council Regulation (EC) 1257/99. This governs the public sector investment &#8211; &quot;The total amount of support &hellip; is limited to a maximum of (a) 50% in Objective 1 regions; (b) 40% in other regions&quot;. The Council Regulation came into force in 1999 and has the force of law in the UK.</p>

  <p>These limits are also reflected in the <i>Community Guidelines on State Aids in the Agriculture Sector</i>.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is in contact with the European Commission on an ongoing basis about the EC Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive. For example, Executive officials participate in the committee of representatives from member states which is chaired by the Commission under Article 18 of the Directive and which considers issues arising from the implementation of the Directive.</p>

  <p>Sewerage charges were not separately levied by the former regional councils, but were included in the council tax. There is therefore no meaningful comparison with 1996-97. Domestic Sewerage Relief Grant offset most of the domestic sewerage charge in 1996-97, and a decreasing proportion thereafter until 1998-99. The figures shown in the table below show the change in the gross amount levied by the water authority, before the deduction of the grant.</p>
