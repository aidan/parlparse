  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Prison Service (SPS) aims progressively to improve visit facilities at all our establishments as opportunities and resources permit. The SPS works closely with the Scottish Forum on Prisons and Families, sponsored by the SPS and Save the Children Fund.</p>

  <p>The forum&#8217;s report <i>Facilities for Children Visiting Prisons: A Good Practice Guide</i> supports SPS, agencies and individuals in improving conditions.</p>

  <p>SPS have seconded a member of staff to the forum and one of his tasks is to help SPS ensure that prisons continue to provide the best facilities we can for children visiting prisoners.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is not at present providing funding to the Royal Scottish Agricultural Benevolent Institution for the recycling of farm plastics. However, there are possible sources of funding from the Executive and the institution has been made aware of those.</p>

  <p>In line with the <i>National Waste Strategy: Scotland</i> , adopted in 1999, it is the Executive's policy to promote reduction, re-use and recovery (including recycling) of waste where possible. The Executive supports two initiatives to create and develop markets for recycled materials &#8211; the UK-wide Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) and Recycling Market Development (ReMaDe) Scotland. An aim of WRAP's initial work programme is to stimulate greater use of recycled plastic by raising awareness of the range and quality of products already available. A programme to review plastic standards will also be undertaken with the aim of removing discriminatory standards for recycled plastic products. ReMaDe Scotland has also identified plastic as a priority material for its work to determine opportunities for local market development.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it plans to make any legislative or administrative changes in order to improve the implementation of EC Directive 92/43/EEC, the Habitats Directive, in cases where European protected species are present on development sites.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2001-07-20.10.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80135" speakername="Rhona Brankin" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-01/wa0720.htm#6">

  <p>We recognise that current arrangements are complex and are keen to ensure the appropriate level of safeguard for European protected species which might be present on a development site. We have therefore decided to make adjustments to the land-use planning regime in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Our proposals, which will be the subject of public consultation later this year, envisage the integration of the species protection and derogation provisions of the Directive within the land-use planning process. This will ensure that all relevant issues are properly considered within the planning process, rather than under separate regimes operated by separate authorities, as occurs as present.</p>

  <p>In the interim, pending introduction of the new arrangements, the Executive will continue to operate the licensing system for developments affecting European protected species. A circular will be issued shortly to all local authorities setting out the interim position. Copies of this circular will be placed in the Parliament's Reference Centre.<br /></p>
