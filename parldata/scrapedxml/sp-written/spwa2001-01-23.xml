  <p>It is not possible to define precisely the criteria used by specialists in deciding whether an individual patient should receive Transtuzmab (Herceptin). The ultimate judgement regarding the use of a particular treatment will be made by the specialist in discussion with the patient, or the patient&#8217;s carer, taking into account evidence from various sources such as the product literature provided by the manufacturer, information from clinical studies, publications such as professionals journals and advice from bodies like Area Drugs and Therapeutics Committees and the Health Technology Board for Scotland.</p>

  <p>The role of CCTV in providing evidence in support of criminal proceedings is not the sole nor indeed the main criterion by which the contribution which CCTV can make to increasing public safety can be measured. Evaluations of particular schemes generally show a reduction in crime in the areas covered following the introduction of CCTV. The demand for new CCTV schemes is also an indication of the contribution which local communities consider it makes to improving safety. The CCTV Challenge Competition for funding for 2001-02 is the sixth such annual competition and the number of applications made in support of new schemes remains in line with the average number received in previous years.</p>

  <p>The provision of a variety of support services to learning and teaching in our schools is quite properly a matter for local authorities as the managers of education. Consequently, we have no plans to make the appointment of a school librarian a statutory requirement for all secondary schools.

Following from the 2000 Spending Review, substantial additional resources have been provided for the next three years to enhance and improve care services for older people.

  <p>In April 2000, I announced publication of the consultation document <i>Delivering Lifeline Ferry Services</i> which sought views on options for putting our subsidised lifeline services out to tender in order that they can continue under European Community rules.</p>

  <p>We received a response of over 100 replies. I have considered all of the points made carefully, taking account of the relevant EC Regulations and Guidelines on State Aid. I am announcing today a package of provisional proposals which have been submitted to the European Commission and which I believe will provide a robust framework for the continued delivery of high quality lifeline ferry services to the Highlands and Islands. The key elements are briefly summarised as follows:</p>

  <p>- I regard all Caledonian MacBrayne ferry services which serve islands as being consistent with public service obligations (PSOs) and plan to tender these services in line with the requirements for these as set out in the European Community cabotage regulations and guidelines;</p>

  <p>- I have made robust representations to the Commission in relation to Caledonian MacBrayne&#8217;s mainland-to-mainland routes, Gourock-Dunoon and Tarbert-Portavadie. I am pleased that the Commission has indicated it might be prepared to consider such services where land-based transport would not provide a viable alternative. I regard Caledonian MacBrayne&#8217;s present mainland-to-mainland routes as being consistent with this criterion. I therefore propose PSOs in respect of these routes also. In the case of Gourock-Dunoon, the PSO would be in respect of a passenger-only service because of its integration with other modes of transport (as indeed is the approved service at present);</p>

  <p>- On the packages of routes to be tendered, the Executive&#8217;s strong preference, based on the results of consultation, is to tender the network as a whole. Overwhelming support was expressed for this option in response to consultation and we believe this would maximise service reliability for the communities served, simplify the process for management of vessels and provide economies of scale in company management, safety and quality systems. It also avoids cherry picking of routes and facilitates integrated transport through co-ordinated timetabling of services;</p>

  <p>- On arrangements for future ownership of vessels, I propose to establish a publicly-owned vessel owning company in line with proposals set out in <i>Delivering Lifeline</i> <i>Ferry Services</i>. I believe this strikes the right balance between the need to ensure the efficient utilisation of the unique existing fleet and service reliability through this period of great change. Vessels would be leased to operators on a commercial basis and without subsidy in line with European Community rules that prohibit grants in respect of vessel replacement;</p>

  <p>- I propose operators would be bound to the vessel owning company&#8217;s existing vessels. However, I propose to allow scope for operators to bring their own vessel solutions where we have identified a need for new vessels to replace older ships or expand the range of services during a five-year contract period. This will be decided on a case-by-case basis at the outset of each PSO contract period. In line with the Commission&#8217;s guidance, the vessel owning company&#8217;s functions would focus on bare boat leasing to operators as well as ownership and maintenance of CalMac&#8217;s piers and harbours. I am considering the possibility of the vessel owning company offering, on an optional basis, a management of maintenance package which might be attractive to some operators. We also propose the vessel owning company should act as an operator of last resort which would provide an important safeguard through this period of change;</p>

  <p>- <i>Delivering Lifeline Ferry Services</i> made clear that the Executive would allow Caledonian MacBrayne to bid to operate the routes on a basis which ensured that the bid was prepared on a fair and full cost basis and evaluated transparently and equally with bids from other potential operators. We will honour this commitment. It will be for the company to decide how best to proceed and I will ask it to draw up proposals setting out details of its plans and to put these to me;</p>

  <p>- the consultation paper invited views on the possible need for a new legislative framework. There was little comment on this aspect and I intend to consider this in the longer term drawing on the lessons learned through the first contract period and taking account of the possible future role of a Highlands and Islands Integrated Transport Authority;</p>

  <p>- I wish to promote good consultative arrangements within the new framework. The Highlands and Islands Integrated Transport Forum was invited in autumn 1998 to review the way in which passenger ferry companies consult the public and local communities over services and timetables. I propose to invite the forum to expand their review to look at the arrangements needed under the new framework;</p>

  <p>- I gave a commitment when I announced <i>Delivering Lifeline Ferry Services</i> that levels of service and fares would be protected. We will be developing a detailed specification of services and will be consulting on this in due course;</p>

  <p>- Caledonian MacBrayne currently operates several services which are outwith the Undertaking of approved services. I plan to take the opportunity presented by the tendering exercise to consider whether any of these Out of Undertaking Services should be brought within the Undertaking and hence safeguarded and made eligible for subsidy. I will also be considering whether any new routes ought to be added. We will require to take into account the affordability of proposals and we will consult on the service specification in due course when we have taken decisions on these matters;</p>

  <p>We are required under the European Community&#8217;s rules to consult the Commission on the proposals and therefore they are provisional at this stage and subject to the Commission&#8217;s approval and further investigation. The Executive is committed to maintaining these vital lifeline links to Scotland&#8217;s islands and rural communities. If approved by the Commission, these measures would ensure that we will be able to continue to subsidise them in the future and safeguard the services on which these communities depend.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what discussions it has on a regular basis with the Chest, Heart and Stroke Association Scotland Ltd., what money will be made available to the NHSiS and voluntary organisations to ensure the fullest support for those with heart and stroke related conditions and how any such funding will be allocated to health board areas.</p>

  <p>The Executive welcomes requests for meetings from voluntary organisations such as Chest, Heart and Stroke Scotland. The most recent such meeting took place shortly before CHSS launched its stroke strategy on 6 December.</p>

  <p>The section 16B scheme of grants exists to assist voluntary organisations whose work complements that of the statutory providers of health care. Under that scheme, the Scottish Executive Health Department funds bodies which operate at national level. In allocating funds through the scheme, the department takes account of the priority areas of the NHS in Scotland, such as coronary heart disease and stroke. Health boards have discretion to provide money through the scheme to assist voluntary bodies which operate in their area.</p>

  <p>Voluntary organisations can also apply for assistance with the provision of social care through the scheme of grants operated under section 10 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968.</p>

  <p>The funding proposals set out in <i>Fair Shares for All</i> mean that there is a formula for distributing funds to health boards which fully recognises factors such as morbidity, including coronary heart disease and stroke.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-7184 by Ms Wendy Alexander on 7 June 2000, whether the seminar with all relevant parties in relation to the employment and training opportunities arising from New Housing Partnerships has been held; what outcomes have resulted from the seminar, and what further consultation, guidance or action it has issued, given or taken as a result of the seminar.</p>

  <p>The seminar was held in August 2000. Following the seminar, a working group has been established including representatives from the Scottish Executive, Scottish Homes, Scottish Enterprise, the Employment Service, COSLA, the Construction Industry Training Board, the Scottish House Builders Association and Professor Alan MacGregor of Glasgow University. The group&#8217;s remit is &quot;to identify the mechanisms required to maximise both employment opportunities and inclusion benefits arising from housing investment&quot;.

  <p>Information on bed closures in private nursing homes and residential care homes is not available centrally.</p>

  <p>However, a census of bed complements is carried out as part of an annual return for each private nursing home and registered residential care home. The table shows the number of homes and bed complement.</p>

  <p>The figures for nursing homes are based on information supplied to NHSScotland Information and Statistics Division at the end of each financial year. It is understood from health boards that a small number of other nursing homes registered in Scotland have been unable to provide the information requested. Data for these nursing homes are not included in the table and account for approximately 15 homes at 31 March 1998, 30 homes at 31 March 1999 and 30 homes at 31 March 2000. The bed complements of these homes are not known and may explain the decrease in bed numbers over the three-year period.</p>

  <p>Councils are allocated Grant Aided Expenditure for Roads and Road Lighting which includes road maintenance. It is entirely a matter for each council to determine its current expenditure priorities and from GAE to allocate resources for roads maintenance. Similarly, Scottish Ministers provide local authorities with a single block allocation for capital expenditure on a number of services including roads and transport, but that is the extent of our control. Councils can supplement their allocations from resources raised locally, mainly capital receipts.</p>

  <p>Exceptionally, to alleviate significant public safety concerns about the condition of the roads on Arran, North Ayrshire Council was awarded in August a supplementary capital allocation of &#163;400,000.</p>

  <p>Tenders for the competition for the four units were received by the Scottish Executive on 30 October and have subsequently been assessed. I can today announce the intention to award four new contracts worth &#163;350 million over five years from 1 April 2001. Subject to completion of an urgent independent review of one aspect of the assessment process which has featured prominently in recent proceedings in the Court of Session, i.e. the use of tender assessment quantities, the contracts will be awarded to BEAR Scotland Limited for the North East and North West Units and to AMEY Highways Ltd for the South East and South West Units. The companies involved already have a substantial record of successful provision of trunk road maintenance in England and Scotland.</p>

  <p>The review will be undertaken by Halcrow, in association with PricewaterhouseCoopers. I expect it to take no more than seven days, and I am confident that that it will confirm that the processes followed in assessing quantities were both fair and reasonable. The contracts will be awarded when the review is complete, but the new companies will only take over responsibility on the roads on 1 April. The intervening period will be spent in the essential work of developing plans and systems and procuring the necessary plant, depots and staff required to carry out the work.</p>

  <p>Under the terms of the competition, the new companies are responsible for any obligations for staff which arise under TUPE. We expect TUPE to apply.</p>

  <p>It is customary to publish in the Official Journal of the European Community details of the outcome of public sector competitions. In the case of these competitions each bidder was required to demonstrate that their proposals for the contract would meet a quality benchmark. Each bidder satisfied that requirement and therefore an assessment of the rates and prices quoted was made against a predetermined volume of work and subjected to a number of sensitivity tests to provide an overall comparative cost for each tender. The names of each bidder for each competition are set out below, in alphabetical order, and the overall comparative costs of the tenders received for the five-year core duration of each contract are set out in numerically increasing order. The actual value of the contracts over this period will depend on the volume of work ordered within each unit.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive have not yet fixed a date for the laying of these Orders before the Parliament. It would be premature to indicate a timetable for implementation at this stage. The Orders will be re-laid for debate by the Justice and Home Affairs Committee once the review of the Rules is completed. There is likely to be a three month lead-in time for the Orders taking effect. Related work to review the Table of Fees for solicitors in summary cause actions is being taken forward by the Lord President&#8217;s Advisory Committee having regard to proposed changes in the Rules.</p>

  <p>A report on <i>Health Effects of Waste Combustion Products</i> , published in 1997 by the Medical Research Council&#8217;s Institute for Environment and Health, concluded that &quot;Epidemiological studies of people who work at or live near incinerators have shown no consistent excess incidence of any specific disease.&quot;.</p>

  <p>Similarly, a report on <i>Waste Incineration and Public Health</i>, published in 1999 by the US National Research Council, concluded that &quot;Few epidemiological studies have attempted to assess whether adverse health effects have actually occurred near individual incinerators, and most of them have been unable to detect any effects. The studies of which the committee is aware that did report finding health effects had shortcomings and failed to provide convincing evidence.&quot;.</p>

  <p>Both reports point out, however, that effects on health cannot be excluded, because (for example) the studies examined small populations, could not adequately make allowance for other factors which might influence disease rates, could not measure exposures accurately and could not allow for the possibility of a long latency between exposure and development of disease.</p>

  <p>A study undertaken by the government-funded Small Area Health Statistics Unit found a small excess of primary liver cancer near the older generation of municipal solid waste incinerators (MSWIs). The Government&#8217;s expert advisory Committee on the Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment has considered these studies and concluded that any potential risk of cancer due to residency near to MSWIs was exceedingly low and probably not measurable by the most modern epidemiological techniques. The committee agreed that, at the present time, there was no need for any further epidemiological investigations of cancer incidence near municipal solid waste incinerators. The committee&#8217;s statement can be found on the Internet at www.doh.gov.uk/munipwst.htm.</p>

  <p>The Department of Health in England has recently published guidance, reflecting the advice of the Committee on Medical Effects of Air Pollutants, on <i>Investigating the</i> <i>health impact of emissions to air from local industry,</i> which can be found at http://www.doh.gov.uk/comeap/goodpracticeguide.pdf and statements on the applicability of time-series co-efficients to areas affected by emissions of air pollutants from industrial sources, at http://www.doh.gov.uk/comeap/areaemissions.htm.</p>

  <p>The UK Health Departments will continue to take account of any new evidence in this area, in the light of expert advice.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive intends to take advantage of the provision in the Landfill Directive which allows the UK, as a member state that landfilled more than 80% of their municipal waste in 1995, to postpone the attainment of the landfill reduction target dates by up to four years.

  <p>I expect the Scottish Environment Protection Agency to have prepared all 11 Area Waste Plans for public consultation by October this year, although some may be published before then. The Executive has already announced that &#163;3 million is to be available from the Strategic Waste Fund this year to local authorities to improve recycling and composting. As no Area Waste Plans have been completed, no local authority is currently in a position to apply for grant from the &#163;50.4 million provision which the Executive has allocated over the next three years for implementing the Area Waste Plans.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s press release SE3051/2000 issued on 27 November set out the actions being taken in response to the results of a survey confirming that lead solder had been used in the domestic plumbing systems in new houses in Scotland. These actions should together help to protect the public from the potential ill effects of excess lead in their domestic plumbing and to eliminate the use of lead solder. We are continuing to explore with the Health and Safety Executive and European Commission whether it would be feasible to extend the ban on lead solder. In the meantime, in December the Scottish and Northern Ireland Plumbing Employer&#8217;s Federation again recommended to its members a voluntary ban on the use of leaded solder.</p>
