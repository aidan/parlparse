  <p>Internet regulation is a reserved issue. Matters relating to the protection of children using the internet is the responsibility of the Home Office which has established a task force involving representatives from across the UK internet industry. As a result of the group&#146;s recommendations to raise public awareness of the activities of paedophiles in internet chatrooms and steps to avoid them the Executive is contributing to the current UK-wide &quot;know the net&quot; campaign to alert children to the risks of the internet and how to minimise them. The Executive is also participating in a UK-wide exercise to accredit educational Internet service providers who wish to serve the education market (including libraries, community learning facilities, UK Online centres etc). The main focus of the approval process is on safety features such as content filtering.</p>

  <p>There are 95 secure places in Scotland and we have over twice the proportion of children in secure accommodation as in England and three times as many as in Wales. The Secure Accommodation Advisory Group&#146;s interim report concluded that the available data did not substantiate the need for expansion. We are considering this further and I will announce our conclusions shortly. Only under extreme circumstances are young people held in adult units, for the absolute minimum time necessary for secure accommodation to be found. The number of such cases is declining (13 in 1999: 5 in 2000).</p>

  <p>The objective of the police is to investigate such incidents properly and fully. The objective of procurators fiscal is to scrutinise reports for a sufficiency of evidence and then to select from the range of available options the one which is most appropriate in the particular case. One important consideration is the probability that any given option will reduce the likelihood of further offending. Allegations of domestic abuse are treated very seriously by prosecutors who were issued in July 2000 with fresh training and guidance on this area of offending. However, it would be inappropriate to have an objective to increase the number of prosecutions. Each individual case must be considered on its own merits.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to ensuring that women who have experienced domestic abuse get the support and protection they need. This includes providing a sufficient number of refuge places but also providing support to those who do not wish to leave. There are many reasons why women might be reluctant to leave an abusive partner and may suffer a number of incidents of abuse before doing so. Her decision must be respected. The important thing is that she should get the help and information she wants at any stage.</p>

  <p>The information on repeat victimisation in the police statistics is very helpful in building up a picture of the nature of abuse. It is for police forces to decide how they will respond to specific instances of repeat victimisation.</p>

A new research agenda is being worked out for publication early in 2002. Even when the research agenda is published it will not be possible to say how much monies will be devoted to a specific issue such as domestic violence. Research is not commissioned to a fixed timetable but, rather, according to identified and emerging priorities and the cost of that research is determined by the nature of the study and how long it takes to complete.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the intentions set out in paragraph 2.6 of its <i>Draft Guidance on the Circumstances in Which Parents May Choose to Educate Their Children at Home</i> exceed the powers contained under section 37 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 and, if so, whether there is any risk of local authorities engaging in unlawful activity as a result and in breaching data protection and human rights legislation, and to what legal scrutiny the draft guidance was subject to before publication.</p>

  <p>Section 37 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980, provides that authorities have a duty to intervene if they are not satisfied that a parent is providing an efficient education that is suited to his or her child. The Scottish Executive believes that authorities cannot fulfil this responsibility without taking reasonable steps to satisfy themselves as to the effectiveness of the education provision being made for a child. Paragraph 2.6 of the draft guidance on the circumstances in which parents may choose to educate their children at home reflects that position. In fulfilling their duties, authorities must act within the terms of data protection and human rights legislation. The draft guidance, which has been issued for consultation until 29 March 2002, was subject to the normal legal scrutiny.</p>

A range of documents provided by Education Otherwise was considered in preparing the draft guidance, including a summary of <i>Educating Children at Home</i> by Alan Thomas and <i>The Next Learning</i> <i>System</i> by Roland Meighan.</p>

  <p>In response to a Scottish Executive survey of children educated outwith school, education authorities reported that a total of 349 children were known to be receiving home education as a result of parental choice in 2000-01. The survey requested information about all children who had received education outwith school at any point during the 2000-01 school year, whether out of necessity or by parental choice. The above figure relates only to those children educated outwith school by parental choice. It does not include those who received education outwith school because they were unable to attend due to illness or exceptional circumstances. The Scottish Executive recognises that the true figure is likely to be much higher since many children who are educated at home by choice are not currently in contact with their education authority.</p>

  <p>NHS 24 recognises that there is a real need to provide support for people with a mental health illness and have taken this into account in developing the clinical decision software that will be used by its nurses. Clinical algorithms have been developed for crisis, suicide, depression, confusion and many other conditions. These have also been reviewed under NHS 24&#146;s quality review process by a range of clinicians which have included doctors and mental health specialist nurses.</p>

  <p>NHS 24 recognises the importance of ensuring that their nurses have the skill set and competency base to support patients with mental health problems. Within the core induction and training for NHS 24 nurses, they have invested a significant resource towards mental health training. This comprehensive training programme has been specifically developed for NHS 24 by the Scottish Development Centre for Mental Health in conjunction with Abertay University.</p>

  <p>The Performance Audit Group (PAG) is appointed by the Scottish Executive to audit and monitor the activities of BEAR Scotland Ltd, including their winter activities, and I have undertaken to publish a report by PAG on the first year of operation of the new contracts in line with the recommendation of the Auditor General. A copy of the report, once available, will be placed in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>It would not be appropriate to publish copies of correspondence between the Executive and BEAR Scotland Ltd because of contractual and commercial considerations. However, I have undertaken to publish a report by PAG on the first year of operation of the new contracts in line with the recommendation of the Auditor General. A copy of the report, once available, will be placed in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>No representations were received by the Scottish Executive concerning the condition of the footways in Newtonmore during the week commencing 30 December 2001.</p>

  <p>All rock salt used on trunk roads and associated footways complies with British Standard BS 3247 and this material is not considered to be a factor in the condition of the pavements in Newtonmore.</p>

  <p>BEAR Scotland Ltd has quality systems and operational procedures in place which require safety issues to be addressed, relating both to the public and its employees, whilst ensuring that its other obligations under the terms of the trunk road contract are met. These systems and procedures have been scrutinised by Performance Audit Group and consented to by the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>The offices of the Performance Audit Group (PAG) were closed between 24 December and 2 January. However, in view of the weather conditions prevailing, staff from the PAG travelled routes in the north west and north east Operating Units to report on conditions on 27, 28, 29 and 31 December. Staff also visited BEAR&#146;s winter control room in the North East on 29 December.</p>
