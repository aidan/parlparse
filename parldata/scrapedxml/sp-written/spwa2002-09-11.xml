The Executive supports the UK Government&#8217;s commitment to the NSC and is keen for the project to be delivered as soon as it is feasible. The public private partnership for National Air Traffic Services was completed on 26 July 2001.</p>

  <p>The Action Plan for the Social Services Workforce, launched in April 2002, is underpinned by five strategic aims, one of which is &quot;to raise investment and learning and support for all front-line staff in local authorities and the independent sector&quot;.</p>

  <p>To this end a sum of &#163;3.5 million additional funding to local authorities was announced to support investment in training and opportunities for career development. We are writing to local authorities to ask them how they will be using this money and we will also be looking at what opportunities for training they intend to make available to all staff in the independent sector.</p>

  <p>We are also working closely with the Association of Directors of Social Work which is developing proposals to improve the support for all front-line staff.</p>

  <p>To help meet this aim registration of the workforce will be phased in over a number of years. The qualifications criteria for registration in phase one, that includes heads of residential care homes and heads of adult day care services, is out to consultation at the moment. Views are sought on a number of questions around the qualifications criteria and everyone has the opportunity to shape the final decision.</p>

  <p>Phase 2 will incorporate all other staff in residential care settings and a major task now for the Scottish Social Services Council is to set a timescale for its implementation.</p>

  <p>As part of regulating the workforce there are to be codes of practice and conduct for employees and their employers. These will set out the standards expected of each. For example these will cover expectations of employers in relation to supporting their staff.</p>

  <p>&#163;3.5 million additional funding has been provided to local authorities to support investment in training and opportunities for career development. We will be asking local authorities to inform us of the training opportunities they make available to the independent sector staff.</p>

  <p>The costs of providing care for older people in local authority run care homes is a matter for individual councils. In their report in November 2001 the National Review Group on Care Home Costs stated that independent care homes were being publicly underfunded.

  <p>This was principally a clinical guideline. However, as well as its distribution to all primary care trusts, acute trusts and NHS boards in Scotland, copies were sent to all members of the Scottish Parliament Health and Community Care Committee and other MSPs and individuals who had registered an interest in receiving the guideline upon its publication, relevant voluntary organisations and all related member organisations of the SIGN Council, which includes the British Association of Social Workers. There was also a media campaign aimed at raising public and clinical awareness resulting in widespread TV, radio, newspaper and medical press coverage. The guideline is of course available for all interested persons to see at the SIGN website:</p>

  <p>No such measures exist. Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network guidelines are best practice guidelines primarily intended for use by clinicians, and are not intended to be construed or to serve as mandatory standards of medical care, as is made clear in section 1.4 of guideline 52. Their implementation is a matter for NHS boards in consultation with other appropriate authorities.</p>

  <p>The policy analyst recruitment process is still on-going and selection decisions are not expected for some weeks. At this level of recruitment, successful candidates are likely to be subject to three months notice to their current employers. It is likely therefore that the majority of successful candidates will join the Executive from the beginning of 2003.</p>

  <p>Successful candidates will fill posts at policy analyst level that are vacant at the time of their appointments. In the meantime the vacancy position remains fluid as posts are filled or vacated by the internal movement of existing policy analyst staff.</p>

  <p>Realising the benefits of stroke unit care will be a central element of the CHD/Stroke strategy which the Executive will publish in the autumn. The evidence for their effectiveness is also integral to the standards for stroke care currently being developed by the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland. Both the strategy and the standards will promote implementation of the recommendation in <em>Adding Life to Years</em> , the report of the Chief Medical Officer&#8217;s Expert Group on the Health care of Older People which we published in January of this year, that stroke patients admitted to hospital should be managed in a stroke unit.</p>

  <p>There is good evidence that care in specialised stroke units reduces the number of deaths, leads to fewer admissions to long-term care and increases the number of patients able to return home to independent living.</p>

  <p>Work on the formulation of a successor to the individual learning account scheme continues to make progress. Officials are currently consulting key stakeholders about my plans in principle and will in due course confer with them further about the operational details. I intend to launch the successor scheme when I am satisfied that it will incorporate the required improvements on the first programme. I expect to make an announcement before the end of the year.</p>

  <p>The Chief Scientist Office (CSO) is primarily a response mode funder of research and this role is well known and advertised throughout the health care and academic community. Mental health is a research priority and given the number of high quality applications received in recent years, direct commissioning has not been considered necessary. The CSO is currently directly funding 40 research projects on mental health at a cost of &#163;4.1 million. As well as trials of treatment for mental illness, the projects include epidemiological and methodological work which is an essential basis for developing and evaluating treatments and services. Additionally, through the Research and Development Support Fund, the NHS in Scotland spent &#163;2.8 million on 385 research projects related to mental health issues in 2001-02. These projects are recorded on a UK-wide research database called the National Research Register (NRR) which is available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 17404).</p>

  <p>Scotland has an excess of generating capacity, much of it flexible and responsive to changes in demand. The temporary shutdown of two reactors at Torness Power Station should have no impact on businesses and domestic consumers.</p>

  <p>Provision of a police station at Peebles is a matter for Lothian and Borders Police. I am not aware of any proposals for upgrading or refurbishing the police station at Peebles nor of any plans for building a combined police station and courthouse at Peebles.

  <p>Post Offices and postal services are reserved matters. The UK Government has already put in place a number of measures to maintain the network of rural post offices. These include the formal requirement placed on the Post Office in November 2000 to prevent any avoidable closures. For its part, the Scottish Executive is demonstrating its commitment to rural post offices through the provision of rates relief for qualifying rural outlets.</p>

  <p>Additionally, as part of the Scottish Executive&#8217;s commitment to providing services in deprived urban areas, we are currently considering support for post offices in these locations and I hope to be able to advise you further in due course.</p>

  <p>The prevalence of mental health problems within the prison population is not known with any precision. Studies have ranged from 3% to 82% of the prison population.</p>

  <p>The last major studies undertaken within Scottish prisons were, by Dr David Cooke, <em>Psychological Disturbance amongst Prisoners</em> and, by Dr James McManus, <em>Mentally Disturbed Prisoners</em>.

  <p>There are no specific regulations addressing the appointment of consultants in respect of PFI/PPP projects and housing stock transfers. Directive 92/50/EEC (given effect in the UK by the Public Services Contracts Regulations 1993, SI 1993 No. 3228) establishes certain procedural rules which must be followed when awarding public service contracts. Also, the Local Government Act 1998 places certain requirements on local authorities in respect of the award of contracts.</p>

  <p>The Executive does not maintain central records of such contracts. Local authority contracts are a matter for the authority concerned. Records held by Audit Scotland are a matter for it, rather than the Executive.</p>

  <p>Significant amounts of Scottish Higher Education Funding Council (SHEFC) block grant funding to universities are being used to support teaching and research staff who are working in the field of nanotechnology. Most of Scotland's universities already have departments which are engaged in nanotechnology research - typically these include engineering and life sciences departments. In addition, since 1997, SHEFC has awarded nine Research Development Grants into nanotechnology related areas, totaling over &#163;8 million. SHEFC has also funded three Joint Research Equipment Grants in nanotechnology related areas. In many cases this funding has underpinned additional support from the UK Research Councils, European Framework programmes and directly from industry.</p>

  <p>Our universities are also able to access existing support vehicles - such as the Proof of Concept Fund - to assist in the commercialisation of research in this area.</p>
