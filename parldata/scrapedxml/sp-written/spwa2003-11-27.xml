  <p>The draft Agricultural Holdings (Consequential Amendments) (Scotland) Order was laid before Parliament on 2 October 2003. Following consideration in accordance with the standard procedure for draft instruments subject to affirmative resolution, Parliament approved the draft order on 20 November 2003.</p>

  <p>I have now also signed the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act 2003 (Commencement No. 3, Transitional and Savings Provisions) Order 2003 (SSI 2003-548). As a result, most of the act (including Part 1, which introduces the new limited duration tenancies and short limited duration tenancies) will come into force on 27 November 2003.</p>

  <p>The Executive is taking action to raise awareness on a number of fronts. Our Healthy Living campaign will be targeting young people between the ages of 16 and 25 with messages which highlight the dangers of drinking too much alcohol. The first phase of the radio and poster campaign, which uses the &quot;You choose what you lose&quot; strapline, is running in November and December. This will complement NHS Health Scotland's &quot;Think About It&quot; alcohol campaign which is targeted at younger teenagers and is running TV advertising from November to early January.</p>

  <p>Through health education in schools, young people have opportunities to discuss and consider the effects and possible consequences of alcohol consumption with a view to helping them to make healthy choices.</p>

  <p>A parents' guide to alcohol is also being developed by NHS Health Scotland in partnership with the Executive to support parents discuss alcohol with their children.</p>

  <p>There has been a move away from residential detoxification for people with an alcohol dependency to community-based treatment and rehabilitation in the last few years, and information on the number of residential places is not consistently collected by NHS boards, local authorities or alcohol action teams. The team at the National Alcohol Information Resource will be examining the feasibility of improving information collection in this area.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, the Acting Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>In the public sector we are on course to ensure that all local authority tenants who are without central heating systems, and want a central heating system installed, will have the measures by April 2004. Similarly all Responsible Social Landlords' tenants will have the measures installed by the end of 2004. Because of the large number of properties, Glasgow will take a little longer and the programme there will not be complete until 2007.</p>

  <p>In the private sector, everyone who is eligible and wants to take up the programme will receive a central heating system by April 2006.</p>

  <p>The warm deal programme managed by Eaga will continue to deliver insulation measures across all sectors of the housing stock. Local authorities will continue to have their own insulation programme. However, no date has been given for the completion of the warm deal programme.</p>

  <p>An estimate of the nature requested has not been made by the Executive.</p>

  <p>There are many uncertainties associated with emissions from organic soils and the Executive is undertaking research to better understand the role of agricultural and other land uses on greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide, from Scotland's organic-rich soils. The Executive has commissioned research to consider development of a modelling framework to simulate carbon and nitrogen cycling in organic soils and to provide predictions of how they will respond to land use change and climate change. The findings of this study will contribute to understanding of greenhouse gas emissions from soils due to land use change.</p>

  <p>On fisheries, two items were on the agenda. There was a brief presentation by the Commission of proposals to manage fishing in the mediterranean and agreement of a proposal for a regulation on the management of fishing effort in western waters.</p>

  <p>The new western waters proposal was first discussed at the May Council, but its adoption has been delayed while the presidency sought a compromise acceptable to as many member states as possible.</p>

  <p>The new regulation (Com (2002) 739 final) replaces an earlier western waters regulation (EEC) No. 2847/93. That regulation was designed to prevent an increase in the overall fishing effort for the area following the 1985 Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal. It also established a restricted area known as the Irish box in which the access of the new member states was limited to a specified number of vessels.</p>

  <p>The new effort regime for western waters will take effect no later than 1 August 2004. It also makes provision for an effort-based regime, with member states' effort allocations to be based on fishing activity in the reference period 1998-2002; and it introduces a smaller biologically based sensitive area to replace the current Irish box.</p>

  <p>Most of the Scottish negotiating objectives were achieved:</p>

  <p>pelagic and deep water fisheries are excluded from the regime;</p>

  <p>access to western waters will not be based on having a track record in the area &#8211; all Scottish boats will have access to the zone;</p>

  <p>except for the biologically sensitive area, the bureaucratic burdens of small management areas and associated hailing in and out have been avoided;</p>

  <p>there is a facility for increasing our effort allocation, if we need more to catch our quota or our non-quota stocks, and</p>

  <p>there is a facility to revise our initial effort data&#8211;particularly relevant where logbook data may be incomplete (as with non-quota species such as scallops).</p>

  <p>The text therefore represented a very good outcome for Scotland with all our major areas of concern being addressed.</p>

  <p>On agriculture, there was a brief discussion of the Commission's outline ideas for reform of the cotton and olive oil regimes. Producer member states emphasised the importance of both crops to their farming sectors and the need to maintain a significant level of production-linked aid to ensure continued activity in the sectors. The United Kingdom joined other non-producers in arguing for changes in these regimes to follow closely the pattern of reforms agreed in June for others. In particular, a substantial level of decoupling should be the norm, with the option for more if member states wished to move in that direction.</p>

  <p>The arrangements for the annual consultation for those aged 75 or over are contained in the terms of service for general practitioners set out in the NHS (General Medical Services) (Scotland) Regulations 1995.</p>

  <p>The general practitioner is required to invite each patient who has attained the age of 75 to participate in a consultation for the purpose of assessing whether the patient requires personal medical services and to offer to make a house call. The invitation should be made in writing and if first made orally should be confirmed in writing. An entry should be made in the patient's medical records of the date of the invitation and whether or not it was accepted.</p>

  <p>During the consultation the general practitioner should consider any matter which may be affecting the patient's general health including sensory functions, mobility, mental condition, physical condition including continence, social environment and the use of medicines. Appropriate entries of the general practitioner's observations should be made in the patient's medical records.</p>

  <p>Following any consultation the general practitioner should offer to discuss with the patient the conclusions which have been drawn as to the patient's state of health unless to do so would, in the opinion of the general practitioner, be likely to cause serious harm to the physical or mental health of the patient.</p>

  <p><em>Influenza-like illness is increasing in Scotland at present, and there is certainly more around than we have experienced in the last few years. </em> Estimates from the Scottish <em>Influenza</em> Spotter Scheme co-ordinated by the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health now exceed the baseline threshold limit of 50 consultations per 100,000 population. At 11 November 2003 the estimate was 99 per 100,000 population across Scotland as a whole. The consultation rate for &quot;normal activity&quot; for seasonal influenza like illness is defined as between 50 and 600 consultations per 100,000 population. As such we are still within the lower part of this range currently.</p>

  <p>However, laboratory analysis is required to confirm a diagnosis of influenza. Laboratory data as at 17 November, by NHS board, are shown in the table below (These respiratory virus laboratory data broadly reflect the NHS board areas. They are summations of the laboratory detections from hospital and community samples. While the GP practices are immediately attributable to NHS boards, the hospital laboratories to which samples are submitted are not necessarily the place of residence of the individuals from whom the samples were obtained).</p>

  <p>It is not possible to indicate how many such cases are being treated in hospital as hospital data for this winter are not yet available centrally.</p>

  <p>The UK national influenza laboratory is the only UK laboratory that tests for influenza strain type. Only a select number of the clinical isolates are routinely sent to this laboratory for strain typing (for example, from patients who have died or from outbreaks in defined settings). The only Scottish cases to date in which influenza A Fujian-411-2002-like virus has been identified have been in the three reported deaths in children.</p>

  <p>I am delighted to state that, tomorrow morning, at the Scottish Poetry Library in Edinburgh, I shall launch the 3rd annual report of the National Cultural Strategy. This gives a full account of much progress and many important announcements and initiatives for Scotland's culture since last November's report. Key amongst these are: the announcement that Scotland is to have a National Theatre; the investment of &pound;17.5 million to ensure that by 2006, every primary school pupil will be able to take a year's free music tuition; a new &pound;30 million strategy will provide a network of high quality sports facilities across the country; publication of draft legislation to provide secure status for the Gaelic language; and the establishment of Gaelic development agency, B&ograve;rd na G&agrave;idhlig.</p>

  <p>I will also be launching the pilot of the Scotland's Culture portal. The National Cultural Strategy committed the Scottish Executive to establishing a national &quot;portal&quot; website with information and links relating to Scotland's culture. The pilot portal seeks to demonstrate potential uses, linking quality website information from key agencies and extending access to the public, educators, pupils and potential visitors. Initially focusing on the themes of Scottish music and literature, the pilot offers great potential for future development.</p>

  <p>We believe that offshore wind, which is eligible for support under the Renewables Obligation Scotland, can make a contribution towards Scotland's future energy needs.</p>

  <p>Earlier this year Scottish ministers gave consent to a 200 megawatt offshore development in the Solway Firth, which is expected to generate enough electricity to supply 180,000 homes.</p>

  <p>In partnership with the European Union and the Department of Trade and Industry, the Executive is also contributing to the development, by Talisman Energy (UK), of a demonstration project in the Moray Firth for the world's first deep water offshore wind farm. If successful, the potential markets for this technology world-wide could be very significant indeed.</p>

  <p>Although the aesthetic value of wind farms is subjective, visual impact is a material consideration when new developments are being considered. Research into wind farms by VisitScotland indicates that their impact on tourism is generally felt to be minimal; the majority of those who took part in the research were of the view that wind farms will have few negative impacts on tourism. There is also some evidence that certain wind farms may attract additional visitors who are interested in the development of a "green" Scotland, as has been the experience in other European countries.</p>

  <p>Measures are already in place. The Executive publication, <em>The Standard for Initial Teacher Education in Scotland </em> (the Standard) <em>, </em> details the broad range of skills and attributes that programmes of initial teacher education are designed to enable student teachers to acquire. These include the expectation that, by the end of the programme, students will demonstrate the ability to identify and respond appropriately to pupils with difficulties in, or barriers to, learning and recognise when to seek further advice in relation to their special educational needs, and this includes dyslexia. These abilities are then further developed, as required, during the induction period and thereafter through continuing professional development (CPD). The national register of providers of CPD, which can be viewed at http://www.gtcs.org.uk/gtcs/nat_reg_prog_search.aspx, indicates that a range of providers offer relevant programmes.</p>

  <p>We are currently undertaking the second stage of our review of initial teacher education. This will include consideration of whether the Standard, which was published in 2000, is still appropriate.</p>

  <p>Two of the principal conclusions of the report of the independent expert group on mobile phones, issued in May 2000, were that the balance of evidence to date suggests that (i) exposure to radiation from mobile phone technologies at levels below current guidelines do not cause adverse health effects to the general population, and (ii) there is no general risk to the health of people living near to base stations on the basis that the exposures are expected to be a small fraction of the guidelines. No compelling scientific evidence has since emerged to challenge the continuing validity of these conclusions.</p>

  <p>The provisions for limiting the exposure of members of the public to radiofrequency emissions from the equipment that forms the Global System for Mobile Telecommunications (GSM) apply equally to emissions from the TETRA system. This includes a requirement from the Home Office that all TETRA handsets comply with the same conditions for Specific Absorption Rate as apply to GSM handsets. There is therefore no need for any change to the current position.</p>

  <p>The Executive has received a number of enquiries about the possible adverse health effects of TETRA systems. All the provisions for control of public exposures to radiofrequency radiation from the Global System for Mobile Telecommunications apply equally to TETRA systems. These include the requirement for operators to ensure that exposures are kept within the guideline levels defined by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection</p>

  <p>Race relations legislation is a reserved matter. Any change would have to be made by Westminster legislation.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive acknowledges the cultural identity of Gypsies/Travellers in Scotland and acknowledges them as a distinct group. This is reflected in a number of the Scottish Executive's published documents including its Race Equality Scheme.</p>
