  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what methodology was used in the calculation of the average &pound;550 estimated savings that elderly people are expected to make under the Scottish Executive central heating scheme announced by the Minister for Communities on 19 September 2000.</p>

  <p>The figure quoted was based on an analysis of data from the 1996 Scottish House Condition Survey, using the National Energy Rating Scheme modelling programme, Autoevaluator, uprated to 1999 prices. The model used a standard heating regime for elderly households which assumes that their homes will be heated for 16 hours daily; the living room to a temperature of 21 degrees Celsius and the rest of the house to 18 degrees.</p>

  <p>The estimated savings arose from the installation of (a) central heating in all private sector elderly households without central heating where the heating fuel is either gas or electricity, and (b) home insulation.</p>

  <p>The initiative is intended to help those most vulnerable to cold and damp: an estimated 140,000 households who currently lack any form of central heating. Local authorities should continue to replace obsolescent systems as part of their ongoing housing capital improvement programmes. Housing Associations should also continue their replacement programmes. The Housing Bill will set out the Executive&#8217;s proposals to reform the improvement grant system to allow local authorities to give assistance at rates up to 100% for the installation or replacement of heating systems for low income households in the private sector.</p>

  <p>The National Library of Scotland Act 1925 provides for the Dean of the Faculty of Advocates to be an ex-officio member of the Board of Trustees, and for five other members to be appointed by the Faculty.

  <p>The GB road safety strategy, <i>Tomorrow&#8217;s</i> <i>Roads</i> &#8211; <i>Safer</i> <i>for</i> <i>Everyone</i> , published on 1 March, confirms that there is a need for targeted public information advertising to highlight the risks of driving under the influence of drugs. For publicity campaigns to be effective, they need to be targeted specifically at the groups most at risk and to be based on an understanding of the precise nature and extent of the problem. A generalised high profile television campaign would not necessarily reach the right people.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has commissioned research on the prevalence of recreational drug use and driving in Scotland. Other research is also being carried out by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. The results of all this research will inform the targeting and content of a publicity campaign.</p>

  <p>Following representations received about different dates set in different areas, officials wrote to authorities in February to ask how holidays were currently co-ordinated between authorities and what could be done to improve liaison in the future. In response, most authorities indicated that they held discussions with their neighbours with a view to securing a consistent approach although complete consistency could not always be achieved because of local circumstances and local holidays. I am considering the detailed responses further.</p>

  <p>GPs have for some time been encouraged to prescribe generically, unless there are good clinical reasons for proprietary products to be prescribed. Increasing use of local formularies and GP computing systems; the development of practice-based prescribing protocols, and enhanced pharmacist input into prescribing review and audit have resulted in excellent progress having been achieved in this area and the current rate of generic prescribing is now over 70%. The remaining identified potential savings from greater generic prescribing are comparatively low at approximately &pound;2 million (0.3% of the overall cost of prescribing in Scotland).</p>

  <p>These are being addressed by the actions contained in the <i>New</i> <i>Strategy</i> <i>for</i> <i>Scottish</i> <i>Tourism</i> . The industry will also benefit from changes to the structure and linkages of the Scottish Tourist Board, arising from the recent independent review of that body.</p>

  <p>A research project is currently underway to identify an appropriate methodology to forecast future traffic levels in Scotland and produce interim traffic and emission forecasts for local air pollutants and carbon dioxide where possible. The current stage of this work should be completed by the end of the year.</p>

  <p>Measures to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from transport will be an important element of the Scottish Climate Change Programme that the Minister for Environment, Sport and Culture will announce shortly.</p>

  <p>Water charges are currently linked to council tax bands; this provides significant protection for a large number of low-income households. Despite this, the Executive recognises that recent increases in charges may have presented some households with difficulties; accordingly we are looking at ways of improving on this existing protection.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer what the meaning is of &quot;identical characteristics&quot; in the part of the specification for the granite cladding of the MSP block of the new Parliament building which states &quot;Granite: Kemnay (Aberdeen) or Creetown (Galloway). Alternatives providing identical characteristics may be considered&quot;.</p>

  <p>The Convener of the Holyrood Progress Group has informed me that, <strong> </strong> in the context of the specification for granite cladding, &quot;identical characteristics&quot; means that the &quot;essential nature&quot; of any alternative stone offered must be &quot;the very same&quot;, in terms of properties and attributes, as the stone from the Scottish quarries. Under EC procurement rules it would not have been permissible to specify &quot;Scottish granite&quot; which would prevent other EC member states an opportunity to compete, when they may be able to supply suitable alternatives.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer, further to the statement by the Convener of the Holyrood Progress Group that materials &quot;must be demonstrably from sources that respect the human rights of those employed in their production, and do not employ child labour&quot; ( <i>The</i> <i>Herald</i> , 26 September 2000), how it is intended to establish whether materials meet these criteria.</p>

  <p>I understand from the Convener of the Holyrood Progress Group (HPG) that the inclusion of the stipulation, quoted from the tender documentation for the MSP block &quot;cladding&quot; package, goes beyond the statutory requirements for contract tendering, under existing EC regulations. The HPG is confident that, together with the assurances from the successful cladding contractor, the stipulation will ensure that the materials are obtained from a responsible and ethical source. Additional checks will be subsequently carried out, the arrangements for which will be determined by the HPG on the basis of the best available professional advice.</p>

  <p>For the purpose of clarification, I can confirm that Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body staff are able to purchase Scottish Parliament Christmas cards. Where these are for personal use, the purchase and postage costs must, of course, be met by the individuals themselves.</p>
