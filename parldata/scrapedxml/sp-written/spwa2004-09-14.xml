  <p>The best value audit of local authorities examines the range of services that local authorities provide, including the services that have an impact on environmental and social factors (e.g. education, housing, environment and consumer protection, social work).</p>

  <p>These services are examined against the key elements of best value, as described in the statutory guidance that supports the Local Government in Scotland Act 2003. Included in these key elements is responsiveness and consultation, sustainable development and equal opportunities.</p>

  <p>Best value audits should result in reports that will provide a clear picture of the quality of services being delivered by each council.</p>

  <p>The original proposals for tendering, published for consultation in 2002, provided for the Gourock to Dunoon route to be tendered as part of the bundle of routes which make up the network but on the basis that it would be restricted to a passenger only service.</p>

  <p>Many representations were made in relation to the proposals for the Gourock to Dunoon route, the majority of which supported the continuation of the vehicle service. Following further discussion with the European Commission a way was identified, consistent with EU rules, to meet the local community&rsquo;s wish to keep open the possibility of a vehicle service. This was on the basis that:</p>

  <p>the Gourock to Dunoon passenger subsidy would be tendered separately from the rest of the network;</p>

  <p>bidders would be allowed to bid on the basis of either passenger or a combined passenger and vehicle service;</p>

  <p>operators would be allowed the freedom to bring their own vessel solutions, with no binding to VesCo vessels;</p>

  <p>the restrictions on any vehicle service would be maintained (in terms of frequency and length of operating day applied to the Gourock to Dunoon service currently operated by CalMac), and</p>

  <p>the outcome would be determined on the basis of the lowest cost bid (in line with the rules for Public Service Obligations) regardless of whether this is for a passenger-only or a combined service.</p>

  <p>These proposals were set out in the consultation paper, <em>Proposals for Tendering Gourock to Dunoon Ferry Services,</em> published in March 2003 placed in the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 27056). Discussions are on-going in relation to the Gourock to Dunoon route and ministers will announce their conclusions in due course.</p>

  <p>There are no formal registration arrangements for people requiring oxygen therapy. However it is estimated that there are approximately 3,000 patients receiving therapy via concentrators supplied by the hospital service, and approximately 5,000 patients receiving therapy in cylinder form.</p>

  <p>Approximately 3,000 patients are currently receiving oxygen therapy via oxygen concentrators provided by the hospital service. The threshold of eight hours a day was introduced in April this year. The previous threshold was 15 hours a day or more and it is currently too soon to ascertain the impact on concentrator users.</p>

  <p>Portable oxygen equipment has been available on GP prescription since 1 April 2004. Oxygen conserver devices are not available on GP prescription. Although portable oxygen has always been available through the hospital services in cases of clinical need, I am advised that oxygen conservers have not been supplied as part of that service.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Ministers have given a commitment to provide 18,000 new and improved homes for social rent and low-cost home ownership in the three years up to 2006. The principal mechanism for funding this new affordable housing is the Scottish Executive Housing Investment Programme. The following table shows the number of new and improved housing approvals made available through the Scottish Executive for social rent in 2003-04.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it is satisfied that local authorities ensure a political balance of parties&rsquo; representatives on each council in allocating councillors to committees; whether it will publish evidence it has received in respect of the track record of local authorities in this regard; whether it will make it a statutory duty to ensure such political balance by implementing sections 15 to 17 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989; whether it is satisfied that the current voluntary approach to political balance is working, and whether it will make the evidence that it has considered in this regard available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre.</p>

  <p>Sections 15 to 17 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 would place a duty on local authorities to ensure that the political balance on council committees reflects the political balance on the council itself. We have received a small number of representations on this issue, but we are not aware of any widespread view that the current voluntary approach is failing. The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities have confirmed that the issue has not been raised with them and that they see no reason to impose a statutory duty on councils. We will, however, keep the position under review, particularly in the context of the introduction of the single transferable vote for local government elections.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive continues to build capacity across all staff groups within NHSScotland This includes increasing the number of consultants, a partnership agreement commitment, by working with key partners to address recruitment and retention of consultants in NHSScotland.</p>

  <p>Between 2002 and 2003, the radiologist establishment has increased by 4.6% from 225.2 whole-time equivalents (WTEs) to 235.7 WTEs.</p>

  <p>The consultant radiologist vacancy rate has risen from 11% to 13.4% in the same period. However, the number of Specialist Registrars has also increased from 87 in 2001 to 101 in 2004, providing an improved supply of training grade doctors for future consultant posts.</p>

  <p>In April 2004 a workshop was organised jointly by the Scottish Executive Health Department, the Royal College of Radiologists, the Scottish Radiological Society and the Society of Radiographers to discuss in an open forum perceived radiology bottlenecks in the patient pathway and to review experiences from around Scotland that have emerged from the Cancer Service Improvement Programme and have been successful in addressing these. These included projects in the Borders, Livingston and Tayside. Further information on this workshop is available via:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive continues to build capacity across all staff groups within NHSScotland. We remain on track to achieve our partnership agreement target of attracting 12,000 nurses and midwives into NHSScotland by 2007.</p>

  <p>Under the banner of the <em>Facing the Future </em>programme a number of initiatives have been launched, with a focus on improving the recruitment and retention of nursing and midwifery staff.</p>

  <p>These have included a review of nursing and midwifery workload which has identified a number of recommendations for improved workforce planning as well as reduction in the reliance on agency usage. This includes specific savings targets against the use of agency nurses in each NHS board area. The Executive has accepted these recommendations and is now working with NHS boards to deliver them.</p>

  <p>In addition a review of current nursing bank arrangements across NHSScotland has identified the potential for improving practices which will impact on the use of agency staff and associated costs. A full report is anticipated in October 2004.</p>

  <p>Lothian and Borders Police has received additional grant funding from the Scottish Executive over each of the past three years to help meet the additional costs associated with policing in Central Edinburgh, including the area around the Parliament. The Parliament also contributes to these costs. The payments made by the Scottish Executive in each year are shown in the table. A further annual grant of &pound;600,000 is also being provided to the force from this year to meet the wider pressures associated with policing Scotland&rsquo;s capital city.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the reasons are for differences in treatment between Scottish students and those from other parts of the European Union at Scottish universities in respect of student fees and support.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2004-09-14.28.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80123" speakername="Mr Jim Wallace" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-04/wa0914.htm#14">

  <p>Under the Scotland Act it is the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s duty to comply with EU obligations and be in conformity with the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights. The Executive is, therefore, required to ensure that EU students receive the same treatment as home students in relation to their tuition costs at Scottish universities. It should be noted that this requirement only applies to nation states of the EU, not the home countries of the UK nation state.</p>

  <p>Students who are EU nationals and meet the residence criteria are therefore eligible for the same fee support from the Student Awards Agency for Scotland (SAAS) as students who are ordinarily resident in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Students who have been ordinarily resident in the UK and Islands throughout the three year period immediately preceding the start of the course, and are ordinarily resident in Scotland on that day, are also eligible for student support from SAAS. The purpose of these criteria is to ensure that eligibility for support is determined by residence rather than nationality.</p>

  <p>European Court of Justice case law indicates that EU obligations do not currently extend to student support. EU nationals who are in Scotland wholly or mainly for the purposes of education therefore are not considered eligible for student support.</p>

  <p>However, students may qualify for the same student support as Scottish domiciled students if they, their partner or parents are classed as European Economic Area (EEA) migrant workers, and they meet the residence criteria. This fulfils an obligation under an EEC Council Regulation on freedom of movement for workers within the Community.</p>
