  <p>Estimation methodologies are included in Appendix 1 of <em>Greenhouse Gas Inventories for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland</em> published by the National Environmental Technology Centre. The latest available data, for the period 1990-2004, was published in 2006 and is available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 42395).</p>

  <p>Since 1990, improvements to data collection and estimation techniques have resulted in revisions to the data and methods used to estimate emissions. Where appropriate, revisions are made to historic data which means that it is not appropriate to make comparisons with previous inventory reports without taking account of changes to data and estimation techniques.</p>

  <p>The Gender Audit of Statistics will be published before the end of March 2007. The audit provides the most comprehensive review to date of currently available gender disaggregated statistics and sets out gendered differences and inequalities across a range of key areas of social and economic life in Scotland. It looks at the extent and nature of differences and inequalities as indicated by statistical trends, and comments on changes over time. The audit has already informed the development of our gender equality scheme and the individual action plans of Scottish Executive departments, which set out the corporate and departmental policy objectives for implementing the requirements of the gender equality duty.</p>

  <p>Local authorities are statutory bodies with statutory responsibilities, responsible for running their own affairs. Under section 64 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, they are empowered to appoint such staff as in necessary for the proper discharge of their functions and on such terms and conditions as they think fit. The appointment of staff is entirely a matter for individual local authorities and in doing so it is up to them to ensure they comply with all employment legislation.</p>

  <p>The gender balance of chief executives in local authorities is a matter for those local authorities and they will need to examine their working practices in this regard under the gender equality duty which comes into force in April 2007. However, the Local Government in Scotland Act 2003 introduced a duty of best value for all local authorities. The duty has 10 characteristics, one of which is equal opportunities. The statutory guidance states that a local authority which secures best value will be able to demonstrate a culture which encourages both equal opportunities and the observance of the equal opportunities requirements. This means (amongst other things) that the encouragement of equal opportunities and meeting the equal opportunities requirements are reflected in the authority&rsquo;s objectives and highlighted in all plans at corporate and service level, and that employment policies are fully in line with their commitment to equal opportunities and training is in place to support that commitment.</p>

  <p>It is a matter for individual public authorities to ensure they comply with the gender equality duty. The Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) is the organisation responsible for providing support and guidance to the public sector, however, to support the introduction of the duty and assist public sector organisations in Scotland the Scottish Executive has:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>commissioned a Gender Audit of Statistics, which will be published shortly, providing the most comprehensive analysis to date of currently available gender disaggregated statistics, and, where relevant, key research reports and reviews, for Scotland;</p>
<p>supported Fair For All Gender, a partnership between EOC Scotland and the Executives Health Department to help the NHS in Scotland to mainstream gender equality considerations into planning and delivery and ensure the health service meets its obligations under the new public sector gender equality duty;</p>
<p>contributed to the development of the Equal Opportunities Commission&rsquo;s (EOC) <em>Scottish Code of Practice for the Gender Equality Duty</em>;</p>
<p>contributed to the development of the EOC&rsquo;s guidance for the public sector on the gender equality duty, including, Scottish Guidance for Local Government, Scottish Guidance for Pre and Post-16 Education, Scottish Guidance for Local Government, Scottish Guidance for Health, Scottish Guidance for Criminal Justice and guidance on impact assessment, which are available on the EOC Scotland&rsquo;s website at <a href="http://www.eoc.org.uk" target="_blank">www.eoc.org.uk</a>;</p>
<p>participated in EOC consultation and awareness raising events across Scotland for the Scottish Code of Practice, and</p>
<p>provided funding and support to the EOC to organise the <em>Transgender Rights: Organisational Responsibilities, Good Employment Practise and Service Provision</em> conference.</p>
</blockquote></p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to continuing to work with the EOC, relevant employees and public authorities in Scotland to encourage and support the implementation of the gender duty. As part of this we plan to establish a Public Sector Equality Forum and will use this to promote shared or joint approaches by public authorities. This forum will consider issues arising from all three public equality duties.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, with regard to the extension of the weekly close time for salmon fishing in 1988, how the Executive defines the term &quot;general conservation grounds&quot; and what scientific evidence existed at that time to support the case for extension.</p>

  <p>As there is no definition of this term in the relevant legislation, the words must take their normal meaning. The Scottish Office in 1988 considered that general conservation grounds in relation to salmon were that there were declining numbers of salmon returning to Scottish rivers and that these should be afforded increased protection.</p>

  <p>The scientific evidence relating to juvenile salmon production in rivers available at the time was recognised as being inconclusive. However, against a backdrop of increasing levels of mortality in salmon during the marine part of their life cycle, the Government introduced the regulations as a precautionary measure to reduce exploitation of salmon in home waters to protect declining stocks.</p>

  <p>At that time nets were taking 75-80% of the total catch of salmon and grilse. Extending the weekly close time for nets would effect a greater reduction in exploitation than extending the weekly close time for salmon fishing by rod and line. The government of the day also considered the relative economic values of rod caught and net caught fish to the economy generally and to rural Scotland in particular, and concluded that the value of a rod-caught fish was many times greater than the value of a net-caught fish.</p>

  <p>There has been a great deal of progress since the launch of the Sea Fisheries Strategy ( <em>A Sustainable Framework for Scottish Sea Fisheries</em> ) in 2005.</p>

  <p>In September 2006, the SeaFAR group, which brought together all the key players in the Scottish sea fisheries sector, published an <em>Action Plan</em> to underpin the strategy. Real progress has been made on a range of issues on the ground including:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>Improved communications between the Executive, the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency (SFPA) and the industry and significant improvements in compliance as evidenced by publication of figures from the SFPA showing figures showing blackfish landings have declined to negligible levels;</p>
<p>Improved economic prospects for the whitefish fleet and the development and implementation of commercial strategies for Scottish Langoustine and Scottish Haddock;</p>
<p>Development of more industry/science partnership, and</p>
<p>Publication of the first Environment and Rural Affairs Department newsletter for the sea fisheries sector as part of our commitment to improve communications with stakeholders.</p>
</blockquote></p>

  <p>I chaired the first meeting of a re-vamped SeaFAR group on 27 March which will now oversee the full implementation of the plan. The group has agreed that, so far, all the commitments in the plan are broadly on track.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to say whether the consultants were allowed to work beyond retirement age. A table has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 42437), showing the number of consultants who are at the retirement age of 65 or over in the post at 30 September each year since 1990 by NHS board by specialty.</p>

  <p>The Executive&rsquo;s booklet Fire Safety in Schools Building our Future: Scotland&rsquo;s School Estate published in November 2003 suggests that the provision of sprinklers should be considered for new schools and for existing high risk schools. The decision on installation remains though one for the local authority concerned. A copy of the booklet is available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 36155).</p>

  <p>The Executive itself has no plans to develop a waste incinerator in the Forth Valley area.</p>

  <p>The local authorities in the Forth Valley area (Clackmannanshire, Falkirk and Stirling Councils) submitted a Strategic Outline Case which included suggested infrastructure for treating residual municipal waste.</p>

  <p>Following consideration of this Strategic Outline Case, and other cases put forward by other local authorities, I have recently written to all local authorities in Scotland. In particular, I have asked the Forth Valley authorities to produce an Outline Business Case on residual waste by 31 December 2007 and to consider the scope for producing this Outline Business Case jointly with Fife Council and Perth and Kinross Council.</p>

  <p>I announced the way forward for implementation of phase 2 of the National Waste Plan on 14 March 2007. This announcement outlined the position for local authorities in terms of recycling/composting rates which should be achieved, new treatment capacity for residual waste and indicative funding for treatment facilities.</p>

  <p>The total maximum capacity for treatment which will receive support from the Strategic Waste Fund is 1.14 million tonnes by 2020. The total amount of indicative funding to be made available from the Strategic Waste Fund is 48 million per year (at today&rsquo;s prices). Two groups of local authorities have received indicative allocations of tonnages and funding. Further indicative allocations to the remaining local authorities will be within the overall capacity and funding parameters and will be announced at a later date.</p>

  <p>A number of groups of local authorities submitted <em>Strategic Outline Cases</em> which included suggested infrastructure for treating residual municipal waste. A copy of these <em>Strategic Outline Case</em> , with certain commercially sensitive information removed, can be found on the Scottish Executive website at: <a href="http://search.scotland.gov.uk/search/pages/search/basic.asp?QuerySubmit=true&amp;Paging=true&amp;Page=1&amp;QueryText=strategic+outline+cases" target="_blank">http://search.scotland.gov.uk/search/pages/search/basic.asp?QuerySubmit=true&amp;Paging=true&amp;Page=1&amp;QueryText=strategic+outline+cases</a> .</p>

  <p>Following consideration of these <em>Strategic Outline Cases</em>, and draft<em> Outline Business Cases</em> being prepared by the Lanarkshire authorities and the Lothian and Borders authorities, I have recently written to all local authorities in Scotland outlining the way ahead on both recycling and on infrastructure to treat residual waste.</p>

  <p>In a number of cases, I have asked local authorities to submit <em>Outline Business Cases </em>on residual waste infrastructure. These <em>Outline Business Cases</em> will have to be approved by the Scottish ministers ensuring they are in line with our objectives on waste prevention, recycling and composting, value for money, affordability and deliverability.</p>

  <p>The <em>Outline Business Cases</em> should also contain a value for money assessment of alternative forms of procurement. Subject to the conclusions of these assessments, our expectation is that local authorities will issue output based tenders. These will outline the amount of waste authorities wish to divert away from landfill and seek bids and proposals from contractors on how to achieve this objective. Proposals from contractors may include thermal treatment plants.</p>

  <p>In addition, developers are, of course, free to put forward their own proposals for thermal treatment plants.</p>
