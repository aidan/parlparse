  <p>I am delighted to announce that &#163;90 million will be available to support pathfinder projects to improve the quality of services to those living in disadvantaged neighbourhoods in 12 Scottish local authority areas. Each council will have the opportunity to agree with its community planning partners locally which neighbourhood should benefit and how the resources should be deployed to bring about improvement in the lives of those communities. Through involving those communities, agreement will be reached on the specific services and outcomes that will result from the pathfinders, and these will become the subject of local outcome agreements along the lines that I described in the debate on the renewal of local government finance on 22 November 2000. Resources will be available over the coming three-year period, as follows:</p>

  <p>In recognition of its size and the scale of deprivation it faces, Glasgow City Council and its partners will be invited to implement pathfinders in three neighbourhoods. The Better Neighbourhoods Services Fund will deliver real and substantial improvement in the quality of services for local people.</p>

  <p>I am also pleased to announce that &#163;7 million will be made available from the Social Justice budget over the next three years to develop better Neighbourhood Statistics. These will help agencies to better target and measure the outcomes of our policies aimed at improving the lives of deprived communities.</p>
