  <p>The decision to move to full incorporation of MACS and the PTUC was taken following a wide-ranging consultation carried out between December 2005 and March 2006. The requirement to undertake an equality impact assessment in relation to disability came into effect in December 2006.</p>

  <p>An equality impact assessment is currently being undertaken. This is examining the effect of the amalgamation of the Mobility and Access Committee for Scotland (MACS) with the Public Transport Users&rsquo; Committee for Scotland (PTUC), taking on board evidence from stakeholders as gathered in the recent consultation. This will be published once it has been completed.</p>

  <p>A wide-ranging consultation seeking views from organisations representing disability and mobility interests about incorporating the Mobility and Access Committee for Scotland (MACS) into the Public Transport Users&rsquo; Committee for Scotland (PTUC) was carried out during the passage of the Transport (Scotland) Act 2005 between December 2005 and March 2006.</p>

  <p>We recently consulted MACS and over 70 other key stakeholders and organisations seeking their views on the practical implications of the amalgamation.</p>

  <p>Public bodies in Scotland work in partnership to provide support to creative industries.</p>

  <p>The enterprise bodies and the activities of the business gateway focus on accelerating economic growth through key sectors and companies with particular growth potential.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Arts Council supports artists and art organisations to fulfil their creative and business potential. Scottish Screen seeks to develop business and skills in Scotland&rsquo;s screen industries.</p>

  <p>In future, we propose that Creative Scotland be the leading public body advocating for the creative industries. It will evolve complementary tailored services for creative entrepreneurs in the first stages of business development, which dove tail with those offered by the business gateway and the enterprise bodies.</p>

  <p>In order to build on existing joint working we will also establish a creative economy forum. The forum will develop further a shared framework for the support and development of the creative economy, based on the core functions described above.</p>

  <p>My answer to question S3W-13054 on 27 May 2008 described the core functions of public bodies in support of the creative industries, and that the bodies noted there, as well as other important partners, will work together in a creative economy forum to ensure continuing and effective joint working.</p>

  <p>In pursuing their functions, the enterprise bodies, the Scottish Arts Council and Scottish Screen will allocate such resources from their grant in aid as they consider appropriate.</p>

  <p>Proposed expenditure by the enterprise bodies on creative industries is an operational matter for Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise and I will ask both of their chief executives to write to you in this regard.</p>

  <p>In 2008-09, the Scottish Arts Council and Scottish Screen will distribute approximately &pound;45 million from Government grant in aid of &pound;50 million to a range of individuals and organisations. Within this total, the Scottish Arts Council plans at present to allocate &pound;170,000 to the Cultural Enterprise Office, a specialist creative and cultural industry service, which assists individuals with the development of their business, arts practice and continued professional development. General expenditure for subsequent years has not yet been decided, but the Scottish Government will provide core grant in aid in those years at the same level as provided in 2008-09.</p>

  <p>In 2008-09, an estimated 1% of the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s transport budget as published in the Budget Bill 2008-09, will be spent on cycling projects. However, it is difficult to measure this figure exactly as cycling infrastructure forms an integral part of many road improvements which is not separately costed. Also, funding for the general refurbishment of 25x class 158 trains based at Inverness has been made available and will include cycle storage for on board carriage.</p>

  <p>As published in the budget document, the Sustainable and Active Travel budget line of &pound;11 million per year over the course of the spending review will be administered by the Sustainable Transport Team.

  <p>Within the Active Travel budget, up to &pound;15 million will be available to local authorities over the spending review period for the Smarter Choices Smarter Places project. Participating local authorities will use this funding to implement intense activity on sustainable travel and related physical activity interventions, including walking and cycling.</p>

  <p>The Physical Activity strategy will invest a further &pound;12 million over the next three years for physical activity initiatives in schools, workplaces, homes and across communities. This includes funding of &pound;200,000 to Living Streets and &pound;1 million per year to the Paths for All Partnership which will help to promote walking initiatives.</p>

  <p>Information on the economic benefit to Scotland of golf and of bagpiping is not held centrally. However, recent research on 70 golf courses around Scotland shows that the value of golf tourism to Scotland is estimated to be nearly &pound;97 million from these courses alone. VisitScotland is currently working to determine the total value of golf tourism to Scotland. Estimates from previous Ryder Cup tournaments suggest that it is reasonable to expect that there will be positive economic impacts on Scotland through hosting the 2014 Ryder Cup &ndash; likely to lie in the range of &pound;82 million to &pound;148 million.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has received a number of representations from residents on islands such as Colonsay about their exclusion from the road equivalent tariff (RET) pilot. In responding to these representations we have made clear that -</p>

  <p>We sympathise with their concerns about the cost of ferry travel and that is why we are carrying out a study into RET that includes a pilot exercise.</p>

  <p>There is no previous experience of RET in the UK and work was required on how the concept would translate into actual fares charged. The initial desk-based study has been comprehensive and very informative but only a real world pilot will tell us how island residents, tourists, businesses and local economies will react to a significant reduction in fares. It is also important to assess the impact on areas not being funded through the RET mechanism.</p>

  <p>While we appreciate that island communities such as Colonsay are disappointed at not being included in the pilot the very nature of pilots mean that they are selective and it is not possible to include all the routes at this time.</p>

  <p>The pilot will inform the possible future roll out of the scheme across the rest of the Clyde and Hebrides and Northern Isles networks. It is vitally important that we fully assess all the impacts before decisions are made on any future roll out.</p>

  <p>Planning for emergencies, including recovery from such incidents, is primarily a matter for local responders, as defined under the Civil Contingencies Act 2004, to whom the Scottish Government will provide appropriate support. Scottish Resilience has sponsored a current project to develop guidance for those charged with the care of people affected by emergencies. The guidance will propose management arrangements for co-ordinating multi-agency response to the personal needs of victims of all individuals affected by emergencies. Funding will be made available for the implementation of the guidance.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Police Services Authority (SPSA) provides forensic science services, including DNA testing, to Scottish police forces. SPSA has allocated &pound;24.4 million for forensic services in 2008-09 compared to &pound;23.3 million in 2007-08. Information about how much of this budget is spent on DNA testing is not held centrally. SPSA does not normally charge police forces for forensic services. Details on how much police authorities and joint police boards spend on DNA testing prior to the establishment of SPSA on 1 April 2007 are not held centrally. The Scottish Government has no plans to change the funding mechanism for the police support services provided by SPSA.</p>

  <p>The Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act 2005 Act provides for B&ograve;rd na G&agrave;idhlig to issue notices to Scottish public authorities requiring them to develop Gaelic Language Plans setting out how they will enable the use of Gaelic in connection with the exercise of their functions. Statutory notices to prepare Gaelic plans were issued to six Scottish public authorities in October 2006. The authorities were the Highland Council, Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, Argyll and Bute, the Scottish Parliament, the Scottish Government and Highlands and Islands Enterprise. The Scottish Government understands that four of these plans have been submitted to B&ograve;rd na G&agrave;idhlig for approval under the terms of the Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act 2005. The b&ograve;rd expects to approve two of these plans very soon and will approve a further two Gaelic plans following further discussions with the authorities concerned. The remaining two Gaelic plans are expected to be submitted to the b&ograve;rd for approval later this year. B&ograve;rd na G&agrave;idhlig will be issuing six statutory notices to a further six Scottish public authorities later this year inviting them to develop statutory Gaelic language plans.</p>

  <p>A significant amount of this money, almost &pound;40 million, was spent on costs relating to the stock transfer process or on trying to persuade tenants of the benefits of stock transfer, something they ultimately rejected. That was a complete waste of money.</p>

  <p>Despite &pound;110 million being allocated to Edinburgh, Renfrewshire, Highland and Stirling by the previous administration for use before stock transfer, tenants still voted no in these areas. It was wasteful to spend money in support of an unsuccessful campaign, rather than part of a properly targeted investment programme.</p>

We will work with our industry partners to implement these service enhancements in the most cost effective way. Full details on the information requested is given in the <em>ScotRail Franchise Amendment Agreement</em>, a copy of which has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 45544).</p>

  <p>The longer term needs of Scotland&rsquo;s nationally strategic transport corridors are being considered through the strategic transport projects review.</p>

  <p>The figures relate only to investment in new construction and minor improvement schemes that have been completed but do not include maintenance costs. They are inclusive of construction and land costs with VAT applied where appropriate. The figures exclude preparation and land costs on capital schemes that have not yet gone to construction because there is, as yet, no tangible asset to show for the expenditure. The figures do not include expenditure on the M74 and M77 PPP schemes.</p>

  <p>There has been no formal assessment made of the school travel co-ordinator grant scheme. Since 2003, the Scottish Government has provided ring-fenced funding to local authorities for school travel co-ordinator posts. This funding has now been rolled up into the block grant as part of the concordat agreement with COSLA and it is up to local authorities to prioritise local needs.</p>

  <p>In 2008, over 61% of Scottish schools are working on or implementing a travel plan to encourage more children to walk and cycle to school and to reduce the numbers of vehicles on the road during the school run periods. In East Dunbartonshire every primary school has implemented a travel plan and in Inverclyde 100% of its schools, primary and secondary, are working on a travel plan. This is evidence of the success of the school travel coordinators&rsquo; work.</p>

  <p>For criminal proceedings the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) retains information on the number of children who are required to be cited in the event of a not guilty plea. Between 2005 and 2008 the numbers were as follows:</p>

  <p>2005-06 - 9,088 children</p>

  <p>2006-07 - 9,673 children</p>

  <p>2007-08 - 7,364 children.</p>

  <p>The COPFS does not hold statistics on the number of children called to give evidence at trials, but this will be less than those marked to be cited or actually cited to give evidence since a number of cases do not proceed to trial for variety of reasons.</p>

  <p>Information is not available on the number of child witnesses cited by the defence, but since the vast majority of witnesses are cited by the COPFS these numbers are likely to be very small.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Court Service (SCS) has been developing its recording of information on the numbers of applications for special measures since the beginning of the phased implementation of the 2004 act in April 2005. Figures for special measures actually used are not available, but since many cases involving applications for special measures do not proceed to trial they will be less than the numbers of applications made.</p>

  <p>SCS records show that in the sheriff court in 2005, 55 children had applications granted for live television links and 119 applications granted for screens. Between January and September 2006 these figures stood at 99 and 111 respectively. From October 2006 the SCS put in place revised returns to collect details of defence and Scottish Children&rsquo;s Reporter Administration applications. The figures were as follows:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is working with key partners across the justice system to improve the quality of information collected on child and vulnerable witnesses following the completion of the implementation of the Vulnerable Witnesses (Scotland) Act 2004 in April this year. We are also considering how best this information can be made publicly available. In undertaking this work we will take into account the findings of the early evaluation of the first phases of implementation of the 2004 act, which is nearing completion and will be published later this summer.</p>

  <p>Examples of recent work by agencies in this area include the Scottish Court Service&rsquo;s (SCS) monitoring system that captures information in relation to the throughput of applications placed before the court. The SCS is also improving the collection of information on how effectively special measures operate when evidence is being led. The police service is rolling out a revised standard police report (SPR2) which will improve the collation of information on witness vulnerability.</p>
