  <p>Each authority&#8217;s grant for 2001-02 was calculated using the existing client group-based distribution formula adjusted to reflect a number of distribution reviews completed this year. A minimum grant increase (or &quot;floor&quot;) of 5% was put in place. For 2002-03 and 2003-04, the formula was updated using projections of population changes in key client groups. Floors of 4% in 2002-03 and 3.4% in 2003-04 were applied.</p>

  <p>Comparisons of the population update and block and formula methods of grant distribution for 2002-03 and 2003-04 suggested that Glasgow City Council would gain around &pound;3.9 million more over the three-year period 2001-04 from the block and formula method than the population update method. The incorporation of a &quot;floor&quot;, or guaranteed minimum grant increase, gives the council an additional &pound;16 million over the block and formula method. It is the difference between these two figures that constituted the additional &pound;12 million that was referred to in the statement of 7 December 2000.</p>

I expect these to produce a marked improvement in response times in 2001, and the Executive&#8217;s targets for answering ministerial correspondence in the last quarter of 2001 will be:</p>

  <p>80% of correspondence to receive a reply within 17 working days; and</p>

  <p>100% of correspondence to receive a reply within 25 working days.</p>

  <p>I shall report quarterly on progress towards these targets.</p>

  <p><i>Our</i> <i>National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change</i> makes clear that all NHS employers will be required to meet or exceed best practice guidance on family-friendly policies as part of the new Staff Governance Standard. To help employers, guidance on family-friendly policies will issue in the New Year, and will address issues such as flexible working, childcare, breastfeeding and career breaks. The guidance will apply to all staff in NHS Scotland.</p>

  <p>The introduction of family-friendly policies is expected to improve morale and show that NHS Scotland cares about its staff. It sends the message that NHS Scotland is serious about recruiting new staff and retaining its staff by offering them the ability to work the hours they want to combine work with family commitments.</p>

  <p>The Post Office and postal services are reserved matters for the UK Government, although the Executive recognises the important role which post offices play in communities across Scotland, and in particular in rural areas.</p>

  <p>The Executive is keen to encourage innovative approaches to service provision in rural areas, including post office services, and has asked a sub-group of the Scottish National Rural Partnership to investigate this issue. I expect to receive the group&#8217;s report shortly.</p>

  <p>I am aware that the Post Office is continually seeking to identify new opportunities to increase the number of transactions across its counters, and is already offering a number of additional services, including banking services. We welcome the progress being made, and encourage the Post Office to continue its efforts to attract additional business. With regard to the sale of travel tickets, while it is for transport operators to decide who should act as ticket agents, the Executive would welcome any initiatives which make the advance purchase of travel tickets more readily available.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive <a name="QuestionText">what response it will make to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency&#8217;s Strategic Review of Organic Waste Spread on Land.</a></p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-12-22.28.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80158" speakername="Mr Sam Galbraith" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa1222.htm#QuestionText">

  <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency&#8217;s (SEPA) Strategic Review of Organic Waste Spread on Land was commissioned by the Scottish Office in 1998. The report provides a comprehensive and useful assessment of the practices, impacts and risks of spreading organic wastes on land.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive conducted a public consultation on SEPA&#8217;s recommendations. Although there was general support for increased or more consistent control of most aspects of waste spreading on land, some of the recommendations did not receive overall support.</p>

  <p>The Executive is also carrying out a wider review of the exemptions set out in the Waste Management Licensing Regulations (WMLR) 1994 and the SEPA recommendations have been very useful in this work. At present, these regulations allow certain wastes to be spread on land with only a minimum of control, with information simply having to be registered with SEPA. These exemptions are made to encourage the recovery or recycling of waste but there may be a need for more stringent controls. This will be the subject of consultation in due course. The amendments being considered, if adopted, would implement the bulk of the recommendations in SEPA&#8217;s Review. These include:</p>

  <p>the introduction of a consistent legislative framework for all organic wastes spread on land;</p>

  <p>a requirement for those intending to spread organic wastes to demonstrate to SEPA the agricultural benefit or improvement for animal and plant communities;</p>

  <p>restrictions on land utilisation following the application of wastes to prevent harm to health, wastes to be analysed for chemical and microbiological parameters prior to spreading;</p>

  <p>a prohibition on spreading of septic tank sludge on land;</p>

  <p>a requirement for a waste producer who wishes to recycle organic waste to land to provide an audit trail which SEPA can assess and;</p>

  <p>a charging scheme to be developed by SEPA to recover the cost of inspections from those seeking the exemption.</p>

  <p>However, the following SEPA recommendations still need to be addressed.</p>

  <p><u>Prohibition of the spreading of blood and gut contents from abattoirs.</u></p>

  <p>The Executive proposes to consider how blood and gut contents should be dealt with in the light of the report due to be published in 2001 by the joint Executive/Food Standards Agency Task Force which is examining how to minimise the exposure of the public to E.coli 0157. In the meantime the Executive will continue a dialogue with spreading contractors to promote improved practices.</p>

  <p><u>Introduction of Land Management Plans.</u></p>

  <p>The Executive will continue to work to promote better planning of farm activities to prevent adverse impacts on the environment. However, the Executive&#8217;s Prevention of Environmental Pollution from Agricultural Activity (PEPFAA) Code already provides good practice advice to farmers.</p>

  <p>Prohibition of certain practices including injecting wastes on land with field drains and spreading waste outwith daylight hours. Prohibition of these practices will not be taken forward at present. It is considered impracticable to prohibit injecting on agricultural land with field drains. Spreading outwith daylight hours could be a practical disadvantage to Scottish farmers because of the shorter winter daylight hours in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Competency schemes for contractors carrying out landspreading operations. The Scottish Agricultural College (SAC) already offers Waste to Agricultural Land Systems Training Schemes (WASTeS). It is not considered that other schemes are necessary at present.</p>

  <p>I am confident that the activities currently under way and planned as a result of the review of the WMLR exemptions and the recommendations in the SEPA report will lead to better control of the recycling and recovery of wastes spread on land. There is potential for continuing to make use of these waste materials, but it is obviously vital that we also allay the concerns of the public and avoid unacceptable risk and impact to health and the environment.</p>
