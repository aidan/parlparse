  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what arrangements are in place to provide one-to-one assistance with the completion of the census forms to visually impaired and deafblind people.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2001-03-09.S1W-13527.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80252" speakername="Mr Jim Wallace" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-01/wa0309.htm#1">

  <p>Special arrangements to assist those who are visually impaired or have hearing difficulties to complete a census form have been made through the Registrar General&#8217;s Community Liaison Initiative for the census, which was introduced last year. The twin aims of the initiative are to raise awareness of the census among those groups in the population thought to have been undercounted in the 1991 census, and to establish contact with a range of voluntary organisations in order that their assistance could be enlisted to help people who, for one reason or another, might be apprehensive about the census, or who might have difficulty in completing a census form.</p>

  <p>Initial contact was made by the General Register Office for Scotland at national level with organisations which included those representing people with particular disabilities, such as the Scottish Council on Deafness and the Royal National Institute for the Blind (RNIB). From these initial contacts a database of local contacts was established enabling the 22 Census Area Managers throughout Scotland to develop locally a link with these groups so that, in the event of someone needing help, frontline skilled assistance would be available from the representative organisations. These organisations were provided with the names, addresses and telephone numbers of the Census Area Managers.</p>

  <p>The aim is for the local voluntary groups to let census managers know of individual people who may require assistance to complete a census form so that census field staff can tap in to this assistance, often provided by someone familiar to the householder. Citizens Advice Bureaux may also be able to provide help.</p>

  <p>Census enumerators will receive instructions and training on dealing with the public generally as well as with people who may have difficulty completing their form. The enumerators are instructed to provide assistance where this is unavailable from the professional sources mentioned, or from relatives, friends, neighbours, home helps etc.</p>

  <p>The census questions and the information leaflet, which is delivered along with the census form, are available in Braille and in large print to standards agreed with RNIB. There is also a census telephone helpline and a textphone for the deaf. Both numbers are shown on the census form, as well as on the Braille and the large print leaflets. Videos used by Census Area Managers in community liaison meetings include subtitles for use by those who have hearing difficulties. Two audiotapes have been produced for circulation by the Scottish Talking Newspaper group. The first gives a general overview of the census and the questions being asked, while the second covers the help available to persons with a sight impairment. Census managers are also able to seek the services of British Sign Language interpreters where necessary.</p>

  <p>The census form has been designed so that many of the questions can be answered by ticking a box and the information can be captured using modern digital scanning technology. This will deliver major cost savings compared with traditional clerical processing. The precision required in this process coupled with the sheer volume of the operation means that it is not practical to offer the actual forms in large print or in Braille. If, however, someone cannot complete a census form, they can contact the Census Helplines and arrangements will be put in place for help to be provided to complete the form through the Community Liaison Initiative or by census staff. Alternatively, those needing assistance can tell the enumerator who will notify the field managers of the kind of assistance required.</p>

  <p>The census form is not available for completion by email because of concerns about confidentiality, duplication and authentication, and the low value for money of setting up electronic completion facilities in tandem with those for completion of the paper forms.</p>

  <p>In the year April 1999 to March 2000, Locate in Scotland and its partners helped to attract to Scotland a total of 91 projects involving planned investment of &#163;650 million and the expected creation or safeguarding of over 19,000 jobs. This represented Scotland&#8217;s strongest ever performance in this highly competitive market.</p>

  <p>Locate in Scotland does not publish aggregate results for inward investment until after the end of the year to which the figures relate. With the expectation that the current year would be very tough, the key targets for the period April 2000 to March 2001 were set as 60 projects, involving planned investment of &#163;500 million, and the expected creation or safeguarding of 7,000 jobs. The final verified results will be published, as usual, in June.</p>

  <p>Although responsibility for policy on energy pricing is a reserved matter, the Scottish Executive is in regular contact with Scottish Gas on a range of issues, including concerns about fuel poverty in Scotland. The current rise of 4.7% in the price of gas must be seen in the context of a fall in gas prices over the last five years of around 20% in real terms. The effect of the rise on domestic consumers will be to cause a marginal increase in fuel poverty, but this will be mitigated by a number of programmes across Government aimed at helping low-income households.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is determined to improve access to primary care services across Scotland, and just some of its current initiatives are set out below:</p>

  <p><i>Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change</i> sets out our commitment to ensure that patients in every part of Scotland can get access to an appropriate member of the primary care team in no more than 48 hours.</p>

  <p>The development of Personal Medical Services (PMS) will enable PCTs to employ salaried GPs to fill gaps in current service provision and enhance existing services, particularly in remote and rural areas. In addition, I announced on 19 February an additional &#163;18.5 million over the next three years for PMS development, and Highland Health Board have been given a notional allocation of &#163;228,078 to help provide greater access to its primary care services.</p>

  <p>The development of NHS 24, which will provide the public of Scotland with 24-hour access to advice and information, will ensure that patients are provided with direct access to the appropriate health or care service in one phone call. NHS 24 will build links with GPs and their out-of-hours services, as well as other NHS services, to ensure that a fully integrated system is put in place.</p>

  <p>We have set up a Remote and Rural Areas Resource Initiative with funding of &#163;8 million over a three-year period. The initiative is looking at new and innovative ways of providing services in the less populated parts of Scotland and improving access to services will be a central theme in its work. <i>Our National Health </i>makes clear that health boards will be expected to start rolling out successful projects in their areas by April 2002.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Law Commission published its Report on the Law of the Tenement (Scot Law Com No 162) in 1998. Following the publication of the subsequent Report on Real Burdens (Scot Law Com No 181) in October 2000, the Executive asked the Commission to update its recommendations on the law of the tenement to take account of its subsequent work on real burdens and title conditions. This is because the management of tenements is governed by rules and conditions set out as rights and real burdens in the relevant title deeds. The modernisation and simplification of the law on real burdens will rationalise the application and enforcement of burdens on all property, including tenements. Reforming the law relating to real burdens and title conditions first will mean that reform of the law of the tenement should be more straightforward. A Tenement (Scotland) Bill will therefore be introduced after enactment of the Title Conditions (Scotland) Bill when an opportunity arises in the legislative programme.</p>

  <p>No. On 14 February South Lanarkshire Council indicated their intention to grant planning permission, subject to conditions and the satisfactory conclusion of a legally binding agreement under section 75 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1997. There are no planning reasons which would require the Scottish ministers to intervene.</p>

  <p>Our proposal to set the same buy-out price under the Renewables Obligation (Scotland) (ROS) as for England and Wales will ensure that the UK market for renewable energy is not distorted. A lower Scottish buy-out price would make it difficult for Scottish electricity suppliers to meet our ROS targets, since renewables generators would tend to sell their Renewables Obligation Certificates to suppliers in the English market where prices would be higher. A higher Scottish buy-out price would place higher costs on all Scottish electricity consumers. The proposal to set the same buy-out price in Scotland as in England and Wales has been widely supported by respondents to our consultation on the ROS.</p>

  <p>The policy of setting the same buy-out price for all renewable technologies will allow the market to choose which technologies it wishes to use to meet the targets, but we are aware of the need to promote the development of longer-term technologies.</p>

  <p>It is expected that the new Renewables Obligation (Scotland), and equivalent obligations elsewhere, will eventually result in a market for renewables obligation certificates, which will be traded separately from the renewable electricity they will represent. But it will be for renewable energy generators, electricity suppliers and others involved in the energy markets to decide what form this certificate market will take and whether there should be a trading exchange.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has set up the headquarters of the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Department in Glasgow. This involved the transfer of 140 posts from Edinburgh to Glasgow. We have also set up the headquarters of the Food Standards Agency (Scotland) in Aberdeen and announced that the Public Guardian&#8217;s Office will be set up in Falkirk.</p>

  <p>I announced on 1 December in the answer to question S1W-11704 that detailed studies of the location of six bodies would be undertaken and that, if the Parliament passes the necessary legislation to enable them to be established, the Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care and the Scottish Social Services Council will not be located in Edinburgh.</p>

  <p>In setting out the relocation policy, the then First Minister indicated in the answer to question S1W-1558 that most of the headquarters functions of the Scottish Executive Departments are located in Edinburgh (or, in the case of the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Department, in Glasgow) and that the Executive expected this to remain the case since they typically involve frequent meetings with ministers and the Scottish Parliament. This remains the view of the Scottish Executive.</p>
