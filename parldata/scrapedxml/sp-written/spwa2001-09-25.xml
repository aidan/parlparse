  <p>The Scottish Executive has not issued any specific guidance on the extent to which parents of a disabled child may choose the mainstream school that they wish their child to attend. Parents of any child are entitled to make a placing request to their education authority as regards the school to be attended by their child. Placing requests for disabled children, in common with all other children, have to be considered under the framework in the Education Act 1980 (as amended), and education authorities can turn down those requests only for reasons set out in the legislation.</p>

  <p>However, section 15 of the Standards in Scotland&#8217;s Schools etc. Act 2000 includes a requirement for education authorities to provide for all children in mainstream schools, except in certain specified circumstances. The Scottish Executive is currently preparing guidance for local authorities on this presumption in favour of mainstreaming.</p>

  <p>Legislation on firearms is a reserved matter. The Government receives advice on firearms issues, including issues relating to replica and imitation firearms, which are defined in section 57(4) of the Firearms Act 1968, from the Firearms Consultative Committee. The committee is an independent body established by an Act of the UK Parliament to keep under review the workings of the Firearms Acts. Its 11th annual report is due to be submitted to the Home Secretary later this year.</p>

  <p>Good progress is being made towards fulfilling the commitment in <i>Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change</i> to launch a Scottish Diabetes Framework in 2001. A consultation paper was issued in July by the Scottish Diabetes Framework Working Group and two open meetings were held in Polmont (31 August) and Glasgow (7 September). These meetings were attended by about 350 people including a significant number of patients.</p>

  <p>The Executive is launching today a strategy designed to achieve universal access to the internet and help close the digital divide in Scotland. The promotion of a digitally inclusive Scotland is a key element in our drive to create a socially just society.</p>

  <p>The strategy encompasses a range of measures including publishing details of over 700 existing facilities in Scotland where the public can gain access to the internet and a scheme to create over 1,000 extra access points to the internet, delivering comprehensive access across Scotland. We are also launching a search for two Digital Communities. The objective is to demonstrate how the internet can increase peoples&#8217; opportunities and improve quality of life, but at the same time to inform our further efforts to close the digital divide. This initiative will ensure that 2,000 households in two disadvantaged communities have access to the internet and are able to gain the skills to use it.</p>

  <p>The actions listed in the strategy will complement existing programmes, such as the Individual Learning Account scheme which offers individuals discounts of up to 80 per cent on the cost of basic IT courses.</p>

  <p>Copies of the digital inclusion strategy are available on the Scottish Executive website (www.scotland.gov.uk/digitalscotland). Copies have also been placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>Information on the number of Home Economics teachers employed in each year is not available.</p>

  <p>The periodic Teacher Census estimates that in 1994-95 there were 1,251 (FTE) teachers in publicly funded secondary schools who recorded Home Economics as their main subject qualification. In 1998-99, there were an estimated 1,276 (FTE) teachers in publicly funded secondary schools who recorded Home Economics as their main subject qualification.</p>

  <p>This information was not collected in other years.</p>

  <p>As part of the Teacher Workforce Planning exercise the Scottish Executive have taken steps to improve the quality of data collected from local authorities this year. It is believed this will provide more accurate information on a range of areas, including subject coverage, on an annual basis.</p>

  <p>The Executive responded to Her Majesty&#8217;s Government on the European Commission&#8217;s 6th Environmental Action Programme, and in common with normal practice, it respects the confidentiality of the information exchanged.</p>

  <p>On 5 June 2001, my officials provided the clerk to the Transport and Environment Committee with a copy of all the responses on the Scottish Executive&#8217;s consultation on the 6th Environmental Action Programme.</p>

  <p>The Food Standards Agency has advised that European Law requires specified risk material (SRM) to be removed at the slaughterhouse, and it is illegal for another EU Member State to send consignments of meat to the UK, which contain spinal cord. The Specified Risk Material Regulations, as amended, are enforced by the Meat Hygiene Service in licensed plants and local authorities in unlicensed premises. The agency has addressed SRM infringements through enhanced checks on imported beef and by raising the issue at high level with the Commission and the member state in question. The agency&#8217;s policy is to seek for the plant&#8217;s licence to be suspended in cases of systematic failures.</p>

  <p>During 2000-01, &#163;3.78 million was spent on applying skidding resistance treatments to the trunk road network. It is important to note that the fact that a section of road is below the investigatory level does not necessarily mean it is unsafe or requires immediate treatment.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no plans to introduce such schemes in Scotland.</p>

  <p>It is for roads authorities to decide how roadside cleaning should be carried out, taking into account a number of factors such as traffic management and the health and safety of those carrying out the work. The overriding imperative is to ensure that when roadside cleaning, verge maintenance, etc, is carried out neither road users nor those undertaking the activity are placed at any risk or danger. For that reason the Executive does not believe the &quot;adopt-a-road&quot; model is suitable for Scotland.</p>

  <p>Guidance on the curriculum recommends one hour&#8217;s physical exercise per week for all pupils up to the age of 16. The Scottish Executive has encouraged schools to promote physical exercise in recent years through a range of <strong></strong> sportscotland initiatives which include: the TOPS programmes (resources for schools and training for teachers), the Active Primary Schools programme (being piloted in a number of education authorities) and the School Sport Co-ordinator programme (currently in over half of secondaries).</p>

  <p>Schools and local authorities also have to implement the national priorities for education, which were approved by the Scottish Parliament. These priorities stress the need to teach pupils respect for self and to equip them with the attitudes necessary to prosper in a changing society. Physical exercise and education can play a central part in making these priorities a reality.</p>

  <p>Local authorities are expected to have plans on the implementation of the national priorities in place by December 2001. Schools must do so by June 2002.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally. The organisation of, and contracting for, the school meals service is a matter for local authorities. The <i>Model Nutritional Guidelines for Catering Specifications for the Public Sector in Scotland</i> issued in 1996, as part of the Scottish Diet Action Plan, contain a number of general principles concerning the qualifications of staff. Amongst these is the suggestion that dieticians should be part of the formal advisory structure, in both the preparation and monitoring of specifications; that menus should be analysed by a dietician or nutritionist; and that training of all levels of staff should be delivered by suitably qualified staff, such as dieticians.</p>

  <p>Protection against measles, mumps and rubella in the UK is recommended through the combined MMR vaccine. This policy is based on independent expert advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation and the Committee on Safety of Medicines, and was set out in letters from the Chief Professional Officers in the Scottish Executive Health Department to GPs and other health professionals on 22 December 2000 and 12 March 2001. Single vaccines leave children at risk of disease while they wait, unprotected between vaccines, for no additional benefit. They also expose children to an increased risk of local reactions at the injection site. An MMR discussion pack, leaflet and poster are being issued to health professionals in September. These materials will help inform discussion between GPs and parents on MMR and single vaccine issues.</p>
