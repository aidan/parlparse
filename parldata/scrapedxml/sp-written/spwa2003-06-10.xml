  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what (a) powers and (b) plans it has to introduce legislation to provide safeguards for debtors with bank accounts by restricting the extent to which an arrestment attaches to monies in bank accounts and establish an arrestment restriction procedure, whereby a debtor would be able to apply to a sheriff for an order to release monies from arrestment.</p>

  <p>In this parliamentary year we will consult on and bring forward proposals for reform to the law on the enforcement of civil obligations in Scotland. The Executive consulted extensively on diligence reform last year and has published an independent analysis of the responses to consultation. The legislation which will follow will cover issues consulted upon such as modernisation of the enforcement system and individual types of enforcement, including arrestment of funds such as those held in bank accounts, as well as other debtor protections.</p>

  <p>The specific information is not available. However, the number of dentists whose patient registration status shows "withdrawn" in the last financial year and the NHS board area that these dentists are located is shown in the following table. Patient registrations can be withdrawn for a number of reasons, including the dentist moving to another area, non-payment of charges by the patient, entry into a private arrangement, because the dentist has decided to stop treating some or all categories of NHS patients or if a duplicate registration has been detected.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for the overall provision of NHS dental services in an area rests with the NHS board or Primary Care NHS Trust. However, the Executive recognises that there are problems with access to NHS dental services in some parts of Scotland and has introduced a number of measures aimed at improving such access. We will keep the need for incentives which attract and retain dentists within the National Health Service under constant review.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Based on dentists whose patients registration status shows &quot;withdrawn&quot; and where the start date of the registration period is between 1 April 2002 and 31 March 2003; this occurs when there is a request for the registration record to be withdrawn (usually a request from the dentist, approved by the NHS board or primary care NHS trust). It also includes withdrawals carried out where more than one active registration exists for the same patient as part of data cleansing. This means that some withdrawals may be done due to an internal process.</p>

  <p>2. One dentist can have more than one list number within a NHS board area. One dentist is present in two NHS boards.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what plans it has to improve the provision of digital hearing aids to NHS patients in each year to 2006-07; how much has been allocated from the Health and Community Care budget for this purpose in each year to 2006-07, and how many patients it estimates would benefit from a digital hearing aid</p>

  <p>The Partnership Agreement includes a commitment to ensure the resources are available to allow the routine issue of digital hearing aids and support where they are the most clinically effective option. This follows the commitment made by the Executive to modernising audiology services in response to the Public Health Institute Report <em>NHS Audiology Services in Scotland</em> .</p>

  <p>We have asked NHS boards to develop modernisation action plans for hearing aid services, and an additional &#163;1.5 million was made available earlier this year for the purchase of new audiology equipment.</p>

  <p>In 2003-04 boards will receive an average increase of 7.8% in their budget allocations. We expect boards to use some of this funding to help implement these plans. Allocations for future years are still to be decided. In addition, the Executive is making &#163;8 million of central funding available over the next four years to support the modernisation process, and will appoint a project manager to facilitate and co-ordinate modernisation over the next two years.</p>

  <p>The overall aim is to ensure that patients receive a hearing aid with features that best overcome their impairment and it is not possible to estimate how many will be digital hearing aids.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is being kept fully informed of developments at the Arjo Wiggins paper mill in Corpach. Officials from Highlands and Islands Enterprise met the company&#146;s senior management to discuss the job loss situation and also what assistance can be offered to those employees affected.</p>

  <p>The company has been offered a grant under the Department of Trade and Industry&#146;s Bio-energy Capital Grant Scheme. The grant offer is based on the installation of a bio-energy plant and the DTI is monitoring the situation with Arjo Wiggins. In respect of their dealings with the EU, this is a separate matter of Competition Policy, which is reserved to the UK Government.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive collects annual statistics from local authorities on the following aspects of the mandatory licensing scheme:</p>

  <p>number of applications received, refused, granted, revoked or suspended during the year, by types of Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMO);</p>

  <p>number of applications pending at 31 March, by types of HMO;</p>

  <p>total number of licenses in force at 31 March, by type of HMO and by number of occupants;</p>

  <p>reasons for refusals for licences, and</p>

  <p>licensing fees and fee structure.</p>

  <p>The resulting figures have been published in the Scottish Executive&#146;s Statistical Bulletin, <em>Housing Trends in Scotland</em>. The relevant issues, which are available in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre, are for quarters ending 31 December 2001 and 31 March 2002 (Bib. number 23303) and quarter ending 31 March 2001 (Bib. number 16396).</p>

  <p>The Executive also commissioned independent research, <em>A Review of the First Year of Mandatory Licensing of Houses in Multiple Occupation in Scotland</em>, by Hector Currie, and officials keep in touch with current issues and developments through attending the meetings of the Scottish HMO Network Group of local authority officers.</p>

  <p>The law relating to the detention of persons suffering from personality disorders was recently reviewed as part of the work of the Millan and McLean Committees.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the powers of direction of Scottish Ministers in respect of non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs) were used during the first session of the Parliament and, if so, in which instances.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2003-06-10.34.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80057" speakername="Mr Andy Kerr" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-03/wa0610.htm#16">

  <p>Powers of direction vary from body to body. There is a wide range of terminology used in statute to describe directions that can be given to NDPBs. The power is normally contained in each body&#146;s establishing legislation or other founding framework documentation. These provisions give ministers a power to issue to an NDPB directions of a general or specific nature. Alternatively or in addition, statute may give ministers the power to issue directions on matters such as the form in which an NDPB must draw up its accounts or on what the NDPB must do to ensure the delivery of an EU obligation.</p>

  <p>The provision and application of such powers, is and can be interpreted in many ways. This flexibility is desirable in order to reflect the differing nature and individual status of the wide range of NDPBs and also to maintain positive relationships between bodies and ministers. In practice it is for each NDPB sponsor division within the Executive and solicitors to interpret what action(s) might qualify as a direction, taking into account the circumstances of the body and the scope of the power, and offer advice to ministers accordingly.</p>

  <p>Any decision for a minister to write to an NDPB in such terms may be considered to form part of the normal day to day operational responsibilities which ministers hold in relation to accountability and governance of NDPBs. Such responsibilities are an essential aspect of the well defined arms length relationship between NDPBs and ministers.</p>

  <p>The use of powers of direction is not recorded separately in every case. The information requested is, therefore, not held centrally in a way which would allow the provision of a comprehensive list.</p>

  <p>What matters is identifying the most effective locations for meeting people&#146;s needs for access to public services. The Scottish Executive, as part of its 21st Century Government agenda, has developed and supported the delivery of public services through a range of channels including the internet and managed contact centres as well as face to face in offices and one-stop shops. The Executive is also exploring other platforms for information and service delivery, including interactive digital television, smartcards, public kiosks, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) and WAP phones. Assisted access to public services remains an important aspect of improving public service delivery and the use of both Citizen&#146;s Advice Bureaux and Post Offices are being considered.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#146;s Modernising Government Fund has supported projects in Eddleston Post Office in the Scottish Borders setting up a community PC to allow local people to develop IT skills and access information and in Dumfries and Galloway to test information kiosks in various locations including rural post offices. It has also supported the Digital Highland Project where Highland Council is extending availability of services through a network of one-stop shops across its area and is extending the facility to carry out transactions with government electronically through rural Post Offices.</p>

  <p>At the same time, as a part of its digital inclusion strategy, the Executive's public internet access point initiative is creating over 1,000 new venues across Scotland where people can have cheap, easy access to the web and all its services - public, commercial and voluntary sector. Any public venue can apply &#150; such as shops, pubs, community centres etc. Rural post offices have been actively encouraged to participate in the scheme - which provides eligible venues with computer hardware, software, and internet connectivity - all free of charge. The scheme therefore allows rural post offices to provide another valuable service to their customers. Nearly 600 new public internet access points are in operation now including 40 post offices. Potential applicants can obtain details of the scheme by calling 0845-270-1043 or on the web at www.scottishwebaccess.com.</p>

  <p>(i) Consultation documents to farmers</p>

  <p>We issue these to representative bodies with an interest, and not as a rule to farmers, although all the documents can be accessed by individuals through the Executive&#146;s website. We do not keep a record of the costs of these consultation documents since in the main they do not involve external printing and dissemination. The costs, mainly in photocopying and postage are met from the general running costs of the department.</p>

  <p>(ii) Guidance documents to farmers</p>

  <p>On guidance documents, primarily subsidy scheme literature and claim forms, the costs are as follows:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive and the Home Office jointly reviewed the Sex Offenders Act in 2000 and published the results in July 2001. That review concluded that there was no viable way of extending the act to offenders convicted before the legislation came into force, beyond the limited retrospection with respect to those serving relevant sentences on 1 September 1997.</p>

  <p>There are measures, however, to protect the public from sex offenders who have completed their sentences prior to 1997 but who continue to display risky behaviour. Chief constables can, for example, apply for a Sex Offender Order, which triggers notification and can place prohibitions on the individual.</p>

  <p>A number of changes to strengthen the existing sex offenders&#146; regime are contained in the Sexual Offences Bill currently before the UK Parliament. No further changes to the retrospective element of the legislation are planned.</p>

  <p>We have, once again, succeeded in allocating everyone who applied to join the Teacher Induction Scheme in August 2003 to one of his or her five preferred authorities, albeit the scheme offers no such guarantee.</p>

  <p>The matching of probationers to their preferred authorities has been even more successful than last year. In the primary sector 96% of applicants have been allocated to one of their top three preferences (94% last year), and in the secondary sector 89% have been allocated to one of their top three (86% last year).</p>

  <p>There is, however, no certainty that we will be able to maintain such high levels of matching in future years. As we train more teachers over the coming years, to deliver our new partnership commitments, it may not prove possible to afford the same priority to student preferences</p>
