  <p>After careful consideration, I have decided to locate one office in Glasgow and the other in Inverness, dealing with the courts in Dingwall, Dornoch, Elgin, Inverness, Nairn, Tain and Wick. The offices will also be able to represent clients in other courts if their services are sought. My officials and those of the Scottish Legal Aid Board will be consulting the Law Society about the operational aspects of this decision. It is hoped to have these offices operational by 30 June 2004.</p>

  <p>As with any proposals for significant service change or closure approved by NHS boards, I would only make a decision on whether to endorse the preferred option or not following careful consideration of the relevant local review.</p>

  <p>In the case of maternity service proposals, I would have to be satisfied that the preferred option is consistent with <em>A Framework for Maternity Services in Scotland</em> (February 2001) and the recommendations of the <em>Expert Group on Acute Maternity Services </em>(December 2002). These policy documents set out clear action points and recommendations intended to ensure that NHS Scotland provides modern, safe and sustainable maternity services that are appropriate to the needs of women and families in Scotland.</p>

  <p>In the case of NHS Argyll and Clyde&#8217;s maternity service proposals, I have taken the time to both carefully consider all the available information and to meet with local representatives and campaign groups.</p>

  <p>I consider that NHS Argyll and Clyde&#8217;s proposed model of maternity services is the best available option for providing high quality, safe and sustainable maternity services that are consistent with national guidelines. As such, I can confirm that the plans will see a consultant-led maternity unit at the Royal Alexandra and new midwife-led community units in Greenock and Vale of Leven. However, I have asked NHS Glasgow and NHS Argyll and Clyde to do more detailed work on the pattern of patient choice between Glasgow and Paisley and to submit a report to me by April 2004.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive <a name="QuestionText">whether it will identify the &quot;risks&quot;, as referred to by executive directors at the Argyll and Clyde NHS Board meeting on 29 July 2003 in the context of justification of the siting of consultant-led maternity services at Paisley as an alternative to enabling women to access consultant-led services in Glasgow, particularly in the Queen Mother Hospital, and whether such &quot;risks&quot; are clinical or administrative.</a></p>

  <p>Argyll and Clyde NHS Board outlines their view of the risks attached to providing Glasgow based consultant-led maternity care to their residents who live north of the River Clyde on page VII of the executive summary in their <em>Report on the Review and Consultation of Maternity Services </em> (July 2003).</p>

  <p>I have asked for a more detailed report by April 2004 on the pattern of patient choice between Paisley and Glasgow. I stress that women who choose to have their babies in Glasgow will continue to have that choice.</p>
