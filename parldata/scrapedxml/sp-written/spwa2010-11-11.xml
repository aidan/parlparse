  <p>The approach to broadcasting at previous Commonwealth Games has varied. At Manchester 2002, for instance, the provider of the host broadcasting function and the domestic broadcast rights holder were the same organisation. On other occasions, for example Melbourne 2006, the host broadcaster was procured separately. The budget for the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games has factored in the anticipated cost of procuring a commercial host broadcast service provider with the costs to be offset through the sale of the domestic and international broadcasting rights. Therefore, the Glasgow 2014 Organising Committee does not anticipate any negative budgetary impact or loss of sponsorship revenue from the BBC&rsquo;s decision, and the Government and its partners remain confident that the Games will be delivered within the agreed budget.</p>

  <p>I am sure the member is aware that most of the regulation that impacts on Scotland&rsquo;s farmers and land managers comes from Europe and under the terms of the Scotland Act Scottish Ministers must implement relevant EU rules.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is however committed to reducing the burden on Scotland&rsquo;s farmers and have taken effective action to ensure that happens. Our Scotland's Environmental and Rural Services (SEARS) initiative continues to improve the experience of service delivery for farmers and other rural land managers. Since its launch at Royal Highland Show 2008, SEARS has rationalised inspection activity, reduced charges, tackled bureaucracy, listened to customers, and improved access to services.</p>

  <p>The inquiry was asked to advise on how the Scottish Government's vision for agriculture could be put into practice in a future farm support system. I would like to pay tribute to Brian Pack and his committee for their excellent work on the inquiry.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government gave an initial response when the inquiry report was published on 3 November 2010. Considerable follow-up work will be needed and I will announce details shortly.</p>

  <p>As Brian Pack himself said, the development of a new farm support system will be a long process, involving lengthy European negotiations. At this stage, it is important to establish the principles underlying a new system. While we are still studying the report in detail, I can already endorse the main principles it sets out.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s Notes for Guidance on the Single Farm Payment Scheme are a bold initiative to explain what constitutes eligible / ineligible land for the purposes of claiming support. They are unique amongst the notes issued by all UK agriculture departments in the explanation of problems using photographs to illustrate the issue of eligible land for subsidy purposes. The Rural Payments and Inspections Directorate&rsquo;s (SGRPID) original plan was to have the notes issued earlier but problems were encountered in achieving a satisfactory resolution of the illustrations. The notes were issued close to the deadline for application forms but SGRPID took additional steps to clarify that farmers could correct their land declarations at any time. A significant number of farmers took the opportunity to do that and avoid possible penalties. In this way, we ensured no farmers were disadvantaged by the later delivery of these notes. For the future, lessons have been learned about starting the production process at an earlier stage.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) have confirmed that there have been no changes to the clinical criteria for their Patient Transport Service (PTS). However, as part of delivering its framework <em>Working together for better patient care 2010-1015</em> , which can be found at: <a href="http://www.scottishambulance.com/News/NewsItem.aspx?NewsID=95" target="_blank"> http://www.scottishambulance.com/News/NewsItem.aspx?NewsID=95</a> , the SAS have set up a scheduled services programme board to improve the efficiency, effectiveness and quality of service provided to patients. One of the key aims of this programme board is to improve the assessment of patient need for PTS.</p>

  <p>One of the work streams being taken forward to achieve this is a review of the clinical criteria already in place, to ensure clarity of understanding and shared ownership across the NHS and for patients, and to develop improved procedures for the application and governance of those clinical criteria. This work stream is being progressed in close collaboration with territorial NHS boards, patients, and other partners, and has been informed by the extensive feedback received by the service through the consultation exercise that informed its framework.</p>

  <p>The harvesting of gannet chicks would clearly be unlawful save for Section 16(2) of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 allows for a licence to be issued for the purpose of providing food for human consumption in relation to a gannet on the island of Sula Sgeir, if it is done under and in accordance with the terms of a licence granted by the appropriate authority.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will only consider issuing a licence where it is content that there are no animal welfare issues arising from the taking of the gannet chicks; and that the population of the gannets on Sula Sgeir remains in favourable condition; and the taking of gannet chicks would not significantly impact on their population. This population monitoring is undertaken as part of an appropriate assessment carried out by Scottish Natural Heritage. Where a licence is granted, it is for a specified number of gannet chicks and the hunt is subject to inspection for compliance with the licence conditions.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will give due consideration to the Department of Health cancer drugs fund consultation findings once they are published.</p>

  <p>Scotland has robust, equitable and transparent arrangements for the introduction of newly licensed clinically and cost-effective medicines to treat all conditions, including rare diseases. The arrangements include opportunities at local level for clinically led consideration of medicines for individual patients in certain circumstances.</p>

  <p>In appraising orphan medicines to treat rare diseases, the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) may, in addition to the standard assessment of clinical and cost-effectiveness, apply modifiers which consider other additional factors. subject to meeting certain criteria, this can facilitate acceptance of a medicine notwithstanding the economic evidence provided.

  <p>A range of measures are in place or are being further developed to ensure that staff in care homes have the skills to meet the needs of the residents.</p>

  <p>The National Care Standards require that the care and support which care home residents receive is provided by staff whose professional training and expertise allows them to meet residents' needs. Ensuring compliance with the National Care Standards is part of the Care Commission&rsquo;s inspection process.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Social Services Council (SSSC) is responsible for registering people who work in social services in Scotland and regulates their education and training. The SSSC accepts a wide range of qualifications that must meet a general set of principles of integration of practice and learning, be recognised within the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework and be consistent with the SSSC Code of Practice. Registration with the SSSC is being phased in. Nurses working in social services must be registered with the Nursing and Midwifery Council and no other registration is necessary.</p>

  <p>The National Dementia Strategy published earlier this year includes a commitment to develop a framework that sets out the skills and knowledge expected of staff in different settings, not just specialist dementia services. This is due for completion in 2011.</p>

  <p>Scottish Ministers have given a commitment of no compulsory redundancies for the period of this spending review until March 2011 and this policy applies to both HM Inspectorate of Education and Learning and Teaching Scotland staff. We expect that any necessary reductions in staffing will be achieved, where appropriate, through redeployment, natural turnover or if necessary, targeted and cost effective voluntary early retirement/ severance arrangements. The final staff complement will become clear as the detailed structure of the new agency is developed.</p>

  <p>Scottish Ministers have given the commitment to no compulsory redundancies until March 2011. However, if after transfer posts become surplus, staff will be helped to find suitable posts elsewhere in the agency, the Scottish Government or in the wider Scottish public sector in accordance with established redeployment policies and procedures. There are established protocol arrangements to allow public bodies, where specific criteria are met to allow staff to apply for posts in other Government organisations via the Cabinet Office Website (<a href="http://www.careers.civil-service.gov.uk" target="_blank">http://www.careers.civil-service.gov.uk</a>). A redeployment unit has also been set up within the Scottish Government to help secure posts in Scotland&rsquo;s public sector for any surplus staff resulting from the simplification programme or decisions made by Scottish Ministers.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is well aware of the work of Columba 1400 on supporting leadership in Scotland&rsquo;s school and has been taking an active interest in it, most recently through a meeting last month between the Chief Executive of the organisation and Scottish Government officials.

  <p>Marine Scotland and Scottish Natural Heritage have also been working closely to research the potential impacts of marine renewable energy on fish species that migrate between the freshwater and marine environments. Scottish Natural Heritage has commissioned research into the effects of electromagnetic fields and noise, arising from marine renewable energy developments, on these fish species. Marine Scotland Science has undertaken research into the migratory routes and behaviour of these species. Both research reports will be published shortly.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government currently has no plans to make extra funds available. The Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) gives due consideration to its processes on a regular basis.</p>

  <p>Scotland has a robust, equitable and transparent arrangements for the introduction of newly licensed clinically and cost-effective medicines to treat all conditions, including rare diseases. The arrangements include opportunities at local level for clinically led consideration of medicines for individual patients in certain circumstances.</p>

  <p>In appraising orphan medicines to treat rare diseases, the SMC may, in addition to the standard assessment of clinical and cost-effectiveness, apply modifiers which consider other additional factors. Subject to meeting certain criteria, this can facilitate acceptance of a medicine notwithstanding the economic evidence provided. Full details on SMC policies can be found on the SMC website at:</p>

  <p>1. Community health partnerships are not separate statutory bodies. They are committees or sub-committees of NHS boards and are accountable for their performance to NHS boards. Where an NHS board and local authority have established a community health and care partnership then both the NHS board and local authority monitor their performance.</p>

  <p>2. The Scottish Government commissioned independent research into the progress that community health partnerships and community health and care partnerships have made since their inception. The report was published in May 2010.</p>

  <p>Health and safety at work is a reserved matter and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) is responsible for regulating health and safety in Scotland. Nevertheless the Scottish Government wants to see greater awareness of health and safety issues amongst Scotland&rsquo;s farming communities. There has been recent contact at official level between the HSE, the NHS Centre for Healthy Working Lives and the partners in Scotland&rsquo;s Environmental and Rural Services to explore ways in which the HSE can be supported in raising awareness of health and safety in rural Scotland.</p>

  <p>The latest official figures show that there are around 285,300 dwellings owned and managed by local authorities that are considered to be normal letting stock. It is expected that all the households currently occupying these dwellings have either preserved rights, modernised rights, or are serving the five year qualifying period leading to modernised right to buy eligibility. The breakdown of data for these categories is currently not held centrally. The Scottish Government is however working with local authorities to explore the possibility of collecting this breakdown and improving the information in this area.</p>

  <p>In addition to local authority tenants, registered social landlords have reported to the Scottish Housing Regulator that, as at 31 March 2010, 150,600 of their 265,400 tenancies qualify for either preserved or modernised right to buy. This figure can be broken down to show that 68,800 have preserved rights and 81,800 have modernised rights. The remainder are either exempt or are serving the qualifying period leading to modernised right to buy eligibility.</p>

  <p>No. There is a commitment to no compulsory redundancies in NHSScotland. If individual boards choose to approve redundancies on a voluntary basis they would be responsible for identifying and justifying the costs incurred. Any such costs would depend entirely on individual circumstances.</p>

  <p>The SPPF was first launched across Scotland in April 2007. The SPPF is the product of significant collaborative working between the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland, the eight Scottish police forces, the Scottish Government, Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Constabulary for Scotland, Audit Scotland, the Scottish Police Authorities Conveners&rsquo; Forum and the Scottish Police Services Authority.</p>

  <p>When the SPPF was introduced in 2007-08, it was constrained by the limited amount of consistent data that was available across police forces and had only 23 indicators. Since then, the stakeholders listed above have worked together to develop a more comprehensive suite of indicators.</p>

  <p>The importance of play in childhood development is supported by a robust body of research and we believe that playgroups have an important role to play. This is reflected in the Early Years Framework, which was developed by the Scottish Government, COSLA and a wide range of key stakeholders. We have ongoing dialogue with COSLA, with local authorities and their community planning partners on implementation of the framework.</p>

  <p>It is up to local authorities to work with their partners in the private and voluntary sectors to provide play-based services to meet the needs of local communities. There is no direct or ring-fenced funding of playgroups by the Scottish Government and we have no plans to undertake an audit of local funding. The Care Commission inspects playgroups which provide services for over two hours a day and for six days or more each year under the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act (2001).</p>

  <p>No decision has been taken to introduce generic substitution in NHSScotland. It has long been the Scottish Government&rsquo;s policy to encourage generic prescribing wherever clinically appropriate. This policy has resulted in a high generic prescribing rate. In 2009-10 in Scotland, 83% of prescription items were prescribed generically in primary care. Maximising the use of generic medicines is an area where there may be further opportunities to make cost savings for the NHS and, at present, officials are in discussion with a number of key stakeholders to examine ways to support the use of generic medicines in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Decisions on the future of any local authority owned building, including community centres are solely at the discretion of each individual local authority. The Scottish Government has no locus to intervene. However, the Scottish Government awarded &pound;250,000 in 2009 to the Development Trust Association Scotland (DTAS) to undertake a national two year programme of work to explore the benefits and risks involved in asset transfer. The findings from this will help local authorities fully consider their options.</p>

  <p>The Microgeneration Certification Scheme (MCS) is an independent scheme that certifies microgeneration products and installers in accordance with consistent standards. It is designed to evaluate microgeneration products and installers against robust criteria providing greater protection for consumers.</p>

  <p>However, the MCS is voluntary and the choice of whether or not to participate is for each installer and manufacturer to make. As mentioned in my answer to question S3W-37215 on 11 November 2010, it is a statutory requirement of the Feed-In Tariff (FIT) that products and installers must be accredited under the Microgeneration Certification Scheme in order to qualify for the FIT. It would seem therefore that there is now a clear incentive for these businesses to consider pursuing accreditation.</p>

  <p>Road safety cameras were introduced in 1990. Reported road accidents fell by 43% between 1990 and 2009, all severity injuries fell by 45% and road fatalities fell by 60%. These reductions will be due to a number of factors (including road safety education and engineering initiatives) and not the introduction of road safety cameras alone.</p>

  <p>The Schools (Consultation) (Scotland) Act 2010 gives parents, parent councils and community councils a central role in the consultation process associated with a school closure proposal, as mandatory consultees. The Act also provides for a three week period, after a local authority has published its consultation report, for these groups, and anyone else with an interest, to make representations to the decision makers before they can meet to take a final decision. It does not however prescribe whether or not these groups are allowed to appear before the local authority when they are taking the decision on a closure proposal; that is entirely a matter for the relevant local authority to determine, bearing in mind the obligation of all elected bodies to be accessible, open and transparent in their decision making.</p>

  <p>In accordance with Standing Order 9.3.2 all the bills highlighted by the member were accompanied by a Financial Memorandum on introduction. Each memorandum sets out the best estimates of the administrative, compliance and other costs to which the provisions of the bill would give rise, best estimates of the timescales over which costs would be expected to arise, and an indication of the margins of uncertainty in such estimates. The memorandum distinguishes separately where the costs fell upon the Scottish Government, local authorities and other bodies.</p>

  <p>Financial Memorandums are published by the Parliament alongside each bill.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not support the decision of the UK Government.</p>

  <p>The Security Industry Authority (SIA) has been working very well in Scotland and the Scottish Government made a very strong case to the UK Government for its continuation as the independent body responsible for regulating the private security industry.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is clear that the regulation of the private security industry will continue in Scotland and that regulation has been a vital tool in tackling serious organised crime groups which are active in this industry. The Scottish Government will continue to work with the industry, the SIA, the UK Government, law enforcement agencies and other partners until a new regulatory regime is in place.</p>

  <p>I responded on behalf of the Scottish Government on 13 September 2010 setting out my concerns about the UK Government&rsquo;s proposals and strongly emphasising the need for continued regulation of the private security industry in Scotland.</p>

  <p>These views were also set out in a letter that I wrote to the Deputy Prime Minister on 24 September 2010, and in a further letter to the Home Secretary following my meeting with Scottish security industry representatives on 13 October 2010.</p>

  <p>The Minister for Children and Early Years and I expect to make an announcement in November 2010 about the appointment of the Chairperson of Social Care and Social Work Improvement Scotland (SCSWIS).</p>

  <p>Interviews will be held later this month for the post of chief executive and we will announce that appointment shortly thereafter along with the date when the new chief executive will take up post.</p>

  <p>I can confirm that the planned launch of SCSWIS on 1 April 2011 is on schedule.</p>

  <p>The Minister for Children and Early Years and I have agreed the approach to developing the new organisation over three years as part of the draft operating plan for the new organisation. The transition team is now developing the draft business plan including an interim structure and is making progress on procedures for matching senior management and staff into SCSWIS. As part of this work on-going consultation is being held with the SCSWIS partnership forum and senior staff of the existing bodies.</p>

  <p>Final decisions on the budget and staffing for the new body cannot be made until later this month when the outcome of the spending review is announced. However once known, we expect the senior management team to be appointed and take up their posts in the shadow organisation in the coming weeks.</p>

  <p>In line with our government&rsquo;s aim of developing more proportionate and risk-based scrutiny we expect SCSWIS to have a smaller budget and fewer staff than the bodies and part of HM Inspectorate of Education that are being merged to create it. However, until the outcome of the spending review is known we cannot forecast SCSWIS actual budget or what level of job losses might be required in the first three years of the new body.</p>
