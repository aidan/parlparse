  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what response it will give to the comments of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Ministry of Defence, Dr Lewis Moonie on 27 June 2000, that there had been negligence on the part of the pilots leading to the crash of the RAF Chinook Helicopter on the Mull of Kintyre in 1994; whether it will review its own previous declared position that the findings of the fatal accident inquiry should stand, and whether it will make representations to Her Majesty&#8217;s Government on this issue.</p>

  <p>I would refer to the answer given in question S1W-8286.</p>

  <p>My responsibilities in relation to this tragedy were to ask Crown Counsel to consider the other information published since the Fatal Accident Inquiry in 1996. Crown Counsel concluded that there was no basis for seeking to re-open the Fatal Accident Inquiry, even if such a step were legally competent.</p>

  <p>I have no other responsibility in relation to the tragedy, other than under the Fatal Accidents and Sudden Deaths Inquiry (Scotland) Act 1976. The Ministry of Defence are aware of my decision in this matter.</p>

  <p>Fares concessions are a commercial matter for Caledonian MacBrayne. I understand that this particular concession was introduced following discussions between the company and the National Farmers Union of Scotland.</p>

  <p>Decisions on the specification for tendering, including the possible incorporation of the concessions currently operated by Caledonian MacBrayne, will be taken by the Scottish Executive in due course.

  <p>The information requested is not available.

Information on the CCL is being disseminated by way of seminars; other business events, press articles, the SEEO website and the Enterprise Network. The SEEO is also working with the major energy suppliers in Scotland with a view to sending information on the CCL to their business customers.</p>

  <p>Statutory guidance on exclusion from, and apportionment of, liability for remediation is set out in Chapter D of the guidance, which was laid before Parliament on 25 May.

  <p>The UK Government announced on 20 April proposals to set from 1 August 2000 maximum prices for generic drugs. The consultation period ended on 24 May and the department has subsequently undertaken a further limited consultation with the industry on revised maximum prices.</p>

  <p>It is currently estimated that if the proposals were introduced in their current form the potential savings to the drugs bill in Scotland would be approximately &pound;20 million annually. These savings would accrue directly to health boards through their unified budget allocation and it is for boards and Trusts to apply all funds in the light of locally determined priorities.</p>

  <p>It is widely recognised that, next to smoking, diet is the most important contributor to poor health, and that overweight or obesity is the main problem in Scotland as opposed to under nourishment. The Scottish Diet Action Plan provides the framework within which the Executive is tackling Scotland&#8217;s poor diet.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has issued guidance on core nutritional standards and has asked that they be applied in nursing homes and in all NHS care facilities by health boards and NHS Trusts. In addition, the Clinical Resource and Audit Group (CRAG) has funded an audit of the nutrition of elderly people to assess and improve the quality of nutritional care provided to elderly people living in a variety of NHS and non-NHS settings. This study included the development of a nutrition education pack and nutrition action plan toolkit to raise staff awareness. The results of the study will be published shortly and it is planned to hold a series of meetings throughout Scotland to feedback the results and reinforce the existing standards and guidance to NHS and social services managers and staff. In March, the Health Education Board for Scotland launched a training package for healthcare staff, which is available through <i>HEBSWeb</i>, and a resource will be available later this year for healthcare staff to give to patients, including children, on obesity and weight management.</p>

  <p>When considering the membership of the National Steering Group, I was keen to ensure that the group contained representatives of the relevant housing interests. Both the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations were invited to nominate appropriate individuals to serve on the group. As it is the organisation who are the members of the steering group they are free to circulate the group papers throughout their organisations and to change their nomination at any point, for example, if they wish to involve representatives from other areas of Scotland or to reflect the specific issues to be discussed at the group. I have no plans to extend the number of members represented on the group.</p>

  <p>Local authorities currently have powers under section 66 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1988, to offer grants to qualifying tenants of the authority to assist them to purchase a house in the private sector. Where a local authority decides to operate such a scheme it is required to find the resources from within its capital allocation for the year in which payments are to be made.</p>

  <p>The Executive is currently considering the precise funding mechanisms that will apply to any cash incentives provided to tenants of social landlords in line with the proposals set out in paragraph 42 of the Consultation Paper <i>Better Homes for Scotland&#8217;s Communities - The Executive&#8217;s proposals for the Housing Bill</i>.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-7983 by Ms Wendy Alexander on 15 June 2000, whether housing associations will have to apply to Scottish Homes or the Scottish Executive when seeking exemption from the modernised right to buy for up to 10 years; whether housing associations themselves will be empowered to select the length of time, within the 10-year period for which properties will remain exempt, and whether there will be any facility for the 10-year period to be extended by further application in circumstances where the financial viability of landlords is still felt to be threatened.</p>

  <p>Our proposals as set out in the Consultation Paper, <i>Better Homes for Scotland&#8217;s Communities: The Executive&#8217;s Proposals for the Housing Bill</i> envisage that it will be for housing associations themselves to decide, over the 10-year period, if and when to offer their tenants the modernised right to buy and that once a decision to &quot;opt in&quot; had been made, the modernised right to buy would continue to be available for the remainder of the 10-year period. We do not envisage that the exemption period should be extended beyond 10 years.</p>

  <p>Section 74(2) of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 ensures that council tax payers obtain value for their assets, affords a measure of protection to the authority against charges of discrimination between purchasers and precludes the award of hidden subsidies. Our usual policy has been to grant applications for dispensation under section 74(2) if the intending buyer or lessee is performing some kind of charitable or public service function and where it could reasonably be argued that the buyer could not afford the full market price.</p>

  <p>Under this section, two requests have been turned down. These are:</p>

  <p>North Lanarkshire Council requested consent to dispose of a former play area at Roman Road, Motherwell to the Roman Road Gospel Hall (RRGH) at less than market value. The council stated that RRGH had informed them that the public benefit gained from the proposal would be that the cars currently parked on Roman Road would be removed to the car park. We felt that this did not justify selling a public asset at less than full market value. The council also stated in their original application that the reason the council were selling the land to the Gospel Hall was to allow them to expand their facilities. In later correspondence it was confirmed that the Gospel Hall had since indicated to the council by letter that they have no intention to expand, thus rendering the councils original reason for selling the land to RRGH redundant. Consent was refused on 16 May 2000.</p>

  <p>Orkney Islands council requested consent to dispose of land to the executors of a Mr Cecil Copland at less than market value. This was due to the original sale to Mr Copland, in 1977, not going ahead because of an oversight by the council. Since 1977 Mr Copland had been using the land. When he died his executors stated that, although the payment had not gone through the land belonged to Mr Copland and only the originally agreed price would need to be paid. Because of the period of time the price of the land had risen so selling at the original price would need section 74 consent. We asked the council what public benefit would be gained from this sale and they replied by stating that they could not see any public benefit in selling the land to the above parties. Although the case was an unusual one, we could not grant consent to dispose of a public asset if there was no clear benefit to the public. The fault lay with both parties in that each failed to pursue the sale to its proper conclusion. Consent was refused on 22 May 2000.</p>

  <p>These are the only applications refused consent under section 74 since 1 July 1999.</p>

  <p>Requests for consent to dispose of <u>land</u> at less than best price are considered under section 74(2) of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. In addition, if the land is held on the Housing Revenue Account (HRA), consent in terms of section 12(7) of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 will also be required.</p>

  <p>Requests for consent to dispose of <u>housing</u> held on the Housing Revenue Account at less than best price are considered under section 12(7) of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 (section 12(10) disapplies section 74(2) of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973).</p>

  <p>No requests have been turned down under section 12(7) since 1 July 1999.</p>

  <p>The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) has made no announcement about beta interferon as its appraisal process is still running. NICE have sent their draft conclusions for comment in strict confidence to a number of interested parties, including patient groups. The Scottish Executive has not received the draft conclusions from NICE and, until the process under way is complete, we cannot speculate on what might be in the draft.</p>

  <p>At present local Drug and Therapeutic Committees provide advice to clinicians in their health board on the use of beta interferon in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. To provide a single national focus for this advice, I recently wrote to the Health Technology Board asking them to provide advice on the clinical and cost-effectiveness of beta interferon as a treatment for multiple sclerosis as an early priority.</p>

  <p>The NHS complaints procedure, introduced in 1996, is designed to be independent of the NHS and Ministers. A UK-wide evaluation of the procedure is being carried out by an independent group of researchers - The York Health Economics Consortium. Their report is expected in January 2001.</p>

  <p>One of the issues the researchers have been asked to consider is whether and how the complaints procedure, including its &quot;independence&quot;, can be improved. The NHS complaints procedure (especially the independent review panel) is not perceived by the public to be independent. This will be one of the considerations which will be taken into account once the evaluation has been completed, and in planning the future development of the system.</p>

  <p>I announced on 2 May that an additional &pound;60 million would be allocated to health boards (including the Scottish Ambulance Service and the Common Services Agency). Boards were asked to demonstrate how their share of the extra funds would bring real benefits to patient services. Following analysis and evaluation of local plans, I confirmed the release of additional allocations on 30 June.</p>

  <p>The 210 new specialist nursing posts will be filled mostly by nurses already in the NHS in Scotland. The resulting vacant posts will be filled by newly recruited nurses. The start of the specialist training programmes and the recruitment of the new nurses are both scheduled to take place in September 2000.</p>

  <p>The 110 new posts for doctors will be filled as soon as possible. The Scottish Council for Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education has already taken the necessary steps to start the recruitment process for training grade doctors. For some grades the timing of this process is constrained by the structure of training rotations and by graduation dates. I expect the posts to be filled within the current financial year.</p>

  <p>The latest data available refers to consultant and staff grades at the annual notification of vacancies at 30 September 1999, which is collected by ISD Scotland. At 30 September 1999 there were no unfilled consultant or staff grade posts in clinical and medical oncology. Only consultant and staff grade vacancies are recorded. Information on vacancies for junior doctors is collected on a regional level and are not held centrally.</p>

  <p>We are committed to increasing the number of doctors in the NHS in Scotland, particularly in the area of cancer treatment. That is why I have recently announced a package of additional investment in the workforce which includes provision for new consultant doctors in cancer services.</p>

  <p>There is an element of double counting as some doctors hold more than one contract.</p>

  <p>The table shows all doctors, except locums, working in the NHS in Scotland. It includes both career and training grades working in Hospital Services, Primary Care Services, Public Health Medicine and Community Services, including those with honorary contracts.</p>

  <p>The National Asset Register (NAR) was published in November 1997 to provide a picture at a point in time of the assets owned by central government departments, their executive agencies, executive non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs), health bodies and other sponsored bodies. The NAR did not cover the assets of local authorities since their assets belong to them and not to central government.</p>

  <p>The different groups have continued to maintain their own fixed asset registers and the published accounts of agencies, NDPBs, NHS Trusts, health boards and public corporations provide information on the assets held and the movements during each year. The resource accounts of the Scottish Executive for 1999-2000 when audited and published will provide similar levels of disclosure.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not hold this information. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) collects data annually in the New Earnings Survey and has supplied the information shown in the tables below. Further information on earnings can be obtained directly from ONS.</p>

  <p>Table 1 shows the percentage increases in gross weekly earnings<sup>1</sup> in (a) the public sector and (b) all sectors for Scotland, England and Great Britain over the period for which comparable data is available. UK figures and estimates for future years are not available. Table 2 shows the average gross weekly earnings figures for 1986, the earliest year for which information is available.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is aware of the planning application for an IKEA store at Braehead. Should Glasgow City Council be minded to grant planning permission for the development, the application will require to be notified to the Scottish Ministers as it comprises retail floorspace in excess of 10,000 square metres and because a neighbouring council has made representations to the effect that planning permission should not be granted.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. Mr Cameron&#8217;s response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Reducing drug misuse in Scottish prisons is not simply a matter of numbers of personnel. The continuous development and introduction of technical security measures, including the use of drug detection dogs, also has an important part to play, as does treatment and counselling of drug users. The SPS has established targets for reducing the number of positive drug tests on an annual basis and for increasing the proportion of the SPS that is drug free. The recently revised SPS Drug Strategy, launched by the Deputy Justice Minster on 8 June, includes the appointment of drug co-ordinators in all Scottish prisons and is designed to build on the positive progress the SPS has made.</p>

  <p>The European Court of Justice decision on whether VAT should be levied on toll charges is not expected before 12 September. The UK Government and the devolved administrations are at present considering the likely consequences if the court were not to find in favour of the United Kingdom.</p>

  <p>When I made public the DTZ Pieda Socio-Economic Impact Evaluation of the Skye Bridge on 22 June 2000, I also indicated that I had asked officials to investigate the cost and practical implications of ending the date stamping on books of discount tickets. This investigation is proceeding.</p>

  <p>The Rural Community Transport Grant Scheme applies to community transport activities in settlements with populations of 10,000 or less, although applications would be eligible if the project involved travel to towns with a population of over 10,000 provided the project was for the benefit of a rural area. There are no plans to extend the scheme to include urban areas. Local authorities can make grants in relation to the provision of community transport services in urban areas.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what is being done to address the increase of 5.5% in 1998 in the number of notifications of tuberculosis.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-07-13.S1W-8123.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80146" speakername="Susan Deacon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa0713.htm#8123">

  <p>The number of cases of tuberculosis in Scotland has been comparatively low and relatively stable in the 1990s, with no suggestion of an upward trend. The increase of 5.5% in 1998 is likely to be due to natural random variations in incidence. In 1999, the provisional number of notified cases is 373, slightly lower than 1998.</p>

  <p>In 1998, a comprehensive guidance document on the management and control of tuberculosis, <i>The Control of Tuberculosis in Scotland</i>, was issued to health professionals.</p>

  <p>In February 1999, a letter to health professionals from the Executive&#8217;s Health Department drew attention to new UK guidelines on the prevention and control of HIV-related tuberculosis and drug-resistant, including multiple drug-resistant, tuberculosis.</p>

  <p>The Executive is funding the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health (SCIEH) to carry out enhanced surveillance of tuberculosis in Scotland. This surveillance scheme was introduced in January 2000 and is intended to provide fuller information, to enable better targeting of interventions and better control of the disease in future.</p>
