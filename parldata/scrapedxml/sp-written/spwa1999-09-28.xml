  <p>Of the &pound;1,101 million allocated to Social Work &pound;5.1 million is intended to assist carers and provide respite care. In addition &pound;5 million is being made available to authorities conditional on each undertaking to implement the recommendations of <i>Modernising Community Care: An Action Plan</i> , including the development of respite services. The bulk of the Social Work allocation is for services for specific client groups: carers of individuals in these client groups will benefit directly or indirectly from the services provided.</p>

  <p>We are aware of the concerns that carers and carers&#8217; organisations have over funding of carers services by local authorities. We have been considering this in the context of the National Carers Strategy and will be announcing shortly details of how the Carers&#8217; Strategy will be taken forward in Scotland.</p>

  <p>New Community Schools bring together in a single team professionals from a range of services. Most of the 37 pilot New Community Schools projects currently operating actively involve the police and recognise the police service as an important partner in taking the initiative forward. However, diversity and local ownership are key to the New Community Schools initiative. The nature and extent of police involvement is therefore primarily for local management to determine, in response to local needs.</p>

Figures for 1 August 1998 to 31 July 1999 are currently being collected and will not be available for several months. As information on the date of receipt is not collected, the number of placing requests received between May and July 1997 is not centrally available.</p>

  <p>For the period 1 August 1997 to 31 July 1998 the number of placing requests received in Scotland is as follows:</p>

  <p>Initial estimates by the Scottish water authorities suggest that fluoridating the water supplies where it is possible to do so, serving the majority of the population, would imply capital expenditure in the order of &pound;29 million and annual running costs of &pound;4 million. It is not practical technically to fluoridate some 15 per cent of public water supplies in Scotland. Some 2-3 per cent of the population are served by private water supplies. These costs might vary considerably if fluoridation schemes were introduced at local level at different times. The costs of consulting the public, for example, by local opinion polls, prior to the introduction of any fluoridation scheme will be determined once the arrangements for public consultation have been agreed.</p>

The discharge of its homelessness responsibilities is an operational decision for the local council. Homelessness is one of four national priorities which local authorities are expected to take into account in using their Housing Revenue Account allocations from central government. In 1998-99 North Lanarkshire Council received an HRA allocation of &pound;12.3m. The council has also been allocated &pound;810,000 under the Rough Sleepers Initiative for outreach workers and direct access accommodation in Airdrie and Motherwell; and approximately &pound;14m under the Empty Homes Initiative which should lead to more than 100 empty homes being brought back into use.</p>

  <p>No comprehensive list of statutory bars exists. The White Paper on Open Government (Cm 2290) published in July 1993 identified some 200 Acts which prohibited disclosure of information. If information requested under the Code of Practice on Access to Scottish Executive Information fell under a statutory bar the public authority would be expected to detail which Act or regulation prevented its disclosure.</p>
