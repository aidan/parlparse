  <p>Any decision to install a Noise and Track Keeping system at Aberdeen airport is a matter for the owner of the airport, BAA Scottish Airports, in consultation with local representatives and airport users. There is no present intention to designate Aberdeen Airport for the purposes of Section 78 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982 which would be necessary to empower the Executive to require the installation of such a system.</p>

  <p>BAA Scottish Airports works closely with the National Air Traffic Services (NATS) to monitor noise and track keeping and, as part of its application to remove operating restrictions at Aberdeen airport, BAA is committed to a night period noise management plan.</p>

  <p>A new ISO (International Organisation for Standardisation) standard on <em>Acoustics &ndash; unattended monitoring of aircraft sound in the vicinity of airports</em> is currently under development. This will allow a more accurate determination of noise levels. The Scottish Executive has no plans to make representations on the new standard. It is a technical matter and any Scottish comments are being co-ordinated by the Civil Aviation Authority&rsquo;s Environmental Research and Consultancy Department for submission through the British Standards Institute.</p>

  <p>The International Civil Aviation Organisation standards and procedures for the noise certification of aircraft are subject to review from time to time and, in this context also, technical advice on UK representations will be a task primarily for the Civil Aviation Authority.</p>

  <p>Clinicians have access to standard diagnostic criteria and a multitude of assessment tools for the diagnosis of dementia. These include consideration of intellectual and behavioural functions. Updated best practice clinical guidelines on dementia will be published by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network this summer.</p>

  <p>While the carer&rsquo;s role is always taken into account in the assessments of those with dementia, there are no specific standards for carers&rsquo; assessments of people with dementia.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no direct expenditure on advertising or other publicity since 1999 to date but has contributed to a number of initiatives aimed at increasing skin cancer awareness.</p>

  <p>For example, NHS health boards provide information on sun safety and safe use of tanning beds and last year NHS Health Scotland produced a <em>Sun Safe Protection</em> <em>Tips</em> publication for use by health boards, community pharmacies, VisitScotland, Thomas Cook and Scottish airports.</p>

  <p>Also, the Scottish Executive, in partnership with the other UK health departments supports the Cancer Research UK skin cancer prevention campaign SunSmart. The Scottish Executive contribution has been &pound;10,000 in 2003-04, &pound;17,000 in 2004-05 and &pound;17,000 planned for 2005-06.</p>

  <p>The primary responsibility for the delivery and management of the teaching of swimming within the curriculum rests with local authorities.</p>

  <p>The audit of school swimming provision conducted by Scottish Enterprise Education Department in 2001-02 revealed variations across Scotland. In response to this report, the Scottish Executive commissioned Learning Teaching Scotland to prepare and disseminate a report which would raise awareness of the barriers to providing swimming in Scotland and highlight best practice. This report is in its final stages of preparation and will be issued to local authorities within the next few months.</p>

  <p>The cost of teacher time spent on pupil discipline has not been estimated. It is difficult to quantify how much staff time (including teachers, headteachers and support staff) is spent on promoting positive behaviour, in the form of policy development, staff development and whole school approaches, and responding to indiscipline when it occurs.</p>

  <p>In the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s <em>Policy Update on Promoting Positive Behaviour in Scottish Schools</em> (October 2004), information was provided on the time spent by headteachers on promoting positive behaviour and responding to indiscipline.</p>

  <p>Sixty-seven per cent of primary headteachers report they spend less than 10% of their time on dealing with indiscipline problems, and 52% of secondary headteachers spend less than 10% of their time on dealing with indiscipline problems.</p>

  <p>In the same survey reported in the <em>Policy Update</em>, less than half of primary teachers (46%) and primary headteachers (40%) report they are spending more time than they used to on discipline problems. In secondary schools, more than two-thirds of teachers (69%) and just over half of secondary headteachers (53%) feel they are spending more time on discipline problems.</p>

  <p>The Physical Education Review Group (PERG) was set up by Scottish ministers as a direct result of the recommendations in <em>Let&rsquo;s Make Scotland More Active</em> . In my response to the PERG report, I set out my three key aims for physical education: to provide more time, more teachers and more choice.</p>

  <p>Within the wider programme of achieving these key aims, Learning and Teaching Scotland (LTS) held four regional seminars in March, for local authorities and schools, to raise awareness of the PERG report and my commitment to two hours of PE. The seminars provided a platform to: discuss the key issues; demonstrate a few examples of good practice, and encourage schools to start developing solutions to meet local circumstances. LTS will now build on this by working with HMIe to gather and disseminate best practice delivery of two hours quality and progressive PE programmes. We have also begun discussions with providers of continuous professional development to provide additional opportunities for primary teachers to enhance their qualifications to support more physical activity in schools.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has received any representations regarding the single survey scheme, in particular regarding the merit of the scheme if a survey is three months old or more, and, if so, who the representations were from and what views were expressed in respect of the length of time for which such surveys should be valid.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-04-11.S2W-15573.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80018" speakername="Malcolm Chisholm" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa0411.htm#13">

  <p>In its final report in 2003, the Housing Improvement Task Force recommended that there should be no prescribed &quot;shelf life&quot; for the single survey on the basis that a surveyor can be expected to assess the condition of a property only at the time when survey is carried out. This is similar to the current position when surveys are commissioned by buyers.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive consultation paper on proposals for the Housing Bill included a question on time limits for surveys. Eighty-six percent of those who responded on this point said that there should be a time limit on single surveys. Of those who agreed that there should be a time limit over 60% proposed that the time limit should be six months or less. A further quarter of respondents to this question said that the maximum time limit on the validity of a single survey should be one year.</p>

  <p>Some respondents, for example the National Association of Estate Agents and the Law Society, suggested that a compulsory time limit on single surveys would place financial pressures on sellers particularly in areas where the market is less active.</p>

  <p>The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors expressed strong opposition to any time limit, noting that a survey is a &quot;snapshot&quot; of the property at the time of the inspection. It also pointed out that there are risks in relying on old information.</p>

  <p>The Council of Mortgage Lenders argued that it would be difficult to be prescriptive about a time limit. It expressed the view that in areas where there is a buoyant market, such as Edinburgh, the valuation might change significantly over a three-month period. However, in less active areas a valuation might not change significantly over a six or even a nine-month period.</p>

  <p>From our discussions with the parties mentioned above, we are not aware of any changes to these views on this issue. We will work closely with all stakeholders on this and other issues to deliver an effective scheme.</p>

  <p>I was pleased to announce on 14 March 2005 that the Justice Department would provide MOJO (Scotland) with funding of a total of &pound;103,000 over the next two years.

  <p>As a public member of Network Rail the Scottish Executive would not make individual representations to the Remunerations Committee. Collectively, members perform a corporate governance role and can hold the Network Rail Board to account for its management of Network Rail.</p>

  <p>This includes reviewing the performance of Network Rail against its commercial and other targets, as well as against railway industry benchmarks for the provision, maintenance and management of the railway infrastructure. However, responsibility for Network Rail&rsquo;s license remains a matter for the Office of the Rail Regulator.</p>

  <p>Amey Infrastructure Services is contractually required to clear litter and other debris from motorways and special roads in accordance with the standards laid down in the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and the associated Code of Practice on Litter and Refuse. The clearance of litter on all other trunk roads is the responsibility of the appropriate local authority.</p>

  <p>Amey is responsible for litter clearance on the M8 motorway between Glasgow and West Ferry, Junction 31. The route from Junction 31 to Greenock is designated the A8 trunk road and litter clearance from this route is the responsibility of the appropriate local authority, in this case Inverclyde Council.</p>

  <p>Amey&rsquo;s performance in litter removal is subject to regular scrutiny by the independent performance audit group&rsquo;s field engineers through their regular route inspections. Any aspect which falls below the required standard results in a requirement for corrective action to be taken within set timescales.</p>

  <p>The following table gives the information provided by local authorities in 2004. However it should be noted that safer routes to school is a generic term and some activities were reported under a school travel plan banner. One authority stated that whilst a considerable amount of school travel activity was being undertaken it was not in a position to identify this as a specific number of schemes.</p>

  <p>I have recently commissioned research to review the role of school travel co-ordinators. The research will include a survey of the number of schools with school travel plans in place. The report is expected to be published in August this year.</p>

  <p>Every local authority in Scotland now has at least one school travel plan co-ordinator in post.</p>

  <p>The Transport (Scotland) Bill currently being considered by Parliament includes provisions for the drawing up of regional transport strategies. Each strategy will need to consider the current and future provision of transport within the region and set out practical and affordable plans for its improvement. School travel needs should be included in this consideration, particularly where this impacts on regional rather than purely local travel. The Scottish ministers will issue, later this year, guidance to regional transport partnerships on the development of regional transport strategies.</p>

  <p>Schools have a duty to equip young people to be responsible citizens. Addressing sectarianism is part of this process, in the same way that schools already address other forms of prejudice and discrimination. We have therefore produced an anti-sectarian education resource, <em>Don&rsquo;t Give It, Don&rsquo;t Take It</em> , to help teachers to work with young people on issues around sectarianism and religious intolerance.</p>

  <p>The responsibility for monitoring bus operators rests with the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency of the Department for Transport (DfT). Prior to 1999 the monitoring of operators compliance with bus registrations was undertaken as required by staff from DfT&rsquo;s Scottish Traffic Area. In July 1999 two dedicated bus compliance officers were recruited to work within Scotland as part of DfT&rsquo;s Vehicle Inspectorate (now part of the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency &ndash; VOSA). Last year, the Scottish Executive agreed to fund an additional four bus compliance officers. The first two of these additional posts were filled in November 2004 and the intention is that VOSA will fill the remaining two posts later this year.</p>
