  <p>The delivery of benefits advice is an operational matter for the Benefits Agency, and is a reserved matter. However, we recognise the importance of the take-up of benefit and pension entitlement in the elimination of poverty in Scotland. We welcome current efforts to maximise take-up and are in regular contact with UK Government ministers and Departments on these and other matters.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to provide the average cost of treating patients with ovarian and breast cancer with Taxol and Taxotere because the dose used, and therefore the cost of the drugs, is determined by different factors such as the drug regimen prescribed and the patient's surface area.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what are the numbers of women reported as having breast or ovarian cancer since 1 January 2000, and how many have been prescribed Taxol and Taxotere as part of their treatment, broken down by health board area.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-04-27.5.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80146" speakername="Susan Deacon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa0427.htm#5728">

  <p>The numbers of women diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer are registered retrospectively by the Scottish Cancer Registry. The most recent complete year for which these data are available is 1997, and for which details are set out below.</p>

  <p>Taxol and Taxotere are recommended for hospital use only. Centrally collected data relates to items dispensed in the community by community pharmacists and dispensing doctors. Information about the number of women prescribed Taxol and Taxotere as part of their treatment is not therefore available centrally.</p>

  <p>Cancer is one of the top priorities for the NHS in Scotland. The overall strategy to bring about continuing improvements in the care and treatment of patients is dependent on robust quality assurance systems and reliable information which are essential to underpin the emerging cancer managed clinical networks as well as the work of the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland. Routine prospective audit systems have therefore been set in place nationwide using national recognised datasets which include information about treatment.</p>

  <p>It is a matter for each health board to determine its prescribing policy on drugs, taking into account advice from local drug and therapeutic committees. When the Health Technology Board for Scotland, established on 1 April, begins work this summer, health boards will have access to a single focus of national advice on the clinical and cost-effectiveness of health technologies, including drugs.</p>

  <p>Decisions on treatment with Taxol and Taxotere depend on the clinical judgement of the specialist experienced in the management of cancer.</p>

  <p>Economic links with the United States are extremely important. US companies have a long history of investment in Scotland. Over the last 20 years such investment has played a major role in the restructuring of the Scottish economy towards high technology industries, and has also brought new management practices and other benefits.</p>

  <p>The last ten years have seen Scotland attract over &pound;3 billion worth of planned investment by US companies, involving the creation or safeguarding of some 44,700 planned jobs. The United States are also an important market for Scottish exports. In 1998 exports from Scotland to the US amounted to some &pound;1.9 billion, (i.e. 10% of Scotland&#8217;s total exports).</p>

  <p>Strategic environmental assessment will be a valuable tool in the delivery of our <i>Programme for Government</i> commitment to delivery of sustainable development. The Ministerial Group on Sustainable Scotland has already taken significant steps to ensure that sustainable development is embedded in government and these will take effect over coming months. The EC Directive is now expected to be adopted by the end of the year. This will enable the Scottish Executive to develop a programme for implementation enabling fulfilment of our <i>Programme for Government</i> pledge.</p>

  <p>The Executive recognises that this service is an important route, though not a lifeline service.</p>

  <p>It is regrettable that Sea Containers Ltd has decided to withdraw from the route. A package of support, which was offered to Sea Containers Ltd, was developed between the Scottish Executive, the Scotland Office, Argyll and Islands Enterprise and Argyll and Bute Council which went as far as possible within the boundaries of legal constraints. This funding package may be available to another operator, and I hope that another operator can be found.</p>

  <p>The Executive cannot subsidise the service directly because assistance for ferry services which operate to destinations outwith Scotland is a reserved matter.</p>

  <p>In the period 1979 to 1997, average life expectancy increased from 74.4 to 78 years for women and from 68.2 to 72.6 years for men. But these levels remain significantly lower than those of other European countries and substantial variation exists in life expectancy between the rich and the poor, with that gap having widened since the mid-1980s.</p>

  <p>In consequence, the White Paper, <i>Towards A Healthier Scotland</i>, which was endorsed by the Scottish Parliament last September, sets out a wide-ranging programme of action to improve Scotland&#8217;s health. It gives full recognition to the impact on health of poverty and deprivation. Enhanced health education, with a specific focus on health inequalities, is a key component of the strategy and is now being taken forward, enthusiastically, by the Health Education Board for Scotland and health board Health Promotion Departments.</p>

  <p>Protection is available from a variety of sources. Firstly, consumers may seek legal advice on the terms under which they agree to purchase a property. They are protected in their purchase by consumer legislation (which is a reserved matter) and by the common law of contract and delict; conditions in the missives of sale, for example, continue to apply after the purchase. They can also seek a warranty in respect of a new house: the Government has encouraged the sale of new houses to be accompanied by warranties, such as those provided through the National House Building Council. They are also protected by the Property Misdescriptions Act 1991, which makes it an offence for an estate agent, builder or solicitor to give any description of a property that is not truthful, and by the Building Standards (Scotland) Regulations 1990 as amended with which developers of new houses have to comply.</p>

  <p>Copies of the consultation document have been distributed in response to all requests received from members of the public and interest groups who contacted the Scottish Executive. All requests have been logged. Over 2,500 copies have now been distributed. All Community Councils in the proposed National Parks areas were sent copies. We had no plans to extend the consultation period: this would inevitably have delayed the introduction of the Bill into Parliament. Copies are still available from the Scottish Executive. The text is also available on the Scottish Executive Internet website.</p>

  <p>Local communities with an interest in the Bill have therefore had a full opportunity to comment on it. In addition to the consultation on the content of the Bill, there was the previous consultation on the National Parks, conducted by Scottish Natural Heritage throughout 1998. There will of course be further opportunities for comment in the course of parliamentary consideration of the Bill, and of the formulation of National Park Designation Orders.</p>

  <p>Following advertisement in early January, we expect to appoint consultants to undertake the scoping study shortly. This phase of the corridor study is likely to take some three to four months. Subsequent timing is dependent on the findings of that study. Our present expectation is that the main study will be commissioned late this summer and will take some 18 months to complete.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive and the UK Government will shortly be publishing a road safety strategy for the period to 2010. The strategy will underpin new and challenging targets for casualty reductions, which will build on the progress already made. Fatal and serious casualties in Scotland have halved since the early 1980s.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to ensuring that these victims have access to the support they need.</p>

  <p>We will continue to address their needs in initiatives such as the work being undertaken by the Scottish Partnership on Domestic Abuse and the action plan following the report <i>Towards a Just Conclusion</i>.</p>

  <p>The methods and criteria for the appointment of members of trust ports in Scotland are set out in <i>Modernising Trust Ports: A Guide to Good Governance</i> published in January 2000. The guidance explains that the standards apply to trust ports in Scotland. It also states that the Executive has the option to amend the standards for application in Scotland, though the Executive has no plans to do so at present.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&#8217;s relationship with the voluntary sector, including funding matters, is set out in the <i>Scottish Compact</i> , which was endorsed by this Parliament last November, and in the good practice guides that support it. The implementation of the Compact is currently being reviewed jointly by the Executive and the sector and I shall report on this to the Parliament in due course.</p>

  <p>We have consulted on the funding of local Councils for Voluntary Service as part of a wider review of CVSs and I shall shortly make an announcement on this. We have also just begun a review of the funding arrangements for the black and ethnic minority voluntary sector. Our aim is to complete the review by the autumn.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to the principles of the National Waste Strategy: Scotland, which it adopted in December last year. The strategy is a long-term plan to create a sustainable waste management system in Scotland and promotes minimisation, re-use and recycling as part of the waste hierarchy.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has supported several recycling programmes, including directly funding major materials reclamation facilities in Glasgow and East Ayrshire. The Executive is also a key player and co-funder of the REMADE project, which is investigating new uses for recycled materials. This will help to stabilise markets for recyclables and, therefore, make recycling a more economically viable activity.</p>

  <p>The powers of the Scottish water authorities to engage in activities subsidiary to the discharge of their statutory functions are granted under section 89 of the Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994. In particular, section 89(3) grants the power &quot;to do anything (whether in Scotland or elsewhere) which is calculated to facilitate, or is conducive or incidental to, the discharge of any of their functions.&quot;</p>

  <p>The Scottish water authorities are therefore empowered to pursue jointly any initiative, project or expenditure insofar as such activities meet the provisions of the Act.</p>

  <p>The figures requested are detailed below for each year since the water authorities were established. Forecast figures for 2001-02 will not be available until the charges schemes for that year are agreed. On average, domestic customers in Scotland account for around 56% of water volume supplied, and 65% of the volume of waste water treated:</p>
