  <p>No. The Scottish Office issued a circular in 1988 to Regional Councils as local roads authorities advising them of the need to undertake and fund the assessment and strengthening of relevant bridges to meet the 40 tonne standard for vehicles. In accordance with this circular local authorities have undertaken surveys of bridges from within the resources allocated to them under successive local government finance settlements, initially by the Scottish Office and latterly by the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>Estimates of the potential impact of US tariffs on the cashmere industry in the Borders were made by the industry in June, when a US announcement was expected, and were based on the industry&#8217;s order book at that time. The immediate impact of US action, now or in the future, would vary depending on the order book at the time. The Scottish Executive will continue to work hard until this threat has been lifted.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it is aware of the recent court ruling in Germany that the German Baltic Sea ferry port of Puttgarden must not be opened to competitor lines by its owner and whether it has taken any action in relation to the proposed tendering of Caledonian MacBrayne routes in response to this ruling.</p>

  <p>The Executive is aware of a recent court ruling in Germany in which the court decided that a ferry operator could remain the sole operator from a particular port owned by that operator. However, it is understood that the court has not yet given the reasons for its decision so it is not possible to comment further on this particular ruling. In the UK, the owners of all harbours and piers are legally obliged to allow any vessel to berth, providing due fees are paid (section 33 of the Harbours, Docks and Piers Clauses Act).</p>

  <p>However, the subject matter of this ruling, i.e. the exclusive use of a port, is not directly relevant to the proposed tendering of CalMac ferry services. The requirement to tender arises as a result of EC rather than domestic law.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-11-24.11.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80158" speakername="Mr Sam Galbraith" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa1124.htm#7">

  <p>The statutory requirements for ministerial approval of flood prevention schemes are there to safeguard the rights of individuals who may be adversely affected by proposed schemes. The Flood Prevention (Scotland) Act 1961 requires councils to notify those concerned about what they plan to do and show how this would affect their property.</p>

  <p>Clearly, the construction of flood defences on private land requires careful and thorough planning: the necessary studies to identify the right option can take time. However, the rate of progress towards providing protection depends initially on the efforts and priority given to flood prevention by councils.</p>

  <p>For our part, the Executive seek to progress schemes, once submitted for confirmation, as quickly as the statutory procedures allow. We do plan, however, to review the procedures to identify if improvements can be made. It is too early to be specific about the timescale involved but we shall take this forward as a matter of urgency.</p>

  <p>Funding under the Empty Homes and Rough Sleepers Initiatives was allocated on the understanding that the money would be spent in the year for which it was being sought. Therefore, no mechanism was established specifically to provide additional funding for councils to meet increased costs arising from delays in the implementation of projects. However, individual applications from councils for additional funds to cover increased costs are considered on their merits.</p>

  <p>All underspending on the Departmental Expenditure Limit will be carried forward into the following year.</p>

  <p>The drop in SAC allocated funds in 1999-2000 is explained by (a) the timing of the Capital Grant Committee&#8217;s decisions, which pushed the allocations into the following year&#8217;s accounts, and (b) the impending transfer of responsibility for film production to Scottish Screen from 1 April 2000, with the consequential movement of lottery funding, which meant that few decisions on film projects were taken in the year ending 31 March 2000. Lottery funds do not require to be allocated or spent in a particular year and can be carried forward.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive <a name="QuestionText">what its organisational structure is with regard to transport and what the remit is of each element of that structure which has a transport responsibility.</a></p>

  <p>There are six Transport Divisions covering policy and operational issues and another Division offering economic and statistical advice. All are located within the Transport and Planning Group of the Scottish Executive Development Department.</p>

  <p>I will write to Mr MacAskill with a summary of these Divisions&#8217; responsibilities and place a copy of the letter in SPICe.</p>
