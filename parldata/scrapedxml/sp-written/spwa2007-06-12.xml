  <p>During the course of this Parliament I will consider the need for secondary legislation on a range of animal health and welfare issues as proposed by the previous administration under the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006. I anticipate that regulations on the licensing of animal dealers will be laid before Parliament in the autumn. Work is also underway on animal health regulations to licence animal gatherings so as to introduce biosecurity measures for disease control purposes.</p>

  <p>Whilst I have no definite time scale in mind I will also be looking at the need for animal welfare legislation on a range of issues including the licensing of animal sanctuaries, livery yards and riding stables, the keeping of wild animals in circuses, the operation of pet fairs, the welfare of retired racing greyhounds and the use of electric shock collars.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what percentage of features within Scotland&rsquo;s Special Protection Areas or Special Areas of Conservation, classified under the EU birds or habitats directives, are in unfavourable condition; what steps it has taken to identify the management required to rectify this, and how much such measures are estimated to cost.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2007-06-12.S3W-272.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80381" speakername="Michael Russell" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-07/wa0612.htm#8">

  <p>Based on the features assessed through the Site Condition Monitoring programme so far (the following table 1), the proportions of features that are in unfavourable condition and are not recovering (the management of the site has not already been adjusted to favour the special features) are:</p>

  <p>27% of all Natura features;</p>

  <p>20% classified features on Special Protection Areas, and</p>

  <p>33% of qualifying features on Special Areas for Conservation.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has set a key target for 80% of features to be reported in favourable condition by 2008 progressing to 95% by 2010. The steps taken to identify the management required to bring the unfavourable Natura features into favourable condition are:</p>

  <p>Scottish Natural Heritage has been looking closely at the management required to bring these features into favourable condition and is actively taking forward a programme of voluntary management agreements to put this in place.</p>

  <p>Forestry Commission Scotland is drawing up an action plan for Natura features in unfavourable condition associated with woodlands within their Scottish Forestry Strategy.</p>

  <p>A programme of joint working is addressing impacts caused by grazing animals mainly on Natura sites.</p>

  <p>Public and voluntary bodies who own land are also seeking to meet the Executive target by addressing Natura features in unfavourable condition on their land.</p>

  <p>It is anticipated that funding for bringing Natura features into favourable condition will be available under the Scottish Rural Development Plan.</p>

  <p>However, despite the proactive work underway, it should be noted it is not always possible to address unfavourable condition of features by on-site changes in management. For example, seabird populations account for many of the unfavourable features on Special Protection Areas. These are thought to be influenced by external factors, such as climate change and declining fish stocks, which may require wider policy changes before recovery in condition will be achieved.</p>

  <p>Excluding those features where no on-site action can be taken, there are 258 assessed Natura features where action is required to bring about recovery. From the feature assessments still to be confirmed, Scottish Natural Heritage estimate that a further 36 features will need action. That makes the total number of unfavourable Natura features requiring action to 294.</p>

  <p>It is estimated that to put in place the appropriate management to bring these unfavourable Natura features into favourable condition, it will cost between &pound;20 to 50,000 per feature (based on experience from established Natural Care Schemes). This gives an estimate of around &pound;10 million over a five year period or &pound;2 million per year. This is for incentive based measures on terrestrial features and excludes funding needed for the management of marine sites, monitor the features on terrestrial and marine sites and staff costs.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2007-06-12.S3W-275.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80381" speakername="Michael Russell" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-07/wa0612.htm#8">

  <p>The best estimate of the costs to ensure that appropriate management is in place for Natura features to achieve favourable condition is approximately &pound;6 million a year. This figure takes account of the need to put in place appropriate management where features are in unfavourable condition as well as the need to continue to fund current expenditure commitments for management on Natura sites in order to ensure that efforts to maintain or achieve favourable condition are secured. The estimate is based on payments for terrestrial management. It does not include payment to address marine Natura features, the surveying and/or monitoring of terrestrial or marine Natura features and/or sites, nor does it include staff costs.</p>

  <p>The costs of meeting the objectives of the UK BAP in Scotland were estimated in the Defra commissioned report by GHK Consulting Ltd (2006) <em>UK Biodiversity Action Plan: Preparing Costings for Species and Habitat Action Plans</em>. This report involved a broad number of assumptions and estimates and produced a cost estimate for Scotland of &pound;135 million per annum.</p>

  <p>Annual expenditure relating to UKBAP (UK Biodiversity Action Plan) in Scotland was estimated in &quot;Updating Current and Future BAP Expenditure&quot;, produced by GHK in March 2007 to update the 2006 report, at &pound;92.3 million. The agri&ndash;environment programme accounted for about &pound;20 million (22%) of this spend in 2005-06. This had risen to &pound;35 million in 2006-07.</p>

  <p>Biodiversity action has always depended on partnership and significant funding also comes from the Wildlife and Countryside Link organisations, (&pound;23 million, 25%) Forestry Commission (&pound;20.5 million, 22%) and SNH (&pound;20 million, 22%) in 2005-06.</p>

  <p>It is not possible at this stage to estimate what proportion of Natura and UKBAP costs will be met as part of the Scottish Rural Development Plan, but agri-environment measures funded by the Executive will play an important part in delivering Natura and UKBAP objectives. The amount allocated for agri-environment measures in the new Scottish Rural Development Plan is &pound;404 million.</p>

  <p>Under the UK fishing vessel licensing regime currently managed jointly by agreement, licences which are not attached to active vessels can be established as unattached licence entitlements and remain valid for a period of up to three years. If they are not used within this time period the entitlement lapses and the licence capacity is withdrawn from the system. However, my policy objective is to seek to ensure that capacity remains as far as possible active within the industry.</p>

  <p>The Fishing Vessel Licensing Review Working Group has recommended that the period be extended to five years to allow more time for owners to seek suitable licence entitlements and assist in project planning for a new build as well as accounting for actual build time involved. Industry will be consulted on this shortly and it is hoped that the revised validity period will be implemented later this year.</p>

  <p>We consider that a time period should continue to apply for use to be made of fishing vessel licence entitlements which are not attached to active fishing vessels.</p>

  <p>The Fishing Vessel Licensing Review Working Group has recommended that the validity period for unattached licence entitlements should be increased beyond the current three year period. This increase is to provide adequate time to allow owners to secure suitable entitlements for new vessels and undertake all of the necessary project planning that is required for a new build as well as accounting for the actual build time itself. Scottish ministers accepted this recommendation for an increased time period and propose that a revised validity period of five years be implemented, subject to consultation with industry.

  <p>I am considering the issue and will make an announcement in due course.</p>

  <p>In making changes to jurisdiction limits there is a need to consider the varying interests of the different court users and strike the right balance in what any increase to the limits should be. There is a need to ensure that whatever is done to these thresholds, they are updated to a sensible level which serves the needs of users of the court system and which will have the support of the Parliament.</p>

  <p>At the pre-inquiry meeting it was estimated that the PLI report would be finalised by June 2007.

  <p>A total of 226 Rural Stewardship Scheme agreements are due to come to an end during 2007. A further year of management payments under these agreements would cost &pound;2,188,247.30.</p>

  <p>There are no plans to extend such agreements. The Rural Stewardship Scheme came to an end with the ending of the previous Scottish Rural Development Programme at the end of 2006. We cannot enter into new agri-environment commitments until the new programme is approved by the EU. Future agri-environment support will be delivered through Tiers II and III of Rural Development Contracts.</p>

  <p>There were 504 farmers and crofters who entered into an agreement under the 2006 Rural Stewardship scheme. A total of 1,842 applications were not offered funding. The cost of funding these applications would have been &pound;49.8 million.</p>

  <p>I can confirm that my ministerial colleague Michael Russell and I met with the NFUS following our meeting with the Scottish Rural Development Programme (SRDP) stakeholder group on 21 May. You may be aware that Michael Russell met with Environment Link last week.</p>

  <p>This is in line with the general engagement process we hope to develop with all stakeholders and our desire to meet and work with them in the coming weeks.

  <p>I announced during the Parliamentary Debate on the Scotland Rural Development Programme 2007-13 (SRDP) on 31 May that the rates of voluntary modulation to be applied in Scotland for the duration of that programme will be 5% in 2007, 8% in 2008, 8.5% in 2009 and 9% in 2010-12 inclusive. This will generate resources of around &pound;211 million for the programme. In addition, I announced that Cabinet had agreed that &pound;70 million should be made available to fund the programme over seven years in addition to the &pound;1.1 billion of Scottish Executive resources devoted to rural development.</p>

  <p>These sums, when added to Scotland&rsquo;s European allocation for rural development create an overall budget of around &pound;1.6 billion for the programme. This is sufficient to deliver the programme defined by officials in consultation with stakeholders under the previous administration and our manifesto commitment to a new entrants scheme.</p>

  <p>We shall be investing &pound;254 million in improving competitiveness of the agricultural and forestry sectors, &pound;1,124 million on improving the environment and countryside through land management, &pound;180 million on improving the quality of life through diversification of economic activity and &pound;37 million through LEADER.</p>

  <p>The crucial issue for us, as the new Scottish Government, was to deliver a balanced programme, which was sufficiently funded to deliver environmental, social and economic benefits, without threatening an already fragile farming industry. I believe we have done that and there is something in the programme for everyone. This does not mean however, that we are complacent and we shall consider whether the programme needs to be amended in the course of the next seven years.</p>

  <p>The new organisational structure has led to some changes in roles and responsibilities. Some redeployment has already taken place. For example a small number of staff have moved to other roles as a result of the reduction in the number of ministerial private offices. As work continues to implement the new structure it is likely that there will need to be some further redeployment activity but it is not anticipated that the numbers involved will be significant.</p>

  <p>I know that there have been many representations to the Scottish Government on the environmental requirements to be included in the new Scotland Rural Development Programme 2007-13 (SRDP). That was evidenced by the responses to the consultations that were held last year on the strategic plan and the SRDP.</p>

  <p>The consultation on the SRDP received 259 responses. Of these responses, 50 (19%) were identified as representative organisations, including from environmental bodies. The consultation on the strategic plan produced 107 responses with nine from representative organisations. An analysis of these responses is available on the Scottish Executive website and copies of the responses are available on request from the Scottish Executive Library.</p>

  <p>Both the Minister for the Environment and I are keen to engage with key stakeholders and met with the SRDP Stakeholder Group on 21 May to hear at first hand members&rsquo; views on a range of issues that will affect the new programme. Since then Michael Russell, Minister for the Environment, has met with Environment Link and we fully intend to keep up this level of dialogue with our stakeholders.</p>

  <p>The draft SRDP prepared under the previous administration was drawn up in collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders, including environmental interests, in a series of technical working groups, consultative meetings and through on-going dialogue. As you know, we propose to implement that programme as drafted, with the addition of a new measure to help new entrants to farming.</p>

  <p>No. In Scots law the victim does not have right of appeal against sentence at any stage. The Lord Advocate can appeal against the original sentence passed on conviction where it appears that the sentence is &quot;unduly lenient&quot;, in terms of section 108 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995, but the Lord Advocate does not have the right to appeal a sentence which has already been considered by the Appeal Court.</p>

  <p>I have asked for a review of major public transport projects which is being taken forward by Transport Scotland as a priority.</p>

  <p>We continue to monitor all projects to ensure proper financial control and management as well as to deliver value for money for Scottish taxpayers.</p>

  <p>This is all part of the normal, natural and necessary business of good government.</p>

  <p>The Auditor General will also publish the findings of the review that we have asked Audit Scotland to carry out on the EARL and Edinburgh trams projects. This will be brought to Parliament on 20 June 2007.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what regulations would govern the disposal of waste from any new deep coal mine in Scotland.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2007-06-12.S3W-287.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80340" speakername="Richard Lochhead" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-07/wa0612.htm#28">

  <p>The disposal of any non-mineral wastes from deep coal mines, like most categories of waste, is governed by legislation deriving from the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and the Pollution Prevention and Control Act 1999, notably the Landfill (Scotland) Regulations 2003 and the Waste Incineration (Scotland) Regulations 2003. These Regulations derive ultimately from the European Waste Framework Directive (2006/12/EC) and related Community legislation.</p>

  <p>Waste resulting from prospecting, extraction, treatment and storage of mineral resources and the working of quarries is, however, excluded from the Waste Framework Directive and the related legislation, both in Community and Scots law. Instead, in the case of any new deep coal mine in Scotland, it will be dealt with in legislation to transpose the Mining Waste Directive (2006/21/EC). This Directive must be transposed by 1 May 2008: the Executive is considering means of doing so.</p>
