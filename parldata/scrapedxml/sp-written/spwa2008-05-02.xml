  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many offences of selling alcohol to under 18-year-olds have been detected as a result of the national roll-out of the test purchasing of alcohol; how many of these have resulted in (a) prosecution and (b) conviction of licensees operating (i) on-sales and (ii) off-sales premises as defined by the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976, and how many prosecutions for these offences are presently pending.</p>

  <p>Between 10 December 2007 and 31 March 2008 106 reports identified by the police as arising from test purchase operations were made to the Procurator Fiscal. A number of these were wrongly classified and it is not possible to distinguish between on-sales and off-sales in terms of prosecution decisions. Information is currently available on 60 reports and the position is as follows:</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>Two convictions have been recorded since the test purchasing roll-out. In one of the cases there were two accused who both pled guilty to contraventions of the legislation. The accused were fined &pound;135 each.</p>

  <p>In the other case an accused was fined &pound;60.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether during the test purchasing of alcohol pilot scheme in Fife, only licensed premises which failed two test purchases were subject to prosecution by the Crown Office and, if so, whether this position has changed following the national roll-out of the test purchasing, and whether there has been a change in prosecution policy and, if so, what the reasons are.</p>

  <p>During the test purchasing of alcohol pilot scheme in Fife the prosecutor assigned to deal with such reports took account of all the information provided by the police and made a decision on the merits of each individual case. He also was aware of the educational campaign to raise awareness amongst licensees and their staff about the illegal sale of alcohol to those under age which took place as part of the pilot. In the event licensed premises which failed only one test purchase were not subject to prosecution but there was no blanket policy not to prosecute in these cases. It remains the fact that there is no such blanket policy. In making prosecution decisions prosecutors will, of course, take account of the fact that most test purchase operations now arise as the result of police intelligence concerning illegal activity and premises are not visited routinely, as they were during the pilot.</p>

  <p>Prosecutors are always issued with guidance about any significant change in the law which is likely to have an impact on them. Guidance was provided to prosecution staff before the roll-out of test purchasing to all Scottish police forces on 10 December 2007. The approach to be taken in such cases is in line with the requirements set out in the Prosecution Code. Prosecutors will consider all the information provided by the police, including previous convictions, reliable intelligence concerning illegal activity of this kind on the premises, any aggravating circumstances and any test purchase failures referred to in the police report.</p>

  <p>Representations to the Home Office on immigration rules and legislation have covered six broad subjects: the points based immigration rules, asylum seekers and the rights children, the displacement of UK medical graduates, academic visitors to Scotland, citizenship and policing issues.</p>

  <p>Written representations by Scottish ministers are underpinned by meetings, exchanges and correspondence at both official and ministerial level and have included: First Minister to Home Secretary on the subject of asylum seekers (1 August 2007 and 17 September 2007); Cabinet Secretary for Health and Well Being to the Home Office Minister of State (9 October 2007) and to the Home Secretary (5 January 2008) on the subject of medical graduates and the highly skilled migrants programme; Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning to Home Office Minister of State on the subject of asylum seekers (17 December 2007); Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning to Home Office Minister of State on the subject of academic visitors (19 March 2008), and First Minister to Home Secretary on the subject of Citizenship (25 March 2008).</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers have also made representations on the points based immigration system covering: the scope for Scottish flexibilities within the system; a reduced qualifying period for settlement in Scotland; the criteria for Tier One - Post Study (the successor to the Fresh Talent: Working in Scotland Scheme), including retaining Scottish HNDs as an eligible qualification; Scottish representation on the Migration Advisory Committee and the Migration Impacts Forum, and the potential impact on Scotland&rsquo;s cultural festivals and sports events, the Asian restaurant trade and Japanese investment (as a result of the English language requirement).</p>

  <p>Official discussions on policing have also been conducted, covering the implications for Scotland of extending police powers to immigration officers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and the UK Borders Review, which led to establishment of the UK Borders Agency from April 2008.</p>

  <p>It would be inappropriate to refer to any particular case which is before the courts.</p>

  <p>However, the duty on the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) to disclose evidence to the defence is set out in <em>The Crown&rsquo;s Principles of Disclosure</em>, available on the COPFS website as part of the COPFS Disclosure Manual, as follows:</p>

  <p>1. The Crown is obliged to disclose <u>all material evidence for or against the accused</u>. This relates to statements, but it also relates to <u>all</u> information of which the Crown is aware.</p>

  <p>2. &quot;Material&quot; means evidence which is likely to be of real importance to any undermining of the Crown case, or to any casting reasonable doubt on it, and of positive assistance to the accused.&quot;</p>

  <p>This does not mean that the Crown should disclose all information in its possession but that the Crown requires to consider all information for disclosure, and disclose any information which meets the test set out above, subject to any consideration of public interest immunity (PII).</p>

  <p>COPFS does not hold information about the number of cases where documents in the possession of the prosecution have not been disclosed to the defence.</p>

  <p>Final approval of a Strategic Development Plan will be for Scottish ministers. In the unlikely event of consensus not being reached on the content of the strategic development plan, an individual planning authority may submit alternative proposals to Scottish ministers.

However, planning authorities will be required to have regard to the guidance on SDPAs which Scottish ministers have issued as Planning Circular 2/2008.

  <p>Bus fares are a matter for individual operators who use their own commercial judgement as to the fare structure to be applied, taking into account the level of patronage, in order to provide a viable service.

  <p>Prior to the decision to extend the First ScotRail Franchise, a value for money assessment was undertaken. The principles of awarding an extension were carefully examined against the alternative of a re-franchise. This examination covered performance to date; incentives for future growth; transaction costs; risk and uncertainty, and the wider economic context.</p>

  <p>A business case for extending the contract was clearly identified.</p>

  <p>Extensive modelling was undertaken to predict future revenue collection under a number of separate scenarios. This identified the impact on the revenue share and support mechanisms included in the contract.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers will give full consideration to the report of the Beauly to Denny public inquiry and all other material considerations, including any relating to alternative options such as subsea cables, before determining the application.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has recently established a new working relationship with local government. It entered into a concordat with COSLA on 14 November 2007 which sets out a set of shared objectives and underpins the funding to be provided to local government up to 2011. The settlement provides local authorities with total funding of &pound;34.9 billion, an increase of 13.1% over the next three years, a figure which includes the former specific grant for centres of excellence such as the specialist music schools.</p>

  <p>Alongside that increase in funding, the Scottish Government has also devolved significant controls and flexibilities to local government in how councils spend that resource and local authorities need to extend that principle within their authorities as far as possible. It is the responsibility of each council to allocate the total financial resources available to them on the basis of their local needs and priorities.</p>

  <p>We are keen to promote quality fresh local produce and to ensure that this reaches the supermarket shelf. Where products are Scottish we would wish them to be clearly labelled as Scottish and we are actively engaging with both producers and retailers to determine how best this can be achieved.</p>

  <p>We are asking our pig industry task force to consider the need for possible actions to assist the pig sector, including an audit of standards, transparency and labelling of imported pork. We have also commissioned an advisory letter from the Farm Animal Welfare Council on the different welfare standards which apply in pig production systems in the UK, other European member states and third countries which export pig meat to the UK.</p>

  <p>Figures are not available for the value of wildlife-watching tourism to the Scottish economy as a whole. For the Highlands and Islands area only, research in 2005 estimated that a net annual expenditure of &pound;84.5 million and the equivalent of 1,651 full-time jobs were supported by wildlife tourism.

  <p>We recently announced record funding for councils of voluntary service, recognising that their network business plan specifically offers to enhance the connection between the third sector and local authorities which should further improve the contribution which the sector makes to the design and delivery of services. We are supporting the development of public social partnerships and the creation of compacts between the sector and local authorities, both which will build on the partnership approach.</p>

  <p>Overall, we believe the third sector has a substantial contribution to make to the growth of the economy, not least through the innovative way it designs and delivers services.</p>
