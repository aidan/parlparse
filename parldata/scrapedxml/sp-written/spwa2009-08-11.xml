  <p>Through the single outcome agreement process, local authorities and community planning partners are responsible for securing improved outcomes for children in their local areas, where necessary realigning existing resources to support the early years framework and priorities such as play. This may include developing their own local play strategy.</p>

  <p>We announced on 13 May 2009 that we would be piloting Activity Agreement in ten local authority areas. This intervention is designed to enable young people to undertake informal learning which will help them to become ready for formal learning or employment. The pilot areas are Glasgow, Stirling, Highland, Fife, South Lanarkshire, North Lanarkshire, North Ayrshire, West Dunbartonshire, Renfrewshire and Inverclyde.</p>

  <p>Additionally, the national training programmes offered by Skills Development Scotland continue to provide skills training for this age group. The national training programmes include Modern Apprenticeships, Skillseekers and Get Ready for Work.</p>

  <p>The Modern Apprenticeship/Skillseekers programme provides skills training for 16-18 year olds in a number of areas. The focus of this intervention is on offering skills training for specific employment sectors.</p>

  <p>The Get Ready for Work programme was introduced in April 2002, to provide a national work based training framework for 16-19 year olds who require tailored support in order to access employment. The focus of this intervention is on offering generic work skills rather than training for specific employment sectors and is tailored to meet the needs of the individual and reflect local economic drivers.</p>

  <p>In 2008, 13 Community Planning Partnerships were awarded &pound;38.6 million in European Social Fund (ESF) and &pound;11.2 million in European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) grants to support more people in target areas to move towards and into sustained employment over the two years to 2010.</p>

  <p>In April this year, the eligibility rules for Training for Work (TfW), the Scottish Government&rsquo;s vocational skills programme for the unemployed, were changed to allow access to the programme when people reach the three month unemployed stage &ndash; previously they had to wait for six months. Lone parents, those with disabilities and those recently made redundant are among specific groups who already have immediate access to the programme.</p>

  <p>An additional 3,150 TfW training places will be available in the coming year following an award of almost &pound;3 million ESF money in June of this year.</p>

  <p>During this year the Scottish Government has received bids for funding from the Gaelic School capital fund from Highland Council, Glasgow City Council and Argyll and Bute Council. On 3 August the First Minister announced that an additional &pound;800,000 would be committed to the fund, increasing the amount available this year to &pound;2.15 million. I am currently considering how awards from the fund should be allocated, and all applicants will be formally notified of my decision later this summer.</p>
