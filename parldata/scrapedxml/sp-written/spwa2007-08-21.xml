  <p>Scottish Enterprise Ayrshire reviewed the Prestwick free zone in the late 1990s to establish whether it could leverage additional investment into Ayrshire and Scotland. The review found that newer regulations have been introduced which mean that any person may apply to HM Revenue and Customs to have an area of land designated as a free zone. These regulations have very much eroded any competitive advantage offered by the free zone at Prestwick.</p>

  <p>The free zone at Prestwick is currently non-operational and no traders are using the facility.</p>

  <p>Policy responsibility for free zones remains with the UK government. HM Revenue and Customs is currently reviewing the free zone process across all six UK free zone sites and may revoke free zone procedures when the modernised customs code is introduced.</p>

  <p>The Sustainable Housing Design Guide published by Communities Scotland is intended as a reference source for housing providers, including local authorities and Registered Social Landlords, who wish to adopt sustainable principles and practices in housing maintenance and development.

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s fuel poverty programmes improve the energy efficiency of existing housing and contribute to the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions through the provision of measures such as insulation and central heating. Further information on the central heating programme and the Warm Deal, including costs, is provided in annual reports for the programmes available via this link: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2006/08/e9122648/link" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2006/08/e9122648/link</a>.</p>

  <p>I am informed by the Food Standards Agency Scotland (FSAS) that there is no single data set that provides information on the average consumption of calcium by socio-economic group between 1980 and the present time. Thus, data on the average consumption of calcium by income quintiles was obtained from the Expenditure and Food Survey of the UK, which provides information from April 2002 up to March 2003 and from April 2003 up to March 2006. This data is not Scotland specific.</p>

  <p>The following table shows the average intake of calcium (per person, per day) by income quintiles which are based on gross weekly household income. The first quintile contains the lowest income households and the fifth income quintile contains the household with the highest income. Calcium intakes were determined from food brought into the home and eaten outside the home.</p>

  <p>The report to Parliament in September 2006 on the effect of the right to buy concluded that the full impact of the changes arising from the 2001 Housing Act would not begin to be known until after September 2007. We intend to monitor closely the emerging pattern of sales to tenants who have completed their qualifying periods under the modernised right to buy over the coming months. The impact of right to buy sales varies from one locality to another. We will be examining whether there are ways to make the policy more responsive to local needs; balancing the opportunities for homeownership against the pressure on affordable housing locally.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises that the vast majority of landlords operate lawfully. No applications for registration have been rejected yet, but several local authorities are taking action on applications where there are concerns. This may involve the landlord being invited to an interview with a panel of officials to discuss those concerns, or a hearing before the relevant council committee.</p>

  <p>There are currently no plans to develop a specific energy policy and targets for the railway system following the publication of <em>Scotland&rsquo;s Railways</em> . The Scottish government will continue to explore opportunities for its transport policy to contribute to the aims of Scotland&rsquo;s Climate Change Programme <em>Changing Our Ways</em> and the <em>National Transport Strategy</em> . Its investment in the railways will seek to maximize the opportunities that rail provides by encouraging modal shift away from the private car and air travel where possible. Other measures will include investigating the use of more efficient rolling stock for both passenger and freight services and the increased electrification of the Scottish rail network.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland is also part of the GB-wide cross-industry &quot;Rail Sustainable Development Group&quot; which is working on a 30 year sustainable transport policy and identifying ways of reducing environmental impacts by increasing efficiency, reducing waste, and identifying technological improvements.</p>

  <p>Our energy strategy will set out objectives and key areas for action. A target for generation of electricity from renewable sources is already in place and this Government has ambitions for an approach to renewables which extend beyond that. Targets for heat and transport will be examined, taking into account the European target of 20% renewable energy by 2020 and targets set under the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation.</p>

  <p>This Government wants Scotland to show leadership in facing up to the global threat posed by climate change.

  <p>This Government&rsquo;s primary aim is sustainable economic growth right across Scotland, and we see Scottish tourism playing a key role in achieving that aim.</p>

  <p>The Tourism Framework for Change, which was prepared jointly by the tourism industry and the public sector working closely together, sets out an ambition to increase tourism revenues by 50% over the decade to 2015. This ambition is widely shared across the sector. We will ensure that VisitScotland, EventScotland and the enterprise agencies collaborate even more closely to attract more visitors to Scotland through world class marketing and innovative product development, helping to make Scotland a &quot;must visit&quot; destination. We will work alongside tourism businesses which share the ambition to grow revenues by exceeding their guests&rsquo; expectations, making Scotland a &quot;must return&quot; destination.</p>

  <p>As part of developing this way forward, I shall be working with the tourism industry and public bodies to consider whether any structural or other changes are necessary. As part of this I look forward to meeting a wide cross-section of industry representatives, and hearing their views, at a seminar I am holding later in August.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>In addition to the five measures listed, households can also qualify for pipe lagging and draught proofing. All dwellings benefiting from the Warm Deal programme received one of the available measures plus energy advice and low energy light bulbs, as a minimum.</p>

  <p>Information is not held centrally on that part of the programme managed by local authorities. In that part of the programme managed by the Managing Agent, the number of dwellings receiving all measures is not recorded separately. However, the following table shows the number of dwellings, improved by the Managing Agent, that received energy advice, low energy light bulbs and more than one of the other measures.</p>
