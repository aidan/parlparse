  <p>The free personal care policy was introduced to benefit people aged 65 and over, and the government is focusing its attention on addressing implementation issues arising from this policy. There are no current plans to extend this general provision to other care groups. For people under the age of 65, two forms of support are provided. Nursing care payments are available to care home residents who fully fund their care home costs, and people who have dementia or any other degenerative illness who require care, and who live in their own homes, can claim Disability Living Allowance.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it intends to direct Historic Scotland to approve the plans of Anta Estates Ltd relating to the restoration of Castle Tioram and, if so, when. <br /> <br /></p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2007-06-22.3.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80307" speakername="Linda Fabiani" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-07/wa0622.htm#2">

  <p>At present there is no application for the restoration of Castle Tioram with Historic Scotland.</p>

  <p>Any scheduled monument consent application would be assessed by Historic Scotland on behalf of Scottish ministers. As with all such applications, they will assess the case on its own merits taking into account the relevant legislation, policy and best practice and will give a provisional view to the applicants. If the applicants are not content with this view, they can elect to have the case heard by an independent reporter at a public local inquiry. The reporter&rsquo;s report would then be sent to Scottish ministers who will reach a final view without the further involvement of Historic Scotland.</p>

  <p>The member may wish to know that an application for scheduled monument consent for the restoration of Castle Tioram was refused in 2002 following a public local inquiry.</p>

  <p>Following a detailed discussion of this case by their board, Historic Scotland wrote to the owners on 31 August 2006 setting out their general guidance. They included with their letter copies of the relevant board paper, board minute and the supporting material in order that the owners could understand why they had reached their view. As there has been broader public interest in this case, they also placed copies of this information on their website:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/castletioram" target="_blank">www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/castletioram</a>.</p>

  <p>They did nonetheless stress to the owners that this was pre-application guidance and they would consider any future application on its own merits.</p>

  <p>The agency is keen to ensure that this nationally important ancient monument does not deteriorate and they have indicated a willingness to consider grant-aid for any urgent repairs and for improving visitor interpretation without prejudice to the owner&rsquo;s long-term aspirations.</p>

  <p>More generally, Scottish ministers are in the process of consulting with the public on a range of strategic policies for the historic environment. As part of this process, in March 2007 Historic Scotland released their consultation document on Scottish ministers&rsquo; policies for Scheduled Monument Consent <a href="http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/currentconsultations" target="_blank">www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/currentconsultations</a> seeking responses by 22 June 2007.</p>

  <p>Access to orthodontics at the correct stage is dependent on the patient&rsquo;s dentist either carrying out the treatment themselves or referring the patient to a specialist.

  <p>Our programme for class size reductions was announced during the &quot;Smarter Scotland&quot; debate on 20 June 2007. The Education (Lower Primary Class Sizes) Scotland Regulations 1999 allow a number of exceptions to the class size maximum of 30 that the regulations establish, for example to accommodate successful placing request appeals or for pupils to join a school after a placing round. We envisage that similar flexibilities will apply in 2011. In the meantime we will examine the impact of reducing class sizes in P1 to 25 to assess whether any regulatory changes are required in the future.</p>

  <p>No. It is my understanding that careful consideration was given that the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 was compliant with the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) before, and after its passage through the Parliament.

  <p>The NHS Quality Improvement Scotland publication <em>National Overview &ndash; January 2007 Maternity Services </em> reported that following their review of their Clinical Standards for Maternity Services (carried out between November 2005 and June 2006), 10 out of the then 15 NHS health boards routinely carried out foetal anomaly scans at 18 to 22 weeks. Those health boards were: NHS Argyll and Clyde, NHS Ayrshire and Arran, NHS Dumfries and Galloway, NHS Fife, NHS Forth Valley, NHS Grampian, NHS Orkney, NHS Shetland, NHS Tayside and NHS Western Isles.</p>

  <p><em>A Framework for Maternity Services in Scotland</em> published in February 2001 sets out clearly and explicitly the maternity service which should be offered across Scotland. This includes details of the number and timing of ultrasound scans which should be offered during pregnancy. The government is working closely with NHSScotland to ensure that developments in screening during pregnancy are introduced efficiently and effectively.</p>

  <p>In addition to providing its core service and other support services during the in-hours period of 8am to 6pm, NHS 24 provides cover when GP surgeries are closed during this time to enable doctors to have protected learning time. In addition to handling calls, the in-hours period is used for administration and staff training and development. The nature of calls received during the 8am to 6pm period is different from those out-of-hours with a higher proportion not seeking referral to a health professional. From 1 June 2006 to 31 May 2007, NHS 24 dealt with a total of 1.456 million individual caller contacts, with 136,000 (9.3%) of those being dealt with in the 8am to 6pm period.</p>

  <p>In terms of the specific independent scrutiny arrangements for the revised service proposals in Ayrshire and Lanarkshire, there are no plans to consult the Health and Sport Committee.</p>

  <p>I will look to the Independent Scrutiny Panel to assess the safety, sustainability, evidence-base and value for money of the revised proposals from NHS Ayrshire and Arran and NHS Lanarkshire, and to be satisfied that local views have been taken into account. I have agreed with NHS Lanarkshire and NHS Ayrshire and Arran that their revised proposals &ndash; having been scrutinised and evaluated by the independent panel &ndash; should be with me for a final decision by the turn of the year. In setting this demanding timescale I recognised the importance of not setting back or slowing down the boards&rsquo; service plans &ndash; which include much-needed primary care and community-based developments - any more than is absolutely necessary to fulfil the commitment on accident and emergency services.</p>

  <p>That said, I have announced that the Scottish Government will soon consult on arrangements to embed independent scrutiny in the significant service change process and we would welcome the committee&rsquo;s views on this in due course.</p>

  <p>There is no specific waiting times target which sets a maximum wait between diagnosis and treatment for all patients with cancer. There is a national target from urgent referral to first treatment for cancer of 62 days. Performance information against that target, broken down by NHS board and cancer type is available from the Scottish Executive website at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/health/cancer/waiting-times" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/health/cancer/waiting-times</a>. There is also a national target for patients diagnosed with breast cancer that those &quot;who have breast cancer and are referred for urgent treatment will begin that treatment within one month of diagnosis, where clinically appropriate&quot;. The information requested is as under for this group of patients. It should be noted that cancer waiting times data are subject to continuous development and quality improvement. Data capture systems were not fully established and validated prior to 2003, therefore any data collected prior to January of that year on the waiting times of breast patients between diagnosis and first treatment are not presented because they were of variable quality and completeness and used a different definition of one month.</p>

  <p>Care service providers, including those who provide care home and care at home services, are regulated by the Care Commission under the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001 and its associated regulations. Under the regulations a provider shall not employ any person in the provision of the service unless that person is fit to be so employed.</p>

  <p>The Commission is also required to take account of the National Care Standards in all its regulatory decisions. In respect of staff, the Standards require providers to have safe staff recruitment and selection procedures in place covering all legal requirements. This includes Disclosure Scotland checks, taking up references and cross-reference to the registers of the Scottish Social Services Council, Nursing and Midwifery Council or other professional organisations, where appropriate. The Care Commission has a wide range of enforcement powers at its disposal should a provider fail to meet these requirements or the expectations set out in the National Care Standards.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Trunk Road National Average Accident Rate for dual carriageways is 9.40 per 100 million vehicle kilometres, and 20.60 per 100 million vehicle kilometres for single carriageways. The figures quoted may differ slightly from those published elsewhere because they were extracted on a different date and the database may have changed between the two dates, e.g. due to late returns or corrections to earlier returns.
