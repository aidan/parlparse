  <p>Our digital strategy, <em>Scotland&rsquo;s Digital Future: A Strategy for Scotland</em> , published on 3 March 2011, outlines our ambition for availability of next generation broadband throughout the whole of Scotland, including highland Perthshire, by 2020 with significant progress being made by 2015.</p>

  <p>To achieve this, we are already working with local authorities, enterprise agencies, industry and others to collectively develop a strategic Scotland-wide broadband plan. I jointly hosted a Rural Broadband Summit on 9 March 2011 with the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment to progress this issue, and Perth and Kinross Council were represented at the meeting.</p>

  <p>Using the Annual Population Survey (APS), the change in the number of people employed within each of the groups can be estimated. The most recent APS dataset relates to the period July 2009 to June 2010. To determine the change over an 18 month period, estimates from this dataset have been compared to those from the Jan to Dec 2008 dataset. The results are shown in the following table.</p>

  <p>A comprehensive update on our cross-government work to tackle occupational segregation was included in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Gender Equality Scheme annual report 2010 (at Section 2.3). We are currently updating that information for the 2011 annual report, which will be published soon on our website.</p>

  <p>Scottish Government also published reports in July 2010, which give an overview of progress made across public authorities on tackling the Gender Equality Duty Ministerial Priorities - one of which is occupational segregation.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will provide examples of policy recommendations from each of its directorates that have been amended as a result of equality impact assessments.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2011-03-15.S3W-40314.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80397" speakername="John Swinney" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-11/wa0315.htm#6">

  <p>Our approach to Equality Impact Assessment (EQIA) focuses on ensuring that analysis of equality evidence is embedded from the beginning of the policy making cycle, and shapes the policy on an ongoing basis. As such we expect policies to be influenced by the process of impact assessment and analysis. There are 33 Directorates in the Scottish Government and we do not collate information centrally on amendments made to policies during this cycle.</p>

  <p>We do however provide centralised on-line publication of equality impact assessments from across the Scottish Government and these can be accessed at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/People/Equality/18507/EQIASearch" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/People/Equality/18507/EQIASearch</a></p>

  <p>The following case studies provide three examples of instances where policies informed by equality impact assessment have led to specific actions.</p>

  <p>Patients Rights Bill EQIA:</p>

  <p>During consultation on the Bill one of the issues raised was that without the right help and support some groups of people - younger people, older people (especially those with dementia), disabled people (especially those with learning disabilities and mental health problems) - will find it difficult to enforce their rights. After consideration of the impact on the equality groups it was decided to allocate funding to support the provision of advocacy services to ensure that those who need assistance in upholding their rights can access the appropriate support.</p>

  <p>In addition, results from the consultation also suggested that disabled people face significant problems in accessing health care, often due to access and communication issues. Provisions in the Patient Rights Bill place NHS bodies under a duty to allow and encourage patients to participate as fully as possible in decisions relating to their health and well being. After consideration of the equality issues (in particular the impact on disabled people, and people whose first language is not English) the Scottish Government decided to provide funding to NHS Health Scotland to support the development of translation, interpreting and communication services (TICS). Investing in the TICS infrastructure will help to ensure that all patients are aware of their rights, are communicated with in an appropriate manner, and are involved in decisions about their care.</p>

  <p>Drugs Strategy EQIA:</p>

  <p>In developing the EQIA for the national drugs strategy, a lack of evidence about ethnic minority communities&rsquo; use of drugs and treatment services was identified. It identified that 99.3% of new patients accessing treatments were not from ethnic minority groups. Anecdotal evidence suggested that drug taking patterns amongst ethnic minority communities were different to those in other communities which, along with the perceived shame associated with drug taking in many ethnic minority communities, meant that people were not accessing services. Officials explored the potential gaps, barriers and needs in service provision for people from ethnic minority communities. It transpired that drug use amongst these communities was as prevalent per head of population as those in other communities. However, of the 227 drugs services operating in Scotland, only one specialised in supporting people from minority ethnic communities. In response, the Drug Policy Unit commenced work to help make services more accessible to ethnic minority communities.</p>

  <p>Low-cost Initiative for First Time Buyers EQIA:</p>

  <p>The overarching purpose of the Low-cost Initiative for First Time Buyers Shared Equity Schemes is to help first time buyers, on low to moderate incomes, achieve their home ownership aspirations. A key finding from the EQIA for this policy was that Muslims can find it difficult to buy a home if they want to ensure their purchase is compliant with their religious law and beliefs. Therefore, in order to make the benefits of our policy more accessible and reach a greater number of people, we started working with the Islamic Finance Council to make it easier for lenders to offer Shariah-compliant home purchase plans to buyers.</p>

  <p>The regulation of the internet is reserved to the UK Government under the Scotland Act 1998.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does monitor the use of specific internet sites that provide advice to people with mental health problems which are supported by its partner organisations. For example, on Breathing Space (hosted by NHS 24) and on Well Scotland (hosted by NHS Health Scotland), information such as number of hits, source of hits, and frequency of hits is collected to inform policy.</p>

  <p>Additionally, the Scottish Government actively promotes support to help all people stay safe online, through various national and local initiatives, some of which are listed:</p>

  <p>Get Safe Online is a joint initiative between the UK Government, law enforcement, leading businesses and the public sector. Their website <a href="http://www.getsafeonline.org" target="_blank">www.getsafeonline.org</a> contains advice to help people stay safe online and to avoid some of the risks and threats which exist.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government participates in the UK Council for Child Internet Safety, which is committed to improving the safeguards for young people, and published an <em>Action Plan on Child Internet Safety</em> in February 2010, available at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2010/02/09154928/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2010/02/09154928/0</a>. A second action plan is due to be published in March 2011.</p>

  <p>Skills Development Scotland provides information through the National Learning Opportunities Database on a wide range of IT courses, including courses that help individuals learn about the responsible use of the computers and the internet. ILA Scotland provides funding for people on lower incomes to access a wide range of IT courses.</p>

  <p>In 2010-11 the initial recurring baseline formula allocation for NHS Tayside was &pound;592.9 million. As usually occurs, some recurrent adjustments were required to be made to this baseline allocation throughout the year.</p>

  <p>The most notable adjustment in 2010-11 was that the initial allocation for 2010-11 included funding for cost of capital. This was subsequently stripped out, as per HM Treasury guidance, boards no longer have to factor in a cost of capital charge (therefore there is no impact on boards not getting funding cover for this area). This decreased boards&rsquo; allocation by &pound;12 million and when factoring in some other less significant adjustments, the restated baseline allocation totalled &pound;580.9 million. When using the restated baseline allocation of &pound;580.9 in 2010-11, the uplift is close to 3%.</p>

  <p>In 2011-12 the initial recurring baseline formula allocation for NHS Tayside was &pound;596.4 million. This represents a 2.9% increase on 2010-11 restated baseline figure.</p>

  <p>Source: NHS National Services Scotland National Procurement data collected from NHSScotland boards accounts payable information.</p>

  <p>To reduce the use and costs of agency locum doctors we have reminded Chief Executives of the importance of following the existing Code of Practice on the employment of supplementary medical staff in order to ensure patient safety and achieve best value for money. Guidance has also been issued to NHS boards for action on reducing the demand for supplementary medical staff and, where their use is unavoidable, to ensure that they are high quality and affordable. The guidance describes the steps necessary to reduce demand for supplementary staff and the development of medical banks at NHS board or regional level.</p>

  <p>In addition, NHS National Services Scotland National Procurement put in place a new framework contract for the procurement of agency medical staff, which should make the process easier and more cost-effective.</p>

  <p>Article 19 only applies when the contract value is above the relevant EU threshold. The Government has not awarded any contracts under Article 19 and does not currently hold information on contracts with supported businesses or contracts awarded under Article 19 across the wider public sector.</p>

  <p>We have however placed contracts with a value under the EU threshold with third sector suppliers (we use Capability St Judes to provide laundry services to Marine Scotland in Aberdeen) and part of the imminent call off from the collaborative Cleaning Framework, for the Scottish Fire Services College requirement, will be sourced from suitable supported businesses.</p>

  <p>We are also encouraging our main suppliers to engage with supported businesses and other third sector suppliers with regards to possible subcontracting opportunities. For example, our design and print contractor (APS, the main provider to the core Scottish Government and to a large number of collaborative partners) is currently working with Scottish Braille Press and Deaf Connections. APS are also opening up lines of communication with both Erskine and Remploy with a view to adding them to their roster of sub-contractors if the services they offer meet their requirements.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is taking steps to raise awareness of Article 19 within the buyer community and encourage its use. For example:</p>

  <p>In 2010 the British Association of Supported Employment, in partnership with the Scottish Government, published a brochure <em>Supported Businesses in Scotland</em>, which provides guidance to buyers on the use of Article 19 and provides details of the 24 Supported Businesses based in Scotland along with the products and services they can supply;</p>

  <p>Supported Businesses exhibited at the Scottish Government&rsquo;s National Procurement Conference held at the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre in October 2010;</p>

  <p>A new facility has been added to Public Contracts Scotland which automatically alerts buyers when a supported business can fulfil the requirements of their planned contract, and gives them the opportunity to reserve the contract under Article 19; This facility will also capture information on the number of contracts being awarded to third sector organisations and supported businesses through Public Contracts Scotland in future; and</p>

  <p>We are working collaboratively with supported businesses and their representatives to explore what more the Scottish Government could do to assist them during these difficult times.</p>
