  <p>Castle Douglas April to June 2002</p>

  <p><u>Highland</u> - has a dedicated mobile all year round with the exception of five months every three years when it is used in Western Isles by the same screening centre.</p>

  <p><u>Lanarkshire</u> - all eligible women are screened on mobiles in Lanarkshire. There is always at least one mobile screening unit operational in Lanarkshire but normally two simultaneously in different localities.</p>

  <p><u>Shetland</u> - 12 weeks 2001 (all eligible women invited for screening during this period).</p>

  <p>There is no definition of "specialist eating disorder units" within the NHS. Information is not held centrally on services provided outside the NHS. An eating disorder service was provided by a consultant psychiatrist based at the Murray Royal Hospital in Perth. The service was discontinued in December 2001.</p>

  <p>We understand that Tayside NHS Board is discussing with neighbouring boards what future services might be provided for those with eating disorders. At present, such patients continue to be seen by general psychiatrists.</p>

  <p>Data on the Sure Start Scotland programme from the recent mapping exercise is only available at a Scotland level. Raw data available at local authority level would not be of sufficient quality and completeness to support analysis or to allow conclusions to be drawn or comparisons with other data to be made. The mapping exercise found that over 9,000 additional children received support in the first year of implementation of Sure Start Scotland (1999-2000). This increased to over 15,000 additional children in 2000-01. The figures cover a wide range of provision which vary in intensity from one-off interventions to sustained support over a long period.</p>

  <p>South Lanarkshire reports that Sure Start Scotland funding has been used mainly to improve childcare provision across the council, particularly in social inclusion partnership areas, and to enhance integrated working practices and a more holistic approach to work with very young children. The main form of service delivery is through centres offering group provision, such as daycare, parenting programmes, and support groups, while some intensive one-to-one provision is also offered by centres as drop-in sessions or as outreach home visiting.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer given to question S1W-25312 on 7 May 2002. My view remains that the remit, membership and approach of the Mental Health and Well Being Support Group is fit for purpose. However, as part of our commitment to on-going review a Short Life Working Group has been established with representative interests including users of services, support group members, the Mental Welfare Commission, the Scottish Association for Mental Health and the agencies. The group is to review current and alternative approaches for delivering improved and extended mental health care, services and support.

  <p>There are no immediate plans for a national training programme for multi-disciplinary teams. Reliance is placed upon the agencies to work together to ensure that the training required and given reflects care and quality of need and the multi-agency and professional dimensions.</p>

  <p>In respect of psychological interventions, the best practice guidance published in October 2001 also placed proper emphasis on the need for joint agencies to set in place recruitment, retention and training policies as part of the local joint commissioning process.</p>

  <p>Further, NHS Education for Scotland will promote a multi-disciplinary approach to the training and education of healthcare staff and co-ordinate and oversee educational support. The aim is to deliver a more strategic approach to the development of multidisciplinary skills by making the necessary links between different professional groups and help underpin new models of working which are crucial to the modernisation of NHSScotland.</p>

  <p>Ministerial travel patterns vary according to the timing and location of engagements. Arrangements for travel to work are made to support the efficient conduct of Government business and the security of official documents, involving the use of the Government Car Service as appropriate. The Executive does not hold central records of ministerial travel by public transport or private car.</p>

  <p>All consultant nurse/midwife submissions are vetted by a central evaluation panel co-ordinated by the Scottish Executive Health Department. Prior to doing so each proposal must be supported by the local Unified Health Board. In their submission each trust/NHS board must demonstrate the local need for the post, explaining how this fits with the rest of the organisation and the key policy documents influencing the development of this proposal. Each submission must also include the arrangements for audit and the outcome measures that will be used to evaluate the impact of the post.</p>

  <p><i>Eating for Health</i> , the Scottish Diet Action Plan, set out dietary targets and recommended that accurate consistent healthy eating messages should be based on these. The dietary action recommended in <i>Eating for Health </i> is aimed at improving overall health and reducing the incidence of preventable dietary-related illnesses, including heart disease, diabetes and some cancers. The recommendations in <i>Eating for Health</i> apply to all sections of the community.</p>

  <p>Healthy eating in line with <i>Eating for Health </i>is promoted as part of health improvement by a range of organisations in the public, private and voluntary sectors. A National Food and Health Co-ordinator was appointed in 2001 to give further impetus to implementation of <i>Eating for Health.</i></p>

  <p>Information on the total resources involved in this work, which includes support for breakfast clubs from a number of sources, is not held centrally, nor is it possible to break down expenditure to identify work with adults and children separately. The Scottish Executive allocates &#163;1 million each year to implementing <i>Eating for Health</i> and has prioritised diet within the &#163;26 million Health Improvement Fund. Diet forms an important part of the &#163;6 million National Health Demonstration Project &quot;Have a Heart Paisley&quot;. The Executive has also created a &#163;250,000 Breakfast Service Challenge Fund to expand services targeting vulnerable children and is reviewing current provision, and is also taking steps to improve the quality of school meals. The Scottish Community Diet Project has a specific remit to work with low-income communities and will receive funding of &#163;1.2 million between 2002 and 2005. It supports a range of community food initiatives including breakfast clubs, community garden and allotment schemes, healthy food tasting sessions and local healthy food stores.</p>

  <p>Information about the hours staff in the Scottish Executive are contracted to work and any permanent allowances paid to them is held on the payroll system. This can hold pay history information for up to seven years but, if a record becomes too large, old data is removed.

Records showing hours worked by staff under the flexible working hours scheme are held from January 2001 to date.

  <p>This is a matter for Scottish Water. The Chief Executive's response is:</p>

  <p>Charges for metered customers have always been based on a combination of fixed and volumetric elements. The proportion of the charge represented by the fixed element is being increased to make charges more reflective of the costs of providing the service, and so fairer to all categories of customer. This is in line with the advice of the Water Industry Commissioner for Scotland in his <i>Strategic Review of Charges 2002-06</i>.</p>
