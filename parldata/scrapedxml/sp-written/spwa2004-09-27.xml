  <p>The European Regulation, upon which the Single Farm Payment Scheme is based, comes into effect from 1 January 2005 and I intend to extend the existing formal appeals mechanism, the Agricultural Subsidies (Appeals) (Scotland) Regulations 2000 to cater for the new scheme.

  <p>The number of staff involved in any inspection assessment will reflect the scale of the farming enterprise under review. I recognise the concerns of farmers and crofters about the numbers of potential inspectors &ndash; both from SEERAD and specialist bodies - and have tasked my officials to bring in a co-ordinated approach that avoids duplication of effort and unnecessary visits.</p>

  <p>European regulatory penalties incurred by farmers and crofters will depend on the nature and extent of the producer&rsquo;s non-compliance with scheme requirements. Infringements will come in two categories: firstly, application-related errors, for example late claims and over-declaration of land areas. This category exists at present and the European legislation sets out percentage reductions in accordance with the scale of the error. Farmers and crofters will be familiar with these requirements and the penalties for infringement. The second category concerns failures to comply with Cross-Compliance conditions. In some circumstances, farmers and crofters will not be penalised for minor or technical infringements of the rules. Otherwise, penalties are scaled according to the nature and severity of the non-compliance: a simple failure arising from negligence will result in a 3% penalty whereas a deliberate breach of the rules could mean a 20% reduction or in some cases exclusion from the scheme for the following year.</p>

  <p>Funds for agricultural subsidies are drawn as necessary from EC funds and there is no right to unspent money. However, Council regulation (EC) 1782-2003 does provide that member states will be able to retain sums equivalent to 25% of any penalties imposed because of non-compliance by farmers with the Single Farm Payment Scheme cross-compliance rules. This is in line with the practice on current Common Agricultural Policy subsidy schemes and is intended to offset some of the cost of administering the schemes. Currently the sums are credited to the Scottish Executive administration budget and plans for the Scottish Executive Administration Budget currently include an assumed &pound;80,000 a year for such retained income.</p>

  <p>Yes. Independent research has been commissioned into the use of Antisocial Behaviour Orders (ASBOs), which will include information on orders pursued and granted in each local authority area.

  <p>Individual policy areas in the Scottish Executive taking part in the Scotland in the Netherlands programme will follow up the ministerial programme. The nature of the follow up will vary depending on the individual activity. In some cases the follow up activity may be an influencing of future policy decisions based on knowledge gained through the Dutch experience. In other cases follow up may be of a more tangible nature such as the Royal Society of Edinburgh&rsquo;s intention to offer a further scientific seminar in Scotland next year, as they did following the Scotland in Sweden programme in 2002.</p>

  <p>Under the Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations 1998, all landlords are required to have annual gas safety checks carried out by a contractor registered with the Council of Registered Gas Installers, and to provide a copy of the Gas Safety Certificate to every tenant. Enforcement of these regulations is dealt with by the Health and Safety Executive.</p>

  <p>I recently launched a campaign to raise awareness of the rights and responsibilities of both tenants and landlords in private rented housing. The new website, www.betterrentingscotland.com, makes clear the requirements of the Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations. The national core standards recommended for adoption by local voluntary landlord accreditation schemes include the provision of carbon monoxide detectors. For houses in multiple occupation, it is for each licensing authority to decide whether to require carbon monoxide detectors to be provided.</p>

  <p>The time of discharge after childbirth is a joint decision made by the mother and health professionals taking into account the clinical needs of mother and baby. Shorter stays after childbirth, due to developments in clinical care, and improved home support from community midwifery teams has resulted in a lower requirement for inpatient maternity beds.</p>

  <p>NHS Lothian are working closely with regional planning partners to continue to provide a sustainable maternity service in the future.</p>

  <p>The cost of the franchise is impacted on by the level of fixed Track Access Charges (TACs), which are set by the Office of Rail Regulation. The outcome of the regulator&rsquo;s recent review of TACs has meant that the projected funding in the early years of the franchise has been reduced. From 2006-07 and beyond the TACs will rise again.</p>

  <p>Following the recent consultation on Urban Regeneration Companies Scottish ministers announced on 30 June 2004 that projects in Craigmillar, Raploch and Clydebank would be designated as pathfinder Urban Regeneration Companies and that &pound;20 million of grant support would be offered to the projects in 2004-05 and 2005-06. The Executive is working with a wider group of projects across Scotland some of which may also in time become Urban Regeneration Companies.</p>

  <p>The Executive recently introduced the Water Services etc. (Scotland) Bill, which responds to the implications of the Competition Act 1998 for the water industry in Scotland. The bill proposes that the Water Industry Commission, among the charge limits that it determines in November 2005 as the outcome of the Strategic Review of Water Charges 2006-10, would set a price for wholesale water services. That price would be available to licensed water services retail providers under the Water Services Bill.</p>

  <p>This decision is not directly related to the judgement of the Competition Appeals Tribunal referred to but the Executive believes it to be not inconsistent with that judgement.</p>
