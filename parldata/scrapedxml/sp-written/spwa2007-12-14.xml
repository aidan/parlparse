  <p>As with all immunisation policy, the Scottish Government position on hepatitis B immunisation is informed by advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). The JCVI is an independent committee of experts whose role is to provide advice to UK health ministers on immunisation and vaccination.</p>

  <p>Currently, hepatitis B immunisation policy is selective rather than universal. Hepatitis B vaccine is offered to individuals at increased risk of exposure to the virus or complications of the disease. However, the JCVI are keeping this position under review and will consider all new evidence as it emerges.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises that in recent years there has been an undersupply of housing across Scotland, in many rural areas as well as pressured urban settlements, and is committed to increasing housing supply significantly.</p>

  <p>Our consultation <em>Firm Foundations: The Future of Housing in Scotland</em> can be accessed online at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/10/30153156/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/10/30153156/0</a> or in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 43970). It invites comments on a proposed aim of increasing house building to 35,000 new homes each year by the middle of the next decade across rural and urban areas.</p>

  <p>We are also taking action now to try to overcome the obstacles, such as land supply and planning issues, which stand in the way of new development in rural areas, through the work of the Housing Supply Task Force. The task force has identified rural housing supply as an early priority and met to discuss rural housing supply on 27 November. Further information about the task force can be found online at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Housing/Housing/housing-supply-task-force" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Housing/Housing/housing-supply-task-force</a>.</p>

  <p>Under the terms of the package of measures provided by the Scottish Government it is expected that all councils will freeze their council tax at 2007-08 levels. This includes an additional &pound;70 million for implementing a council tax freeze.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, under the terms of its concordat with COSLA, whether it is a strategic objective in its own right for the share of Scottish spending going to local government to grow year-on-year or whether budgets for any sector should be assessed on a needs basis, taking account of health and tertiary education spending in particular.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government wants to achieve a simpler, more effective public sector for Scotland, which is good for Scotland&rsquo;s competitiveness and overall economic performance. There will be no compulsory redundancies as a result of structural changes proposed.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not set staffing targets across the public sector and the concordat does not contain targets for reductions in staff numbers either in the Scottish Government or local authorities. In relation to local government staff, the National Performance Framework includes a National Target of improving public sector efficiency through the generation of 2% cash releasing efficiency savings per annum. Under the terms of the concordat between Scottish Government and local government, local government will be expected to generate these efficiency savings in the same way as will apply to all parts of the public sector. However, under the concordat, local authorities will be allowed to retain all of these savings, to re-deploy against on-going pressures and address local priorities. It will be for local authorities to determine for themselves how these savings should be realised.</p>

  <p>The concordat with COSLA contains a commitment that the Scottish Government will not undertake structural reform of local government during the term of this Parliament. We recognise that there may be occasions where minor boundary adjustments may be necessary, for example to address an anomaly that would arise where an existing boundary runs through a dwelling house. Recommendations on minor adjustments of this sort are matters for the independent Local Government Boundary Commission within the terms of the direction set for it. It would not be appropriate for Scottish ministers to comment in advance on such adjustments nor otherwise to influence what recommendations the commission may make.</p>

  <p>Yes I can confirm that some of the rolled-up funding was previously provided to other organisations, either directly by central government or indirectly through local authorities. Under the agreement, local authorities will commission services which may have previously been funded by central government, such as those provided by third sector organisations. This will provide an opportunity for local service delivery organisations, including community planning partners and voluntary organisations, to build closer relationships with local commissioners and work together to meet the needs of the local community and deliver on the national outcomes.</p>

  <p>Our commitment was to match the planned school building programme that was in place prior to the election. To that end, three more schools PPP projects have been enabled to reach financial close since May and we will continue to monitor and work with other authorities concerning progress on their projects.</p>
