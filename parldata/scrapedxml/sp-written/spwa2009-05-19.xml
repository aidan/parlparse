  <p>I can confirm the Scottish Government intends to amend Schedule 4 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act to reduce the number of bird species that require to be registered. We will retain seven birds of prey on the Schedule, (golden eagle, goshawk, honey buzzard, marsh harrier, white-tailed eagle, Montagu&rsquo;s harrier and osprey), and we will also retain the peregrine falcon and merlin where they are not otherwise subject to CITES regulations (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species).

  <p>Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE)&rsquo;s approach to crofting community development has two components: Community Account Management, and Crofting Sector Development, which form part of its new Growth at the Edge approach.</p>

  <p>Community Account Management will assist communities with the development and delivery of a Community Growth Plan, prepared by the community in a holistic and integrated manner, which addresses the community&rsquo;s development opportunities. Where crofting is a significant and important activity, Community Growth Plans will include a crofting development statement. Crofters and Grazings Committees will be encouraged to assist in the preparation of the crofting development statement. Crofters may also develop social enterprises or micro-business developments which are supported under other branches of the Growth at the Edge approach.</p>

  <p>HIE will work with Community Planning Partnerships to identify communities with the most credible potential for growth. The aim of HIE is to target up to 42 communities in its fragile areas over the next three2 years through Community Account Management. HIE&rsquo;s fragile areas correspond closely with areas where there is a high level of crofting. A Crofting Development toolkit will be developed to assist other crofting communities not benefiting directly from Community Account Management.</p>

  <p>Crofting Sector Development will include activity such as skills development programmes for crofters and the integration of crofting into promotional and development activities in two of HIE&rsquo;s key growth sectors &ndash; Food and Drink and Tourism.</p>

  <p>On 1 April 2009, crofting community development transferred to Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE). The Scottish Government transferred &pound;175,000 per annum from the crofting assistance budget to assist with crofting community development. In total, HIE will invest &pound;1.42 million in the Community Account Management component of Growth at the Edge over the next three years, as well as supporting growth of social enterprises and selected micro businesses in fragile areas, though not all of this will be invested directly in crofting community development.</p>

  <p>Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) is involved in a partnership that helps to fund courses such as the Crofting Induction Course and the Highlands and Islands Crofters and Small Landholders Training Programme. Under Highlands and Islands Enterprise&rsquo;s Crofting Sector Development approach, HIE intends to continue building capacity and, where appropriate, assistance towards skills development.</p>

  <p>The Highlands and Islands Croft Entrants Scheme has closed to new applicants and the Government is considering how support for crofting might better assist new entrants. It has already agreed to introduce a 10% uplift in support from the Crofting Counties Agricultural Grants Scheme (CCAGS) to new entrants to crofting.</p>

  <p>Neither the Scottish Government nor the Crofters Commission records details of any enquiries made to them on disputes about boundary issues. These will, however, be few in number.</p>

  <p>The determination of the boundaries of a property is primarily a matter between purchaser and seller. The Crofters Commission has no powers to intervene in disputed croft purchases, and the Scottish Government believes the current regime for resolution of such disputes by the Scottish Land Court to be appropriate.</p>

  <p>In its response to the final report of the Committee of Inquiry on Crofting, the Scottish Government agreed that the responsibility for establishing a definitive new Register of Crofts should be entrusted to the Registers of Scotland. The draft Bill issued for public consultation on 19 May 2009 contains provisions for a definitive new Register of Crofts that will provide greater legal certainty on the extent of, and interests in, a croft. Once a croft has been permanently registered on the new Register, it will not be possible to challenge the boundary of that croft. Provision has been made to allow for the boundary to be contested whilst the croft is provisionally registered on the new Register of Crofts.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government wants all children and young people to be included, engaged and involved throughout their education and to make the most of the educational opportunities available to them. In December 2007, we published <em>Included, Engaged and Involved: Part 1. </em> This guidance focuses on the promotion of attendance and action to reduce absence in schools and highlights the need to make strong links with protection of children.</p>

  <p>The key to prevention of absence and truancy lies in the focus of <em>Curriculum for Excellence</em> to provide a broad and relevant curriculum to all our learners, with flexible learning packages across schools, colleges and other placements which can build capacity across schools and local authorities to make provision for all pupils that best meet their needs and increase the chances of each pupil remaining included, engaged and involved.</p>

  <p>There has been a positive response to the Scottish Science and Language Baccalaureates, with over 100 schools and colleges across Scotland expressing an interest in offering the award in their initial implementation years. However, the precise number of schools and local authorities offering the baccalaureates in 2009-10 will not be known until candidate entries for the Interdisciplinary Project are received in December 2009. Numbers for 2010-11 will not be known until December 2010.</p>

  <p>The schools and colleges which have expressed an interest in the baccalaureates are drawn from across Scotland, from both urban and rural areas.</p>

  <p>Local authorities are already adopting imaginative solutions to increase access to Higher and Advanced Higher courses, including developing collaborative arrangements between schools and with other establishments, and using new technology such as SCHOLAR and Glow.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Qualifications Authority will be appointing a Scottish Baccalaureate Development Manager to provide additional support to those centres implementing the Scottish baccalaureates in 2009-10. A key role of this post will be to help facilitate partnerships between centres.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not set targets for the uptake of qualifications. There has been a positive response to the baccalaureates, with over 100 schools and colleges expressing an interest in offering the award in their initial implementation years. It is expected that modest numbers will be involved in the first year (academic year 2009-10) with this growing steadily as baccalaureates become established.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is currently providing local government in Scotland with &pound;23 billion for the period 2008-10. It is the responsibility of local authorities to set budgets for education, within the overall resources provided to them.</p>

  <p>Two of the National Outcomes agreed in the concordat are that &quot;We are better educated, more skilled and more successful, renowned for our research and innovation&quot; and that &quot;Our young people are successful learners, confident individuals, effective contributors and responsible citizens&quot;. The Scottish Science and Language Baccalaureates can clearly contribute to the delivery of these outcomes.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not hold individualised data on any crimes or offences recorded by the eight police forces in Scotland, and as such does not hold information on the victims of crimes.</p>

  <p>Following the introduction of the Emergency Workers (Scotland) Act in 2005, a new crime code (Minor Assault of an Emergency Worker) was created. However, the figures cannot be broken down by category of worker.</p>

  <p>As such it is not possible to identify how many assaults there have been on police officers in the Lothian and Borders Police area in each year since 1999.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not hold details of officer allocations at divisional level. Figures on the number of police officers per force are collected on a whole-time equivalent basis each quarter. The figures to 31 December 2008 were published on 3 March 2009 and are available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 47838). On 31 December 2008 there were 7,955 police officers in Strathclyde Police.</p>

  <p>It is a matter for individual organisers to consult with the force concerned at the earliest opportunity to ensure that the policing requirements can be fully discussed and costed. For large scale events such as the Commonwealth Games Scottish Executive officials will work with events organisers and the police to facilitate these negotiations.</p>

  <p>It is an operational matter for individual chief constables to decide what services they can charge for the policing of major events and to reach agreement with organisers on the total amount to be charged. In general forces aim to cover the full costs and we would not expect the cost of policing major events to discourage organisers from holding events in Scotland.</p>
