  <p>The reduction in adoption applications has been a statistical trend now for around 10 years. To tackle this and other concerns, I established an Adoption Policy Review earlier this year and it started work earlier this month. It will aim to modernise the system, strengthen adoption as a choice for young people in the care system and improve recruitment and selection procedures.</p>

  <p>We have implemented a strict disease control strategy which has involved culling where necessary to contain the spread of the disease. Culling has been carried out for disease control purposes only and for no other reason.</p>

  <p>The <i>Scottish Health Plan</i> reiterates our commitment to the founding principle of the NHS - that access to care should be based on need, not on ability to pay.</p>

  <p>But inequalities in access can occur for many reasons, such as social exclusion and variations in service provision. The <i>Scottish Health Plan</i> provides a comprehensive programme for tackling the root causes of inequalities in health and introducing national priorities and standards which the NHS is expected to meet.</p>

  <p>Yes. The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service is piloting its Victim Liaison arrangements in Aberdeen and Hamilton. The VLO will operate in every region by next spring. The full roll out of the service will take account of what is learned from the pilots.</p>

  <p>In addition, consideration is being given to communication with vulnerable prosecution witnesses, i.e. witnesses who may not be victims, such as children.</p>

  <p>We recognise that citation to give evidence as a prosecution witness is a significant disruption for members of the public, and are examining arrangements for citation and reviewing targets. We attach importance to giving prosecution witnesses good, early information. This includes information about the availability of the volunteer Witness Service in sheriff courts as the service is rolled out nationally.</p>

  <p>We are working with the Justice Department and others to pilot its system, using the ISCJIS platform, to provide victims who elect to receive it with automated case progress information, from the point where the case is referred to the procurator fiscal to the outcome of court proceedings. We will contribute to the Justice Department consultation on procedures for victims.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Data for the period prior to local government reorganisation in April 19996 have been mapped<strong> </strong>to the current council areas.</p>

  <p>2. Number of offences recorded by the police in each year.</p>

  <p>3. Number of persons with a charge proved (main offence), by year of sentence. Data for 2000 are not yet available.</p>

  <p>The figures given in the answer on the number of offences recorded by the police have been extracted from the statistical returns on recorded crime made by police forces to SEJD. The convictions data are based on data held on the SEJD Court Proceedings Database.</p>

  <p>The statistics dealing with court proceedings and with recorded crime are not directly comparable for a number of reasons. A person may be proceeded against for more than one offence and it is also possible that the offence recorded by the police may be altered as a result of the judicial proceedings. If more than one offence is prosecuted in the same proceedings, the one receiving the most severe penalty is counted. The recorded crime statistics relate to the year in which the police recorded the offence; the convictions data relate to the year of sentence.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 removed, or the draft Title Conditions (Scotland) Bill is intended to remove, any remaining provisions in the Schools Sites Act 1841 which require education authorities to restore to feudal superiors land granted under that Act for school buildings once the schools in question have closed down and educational uses have ceased.</p>

  <p>The Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 did not make any provision regarding the School Sites Act 1841. The draft Title Conditions (Scotland) Bill, as prepared by the Scottish Law Commission, does contain proposals for reversions created under the 1841 Act. Although the law is unclear, the accepted position appears to be that the reversion holder is entitled to the entire property when the site is no longer used for educational purposes. The Commission propose that where there is a valid claim, the claimant would not be entitled to the value of any improvements that have been carried out on the property. Where the land is still in possession of the local authority, and has ceased to be used as a school, the holder of the reversion could elect to receive either compensation for the value of the site or a conveyance of the land, after paying the authority a sum to reflect improvement value. Where a third party has purchased the property, the education authority, not the third party, would pay the compensation. This would protect third party purchasers.</p>

  <p>These proposals are subject to the outcome of the consultation exercise for the draft Bill, which was announced in the answer to question S1W-15380 on 1 May 2001.</p>
