  <p>Further to the answer I gave on 19 July 2000 in response to question S1W-8542, a range of documents relating to Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd matters are not copied to SPICe on the grounds that disclosure would harm the frankness and candour of internal discussions within the Scottish Executive. Such documents may express internal opinion, advice, recommendation, consultation or deliberation, all of which are exempted from disclosure under the terms of Part II of the Code of Practice on Access to Scottish Executive Information.</p>

  <p>No such technologies are promoted at the moment. The EEBPP may promote technologies if they are proven to deliver emission savings. In the meantime, its focus is on promoting management measures like driver training, which have a proven record of delivering savings.</p>

  <p>The Executive does not contribute funding to the EEBPP, which is funded entirely by DETR. The programme does not carry out tests. It evaluates test data provided by manufacturers, and to date there are no publications available on fuel-saving devices because they have not been proven to work. However, the EEBPP has recently commissioned a study by a transport consultancy into test parameters for fuel-saving devices. The results should be published by the end of the year.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s priorities for investment in enterprise and lifelong learning over the next three years are to increase access to learning and skills for all Scotland&#8217;s people; to drive forward new initiatives which will place Scotland at the leading edge of new technologies and to improve Scotland&#8217;s competitive position through increased productivity. To enable us to deliver on these key strategic priorities, the department&#8217;s spending will increase by over &pound;300 million, to &pound;2.27 billion by 2003-04.</p>

  <p>We are taking action on a number of fronts to protect and improve Scotland&#8217;s beaches and bathing waters in order to encourage tourism and recreation.</p>

  <p>Our <i>Programme for Government</i> includes a commitment to bring Scotland&#8217;s 60 designated bathing waters up to European standards. Improvements in sewerage infrastructure are already showing results but we cannot be complacent. The water authorities&#8217; substantial investment programme of &pound;1.8 billion over this and the next two financial years will result in, among other things, further improvements through better sewage treatment standards and will dramatically reduce pollution from point sources. We are also working with a range of interested parties, particularly from agriculture, to tackle the remaining issues.</p>

  <p>Building on their substantial investment in wastewater treatment, the three Scottish water authorities have developed initiatives to promote cleaner beaches, involving local communities, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and interest groups.</p>

  <p>The Executive also provides grant aid to the environmental group Keep Scotland Beautiful which carries out anti-litter initiatives and local authority training programmes.</p>

  <p>There are currently no provisions in Scots or UK law covering liability for damage caused specifically by genetically modified organisms. However, under the Environmental Protection Act 1990, there are powers to prosecute a consent holder where the limitations and conditions attached to the consent are breached. Compensation would be a matter for the civil courts in determining an ordinary action brought by an affected farmer for negligent harm done to him or his business or for nuisance.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&#8217;s priority is to protect human health and the environment. Consent is not granted if there is any prospect of a GM release giving rise to environmental harm.</p>

  <p>Patients diagnosed with ectodermal dysplasias (ED) will be treated in a variety of NHS locations depending on the severity of their condition. Some will be seen in General Practice while others will be admitted to hospital and treated as an outpatient or an inpatient or day case.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to give figures for the past five years for hospital cases, as the current coding system only came into force in April 1996 and the previous one did not record ED separately. In the four-year period from April 1996 to March 2000, 17 patients with ED were seen, some more than once. Due to the small numbers involved, the records for these conditions are not broken down by year.</p>

  <p>GP records in a sample of 74 practices in Scotland show only one case of ED treated in the past three years. This would suggest about 12-13 cases treated by GPs in the whole of Scotland in that period. Records for previous years are not available.</p>

  <p>Ectodermal dysplasias (ED) are a group of rare genetic disorders characterised by abnormal development of the skin and associated structures, such as hair, teeth, nails, and sweat glands. Through the four Regional Genetics Advisory Centres, comprehensive specialist genetic services are available to all affected individuals and their families in Scotland. These services include assessment, diagnosis, the provision of molecular genetic tests (for those forms of ED for which they are available) genetic counselling and psycho-social support for families who need it.</p>

  <p>Although there is no specific treatment for the disorder, the various clinical manifestations which can occur because of the condition are managed by appropriate specialties within the NHS, as they arise.</p>

Industrial museums will be given priority in this process. We have announced funding of &pound;250,000 this year and &pound;3 million over the next three years for these purposes.</p>

  <p>From a preliminary read it is clear that the report raises issues which go considerably beyond the competence of this Parliament. But I agree we need to take careful note of the report&#8217;s contents and ensure that they are fed into our policy considerations for the marine environment.</p>

  <p>Capital resources of &pound;6.7 million were made available for investment in the Tayside Health Board area in 1999-2000.</p>

  <p>In addition to &pound;1 million of capital investment in the Tayside area in 1999-2000, &pound;5.7million was transferred from capital to revenue budgets. A large element of the funds transferred were to fund schemes that, under accounting standards, do not add capital value to the NHSiS estate.</p>

  <p>I have tightened up the rules on capital to revenue transfers and from 2000-01, all capital funds must be spent on capital items.</p>

  <p>Reducing waiting time for patients at each stage of their care is at the heart of the Executive&#8217;s plans for the modernisation and improvement of the NHS in Scotland. A small number of patients are currently waiting more than 12 months for inpatient and day case treatment. The Executive is determined to reduce this number. Substantial additional resources have been made available for this purpose and I have asked health board and NHS Acute Trust Chairmen to continue to give this the highest priority.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>All prisons are required to have in place a range of support mechanisms to meet the aggregate needs of their populations. The recently published Scottish Prison Service revised drug strategy sets out in detail how this is being achieved.</p>

  <p>At the national level, the prison service plays a full part in the work of the Scottish Advisory Committee on Drug Misuse (SACDM), and the Scottish Executive Drugs Forum, both chaired by the Deputy Minister for Justice, and both of which bring together the key players in this field.</p>

  <p>At the local level, all prisons are represented on the relevant Drugs Action Teams (DATs). All prisons have social work and health staff who work closely with their community colleagues over a range of issues, including drug rehabilitation. All prisons now have a Drug Strategy Co-ordinator to encourage partnership working and collaboration with other agencies.</p>

  <p>Staff employed by the Scottish Office and the Scottish Executive are eligible to be members of the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme (PCSPS), which is an unfunded scheme managed by the Cabinet Office. All participating employers are required to make payments to the Cabinet Office in respect of the accruing pension costs of their staff. Although pensions for members of the PCSPS are not funded in advance, the accruing pension costs borne by employers are assessed to be consistent with those which would apply in the private sector, and are therefore influenced by the total effect of the range of factors affecting funded pension schemes, including any effect which the advanced corporation tax changes might have had. However, the managers do not disaggregate the accruing pension charges, and the average contribution charged to employers has remained broadly unchanged since 1996.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is taking forward a range of measures which seek to reduce the levels of smoking by young people in Scotland. Although aimed at young people generally, aspects relating specifically to girls are addressed. The measures include health education and promotion activities such as Smokeline (pregnant young women are a priority group), the &quot;blue sticks&quot; TV commercial which has a strong female bias; materials for primary and secondary pupils; targeted smoking cessation services and a new enforcement package to target under age sales of tobacco. Moreover, an element of the &pound;26 million health promotion fund which I announced on 20 August will be used for a major education drive to cut teenage smoking. We intend that this will take account of the differences between girls and boys smoking and be targeted accordingly.</p>

  <p>The Borders Railway Feasibility Study examined a wide range of social and economic factors affecting the viability of the project, including tourism. To this end, the study took account of a report by the Scottish Borders Tourist Board (SBTB) on the potential impact on the area&#8217;s tourist industry of a re-opened railway. This was augmented by detailed discussions with officers of the SBTB, Scottish Borders Council and Scottish Borders Enterprise. The promoters of the feasibility study agreed that this level of assessment was sufficient for its purpose. The conclusions relating to tourism can be found in Volume 2, Part 2, section 3.6 of the full report, which is available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre.</p>
