  <p>The views of all patients with cancer including those with prostate cancer are fundamental to the design, delivery and development of cancer services. Patient Involvement Workers have been working in the North, South East and West of Scotland Cancer Networks to develop sustainable models of involving patients in the design and delivery of cancer services in their region.</p>

  <p>Patients are also members of the Scottish Cancer Group and its sub-groups and working groups advising on their needs and the changes needed to meet them. Patient members act as channels for communicating ideas and views from other patients and groups across the country.</p>

  <p>In addition the Cancer Care Research Centre, University of Stirling is undertaking a three-year programme of work funded by the department (April 2004 to March 2007) that aims to provide models of good practice in gathering patient experience and promoting patient involvement.</p>

  <p>Seeking the views and experiences of all NHSScotland patients with a view to improving services is also a fundamental part of the <em>Patient Focus and Public Involvement </em>programme of work being undertaken by NHSScotland. This approach to the development of responsive local services is now underpinned by the statutory duty of public involvement placed on NHS boards by the NHS Reform (Scotland) Act 2004. All NHS boards have a designated Director for <em>Patient Focus and Public Involvement </em>with responsibility for driving this culture into every aspect of local health services.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Health Council will monitor NHS boards <em>Patient Focus and Public Involvement</em> activities which will include how they use the experiences of patients to inform future service development and delivery.</p>

  <p><em>Cancer in Scotland: Action for change</em> published in 2001 recognised that managed cancer networks, bringing together all of the professions and disciplines involved in the care of patients with a particular cancer type, help ensure that the best possible quality of care is provided equitably across a geographical area.</p>

  <p>Regional cancer networks are in place in the North of Scotland (NOSCAN), South East of Scotland (SCAN) and in the West of Scotland (WOSCAN). Each of these regional networks includes tumour specific multi-disciplinary teams, such as those specialising in urological cancers.</p>

  <p>NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS) is responsible for setting standards for clinical care, assessing performance throughout NHSScotland against these standards, and publishing the findings. As far as cancer is concerned NHS QIS has recently set up a Steering Group to review and revise existing standards, identify core elements of cancer services and look at the possible development of new tumour specific cancer standards.</p>

  <p>The Cancer Service Improvement Programme (CSIP) identified a number of high impact changes across cancer clinical pathways. The <em>Top 20 Actions for Change </em> are available from the Centre for Change and Innovation website at: <a href="http://www.cci.scot.nhs.uk/cci/files/CSIP%20Top%2020%20Actions%20for%20Change%20FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.cci.scot.nhs.uk/cci/files/CSIP%20Top%2020%20Actions%20for%20Change%20FINAL.pdf</a> .</p>

  <p>The programme has worked with urological multi-disciplinary teams across the three regional cancer networks supporting implementation of the <em>Top 20 Actions for Change</em> and enabling clinical teams to make sustainable changes. For example:</p>

  <p>In Oban the provision of patient information at first consultation and the development of a rapid test reporting system means that patients and carers are now better informed about treatment options and the waiting time to diagnosis has been reduced.</p>

  <p>In Grampian nurse led co-ordination of prostate referrals onto a common biopsy list to maximise the use of available slots has reduced time to biopsy by three weeks.</p>

The Scottish Health Council are quality assuring NHS boards&rsquo; Patient Focus Public Involvement (PFPI) activity and this assessment will include monitoring progress against <em>Fair for All - The Wider Challenge.</em></p>

  <p>Equality Impact Assessment guidance (HDL 2005 (9)) has been introduced across NHSScotland, with the expectation that all new and existing functions and policies will be assessed to identify and address any potential negative impact for individuals and communities.</p>

  <p>NHS boards will be establishing a strategic partnership with a consortium of local Citizen&rsquo;s Advice Bureaux to commission an Independent Advice and Support Service for NHS users, carers and the public as set out in HDL (2006) 13. This service will develop to include provision of information, advice and support needed by individuals to manage and take control of their own care.</p>

  <p><em>Cancer in Scotland: Action for change &ndash; A Guide to securing access to information</em>, published in 2003, recognised that people affected by cancer should have access to relevant information at a time and in a form appropriate to them and sets out the direction for cancer services in a broader context.</p>

  <p>The current position in response to Prostate Cancer Charter for Action&rsquo;s four priorities is as follows:</p>

  <p>Resources</p>

  <p><em>Cancer in Scotland: Action for change</em> was published in 2001 backed by a significant new recurring investment of &pound;25 million. This money is for all cancer services and benefits all people with cancer of any type. Over &pound;700,000 was targeted at prostate/urological cancers through the provision of a biopsy service, equipment such as ultrasound scanners and cystoscopes, specialist nurses, staff for brachytherapy services and audit staff for quality assurance of services.</p>

  <p>Patient Care</p>

  <p>NHS Quality Improvement Scotland is responsible for setting standards for clinical care, assessing performance throughout NHSScotland against these standards, and publishing the findings. As far as cancer is concerned NHS QIS has recently set up a steering group to review and revise existing standards, identify core elements of cancer services and look at the possible development of new tumour specific cancer standards.</p>

  <p>A report on prostate cancer services was prepared in 2002 setting out options for the future management of prostate cancer. Regional Cancer Advisory Groups and NHS Chief Executives were asked to consider this report when looking at options for the future management of prostate cancer. Tumour specific multi-disciplinary teams, including those for urological cancers, are now in place across Scotland.</p>

  <p>Transparency</p>

  <p>There is a national data set for prostate cancer in Scotland and data is routinely collected in most places. Urological cancer waiting times and detailed information on all aspects of Scotland&rsquo;s cancer strategy are available from the Scottish Executive website at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/health/cancer/intro" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/health/cancer/intro</a>.</p>

  <p>Public Awareness</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is represented on the Department of Health&rsquo;s Prostate Cancer Advisory Group and will review the results from the evaluation of their pilot campaign to raise awareness of the prostate and its function once these are available.</p>

  <p>The main direct forms of support for parents with child care costs are the tax credits system and child care vouchers. These are both the responsibility of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and are reserved matters.</p>

  <p>Childcare Strategy funding of over &pound;43 million has been passed to local authorities to meet the Executive&rsquo;s aim of providing good quality, accessible and affordable childcare in all areas of Scotland. This funding supports a wide range of child care projects and can include providing or subsidising child care places where this is seen as a priority. Similarly, SureStart Scotland funding is used by local authorities to provide services for vulnerable families, which may include child care provision.</p>

  <p>The Working for Families (WFF) initiative, being operated in selected parts of Scotland, supports parents in deprived areas to progress towards or into employment. This can include help to tackle the financial barriers associated with child care, for example by providing the full cost of a child care place for a short time-limited period whilst the parent makes the transition into employment.</p>

  <p>The average cost, per family, of child care is not known for Scotland in 2006. In 2003-04 a survey of parents in Scotland conducted for the Executive revealed that 63 per cent of families with children do not pay for child care, relying on informal care and free provision. Of those families that did pay for child care, 38 per cent paid less than &pound;20 per week, 18 per cent paid between &pound;20 and &pound;39 per week, 18 per cent paid between &pound;40 and &pound;70 per week, 10 per cent paid between &pound;71 and &pound;100 per week, 8 per cent paid more than &pound;100 per week, 1 per cent make a one off payment and 7 per cent was not stated.

  <p>I wrote to the Council Leader, Allan MacAskill on 14 February following publication of the Best Value Audit of Argyll and Bute Council, noting my concern that the report describes a council lacking clear corporate leadership to drive change and promote a culture of challenge and improvement, and with insufficient focus at a corporate level on the needs of service users.</p>

  <p>I have encouraged the council to work closely with the Improvement Service in addressing the Accounts Commission&rsquo;s findings. The Improvement Service was established in 2005 in partnership between COSLA, SOLACE and the Scottish Executive, to work with Scottish councils, their partners and stakeholders to improve the efficiency, quality and accountability of public services across Scotland. This includes assisting and supporting local authorities in taking forward their Improvement Plans as agreed with the Accounts Commission following a Best Value Audit.</p>

  <p>The Improvement Service has already made contact with Argyll and Bute Council to ascertain the nature and level of support needed.</p>

  <p>I am grateful to Mr Mather for giving me the opportunity once again to bring these matters to light.</p>

  <p>The funding for the mainstreaming of New Futures Fund (NFF) will be allocated to Community Planning Partnerships (CPPs) that have NFF projects in their areas. The allocations are outlined in the table below. We are in discussion with some CPPs to finalise funding arrangements as a number of the existing projects provide services into two partnership areas. By the end of September, CPPs will be required to provide plans for developing employability services for those people furthest from the labour market, building on NFF projects where appropriate.</p>

  <p><em>Getting Our Priorities Right - Good Practice Guidance for working with Children and Families affected by Substance Misuse </em> published by the Executive in 2003 provided a clear framework for practitioners and service providers on working with families where there is substance misuse. This makes it clear that if a child may be at risk of harm this will always override a professional or agency requirement to keep information confidential. Professionals have a responsibility to act to make sure that a child whose safety or welfare may be at risk is protected from harm.</p>

  <p><em>Protecting Children and Young People: Framework for Standards</em> published in 2004 reinforced this requiring agencies and professionals to share information about children where this is necessary to protect them.</p>

  <p>The <em>Getting it Right for Every Child</em> (Bib. number 37081) proposed that all agencies involved with children work to a single assessment, record and plan for each child. Based on this shared information, agencies will be expected to take action which is appropriate, proportionate and timely to address the needs of the child. We will also shortly be publishing an action plan in response to the issues raised in <em>Hidden Harm, </em>responding to the needs of children of problem drug users<em>.</em></p>

  <p>However, recognising the need to strengthen guidance still further, the First Minister announced on 25 February that legislation requiring agencies to share information will be introduced and that all social workers and other frontline professionals will be retrained in child protection over the next two years.</p>

  <p>Aberdeen City<br /> Angus<br /> City of Edinburgh<br /> Dundee City<br /> East Dunbartonshire<br /> East Lothian<br /> East Renfrewshire<br /> Falkirk<br /> Glasgow City<br /> Highland<br /> Inverclyde<br /> Midlothian<br /> Moray<br /> North Lanarkshire<br /> Perth and Kinross<br /> Renfrewshire<br /> Scottish Borders<br /> Shetland Isles<br /> West Lothian.</p>

  <p>In addition, we understand that the following local authorities have commenced or completed work on an open space strategy.</p>

  <p>Aberdeenshire<br /> South Ayrshire.</p>

  <p>A copy of the research report <em>Minimum Standards for Open Space</em> is available from the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 37111).</p>

  <p>As <em>Delivering for Health</em> makes clear, we will be producing new guidance aimed in general at strengthening the authority of Managed Clinical Networks (MCN) and increasing their influence on the way in which resources are allocated for services. A key aspect of that approach will be to ensure that MCNs are fully integrated into NHS boards&rsquo; planning processes at local, regional or national level. Future Networks will therefore be aimed at addressing a need which is considered to be a priority at each of these levels.</p>

  <p>Equity of provision of and access to services is one of the fundamental aims of all Managed Clinical Networks (MCN). The national networks are able to promote this aim for patients regardless of where in Scotland they are resident.</p>

  <p>Where there are networks in each board associated with a national strategy, the fact that they are all working to the same evidence base helps promote equity of access to high quality, clinically effective services. The regular meetings of MCN Lead Clinicians, as part of the implementation of the national strategies, provides a mechanism for identifying and addressing any issues relating to equity of access.</p>

  <p>The Managed Clinical Networks for cardiac services, stroke, cancer and diabetes are showing their effectiveness in taking forward the local implementation of our national strategies for each of these conditions. The gains at present are largely in terms of the integration of services through re-design.</p>

  <p>Assessing improvements in outcomes is a longer term aim. The indications are, however, that the cardiac MCNs are contributing to reductions in mortality associated with coronary heart disease, while the priority which the stroke MCNs have given to the development of stroke units is based on the evidence of improved outcomes resulting from treatment in such units.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not issue licences specifically for ship-to-ship transfer of crude oil.</p>

  <p>If it were to be established that the proposed commercial ship-to-ship transfer of crude oil were likely to disturb a European Protected Species, or damage or destroy its breeding site or resting place, whether or not the species is present in these places, a licence would be required from the licensing authority under regulation 44 of the Conservation (Natural Habitats &amp; c.) Regulations 1994. In that case, the licensing authority would be the Scottish Executive. The advice I have sought from Scottish Natural Heritage in respect of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency&rsquo;s consultation on the relevant oil spill contingency plan will enable decisions to be taken about whether a licence might be necessary and I do not want to prejudge the outcome of that consideration.</p>

  <p>Methods and mitigation measures suggested as a result of the consultation exercise, including those suggested as part of any environmental impact assessment, will be taken into account before the relevant oil spill contingency plan is approved. Once the plan is approved, it will be enforceable under the Merchant Shipping (Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co-operation Convention) Regulations 1998 which are the responsibility of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive will respond to the consultation having taken advice from Scottish Natural Heritage on the potential environmental implications of the oil spill contingency plan, in particular the potential impacts on Special Protection Areas and Special Areas of Conservation designated by Scottish ministers under the Conservation (Natural Habitats etc) Regulations 1994 and bearing in mind our obligations in respect of European Protected Species.</p>

  <p>The role of Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) includes the provision of advice to the Scottish Executive on natural heritage matters and issues likely to affect the environment of Scotland. I have consequently asked SNH for advice in respect of the oil spill contingency plan to help inform any response the Scottish Executive may make to the recently announced public consultation.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, following the publication of Scottish Health Statistics &ndash; Acute Hospital Care on 23 February 2006, what the baseline figure is in respect of 89.9% of out-patients being seen within 26 weeks in the quarter ending as at December 2005.</p>

  <p>The figure quoted was calculated from SMR00 (out-patient return) data records provided by all NHS boards in respect of patients who attended for new out-patient appointments at NHS clinics taken or led by consultants in acute specialties between 1 October 2005 and 31 December 2005. These returns allow calculation of the waiting time experienced by these patients. It is calculated as the time elapsed between the date each patient&rsquo;s referral letter from a general medical or dental practitioner was received at the hospital and the date of their out-patient appointment. The records of patients who have an Availability Status Codes (ASC) are not included in the calculation. ASCs record circumstances where the out-patient waiting time target does not apply (because, for example, the patient asks to delay an appointment, fails to attend and is offered another appointment, or refuses a reasonable offer of an appointment). At the time of the publication for the quarter in question, Boards had submitted 190,632 SMR00 returns for new out-patient attendances in acute specialties where the patient did not have an ASC. Of these 171,294 (or 89.9%) recorded a wait of 26 weeks or less.</p>

  <p>Additional SMR00 records relating to the quarter ended 31 December submitted by boards after the closure of the file for the publication of statistics on 23 February 2006 will be included in future routine analyses and updates of the website. The figures published on 23 February are therefore provisional (as the web pages make clear).</p>

  <p>The SMR00 returns for the quarter ended 31 December 2005 do not record the number of patients who, on that date, were waiting more than 26 weeks for a new out-patient appointment. A separate census of patients waiting at the quarter end date is taken and published. This is referred to as the out-patient waiting list (OPWL) census. The OPWL census allows calculation of waiting times from receipt of referral letter at the hospital to the census date. The OPWL census for 31 December 2005 showed that, of patients who were waiting at that date and who were covered by the out-patient waiting times target (that is, patients who did not have ASCs), two were waiting more than 26 weeks. These cases were the result of administrative errors. They were seen at out-patient clinics as soon as the errors were discovered.</p>

  <p>The NHS in Scotland and Information Services Division of NHS National Services Scotland (ISD Scotland) have checking systems in place to try to eliminate recording errors from waiting times data. However it is possible that a small proportion of data recording errors are made and included in the statistics, including errors relating to the calculation of waiting times.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, following the publication of Scottish Health Statistics &ndash; Acute Hospital Care on 23 February 2006, what the baseline figure is in respect of 90.5% of in-patients being admitted within six months in the quarter ending in December 2005.</p>

  <p>The figure was calculated from the total number of patients who were admitted to hospital from the in-patient/day case waiting list and who were discharged between 1 October 2005 and 31 December 2005. Of this total, 90.5% experienced a wait of six months or less between being added to the waiting list and being admitted to hospital. The calculation was based on SMR01 (in-patient and day case discharge summaries from non-obstetric, non-psychiatric specialties) data records submitted by hospitals and available for analysis for the quarter ending December 2005.</p>

  <p>At the time of the publication for the period in question, hospitals had submitted 55,072 SMR01 discharge records, of which 49,850 (90.5%) had recorded a wait of six months or less for admission. Additional records received later will be included in future routine analyses and updates of the website. The figures for the quarter ended 31 December 2005 are therefore provisional, as the web pages make clear.</p>

  <p>The information <u>includes</u> patients with an Availability Status Codes (ASC) &ndash; which records circumstances where the waiting time guarantee does not apply (for example, where the patient had asked to postpone their admission at some point after they were added to the waiting list, where at some point they were medically unfit for a planned procedure, or where they had failed to attend for their treatment). The recorded waiting times of patients with an ASC are therefore likely to overstate the period of time for which they were waiting and available for treatment. Patients with an ASC are excluded from the Executive&rsquo;s in-patient and day case waiting time guarantee. The recording of ASCs on the SMR01 database is not mandatory and consistency of recording will vary across NHSScotland. ASCs cannot, therefore, be excluded from analyses of in-patient/day case waiting times.</p>

  <p>The SMR01 returns for the quarter ended 31 December 2005 do not record the number of patients who, on that date, were waiting more than six months for admission. A separate census of patients waiting at the quarter end date is taken and published. This is referred to as the in-patient/day case waiting list census and the relevant dataset is referred to as SMR3. SMR3 returns calculate waiting times from the date the patient was added to the waiting list to the census date. The SMR3 census for 31 December 2005 showed that, of patients who were still waiting at that date and who were covered by the in-patient and day case waiting times guarantee (that is, patients who did not have ASCs), two were waiting more than six months.</p>

  <p>The specific information requested is not readily available from central statistical returns. It is not currently possible to calculate the length of time that in-patients/day cases waited between GP referral and admission to hospital. However, information is available on the length of time that in-patients/day cases waited between the date they were placed on the waiting list and their date of admission.</p>

  <p>Table 1 shows the number and percentage of in-patients/day cases admitted within six months, from date placed on the waiting list to date of admission, for the last five financial years, broken down by quarter of discharge. The total number of in-patient/day case discharges in the period is also shown. All figures refer only to in-patients/day cases routinely admitted from home from the waiting list.</p>

  <p>The figures in the table <u>include</u> patients with an Availability Status Codes (ASC) &ndash; which records circumstances where the waiting time guarantee does not apply (for example, where the patient is medically unfit for a planned procedure).

  <p>The number of in-patients and day cases with a guarantee is currently measured by a quarterly in-patient/day case Waiting List Census (SMR3). The census records each patient waiting and how long they have been waiting on the last day of March, June, September and December and whether they have an Availability Status Code (ASC). Patients without an ASC have a guaranteed maximum wait, but patients referred to obstetric, psychiatric and long stay sectors are specifically excluded. The census information is reported by each unified NHS board to ISD and the figures are reported on ISD&rsquo;s website approximately seven weeks after the date of the census.</p>

  <p>Availability Status Codes can be applied in the following circumstances:</p>

  <p>ASC A: for patients with medical constraints that prevent admission for treatment</p>

  <p>ASC 2: where the patient has asked to defer admission for personal reasons or refused an offer of admission or an out-patient appointment has been rescheduled for his/her convenience</p>

  <p>ASC 3: in individual cases where, after discussion with the patient, the treatment has been judged of low medical priority</p>

  <p>ASC 4: for highly specialised treatments identified at time of placing the patient on a waiting list</p>

  <p>ASC 8: for patients who did not attend (DNAs)</p>

  <p>ASC 9: in the circumstances of exceptional strain on the NHS such as a major disaster, major epidemic or outbreak of infection, or service disruption by industrial action.</p>

  <p>Currently some 88 per cent of patients with an ASC have codes A, 2 and 8 and these situations are patient driven rather than NHS driven. I announced in December 2004 that ASCs will be abolished by 31 December 2007 and be replaced by a fairer and more transparent system. From 31 December 2007, patients will be treated within 18 weeks of being placed on the waiting list. Any periods of unavailability for treatment for medical, social or personal will be deducted from patients&rsquo; calculated waiting time. Patients who fail to attend or who refuse a reasonable offer of treatment may be referred back to the care of their GP.</p>

This programme aims to improve the skills and learning capacity of older workers (age 50 and over) through encouraging Sector Skills Councils to collaborate with colleges and learning providers to develop and deliver bite size or taster courses aimed at the older worker within their sector. This programme will fund proposals aimed at improving the employability skills of older people currently in work and will deliver a total of &pound;500,000 over the three financial years from 2005&ndash;08.

  <p>As part of the UK Government&rsquo;s consultation paper on planning gain supplement, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has indicated that it will introduce regulations to scale back the scope of planning obligations in England under section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. The decision whether to adopt a similar approach to planning agreements and future obligations under section 75 of the Town and Country Planning Act (Scotland) 1997 is a devolved matter. We have not come to any conclusion on this, and will do so in the light of the consultation responses and further discussions with the UK Government on how planning gain supplement will be designed and implemented.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has held general discussions with HM Treasury about the implications of the Barker Report, including the possible introduction of a Planning Gain Supplement (PGS). We were aware that the Chancellor&rsquo;s Pre-Budget Report. would include an announcement of a consultation on PGS.</p>

  <p>Discussions are on-going with HM Treasury on a number of aspects of the proposals, including the re-distribution of revenues raised. We will consider the outcome of these discussions, as well as the views of Scottish stakeholders expressed in the consultation. Once there are further details on the likely level and proposed treatment of the revenues raised, we will consider the mechanisms that might be applied to their distribution in Scotland. This consideration will necessarily cover the powers needed to implement them. At this stage, however, it is too early to assess the availability of appropriate powers.</p>

  <p>The standard form of PPP contract reflects key principles and terms used for PPP projects in all sectors and is adopted as a standard throughout the UK. The standard form includes provision for a variation and for the variation to be brought about in accordance with prescribed change procedures.</p>

  <p>The cost of any such change would be negotiated at the time, and there is no reason why the cost of undertaking the physical works should not be at the market rate prevalent at the time. The risks associated with the change would also need to be assessed so that the PPP contractor can bear such responsibilities for the remainder of the contract period. These may affect the life-cycle PPP contract and the risk transfer to the contractor may alter from the original position at contract signature. This may or may not result in additional costs to the public sector body. In a conventional procurement situation the responsible public body would have to take account of similar long-term service and cost implications of the change also.</p>

  <p><em>The Infrastructure Investment Plan,</em> which was published in February 2005, outlines the detail of the Executive&rsquo;s investment plans by ministerial portfolio and confirms the major investment opportunities available within Scotland. This is the first such <em>Plan </em> and it has been welcomed by industry, including small and medium-sized enterprises, as allowing them to improve their forward resource and tender plans. A copy of the plan can be found in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 35376).</p>

  <p>PPP are advertised in accordance with EC Procurement Directives. PPP projects tend to be large projects requiring main contractors to have experience of organising large and complex work programmes, and requiring significant balance sheets. Therefore there is limited opportunity for small and medium-sized companies to become directly involved in the PPP consortium, although a few Scottish regional companies have successfully developed into that market. Many new opportunities across a wide range of services have been created at sub-contractor level under use of PPP in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The development of sex and relationships education programmes, including specific teaching materials, is a matter for local authorities and schools. All schools are required to provide health education, including sex education, within the framework of Health Education 5-14 National Guidelines. Circular 2/2001 <em>Standards in Scotland&rsquo;s Schools etc. Act 2000: Conduct of Sex Education in Scottish Schools </em> sets out the framework for the development and delivery of sex and relationships education in Scotland.</p>

  <p>There are a number of continuing professional development (CPD) sex and relationships education courses available for teachers and as part of their contract, teachers are obliged to undertake 35 hours (CPD) each year.</p>

  <p>Healthy Respect, a National Health Demonstration Project on young people&rsquo;s sexual health is funded by the Scottish Executive and hosted by NHS Lothian. It aims to demonstrate how increasing young people&rsquo;s knowledge of sexual health issues through a multi-disciplinary approach to education, information and accessible services in a variety of settings can lead to improved sexual health and relationships. The learning from Healthy Respect will be shared across Scotland to enable other parts of the country to shape their own services according to local need.</p>

  <p>Healthy Respect and the Scottish Catholic Education Service are jointly supporting a project to develop appropriate sex and relationships education programmes in three Catholic secondary schools in Edinburgh and three in the West of Scotland. This project has been funded by the Scottish Executive (Health and Education Departments) over three years from 2005.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many people have been diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection in each of the last five years, broken down by infection type.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally. Sexually transmitted infections (STI) are treated in a number of locations in addition to genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics. These locations include family planning clinics and primary care settings. Data from these locations is incomplete and is not available by NHS board of residence.</p>

  <p>Data derived from GUM clinic attendances for acute and other STIs, broken down by infection type are available from the web on the Information and Statistics Division&rsquo;s Scottish Health Statistics at <a href="http://www.isdscotland.org/isd/info3.jsp?pContentID=2051&amp;p_applic=CCC&amp;p_service=Content.show&amp;" target="_blank">http://www.isdscotland.org/isd/info3.jsp?pContentID=2051&amp;p_applic=CCC&amp;p_service=Content.show&amp;</a></p>

  <p>This data is based on diagnoses.</p>

  <p>Laboratory data on the four main STIs, syphilis, gonorrhoea, chlamydia and genital herpes, are routinely collected by Health Protection Scotland (HPS). The number of positive laboratory reports for syphilis, gonorrhoea and genital herpes are very similar to diagnoses recorded at GUM clinics, but chlamydia, which is the most frequent single diagnosis in this age group, is more likely to be diagnosed in other settings. It is estimated that only 44% of chlamydia is diagnosed within GUM clinics. Laboratory data for 2000-04 can be obtained from Health Protection Scotland&rsquo;s Weekly Report at <a href="http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/scieh/PDF/pdf2005/0507.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/scieh/PDF/pdf2005/0507.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will provide a detailed breakdown of the public and private expenditure invested in Tartan Week and its activities and what mechanism is being used to analyse the return on this investment.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive budget for Tartan Week in 2006 is &pound;660,000. This is made up of &pound;560,000 in support for events around Tartan Week in New York and Washington DC and &pound;100,000 on marketing. This expenditure is allocated from the Finance and Central Services Department budget. The Scottish Executive&rsquo;s Analytical Services have developed a model for evaluating overseas events and programmes which looks at the planning, implementation and impact of events against their original objectives. This model sets out costs against outcomes for each year&rsquo;s Tartan Week programme. The evaluation report for Tartan Week 2005 will be available later this month.</p>
