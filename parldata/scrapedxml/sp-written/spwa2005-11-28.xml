  <p>We said in <em>Partnership for a Better Scotland</em> that we would work with local authorities to establish Business Improvement Districts (BIDs). We have done that. Following extensive consultation with business and local authorities, we announced in June 2005 that all the recommendations of a working group set up to consider the way forward for BIDs had been accepted. One of those recommendations was to establish pilot BID areas, and work on that front is now well underway.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Communities Scotland has published two pieces of guidance following recommendations from the research published by ODS and Stonewall. These comprise a guide for older LGBT people, as well as a good practice checklist for housing providers. Both were launched with the research report in Glasgow on 1 June 2005. This material has been welcomed by groups active in this field.</p>

  <p>Copies of the guidance has been disseminated to local authorities, housing associations and housing support providers and the older people&rsquo;s guidance has been disseminated through user groups and at events throughout the summer including the Pride Marches in Edinburgh and Aberdeen.</p>

  <p>The impact of price rises on fuel poverty depends on a number of factors including the energy efficiency of the home and household income. The Fuel Poverty in Scotland Report for the Scottish House Condition Survey estimates that an across the board rise of 5% would increase the number of fuel poor households by 30,000, assuming that incomes and household energy efficiency remains unchanged. We will review the case for further research into various aspects of fuel poverty in the context of decisions on the future of our central heating and warm deal programmes.</p>

  <p>The introduction of the ban on bird gatherings was in response to a European Commission decision. Given the precautionary approach being taken to minimise the risk of avian influenza spreading across Europe and the timescale presented by EU deadlines, no assessment was made.

  <p>VisitScotland promotes Scotland as a great country to visit both within the UK and overseas. VisitScotland&rsquo;s marketing strategy shows clear benefits to the Scottish economy with figures for the first half of 2005 showing an increase of 57% in the number of visitors from overseas compared to the comparative period for last year. Each &pound;1 spent by VisitScotland on its pan-European marketing campaign last year resulted in &pound;23 of additional tourism revenues spent in Scotland. The Scottish Executive remains committed to working in partnership with the tourism industry as it strives to achieve the ambition of increasing tourism revenues by 50% over the next decade.</p>

  <p>Many voluntary organisations benefit from continued long-term funding from Scottish Executive grant schemes. Before a decision is taken to renew funding, account is taken of the organisation&rsquo;s performance with its previous grant and the success and impact of its work. More generally, each request for grant funding is considered on merit, taking account of the quality of the application, whether the proposed work programme helps deliver policy objectives, ministerial priorities, the level of resources available for distribution and competing demand.</p>

  <p>In 2004 the Scottish Executive commissioned the consultancy firm GEN Consulting to monitor the effectiveness of the Scottish Compact. Work involved establishing a baseline of data on awareness of and compliance with the Compact by Scottish Executive Departments, non-departmental public bodies and agencies through questionnaires. The findings of the baseline research were published in 2005 and can be found at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/03/20869/54775" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/03/20869/54775</a></p>

  <p>The definition of a vulnerable adult in the proposed bill would be sufficiently broad to encompass those with a communication impairment who may need protection from harm.</p>

  <p>It is also intended that the Vulnerable Adults Bill will contain key guiding principles to ensure any intervention is both necessary and proportionate to the needs and circumstances of each individual.</p>

  <p>The EU Landfill Directive sets targets for the UK to reduce the amount of biodegradable municipal waste (BMW) going to landfill to:</p>

  <p>75% of 1995 levels by 2010</p>

  <p>50% of 1995 levels by 2013</p>

  <p>35% of 1995 levels by 2020.</p>

  <p>The National Waste Plan 2003 set an interim target to reduce landfill of biodegradable municipal waste to 1.5 million tonnes by 2006.</p>

  <p>The Landfill Allowance Scheme sets limits for individual authorities to meet these targets, by limiting their landfill of biodegradable municipal waste to their holding of landfill allowances. A total of 1.5 million tonnes of allowances has been issued for the 2006-07 scheme year. The total tonnes of biodegradable municipal waste which will be allowed to be landfilled in Directive target years are:</p>

  <p>1.32 million tonnes in 2009-10</p>

  <p>0.88 million tonnes in 2012-13</p>

  <p>0.62 million tonnes in 2019-20.</p>

  <p>In order to meet these targets local authorities have been awarded over &pound;329 million to 2007-08 through the Strategic Waste Fund to implement recycling and composting schemes. Indicative awards totalling nearly &pound;1 billion to 2020 have also been made. Further bids to the fund are requested from all local authorities by the end of January 2006 showing how they propose to divert waste from landfill.</p>
