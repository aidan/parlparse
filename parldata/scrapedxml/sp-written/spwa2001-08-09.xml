  <p>Comparing similar properties, office rentals in the centre of Edinburgh are usually higher than in other parts of Scotland. Whether a saving on office accommodation costs is achievable depends on the actual cost of existing accommodation and the cost of available alternatives elsewhere in Scotland. Given the range of variables it is not possible to provide a meaningful quantification of likely savings.</p>

  <p>Accommodation costs are only one part of the total running costs of an organisation. For example, the cost of moving existing staff can be significant. Whether there is an overall saving depends on the range of costs and savings identified.</p>

  <p>Removal of ozone depleting substances from waste fridges and freezers prior to disposal is the responsibility of the holders of the waste. EC Regulation 2037/2000 on substances that deplete the ozone layer requires that, after 31 December 2001, all ozone depleting substances must be recovered prior to dismantling or disposal of domestic refrigerators and freezers. Scottish local authorities which hold such waste will be required to comply with these requirements.</p>

  <p><i>Funding the Scottish Parliament, National Assembly for Wales and Northern Ireland Assembly - A Statement of Funding Policy </i> sets out the comparabilities that operate at a departmental level. These are based on sub-programme expenditure in the year before any review of expenditure. However, the comparability factor is only applied to the departmental change rather than individual changes in sub-programmes. Since most Whitehall departmental programmes are not fully analogous to Scotland it is very difficult to make comparisons between the Scottish budget and comparable UK spending.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not available. However, I can confirm that the UK exported approximately &#163;55 million worth of herring and mackerel in 2000. Of this, approximately &#163;14 million was exported to Russia which is an important market for Scottish pelagic fish.</p>

  <p>Yes. We have also confirmed that there is no scientific justification for the Russian ban. The Executive has no plans to request a meeting with the Russian government until British Embassy officials who are actively pursuing this matter through diplomatic channels indicate that any such meeting might be useful.</p>

  <p>We have no plans to advise health boards how they should spend any reserves which they may temporarily hold. It is for health boards to determine how to allocate the resources available to them on the basis of their assessment of local needs and priorities.</p>

  <p>Appropriate discharge of patients from hospital to other care settings continues to be a high priority for the NHS and social work authorities in Scotland. The quarterly census of patients waiting for discharge, and the Scottish Executive&#8217;s regular contact with health boards, NHS Trusts and social work authorities ensures that this matter is subject to regular scrutiny.</p>

  <p>VisitScotland has been consulted along with other interested organisations and individuals at each stage of the development of the draft Land Reform (Scotland) Bill. This includes early consultations by the Land Reform Policy Group as well as the White Paper and draft Bill stages in July 1999 and February 2001, respectively. VisitScotland is also a member of the Access Forum which has been active in assisting Scottish Natural Heritage in formulating its advice to ministers on access to the countryside and in drafting the Scottish Outdoor Access Code.</p>

  <p>The comments received from VisitScotland will be taken into account in finalising the legislation for introduction to the Parliament.</p>

  <p>At the end of July QMS launched its first strategic plan for the Scottish meat industry. The plan highlights strategic priorities and links in 26 specific objectives to these areas. The broad strategic priorities are Quality Assurance, Marketing, Industry Development, Effective Communication and Organisation Development. Examples of related specific objectives are enhancement of the scope and standards of quality assurance schemes, adoption of the &quot;Specially Selected Scotch&quot; brand across all three red meat sectors and develop and promote the primary themes affecting the Scottish Sheep industry identified in the Andrew Dewar-Durie Report.</p>

  <p>Coverage of the plan takes in the 3-year period from April this year to March 2004. While it is relatively early days, I believe that the positive and proactive approach which QMS have taken to addressing these targets will see their ultimate achievement, to the benefit of the whole of the Scottish meat industry.</p>

  <p>There are a number of ways in which this is being achieved. For example, <i>Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change</i> makes clear that all NHS employers will be required to meet or exceed best practice guidance on family-friendly policies as part of the new Staff Governance Standard. To help employers, guidance on family-friendly policies was issued in January covering areas such as flexible working, childcare, breast-feeding and career breaks. The guidance applies to all staff in NHSScotland.</p>

  <p>For the future, negotiations on Agenda for Change NHS Pay Modernisation are being addressed on a UK basis. The proposed new system will seek to underpin better career progression, modern conditions of service for staff and will ensure that all staff are rewarded fairly according to the work that they do and the contribution that they make rather than the title that they hold.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will make representations to Her Majesty&#8217;s Government to oppose the proposals by the European Union to ban the use of fishmeal in ruminant feeds and what information it has on the scientific basis of these proposals.</p>

  <p>In agreement with the Scottish Executive, the UK Government has made representations to the European Union on the fishmeal issue throughout the legislative process. As a result fishmeal has not been banned from feeding to non-ruminant livestock. The UK has raised the possibility of a relaxation of the ban on feeding fishmeal to ruminants in the Standing Veterinary Committee and the Council. In the Agricultural Council of 19 June the Commission promised to review this ban once a test had been validated that is capable of differentiating between animal and fish protein in feed. The UK uses an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to test compound animal feedingstuffs for the presence of mammalian protein, but this test has not yet been validated. Until this problem can be resolved we have no option but to implement the Community ban.</p>

  <p>The scientific basis for the ban on the use of fishmeal in ruminant feeds came from the EU Scientific Steering Committee, who considered possible scientific reasons for a general feed ban on meat and bone meal (MBM) to all farmed animals on 27/28 November 2000. Their opinion, which was published on the 29 November, stated that the risk of propagation of BSE and other transmissible spongiform encephalopathies was increased by the possibility of cross-contamination of animal feed. Cross contamination with possibly BSE contaminated ruminant MBM is a serious problem. A ban on the use of MBM containing feed for animals minimises this risk.</p>
