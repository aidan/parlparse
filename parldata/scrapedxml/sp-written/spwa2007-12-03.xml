  <p>This information is not collected. The vast majority of missions carried out by the Scottish Ambulance Service&rsquo;s air ambulance service are planned missions and are not time critical. For such missions, shift changes can be worked into the schedule of journeys to be undertaken within the timeframe for the response agreed with the clinician making the request.</p>

  <p>The duty hours of flight crew are regulated in law by the Civil Aviation Authority. The Scottish Ambulance Service has to ensure that its crews strictly adhere to the regulations in the interests of safety - of the patient, the aircraft and the crew. Some leeway does however exist where the condition of the patient is assessed by a clinician as &quot;life or limb threatening&quot;. In such circumstances the duty hours of the flight crew may be extended where that is required for the mission to be carried out within the timeframe requested by the clinician.</p>

  <p>This information is not collected. However, where there is likely to be a delay due to weather conditions, the Scottish Ambulance Service will discuss this with the clinician who is requesting transport. In circumstances where the clinician decides that the patient&rsquo;s condition is life or limb threatening then the Ambulance Service will follow its contingency which is to task the Ministry of Defence (MOD) or HM Coastguard to carry out the mission. In 2005-06, MOD/Coastguard were used on 115 occasions, in 2006-07, they were used 118 times and in the seven months to the end of October 2007 this has occurred on 51 occasions.</p>

  <p>The STAG appraisal undertaken in 2005 sought to establish the benefits of introducing a direct service between Mallaig to Lochboisdale that did not impact on other services on the network.</p>

  <p>The appraisal concluded that there were potential positive benefits to both the Western Isles and Mallaig. However the appraisal noted that a large proportion of the increase in economic activities in South Uist and Mallaig would be the result of displacement from communities served by existing ferry services. The appraisal also concluded that while there would be some demand for such a service the vast majority of demand would be displaced from existing services with little net increase in the number of trips.</p>

  <p>The main benefit to the community in Lochboisdale of a direct Lochboisdale to Mallaig ferry service would be a shorter crossing time.</p>

  <p>Spending on children&rsquo;s health services will be met by NHS Boards from within their general funding allocation and is not separately identified.</p>

  <p>In response to the National Delivery Plan for Specialist Children&rsquo;s Services, specific additional revenue funding of &pound;32 million is being provided over the period of the spending review to improve the quality of service provision, increase capacity in key areas and reduce inequalities in access. &pound;63.2 million capital funding is also being provided for the new children&rsquo;s hospital in Glasgow over the course of the spending review. The Scottish Government will at least match the previous administration&rsquo;s commitment of &pound;130 million for the children&rsquo;s hospital.</p>

  <p>The substantial funding included within the Scottish Government Budget to 2010-11 will ensure continuity of approach and investment on mental health and other priorities by NHS boards, local authorities and other partners.</p>

  <p>Funding now to be included within the overall local government finance settlement has been endorsed by both the Scottish Ministers and by the COSLA Presidential Team following detailed negotiation and which all believe will lead, over time, to significant benefits for users of all local government services.</p>

  <p>It remains the responsibility of each agency to work in partnership and to allocate funds from the total financial resources available to them on the basis of local needs, priorities and agreed targets including the Scottish Government&rsquo;s key strategic objectives and commitments.</p>

  <p>The Planning etc (Scotland) Act 2006 made new provision which, when implemented, will see the transfer of responsibility for neighbour notification of planning applications from the applicant to Planning Authorities. We will also implement measures to extend neighbour notification to notify owners, occupiers and neighbours of new site specific proposals in local development plans.</p>

  <p>On 31 October 2007 we published detailed proposals - including draft regulations &ndash; for implementing this change and others to the development planning system. We intend to issue a consultation paper in the near future on new development management procedures which will include detailed provisions on neighbour notification in relation to planning applications.</p>

  <p><em>Draft Regulations on Development Planning: Consultation</em> is available on the Scottish Government web pages at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/10/31093026/21" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/10/31093026/21</a>.</p>

  <p>A STAG appraisal would not be necessary in this case because no additional infrastructure would be required and instead it is likely to involve timetabling changes. However, a business case for any additional services would need to made.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Transport Appraisal Guidance (STAG) is focussed on identifying the appropriate solution to a transport problem. It is therefore independent of any particular type of solution. A STAG appraisal could therefore be used to assess the most appropriate solution to the transport problem in Mauchline, which may or may not be a new rail station.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive do not hold the information requested.</p>

  <p>Scottish Ministers became responsible for the ScotRail Franchise in November 2005. Passenger counts are carried out as part of the First ScotRail Franchise for train planning purposes.

  <p>I have asked James Hynd, Acting Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The amount of Community Regeneration Funding allocated to Community Planning Partnerships (CPPs) over the last two years is provided in the following table. Local authorities are the accountable body for this funding which is linked to each Partnership&rsquo;s Regeneration Outcome Agreement.</p>

  <p>As part of the recently completed Strategic Spending Review, the Scottish Government has announced a new &pound;145m per annum fund to regenerate communities and tackle poverty which will replace the Community Regeneration Fund (CRF). Allocations from the new fund will be notified to CPPs in due course.</p>

  <p>As an interim measure, one quarter of the baseline 2007-08 CRF allocation has been guaranteed for each CPP in advance of a final decision on allocation of the new Fund.</p>

  <p>Scottish Ministers propose to continue ring-fenced funding to local authorities for Private Sector Housing Grant until 2009-10.</p>

  <p>Proposed budgets for 2008-09 and 2009-10 are provided in the following table.</p>

  <p>Private Sector Housing Grant</p>

</table></p>

  <p>Under the Concordat agreed between Scottish Ministers and COSLA, the ring-fence around Private Sector Housing Grant will be removed from 1 April 2010, with the funding being absorbed into the main local government settlement.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will be providing local government in Scotland with record levels of funding over the period covered by the spending review 2008-11. The vast majority of the funding, including from 2010-11 the funding for Private Sector Housing Grant will be provided by means of a block grant. It is the responsibility of each local authority to allocate the total financial resources available to it on the basis of local needs and priorities having first fulfilled its statutory obligations and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities including the Scottish Government&rsquo;s key strategic objectives and manifesto commitments.</p>

  <p>We have recently announced a significant increase in the target for the generation of electricity from renewables to 50% by 2020, as well as a new interim milestone of 31% to be achieved by 2011. Progress towards these targets will be measured on the basis of whole consumption, which is Scottish demand including losses. This means that meeting the targets will require notably higher amounts of renewable capacity and output than under the previous method of calculation.</p>

  <p>Using the new method, in 2005, which is still the most recent year for which full generation and consumption figures are available, around 16% of electricity generated in Scotland came from renewable sources.</p>

  <p>Six major schemes to upgrade the A830 between Lochailort and Mallaig have been delivered since 1975. The seventh and final section is covered in the answer to question S3W-6721 on 3 December 2007. The original single-track status of the road and the variable traffic patterns make time savings difficult to determine over such a long timescale, but we calculate that peak-time savings over the past 10 and 15 years are in the region of 10.6 minutes and 14.5 minutes respectively.</p>

  <p>I held a very constructive meeting with Universities Scotland on 22 November 2007 covering a range of issues. I stated clearly to Universities Scotland that the Cabinet remains sympathetic to the sector in terms of additional funding from in-year flexibility for capital and potential consequentials in the years ahead. I am sympathetic on the issue of the specific cost pressures universities face in the first year of the settlement and I am willing to work creatively with the sector and the Funding Council on addressing this matter. Universities Scotland have committed to providing more detailed information to the Scottish Government on this issue so that it can be considered further.</p>

The vast majority of the funding, including the funding for implementation of the National Accommodation Strategy for Sex Offenders will be provided by means of a block grant.

Increasing participation is one of two national priorities in the Government&rsquo;s sport strategy and this is reflected in sportscotland&rsquo;s Corporate Plan which will inform future funding decisions.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government's policy proposal was to meet student loan repayments and not write-off in one amount the accumulated student loan debt. We are continuing to explore options for servicing the debt and we are planning to seek views of stakeholders on measures to tackle graduate debt through a consultation next year.</p>

  <p>The overall level of Scottish student loan debt from Scottish borrowers as at 31 March 2007 was &pound;1.95 billion. This figure is made up of debt held by the Scottish Government and of sold debt held by private sector institutions.</p>

  <p>We estimate the current cost to completely write-off this debt in one year would be approximately &pound;1.5 billion as the provisions for the interest subsidy, complete write-off provision and debt sale subsidy would be applied to reduce the total debt outstanding. These figures will continue to grow as more loans are advanced.</p>

  <p>We will be exploring this as part of a consultation on student support and graduate debt proposals that will be undertaken in 2008. The actual annual cost of any servicing agreement will depend on the outcome of this consultation.</p>

  <p>To provide some context, in the 2006-07 financial year &pound;51.5 million was repaid by Scottish student loan borrowers, an amount which we expect to increase over the spending review as more borrowers enter repayment.</p>

  <p>In addition to the allocations in 2005-06 local authorities were given a further</p>

  <p>&pound;12 million in pipeline funds unspent in 2004-05.</p>

  <p>Allocations to local authorities in 2007-08 were above the baseline at &pound;401 million.</p>

  <p>Under the Concordat agreed between Scottish Ministers and COSLA, the ring-fence around Supporting People will be removed from 1 April 2008, with the funding being absorbed into the main local government settlement.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will be providing local government in Scotland with record levels of funding over the period covered by the spending review 2008-11. The vast majority of the funding, including the funding for implementation of Supporting People will be provided by means of a block grant. It is the responsibility of each local authority to allocate the total financial resources available to it on the basis of local needs and priorities having first fulfilled its statutory obligations and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities including the Scottish Government&rsquo;s key strategic objectives and manifesto commitments.</p>

  <p>We will continue to work with local government, through COSLA, to develop policy in areas where local government has a key interest. Both sides will also work together to discuss and agree implementation and resource issues relating to these policy areas. It is recognised that, in some instances, whether through the development of new policy initiatives or for other reasons, there may be exceptional funding pressures which local authorities are unable to meet. In such cases, both sides agree that any difficulties will be addressed jointly between the Scottish Government and local government, as part of a developing mature relationship. That process will include a review of both finance available and of pressures. It will take into account, where appropriate, reviewing the pressures and/or released efficiencies in light of other ongoing initiatives such as in the work being taken forward to simplify the landscape.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government carries out an annual teacher workforce planning exercise that underpins advice to the Scottish Funding Council (SFC) on intakes to teacher training courses including the 1 year professional graduate diploma course. Ministers have yet to receive the final advice of the planning exercise and have yet to issue advice to the SFC on intakes to teacher training courses in 2008-09 and subsequent years. However it is anticipated over the 2007-11 period over 20,000 will enter teacher training. On-going work on teacher workforce planning will determine final figures.</p>

  <p>The total number of training places allocated at any university in any year is a matter for the Scottish Funding Council. However it is anticipated over the 2007-11 period over 20,000 will enter teacher training. Ongoing work on teacher workforce planning will determine final figures.</p>
