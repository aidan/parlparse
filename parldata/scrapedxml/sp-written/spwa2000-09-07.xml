  <p>We do not propose to ask the Scottish Environment Protection Agency to waive the annual charge under the Groundwater Regulations 1998. It remains our policy that SEPA should move towards full recovery of the costs of regulation in line with the polluter pays principle.</p>

  <p>At &pound;123, the annual charge, which covers the cost of periodic inspections for monitoring purposes, is considerably lower than originally proposed during public consultation on the Groundwater Regulations. A number of special arrangements have, nevertheless, been made in Scotland to ease the burden of the Groundwater Regulations. Smaller farmers and crofters can share one set of charges by working collectively to dispose of spent sheep dip, thus reducing substantially the amount they pay each year. The annual charge was also waived in Scotland in 1999-2000 while SEPA determined the first tranche of applications.</p>

  <p>Improvements in survival from cancer are already evident. For example, five-year survival from breast cancer is now 75%, compared to 66% in the 1980s. Cervical cancer incidence and deaths have been reduced by 34% since 1986. In men with testicular cancer, more than 90% are alive after five years. These improvements reflect better treatment as well as earlier diagnosis for most cancers.</p>

  <p>A great deal of work is under way to achieve the target set in <i>Towards a Healthier Scotland</i>. Health boards are working in partnership with other agencies to promote healthy lifestyles in relation to diet and nutrition, smoking cessation and physical exercise, all of which have been shown to reduce the risk of cancer. A range of measures are in place to raise awareness and to encourage people to recognise symptoms and seek early advice.</p>

  <p>More generally, the Executive have made clear our continuing commitment to the Scottish breast and cervical screening programmes, a pilot programme of colorectal cancer screening, the introduction of cancer Managed Clinical Networks underpinned by planned programmes of audit and quality assurance, SIGN Guidelines, the development and monitoring of clinical standards through the Clinical Standards Board and the establishment of additional one-stop clinics to reduce waiting times for cancer diagnosis and treatment.</p>

  <p>The work of the Scottish Cancer Group will continue to inform policy and investment decisions and provide a strategic framework for the development of cancer services across Scotland. With regard to prevention, the focus now being placed on public health, including the creation of a Public Health Institute for Scotland, will help to drive further improvements in lifestyle and life circumstances which will help to reduce the incidence of cancer in future.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive recognises that modern acute hospital care for elderly patients must be supported by rehabilitation that meets individual need. This position was set out clearly in the report of the Acute Services Review, which identified the value of initiatives designed to provide support and rehabilitation at home immediately following discharge, and also revalue of both &#8211; acute rehabilitation for older people with more complex needs. Our work on modernising the NHS in Scotland provides a context in which to build on such developments and further strengthen the links between acute and primary care in the interests of older patients. This approach to the concept of intermediate care takes account of Scottish circumstances and innovations in the pursuit of high quality and cost-effective care designed to maintain access to acute services for older people and at the same time maximise their subsequent independence.</p>

We are working to put in place policies which will help older people play their full part in our society, extending opportunities to work, learn and volunteer, improving health care, providing more transport choice and making public services more responsive. We have been listening to older people and what we have heard will help guide our policies in the future.</p>

  <p>The Executive recognises that the semiconductor industry is extremely important to the Scottish economy. Our comprehensive programme for promoting the industry has resulted in Scotland enjoying the largest concentration of semiconductor plants in Europe.</p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise has identified semiconductors as one of its key clusters and has, for example, provided &pound;25 million of support to the world leading Alba Centre, based in Livingston. This is in addition to just under &pound;20 million of Regional Selective Assistance from the Executive.</p>

  <p>The announcement earlier this week of Motorola&#8217;s major research and development centre in Livingston, creating 550 new jobs, shows that the industry in Scotland continues to move forward.</p>

  <p>We expect to publish our Scottish Forestry Strategy in the autumn. We are still working on the strategy, taking account of all the points that have been raised during the consultation process, and so it is not possible to give precise details about the content of the final version. The strategy will be our framework for taking forestry forward in Scotland. It will therefore not include detailed implementation plans or mechanisms for any particular aspects, but it will include indicators of progress. Our achievements will depend, in part, on the resources that are available, but specific commitments will be given in other documents, such as the Forestry Commission&#8217;s Corporate Plan and the action plan for the forestry industries&#8217; cluster that is being developed by Scottish Enterprise and the Forest Industries Development Council, as well as individual forest plans.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, our draft strategy, which I issued for consultation earlier this year, covered all these issues. Indeed, the draft specifically identified developing the timber transport infrastructure, developing products that meet market needs, the expansion of well designed production forests, securing investment in wood processing, creating wider employment opportunities, and tackling deer problems as priorities for action. The draft also recognised the importance of protecting archaeological sites and transforming plantation forests; the Forestry Commission already provides detailed guidance on both of these issues in its publications.</p>

  <p>About 10,000 hectares of new woodland is created in Scotland each year. We have no plans to double this rate of new planting. Should we wish to consider such a change to our current programme we would, of course, examine the implications for other forms of agricultural land use and for the environment before making any changes.</p>

  <p>The indicative forestry strategies published during the 1990s identified over 850,000 hectares of land as preferred for new planting; this is more than sufficient for the current rate of planting of about 10,000 hectares per year. The Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations have been fully implemented; under these regulations the need for an assessment is established on a case-by-case basis.</p>

Obviously the amount of carbon absorbed would increase if the area planted increased. We are continuing to investigate carbon sequestration by trees, and the Forestry Commission is studying how different forms of forest management affect the amount of carbon absorbed by a forest. Nevertheless, reducing carbon emissions in the first place remains our main priority.</p>

  <p>One of the priorities for action identified in the draft Scottish Forestry Strategy was to extend and enhance native woodland by developing Forest Habitat Networks. Assuming that this is included in the final strategy, the Forestry Commission will use the Woodland Grant Scheme to encourage landowners to contribute to developing such networks. The value of the grants awarded would depend on the number, size and quality of the applications received. If the total of all the grants for approved applications under the Woodland Grant Scheme exceeds the budget in any one year, some applicants will be asked to accept payments in future years.</p>

  <p>The Executive has already advised the Dunaskin Industrial Heritage Museum that it will not provide resources to keep the museum financially viable. In supporting the Scottish Mining Museum, we made it clear that the resources were given in exceptional circumstances and should not be seen as setting a precedent by any other museums or the Scottish Mining Museum. The pressures in the museums and galleries sector were recognised in the National Cultural Strategy and further detailed consideration is being given to them.</p>

  <p>All three surgeons have spent periods of training in transplant centres in the past and therefore have some experience of heart transplantation. The purpose of the latest training, tailored to each surgeon&#8217;s needs, is to provide an update on recent developments in the techniques used in the assessment of patients for surgery, in the surgery itself and in the ongoing post-operative surveillance and immunosuppression treatment which is so critical to the success of transplantation surgery.</p>

  <p>In parallel, a number of nursing staff are also attending the Freeman Hospital to undertake refresher or additional training to ensure skills are maintained or enhanced.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is currently developing a database of poverty related information for Scotland with assistance from the DSS and Inland Revenue. It is considering a wide range of currently available data sources in addition to the option of boosting existing surveys for Scotland, and introducing new data collections. A project is currently underway to investigate the possibility of using the Scottish Household Survey dataset to produce relevant analysis. An area of priority within the Executive is to develop a more comprehensive range of local area data. Information on poverty will be covered by this initiative.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive provides for the additional costs to councils serving remote and dispersed rural and island communities through special measures in the local government finance distribution formula. Adjustments redistribute around &pound;40 million of grant support towards rural councils each year, helping to meet additional service costs and hold down council tax levels. Additional assistance, totalling over &pound;24 million this year, is provided through the Special Islands Needs Allowance to compensate councils with significant islands costs. A review of the level and distribution of SINA is due to be completed this year.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Executive is providing record levels of support for lifeline air and ferry services and through the Rural Transport Fund, &pound;14.6 million in new investment over three years from 1998-99 to improve transport links in rural Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Association of Visiting Committees for Scottish Penal Establishments is, and has been since its creation in 1988, independent of the Scottish Prison Service. Although funded by SPS, the association is wholly separate from it, and its members are appointed by individual visiting committees to represent their interests.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service, to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Only one prisoner has escaped from Scottish Prison Service custody while in transit between court and prison in the last three years; this took place earlier this year. The incident took place in Strathclyde police force area, and in East Renfrewshire local authority area.

  <p>The Scottish Executive has appointed Deloitte and Touche to undertake an independent study of the entire process this year from the point at which assessments or initial examination markings were passed to the Scottish Qualifications Authority to the issue of examination results. We have also brought forward the quinquennial Policy and Financial Management Review of the Scottish Qualifications Authority due in 2002 to enable us to examine, in particular, its structure and functions and its accountability to Ministers. The Scottish Executive has also agreed to the request by the interim Chief Executive of the Scottish Qualifications Authority that a senior official of the Executive should participate in the internal review which he has set in hand. Separate from consideration of the problems which have arisen with the issue of examination results, we announced in March 2000 that there would be a review of all aspects of experience of the first year of implementation of Higher Still and that review has begun.</p>

  <p>Following on from last year&#8217;s planning cycle with the Drug Action Teams, seven out of the 22 specifically refer to volatile substance abuse in their corporate action plans.</p>

  <p>Volatile substance abuse is seen as a high priority by the Executive, and we will be asking all 22 Drug Action Teams a specific VSA question on the year 2000 template, due to be issued in September. The returns in December will be analysed by the Public Health Directorate, which will consider what further action is required to tackle VSA across Scotland.</p>

  <p>According to the Scottish Drugs Forum&#8217;s <i>Directory of Specialist Helping Agencies</i> , there are approximately 85 treatment services available in Scotland which address volatile substance abuse. The Scottish Executive does not directly fund any of these services, but it core-funds the Scottish Drugs Forum which maintains a close interest on volatile substance abuse through the Scottish Volatile Substance Use Working Group. The Executive also supports the work of the Drug Action Teams which, as a point of their remit, are expected to address volatile substance abuse at local level.</p>

  <p>Each party to the planning appeal process is required to meet its own expenses. The Scottish Executive Inquiry Reporters Unit meets the cost of providing a Reporter and associated administration of the inquiry including advertising the inquiry arrangements and hire of the venue. The costs of the public inquiry and planning appeal into the route of the City of Edinburgh Rapid Transit scheme are therefore for the respective parties to meet. The extent of such costs will depend upon, for example, the number of parties involved; the complexity of the issues raised; and duration of the inquiry. The City of Edinburgh Council will not be able to use resources awarded under the Transport Challenge Fund to meet the cost of its participation in this inquiry.</p>

  <p>Along with his partners in EMBT-RMJM, Enric Miralles contributed to the formal Stage D (scheme design) drawings both before his illness, and during his period of recuperation following surgery in America. These drawings were approved by the client on 20 June 2000 and are available for inspection. The SPCB has no reason to seek any ancillary material from the architect in support of that submission.</p>
