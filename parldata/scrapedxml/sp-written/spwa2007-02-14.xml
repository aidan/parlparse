  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the Accountant in Bankruptcy has the power to consider what remedies are available to Farepak customers in Scotland in receipt of benefits under the Social Security Administration Act 1992 with regard to recovering monies lost and, if so, what action the Accountant in Bankruptcy has taken in this respect.</p>

  <p>Corporate insolvency, such as the Farepak Administration, is reserved for the UK Parliament under Schedule 5 of the Scotland Act 1998 and as such the Accountant in Bankruptcy does not have any powers to assist Farepak customers.</p>

  <p>The Accountant in Bankruptcy, as trustee in a personal sequestration, can make a claim in the administration of Farepak where the debtor is due monies. This would be on the same basis as all other Farepak customers and would be treated as an unsecured creditor&rsquo;s claim in the administration. In a sequestration where the debtor had made payments solely out of social security benefits to Farepak, any money recovered would be returned to the debtor under section 187 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many Single Farm Payment (SFP) claimants have had penalties applied for errors found within their completed (a) 2005 and (b) 2006 SFP forms; what the total sum was of these penalties, and whether it will make a ministerial statement on this matter.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2007-02-14.S2W-31451.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80032" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-07/wa0214.htm#2">

  <p>The extent of penalties applied under the arrangements for the Single Farm Payment Scheme (SFPS) and arising from errors in completing the Single Application Form etc are as follows:</p>

  <p>2005: 362 Businesses - Total &pound;581,918.982006: 320 Businesses - Total &pound;676,184.69.These figures should be viewed in the context that they have been applied within the framework created by European Commission regulations to deal with non-compliance with scheme conditions. The current penalty regime (which is very similar to that operated under the previous regime) is shaped to address over-declaration of land areas that would otherwise lead to inflated subsidy payments under SFPS (a land-based scheme). The correct declaration of land areas, therefore, is key to the Single Farm Payment Scheme and my department supplies farm businesses with extensive information on how to complete their applications forms and further guidance is available from local offices. Ultimately, however, it is the producers&rsquo; responsibility to ensure that applications for subsidy are completed properly.Whilst it is unfortunate for the businesses concerned that penalties have been applied, it is worth noting that the overwhelming majority of producers complete their applications properly. The figures for 2005 and 2006 shown above represent 1.7% and 1.5% respectively of all businesses submitting Single Application Forms and 0.14% and 0.15% respectively of the total amount claimed.If any business feels that decisions by the Environment and Rural Affairs Department (SEERAD) on issues affecting their subsidy are wrong, they have recourse to the Agricultural Subsidies (Appeals) (Scotland) Regulations 2000. This provides an accessible and affordable way for producers to challenge SEERAD&rsquo;s decisions to refuse, reduce, or recover support and allow many appeals to be resolved without the need for expensive judicial involvement. The process consists of three stages: an internal SEERAD review; a review by an external panel, and an appeal to the Scottish Land Court.</p>

  <p>This information is provided in table 5.3 of <em>Use of Antisocial Behaviour Orders in Scotland: Report of the 2004-05 Survey </em> and table 4.1 of <em> Use of Antisocial Behaviour Orders in Scotland: Report of the 2005-06 Survey</em> which are available on the Scottish Executive website. These data are based on research on the Use of Antisocial Behaviour Orders and are an estimate of the breach rate. This research suggests that nationally, 31% of orders were allegedly breached in 2005-06 and 26% were breached in 2004-05. However, current data recording practices suggest that the data is incomplete and the figures given are an underestimate of true breach rates.</p>

  <p>To obtain more reliable data on breach rate, further research on the outcome of ASBOs has been included in the new criminal justice research programme and, subject to obtaining the necessary access to records, is expected to begin within the next six months. This research would involve tracking a sample of orders to completion to examine breach rate and outcome of breach hearings in more detail. It will also explore how breach data can be routinely collected in future and make recommendations about improving current monitoring practices.</p>

  <p>Information about private sector installations is held by main postcode area. In the ML postcode area a total of 2,874 households in the private sector are now centrally heated as a result of the central heating programme.</p>

  <p>In the public sector North Lanarkshire Council have installed 291 central heating systems, South Lanarkshire have installed 3,117 systems and housing associations installed 105 systems.</p>

  <p>In the ML postcode area a total of 5,933 households across all sectors benefited from Warm Deal insulation measures provided through the Managing Agent.

  <p>The Executive gave careful consideration to the proposal of 9 January 2007 from One Plus for a refinancing of the company.</p>

  <p>The key factors in arriving at a decision on the refinancing were whether it was a proper role for the Executive to support One Plus in the way it proposed, with particular reference to state aid rules, and the level of risk associated with the proposal put forward by One Plus. Feedback from local authorities that support should be focused on securing continuity of services, rather than re-financing, was also an important factor.</p>

  <p>We have put in place a number of initiatives to address problems of access to NHS dental services in some parts of Scotland.

  <p>Defining &quot;dangerous and persistent offenders&quot; depends on the circumstances of the individual cases and assessments of the risk posed. That is why the Executive has introduced internationally recognised tools for the agencies involved in the assessment and management of offenders and trained them in their use.

  <p>Statistics on patients on in-patient/day case and out-patient waiting lists are routinely published on ISD&rsquo;s website: <a href="http://www.isdscotland.org/waiting_times" target="_blank">http://www.isdscotland.org/waiting_times</a> .</p>

  <p>Statistics are published on the total number of patients waiting, and on the subset of patients who are subject to waiting times guarantees. ISD do not &quot;disregard&quot; any data in publishing waiting list information on this site and aim to present what is of utmost interest and validity. ISD review the range of statistics published to ensure its continued relevance. Full details of the selection criteria for waiting list analyses are included on the website.</p>

  <p>The statistics are sourced from two schemes: the in-patient and day case census (SMR3) and the out-patient waiting list census.</p>

  <p>The purpose of the in-patient and day case census is to collect data on all patients waiting for in-patient or day case admission in any specialty in any hospital in NHSScotland.</p>

  <p>The out-patient waiting list census was set up in 2004 to monitor the out-patient waiting list guarantee. The census has the facility to capture information on patients outwith the scope of the guarantee, but submissions of data on specialties not covered by the guarantee are very patchy and vary between NHS boards. Technical issues have led to specific services being excluded from the census on grounds of data quality. In particular, data from Edinburgh Dental Institute, and primary care specialties in Fife have been excluded since the beginning of the collection. Data from some specialties in South Glasgow are also missing from earlier censuses. Full details of coverage are published on ISD&rsquo;s waiting times web pages: <a href="http://www.isdscotland.org/waiting_times" target="_blank">http://www.isdscotland.org/waiting_times</a>.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2007-02-14.S2W-31564.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80064" speakername="Lewis Macdonald" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-07/wa0214.htm#22">

  <p>There have been 12 meetings of the group since its inception in September 2005 and minutes appear on the website after they have been formally cleared.</p>

  <p>The remit of the group focuses on addressing the adult needs of those who have been sexually abused as children. However, it is recognised that sexual abuse may incorporate psychological and physical abuse.</p>

  <p>The expertise of the Cross Party Group was used to define the core membership, which is largely unaltered. Some additions were made, for example, a representative from the Scottish Association for Mental Health. There are currently 25 members, 17 of whom are external, representing health and local authorities, and the following of voluntary sector groups: the Moira Anderson Foundation; Kingdom Abuse Survivors Project, No More Secrets; SAY Women; Victim Support Scotland; M-Line, and Children 1st. Given the sensitivity, members who are abuse survivors are not identified but some have experience of being in care settings. There have been no resignations.</p>

  <p>To ensure that the strategy is co-ordinated, there are six Scottish Executive members representing community care, sexual and mental health, criminal justice and children and families. In addition there are two lead professionals (each employed one day per week) whose role is to implement agreed action points as laid out in the Strategy and agreed with the Reference Group. One of the lead professionals has been employed in other areas of the Scottish Executive to conduct research in the past.</p>

  <p>In addition to full membership, relevant speakers and other contributors are co-opted to task groups as necessary. Other organisations wishing to contribute to the strategy implementation will be able to do so through the forthcoming national conference on 28 February and through the expanding network to be routed through the website.</p>

  <p>It is anticipated that the Reference Group will conclude its business by April 2009.</p>

  <p>The &pound;2 million Survivors Fund is the total budget available to the Strategy. &pound;60,007 has been spent to date on lead professional salaries, expenses (for example accommodation for service users attending meetings), and setting up a website that will go live shortly. The group has also taken time and care to devise the criteria for a Development Fund. Applications are currently being sought for new, innovative services as well as supporting existing fragile initiatives through demonstration projects. It is anticipated that these will absorb the bulk of the monies available. The fund was launched on 26 January and closes on 31 March 2007. As yet, no applications have been received but there is a keen interest as evidenced by requests for application forms.</p>

  <p>There is no requirement that an organisation has charitable status to be eligible for application to the Survivors Fund, but there will need to be satisfactory evidence that the organisation meets the criteria as laid out in the fund guidelines.</p>

  <p>It was considered that some comments made about the booklet, <em>A Can of Worms</em> , raised issues that required further consideration. I instructed officials to convene a review group to consider those issues further. The booklet addresses an important need and the review group is considering whether changes are required to improve the booklet and, if so, to agree what the changes should be.</p>

  <p>The group met twice in 2006, on 13 October and on 11 December, and has agreed to take forward its work into 2007.</p>
