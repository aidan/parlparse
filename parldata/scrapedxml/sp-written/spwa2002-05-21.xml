  <p>We made a <i>Programme for Government</i> commitment to expand support for families and very young children through family centres and mobile and outreach services, for at least 5,000 additional children by 2002. The findings of the first phase of the Sure Start Scotland evaluation confirm that we have already exceeded this target. Over 9,000 additional children received support in the first year of implementation of Sure Start Scotland (1999-2000). This increased to over 15,000 additional children in the second year (2000-01). During this period over 6,000 additional parents were supported. The figures cover a wide range of provision which vary in intensity, from one-off interventions to sustained support over a long period.</p>

  <p>We are today publishing the summary report of the evaluation, <i>Mapping Sure Start Scotland</i>, and I have arranged for a copy to be placed in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 20952).</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive condemns bullying of any sort and in any sector of education.</p>

  <p>All schools should develop, in consultation with all members of the school community, a clear anti-bullying policy. As a matter of good practice we would expect schools to have developed specific guidelines about how homophobia should be tackled. Current Scottish Executive initiatives aimed at tackling bullying within Scotland's schools include the Scottish Anti-Bullying Network (ABN), the Scottish Schools Ethos Network (SSEN), the recommendations contained in the Discipline Task Group report <i>Better Behaviour - Better Learning</i>, and the underwriting of ChildLine's dedicated bullying helpline. The ABN has developed guidelines on homophobic bullying to help schools to develop good practice in this area.</p>

  <p>Higher education institutions and colleges of further education are autonomous organisations and are individually responsible for matters relating to the safety of both staff and students, including the application of relevant legal provisions relating to employment, the avoidance of discrimination, and health and safety.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does recommend that all education authorities and schools in Scotland have effective anti-bullying polices in place.

  <p>In 2001-02, 36 confiscation orders totalling almost &#163;800,000, were made by the courts, mainly against persons convicted of drug offences, a marked increase over previous years. The Proceeds of Crime Bill, currently before the Westminster Parliament, will provide wide-ranging new powers to investigate, recover and confiscate the proceeds of crime. The Scottish Drugs Enforcement Agency has also recently established a money laundering unit, with partners from other enforcement agencies including the National Criminal Intelligence Service, actively to target criminals and criminal organisations who engage in drug trafficking and other serious crime in Scotland, identify the assets gained illegally and, where appropriate, make these available to the courts for confiscation or civil forfeiture.</p>

  <p>At least three year&#146;s accident figures are required in order to see how well a route accident reduction plan (RARP) is performing. An analysis of the accident figures for pre-1999 RARPs has been prepared to illustrate the reduction, or otherwise, of injury accidents along these lengths of road. The figures may be distorted by traffic growth, development in the vicinity, treatment of accident cluster sites and the carrying out of improvement schemes or major maintenance, but they do suggest that some RARPs have worked and some have not. They are attempting to deal with the most difficult type of accident to treat &#150; the random occurrence of crashes along a length of road. The effectiveness of various types of treatment in different locations is being monitored, and should result in more effective investment in such schemes in the future.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive <a name="QuestionText">whether local authorities will be encouraged to ensure that owners of private hire cars display plates on the exterior of their vehicles which easily identify them as such and whether the display of such plates would be beneficial to public safety and the easy identification of such vehicles, detailing the reasons behind its position on this matter.</a></p>

  <p>Within the licensing framework of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982, it is for individual local authorities to determine what plates should be issued for taxi and private hire car vehicles and how these should be displayed. While it is clearly in the public interest for such vehicles to be readily identifiable we believe that, because licensing requirements vary considerably between areas, local authorities are best placed to determine the precise arrangements for their area.</p>
