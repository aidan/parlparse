  <p>The best means of reducing emergency cases is to improve the management of asthma. The Executive endorses the recommendations of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network on self-management and is funding the Scottish Asthma Management Initiative, one aim of which is to help General Practitioners to identify suitable patients and devise self-management regimes. A newly approved project, &quot;Asthma Attack - Targeting Emergency Asthma Contacts in Children&quot;, will be looking specifically at emergency cases involving children with a view to reducing the numbers of such cases.</p>

  <p>The Executive also provides grant funding to the National Asthma Campaign Scotland, which works to support people with asthma and encourage them to take control of the condition.</p>

  <p>I announced on 21 March the formation of a Standing Committee, under the chairmanship of Sir John Arbuthnott, to keep both the formula for the allocation of resources to NHSScotland and the information used to support the formula under review.</p>

  <p>To date the committee has met twice but has not yet reached any conclusions on the matters it is considering and therefore has neither reported to me nor made any recommendations to me. However, I understand, that one of the issues discussed at the committee&#8217;s meeting earlier this month was how the work of the committee could be made public and it was agreed that the Scottish Health on the Web (SHOW) website would be the most suitable vehicle for this purpose. The committee will therefore be publishing a newsletter, outlining its work, on SHOW, in due course.</p>

  <p>Forces have sufficient funds to meet the existing policing requirements of their area and funding for the police service is currently at record levels. However, all forces continually review their requirements in light of local needs and circumstances. Where new pressures arise, the cost of which might distort the expenditure of the force concerned, there are provisions for Scottish ministers to consider the implications for that force&#8217;s budget. That process is an on-going one.</p>

  <p>I am aware that the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) does support prisoner involvement in a number of exhibitions and competitions annually. However, the particular exhibition referred to was thought likely to cause considerable public offence. The view of SPS was that families of victims of crime in particular, but also members of the general public, could reasonably be expected to find this proposition distasteful. Prisoner art displayed in a Scene of the Crime exhibition to be woven into a Murder Mystery Tour by a well known crime writer was not considered an appropriate context for the display of prisoner art in Scotland.</p>

  <p>I am satisfied that the SPS reached a reasonable decision in these particular circumstances.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS), to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The social work cost per prisoner is not a figure that is kept by SPS because the needs of individual prisoners and therefore costs are extremely variable, dependent, for example, on whether they are subject to post-release supervision and their level of vulnerability.</p>

  <p>The cost of social work to all SPS establishments from 31 March 2000 to 1 April 2001 (the first year these figures were sought) amounted to over &#163;2 million. The average prison population during this period within SPS establishments was approximately 5,600.</p>

  <p>The cost for social work at HM Prison, Kilmarnock is not included in this figure as it is not an SPS managed establishment.</p>

  <p>Note: The figures in the table are not directly comparable. In 1998-99 and in 1999-2000, some fees were means tested. The balance of fee payments was for continuing students. In 2000-01, the agency paid the full tuition fee for all eligible domiciled Scottish students. This included EU students.</p>

  <p>WRc&#8217;s (Water Research Centre) <i>Review of the Scientific Evidence relating to the Controls on the Agricultural Use of Sewage Sludge</i> reported in 1998. It concluded that there is no direct evidence in the UK of adverse human health effects resulting from the transmission of pathogens from sludge.</p>

  <p>In addition, UK Water Research Industry Limited (UKWIR) is currently carrying out research to characterise the risks associated with the beneficial use of sewage sludge in agriculture. This study will be the subject of an independent peer review by the Advisory Committee on Microbiology and Safety in Food.</p>

  <p>Risks are minimised when sludge is applied to agricultural land by complying with the sludge (Use in Agriculture) Regulations 1989, the associated Code of Practice and the &quot;Safe Sludge Matrix&quot;. The matrix has been agreed between Water UK representing the water industry in the UK and the British Retail Consortium representing the major food retailers. It sets out the minimum acceptable level of treatment for any sewage sludge which is to be used in agriculture depending on the type of crop.</p>

  <p>WRc&#8217;s (Water Research Centre) <i>Review of the Scientific Evidence relating to the Controls on the Agricultural Use of Sewage Sludge</i> reported in 1998. It concluded that there is no direct evidence in the UK of adverse human health effects resulting from the transmission of pathogens from sludge. In addition, UK Water Research Industry Limited (UKWIR) is currently carrying out research to characterise the risks associated with the beneficial use of sewage sludge in agriculture. This study will be the subject of an independent peer review by the Advisory Committee on Microbiology and Safety in Food.</p>

  <p>The Water Environment and Water Services Bill, which we plan to introduce to Parliament next year, will provide a new structure to protect Scotland&#8217;s water environment in a consistent and integrated manner. Measures in the bill, or related secondary legislation, may affect the treatment of sewage.</p>

  <p>We issued a consultation paper, <i>Rivers, Lochs Coasts: the Future for Scotland&#8217;s Waters</i>,<i> </i>on 29 June, outlining our policy intentions for the Bill. The paper is available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 14576).</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive plans to incorporate the provisions of the Safe Sludge Matrix into revised regulations, which govern the application of sewage sludge on agricultural land. The matrix, which bans the use of untreated sewage sludge in agriculture and details restrictions on the use of two levels of treated sewage sludge, has been established following agreement between the water industry in the UK and the British Retail Consortium, which represents the food industry.</p>
