  <p>Panel members are normally recruited up to the age of 60 and will not usually be re-appointed beyond the 15 May following their 65 birthday. However, if recommended by a Children&#146;s Panel Advisory Committee (CPAC), appointments may be made up to the age of 62 for new applicants. Reappointment of serving panel members beyond their 65 birthday may also be approved subject to a recommendation by a CPAC. Reasons might include recruitment or retention difficulties affecting the balance of skills and experience, age or gender of the panel. This change was notified to CPACs on 18 August 2000. The circular is currently being updated to reflect this and other changes.</p>

  <p>We will continue to keep under review the evidence as it emerges on the benefits of siting automated external defibrillators in public places. A recent Scottish study suggests, however, that additional resources for wide-scale coverage of public access defibrillators are probably not justified by the marginal improvement in survival.</p>

  <p>As with all medicines, the safety of Seroxat (paroxetine) is continually monitored by the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) and the independent expert advisory body, the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM).</p>

  <p>The CSM reviewed the issue of withdrawal reactions and possible dependence with Seroxat and the other Selective Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) in 1998-99 and concluded that all SSRIs may be associated with withdrawal reactions on stopping, but they are not drugs of dependence. As a result of the review product information was updated.</p>

  <p>Similarly, in 2000, the European scientific advisory committee, the Committee on Proprietary Medicinal Products carried out a detailed review of withdrawal reactions and possible dependence with the SSRIs. The available evidence did not suggest that the SSRIs caused dependence. The results of the review can be found on the European Medicines Evaluation Agency website at: <a href="http://www.emea.eu.int/" target="_blank">www.emea.eu.int</a>.</p>

  <p>Also in 2000, the MCA/CSM reminded prescribers about withdrawal reactions associated with the SSRIs in an article in the drug safety bulletin <i>Current Problems in Pharmacovigilance</i>. This bulletin can be accessed on the MCA/CSM website at: <a href="http://www.mca.gov.uk/" target="_blank">www.mca.gov.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>The MCA and the CSM will continue to assess any new data that emerge on these important issues.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive attaches very considerable importance to the effective implementation of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 which received Royal Assent on 24 July. The act enhances the powers to confiscate assets following conviction, strengthens police powers of investigation, introduces new powers of civil recovery and cash seizure, and allows for the taxation of suspected criminal assets.</p>

  <p>The intention is to bring the cash seizure provisions in part 5 of the act and the money laundering provisions in part 7 into operation in December 2002. The bulk of the rest of the act will be implemented by February 2003. The existing Crown Office Criminal Confiscation Unit is being strengthened and a new Civil Recovery Unit set up. A major training exercise involving procurators fiscal, police, customs and excise officers and others involved in enforcing the act's provisions is under way.</p>

  <p>On 23 August 2002 the Executive published for consultation a draft code of practice in relation to searches for suspected cash, as required by section 293 of the act. The finalised code will be brought into effect by statutory instrument after it has been approved by the Scottish Parliament. The Executive is also in the process of recruiting an "appointed person" to scrutinise police use of cash search powers under sections 290 and 291 of the act.</p>

  <p>On 15 October 2002 the Executive published a draft code on the use of the new investigations powers in part 8, as required by section 410 of the act. Following consultation, it too will be subject to approval by the Scottish Parliament.</p>

  <p>The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 represents a step change in the fight against crime and we are determined to ensure its successful implementation.</p>

  <p>To date, a total of 60 Trade Package contracts have been awarded. Other than a Performance Bond, the SPCB is entitled, under the terms of each contract, to request a Parent Company Guarantee as advised by the Construction Manager. In addition, there are a number of performance management tools in place throughout all Trade Packages which ensure that the client's interests are suitably protected. These are:</p>

  <p>1. The Construction Managers monitor on a daily basis that work is being carried out to the required standard set out in the detailed specification for materials and workmanship, and performance delivery is measured against the construction programme.</p>

  <p>2. Action is taken as necessary to ensure that no payment for sub-standard work is made and steps are taken to encourage improved levels of performance.</p>

  <p>3. Three per cent of the gross value of all payments due to contractors is retained and released only when the client is satisfied that the contract has been completed and any defects rectified to the required standard.</p>

  <p>To date, with the exception of the contract with Flour City Architectural Metals (UK) Ltd, no recovery has been sought against a Parent Company Guarantee in relation to any of the Trade Packages let. The value of the original contract with Flour City Architectural Metals (UK) package was &#163;7,157,281.29.</p>

  <p>The SPCB regards the amount of fees paid to individual consultants as &quot;commercially confidential&quot;. Publication of such information by the Parliament would generally be considered as something that might impede fair competition between them and their competitors and/or prejudice the consultants&#146;, or the Parliament's, future negotiating position. Disclosure would also be in breach of the individual tender agreements between the Parliament and the consultants, which were agreed on a commercially confidential basis and could not be made without the agreement of the firms involved. I understand from the Convener of the Holyrood Progress Group that the Auditor General was required to obtain the specific approval of the respective consultants before authority for publication of the figures was given under the particular circumstances. The Parliament would not normally release such information unilaterally and that is only proper. It is the case that certain elements of fee agreements are still under discussion, however, once outstanding negotiations have been concluded and subject to clearance with the Parliament's legal office, we would expect to secure the agreement of the consultants involved and make these details available.</p>
