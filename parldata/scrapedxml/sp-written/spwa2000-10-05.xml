  <p>The Scottish Executive has made no representations to the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) regarding flight supplements on air services from Scottish Airports. If it received evidence that flight supplements were in breach of competition legislation, the Scottish Executive would refer it to the OFT who would decide what action to take.</p>

  <p>It is for local authorities to consider whether public service obligations (PSOs) should be imposed on any air routes and to approach the Scottish Executive with economically and socially necessary cases for new PSOs in accordance with the criteria contained within EC Regulation 2408/92. The Scottish Executive has not made, and has no plans to make, representations to the European Commission in respect of new PSOs on any air routes.</p>

  <p>Table 2 in question S1W-7086 showed the average number of patient episodes per consultant at each of the cancer centres and not the total number of episodes. The total number of oncology patient episodes at Ninewells Hospital for the year ending 31 March 2000 was 12,095, which is 11.25% of the 107,492 total recorded patient episodes for the five cancer centres. It should be noted that these figures are provisional.</p>

  <p>Staffing data used in answer to question S1W-7086 was as at 30 September 1999 and does not necessarily reflect average staffing levels throughout the year. As the number and duration of visits by an individual patient varies according to the type and stage of the disease, and outreach patients are not included, the number of patient episodes does not show the total workload per consultant. The figures also give no indication to the variation between centres in the contribution made by medical staff other than consultants.</p>

  <p>A range of digital hearing aids have been available through the NHS in Scotland by means of central contracts since June 1999. Digital hearing aid provision currently represents about 0.6% of the total number of aids provided from the contract.</p>

  <p>NHS Trusts can also purchase hearing aids outside the central contract range. Information on the number of digital aids purchased in this way is not held centrally, but it is likely to be small. Whether an individual patient is prescribed a digital aid is a matter for decision at NHS Trust level based on clinical judgment and clinical priorities.</p>

  <p>Dentists are paid to provide oral health advice under the capitation fees they receive monthly for each child registered with them on the NHS. The Scottish Executive is particularly keen to ensure that dentists take adequate time to provide advice on nutrition and oral health to child patients and their parents living in deprived areas. Consequently, there are enhanced monthly capitation fees for dentists registering all 0-2 year olds, with a sliding scale to recognise the greater challenge faced by dentists in more deprived areas, and registering 3-5 year olds in the most deprived areas and advising these children on behaviours which will promote oral health throughout life. The Action Plan for Dental Services in Scotland which was published on 18 August includes a proposal to introduce an enhanced capitation payment scheme for 6-8 year olds in the most deprived areas including the fissure sealing of the first molars of these children and the provision of oral health advice and instruction.</p>

  <p>All NHS patients should be given information and support to ensure they are fully involved in decisions about their own care. The Executive has been taking forward a number of initiatives to foster a better understanding of this requirement within the NHS. While these have not been aimed specifically at dental care, the principles are equally applicable.</p>

  <p>Under current Regulations, a dentist is already required to provide a patient registered with him or her on the NHS with a plan outlining such details as the NHS care and treatment considered necessary and an estimate of the associated patient charge. Dentists must also display information about NHS dental charges approved by the Primary Care NHS Trust or island health board and make available patient information leaflets listing the dentists working in the practice(s) and other helpful information such as opening hours and access for those patients in wheelchairs. In addition, dentists must inform their NHS patients about the practice-based complaints procedure which he or she operates.</p>

  <p>The Executive also provides a free telephone information service, the NHS Helpline, which is able to provide callers with information on the availability of NHS dentists and dental treatments.</p>

  <p>Research indicates that the major proportion of children who are not registered with a dentist live in the most deprived areas and that dental attendance is poor among pre-school children. The Executive is committed to improving the dental health of these children.</p>

  <p>On a national basis, and in addition to continuing dental health promotion initiatives, the early years enhanced capitation scheme has been introduced to pay dentists enhanced monthly capitation fees for registering 0-2 year old children on the NHS, with the level of fee paid linked to the category of deprivation of the area where the child lives. Enhanced capitation fees are also paid to dentists registering 3-5 year olds in the lowest deprivation categories. The Executive also plans to introduce enhanced capitation payments for registering and fissure sealing the first molars of 6-8 year olds in the most deprived areas.</p>

  <p>A number of local schemes are in place in Scotland, mainly involving health visitors, which seek to encourage mothers to register their babies and toddlers on the NHS with a dentist. Health education programmes with nurseries, playgroups and schools are also underway to encourage registration and attendance. In addition, school screening by the community dental service has been extended to nurseries to identify oral disease and encourage registration.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has published within its <i>Action Plan for Dental Services in Scotland</i> proposals to fund enhanced capitation payments (including fissure sealants) for children in deprivation categories 5, 6 and 7.</p>

  <p>In the majority of health boards such targeting will limit these treatments to between 30-50% of the child population.</p>

  <p>However, in rural and remote health boards such as Highland and Western Isles deprivation indices are not an accurate tool for targeting resources and the Scottish Executive will discuss with health boards and the British Dental Association how to appropriately target such services based on clinical criteria and/or social background.</p>

However, the decision by the Scottish Executive to grant consent for the Daviot sites was taken after consultation with, and on the basis of advice from, the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment, the Food Standards Agency, the Health and Safety Executive, Scottish Natural Heritage and the Scottish Agricultural Science Agency that there was no unacceptable risks to public health and environmental safety.</p>

In all but six crops the measures taken have been completely effective.

  <p>We recognise that an element of cross-pollination could occur between related organic and GM crops, but this is no more likely than cross-pollination between related organic and conventional crops. The organic sector cannot operate in isolation from other agricultural practices or the wider environment.</p>

  <p>The environmental implications of the GM farm scale evaluation programme are fully considered by our expert advisory bodies before consent is granted. These bodies are satisfied that there are no safety or scientific reasons why this programme should have an adverse effect on organic farming. Additionally, the separation distance which is imposed around trial sites should ensure that any cross pollination with organic crops which does take place will be negligible and should not affect the organic status of these crops.</p>

The Executive has increased the total resources available under the RSI to &pound;40 million and provided &pound;5.3 million through the B&amp;B initiative.

  <p>In addition, Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) provides funding for provision of conservation advice to farmers by the Farming and Wildlife Advisory Group Scotland. The Department and SNH are currently considering whether changes are required in the delivery mechanisms for conservation advice in the light of a review on which consultation was carried out in 1999.</p>

  <p>As my earlier reply made clear, the main thrust of the Scottish Executive&#8217;s policy is to discourage smoking due to its detrimental effects on health. Non-smoking is the norm. Some staff may, however, wish to smoke so the policy offers a common sense approach by making limited provision for smokers as a concession. Information and support are available to staff who wish to stop smoking. The policy is consistent with Health and Safety Executive guidelines.</p>

  <p>The Monitoring Framework for Social Inclusion Partnerships sets out the requirement for Partnerships to undergo an evaluation towards the end of their lifespan and in some cases at the mid-point of their designation.</p>

  <p>The immediate need for evaluations are those Partnerships formerly designated as Regeneration Programmes that end in November 2001; and those Partnerships formerly designated as Priority Partnership Areas, with a mid-point of November 2001. We intend to write shortly to those Partnerships to ask them to commission individual evaluations to ascertain what has worked within the area and what has not. For the former Priority Partnership Areas undergoing interim evaluations there will also be a need to consider the focus for the remaining period for the Partnership.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Executive will commission a national evaluation of the former Regeneration Programmes to establish the difference which special status has meant for the areas concerned. It is expected that the national and individual evaluations will all be completed by summer 2001 and announcements on the future of the former Regeneration Programmes should follow in the autumn.</p>

  <p>To support the individual evaluations, the Executive will provide additional funding allocations of &pound;15,000 each. To facilitate the evaluation timetable, and to avoid the uncertainty inherent in changes to status and funding part-way through a financial year, the Executive intends to extend the designation of the former Regeneration Programmes to the end of March 2002. There will be a corresponding increase in the Social Inclusion Partnership Fund allocations to these Partnerships.</p>

  <p>The Partnership areas affected by this are as follows:</p>

  <p><u>Former Regeneration Programmes</u></p>

  <p>Cambuslang; Dundee 2; Edinburgh; Falkirk; Fife; Levern Valley (East Renfrewshire); North Ayrshire; North Lanarkshire; Stirling;</p>

  <p><u>Former Priority Partnership Areas</u></p>

  <p>Craigmillar; Dundee 1; East End; Glasgow North; Greater Easterhouse; Great Northern (Aberdeen); Inverclyde; Motherwell North; North Ayr; North Edinburgh; Paisley; West Dunbartonshire.</p>

I am also announcing today that the preferred bidder for the Northern Isles Passenger Ferry subsidy contract from 2002 is NorthLink Orkney &amp; Shetland Ferries, a joint venture of Caledonian MacBrayne and the Royal Bank of Scotland.</p>

  <p>Local authorities are responsible for the collection of water charges on behalf of the water authorities. A variety of payment methods are offered by local authorities to enable customers to pay their accounts.</p>

  <p>Information regarding those numbers of households whom are unable to pay the water charges is not available.</p>

  <p>The results of the survey will be available by November 2000. The Executive will respond to the conclusions as a matter of urgency and is currently is exploring the options for reducing the risk to health from the illegal use of lead solder in new properties.</p>

  <p>It has not been normal practice for the water authorities to take water samples when carrying out byelaw inspections of new domestic properties. Historically, only a visual inspection has been carried out on a sample of new domestic properties. More detailed byelaw inspections have been reserved for those commercial premises identified as posing a greater risk to health should contamination of the public water supply occur during a back syphonage incident.</p>

  <p>All three water authorities are committed to take any necessary action on enforcement in the light of the findings of the study being carried out by the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health. In the meantime the authorities are responding to requests from members of the public who wish to have their water supply tested for the presence of lead.<br /></p>
