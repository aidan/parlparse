  <p>The &#163;2 million which the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council (SHEFC) have allocated for 2003-04 to encourage articulation between further education and higher education has a number of aims. It will help institutions themselves to improve articulation arrangements, help to address problems that students face during transition between the sectors and will aim to enhance and develop links between the sectors.</p>

  <p>Decisions around the actual allocation of resources will be informed by early results of a study into mapping, tracking and bridging between further and higher education. This is being undertaken on behalf of SHEFC by the Scottish Advisory Committee on Credit and Access and the Wider Access Regional Forums.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive commissioned a report on this issue from the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council (SHEFC) which was published on 10 July 2003. As the report indicates, there have recently been a number of positive developments in this area, including new legislation, which should serve to improve the position of contract research staff.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Executive has promoted the need for good practice in this area both in its <em>A</em> <em>Framework for Higher Education in Scotland, </em>published on 20 March 2003, and in its 2003-04 guidance to SHEFC which asked the funding council to work with key stakeholders to ensure positive action is taken.</p>

  <p>The guiding principle to our policies on promoting renewable energy developments is that the land use planning system should play its full part in the process. Within this framework, positive provision is being made for wind farm developments whilst ensuring that designated areas, species habitats and the historic heritage are protected from inappropriate development and that any disturbance to local communities is minimised.</p>

  <p>In our view this provides a robust framework, which ensures that our renewable resources can be fully exploited towards meeting our climate change obligations whilst safeguarding sites of particular local, national and international value.</p>

  <p>We are not persuaded that national co-ordination of the process would contribute to these objectives.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer what powers the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB) has to amend, withhold or remove a staff member&#8217;s entitlement to pension benefits from Civil Service pension funds; to which pension funds these powers apply, and in what circumstances such powers would be exercised.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2003-08-28.S2W-1859.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80272" speakername="Mr George Reid" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-03/wa0828.htm#8">

  <p>The SPCB does not have any powers to amend, withhold or remove a staff member&#8217;s entitlement to pension benefits from Civil Service pension funds as these powers are held by the Minister for Civil Service.</p>

  <p>All staff of the SPCB are eligible for membership of the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme. Under the rules of the scheme the Minister for the Civil Service has the power to withhold pension benefits in prescribed circumstances. These circumstances include:</p>

  <p>conviction of treason; or</p>

  <p>conviction of an offence under the Official Secrets Act resulting in a term of imprisonment of at least 10 years; or</p>

  <p>conviction of an employment-related offence which is certified by a Minister of the Crown either to have been gravely injurious to the state or to be liable to lead to serious loss of confidence in the public service.</p>

  <p>The rules also provide the member of staff with the right of appeal to the Civil Service Appeal Board. Forfeiture of pension benefits is not undertaken lightly and there have been just seven cases since the pension scheme was introduced in 1972. In the majority of these cases only a proportion of pension benefits were withheld.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer, further to the answers to questions S2W-1566, S2W-1567, S2W-1568 and S2W-1569 by Mr Duncan McNeil on 6 August 2003, what the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB) considers its responsibility to be in relation to the communication of matters, and decisions that it takes, directly affecting staff employed by MSPs and what methods of communication are in place to ensure that such staff are appropriately informed of, and consulted on, such matters and decisions.</p>

  <p>The SPCB has various ways of keeping staff employed by MSPs informed of issues that may directly affect them, for example: through the use of e-mail; notices; telephone; letters etc. In this case, however, because these procedural changes were made in order to comply with legislation, it was not considered necessary to consult with MSPs staff.</p>

  <p>The only way that the SPCB can ensure that it complies fully with the regulations of OPRA is for it to have complete control over the payments made to the pension providers. Since the direct debit system gives the pension provider full control of when and how much is collected, the SPCB will not be re-introducing the direct debit system.</p>

  <p>Following the decision to withdraw from the direct debit scheme there are problems currently outstanding which affect eight members of staff all with the one provider. However, the SPCB has now agreed a way forward with the provider to resolve these.</p>

  <p>As none of the providers highlighted any specific problems prior to the withdrawal of the direct debit scheme and no problems were envisaged, the SPCB felt that it was not necessary to inform individual MSPs of the change in the method of payment.</p>
