  <p>Hosting the Commonwealth Games presents the whole of Scotland with great opportunities to make material improvements to people&rsquo;s lives: to improve people&rsquo;s health, to help get people into work, to increase the confidence and international profile of Scotland and to make Scotland a more environmentally-friendly country. As well as bringing estimated net economic benefits of &pound;81 million and 1,200 net new jobs at a Scottish level, the games can lend impetus to the delivery of existing priorities and programmes across all policy interests be they sport, health, education, business, cultural, tourism, volunteering and others.</p>

  <p>That is why we have consulted widely - through a written consultation and through public meetings at 16 locations across Scotland &ndash; to establish where and, as importantly, how we can best use the games to benefit and leave a lasting legacy to all areas of Scotland. We have put in place a comprehensive group structure comprising internal and external stakeholders to consider that feedback and help develop and deliver a Games Legacy Plan. In doing so we will look to optimise the opportunities the games present whilst remaining realistic in our ambitions. The detailed Games Legacy Plan is due to be published in summer 2009.</p>

  <p>Key to the level of success depends on everyone being committed to the plan and playing their part in making it work at a national and local level. Just as we did to win the bid, it is vitally important that we all unite behind the common goal of making these games a success for all of Scotland.</p>

  <p>In 2005, 2006 and 2007 national information on participation in community based adult learning has been collected through a survey of community learning and development activity and published on the Scottish Government website. This data is considered to be robust in terms of local authority delivery but not to give a full picture of delivery by the wide range of providers across statutory and third sectors. Plans are in place to review national information on community-based learning, including that collected to date through the activity survey. This review will be carried out with the full involvement of a broad range of interested parties, to ensure that any national data collected continues to be relevant, robust and deliverable without disproportionate cost.</p>

  <p>We are investing record levels of funding in local government. However, this government believes that decisions about funding allocations should be made locally.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s joint concordat with local authorities, along with the single outcome agreements, is a new way of working, built on mutual trust and respect, focused on improving outcomes for the people of Scotland. It means that the Scottish Government will stop micro-managing local government, allowing councils to concentrate their efforts on delivering better front line services, including adult education. It is the responsibility of each local authority to allocate the total financial resources available to it on the basis of local needs and priorities, having first fulfilled its statutory obligations and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities including the Scottish Government&rsquo;s key strategic objectives and manifesto commitments.</p>

  <p>Levels of support for adult education, then, will be decided at a local level and, given that the needs and associated costs of adult education services will vary from one local authority to another, it would not be appropriate for the Scottish Government to comment on required levels of support in any specific area.</p>

  <p><em>Skills for Scotland</em> , our lifelong skills strategy, sets out a new agenda for skills and learning in Scotland through a system that works for people of all ages and all walks of life, so that they can access the education and training opportunities that they need to improve their skills and achieve their full potential.</p>

  <p>The skills strategy provides us with the opportunity to set out our ambitions for skills, in a lifelong learning context, from cradle to grave. The strategy covers early years provision, schools, further and higher education, work related learning and informal learning opportunities, including adult learning in community contexts, as well as looking at information, advice and guidance and funding systems.</p>

  <p>HM Inspectorate of Education has highlighted the contribution of Community Learning and Development (CLD) to family learning. <em>Working and Learning Together (WALT)</em> sets out a long-term framework for the promotion and development of CLD with one of the three national priorities identified as raising standards of achievement in learning for adults through community-based lifelong learning opportunities. This, along with <em>Skills for Scotland,</em> provides a strategic framework for community-based adult learning including family learning.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to identify how much funding has been allocated to the voluntary sector for national delivery of non-formal adult learning since May 2007.</p>

  <p>While some voluntary organisations may receive direct Scottish Government funding towards their HQ running costs through the annual allocation of HQ and training grants, the voluntary sector&rsquo;s access to government funding for delivery of non-formal adult learning is through the money distributed to the community learning and development (CLD) partnership in each local authority area through the local government finance settlements.</p>

  <p>In 2007-08, this CLD funding was provided as part of the block grant for 2007-08 and it was the responsibility of each local authority to allocate its total resources on the basis of local needs and priorities.</p>

  <p>For 2008-09 and the future, the Scottish Government will be providing local government in Scotland with record levels of funding over the period covered by the spending review 2008-11. The vast majority of the funding, including the funding for the voluntary sector for national delivery of non-formal adult learning, will be provided by means of a block grant. It is the responsibility of each local authority to allocate the total financial resources available to it on the basis of local needs and priorities having first fulfilled its statutory obligations and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities including the Scottish Government&rsquo;s key strategic objectives and manifesto commitments.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises that farmers and crofters in the Highlands and Islands face extra input costs. These are reflected in the current Less Favoured Area Support Scheme (LFASS) which includes higher payment rates for the Highlands (classed as &quot;fragile&quot; areas) and Islands (classed as &quot;very fragile&quot; areas). To help develop policy about how LFASS should operate in the future, the Scottish Government is working closely with members of the LFA Stakeholder Group; this work has included detailed consideration of options for the basis of future payments. The Scottish Government will be consulting on LFASS 2010-13 during this autumn.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that not all students are classified as economically inactive. A student who does at least one hour paid work or has stated that they are actively seeking and available for work is classified as economically active. The effect on Dundee City&rsquo;s economic activity rate of some students being classified as economically inactive is not quantified as the Scottish Government does not hold information on whether those individuals would be economically active or inactive if they were not students.</p>

  <p>It is difficult to quantify the environmental benefits that have been delivered as a consequence of set-aside. They can vary greatly, depending on how the set-aside land is managed. Benefits can include the creation of suitable habitats for wildlife, particularly birds, a reduction in diffuse pollution from using fewer pesticides and fertilisers and less disturbance of the soil, where set-aside land is not used to grow industrial crops.</p>

  <p>We are aware that these problems have been reported.

In addition, the Pesticides Safety Directorate (PSD) has formally suspended its authorisation of the substance while it undertakes further investigation of the concerns of allotment holders and others. I am assured that there are no implications for human health, but I will ask PSD to keep me informed of developments.</p>

  <p>Potentially, yes. The Scottish Government recognises that, although set-aside was introduced as a supply control mechanism, it brought environmental benefits. It is currently consulting about measures that should be taken to maintain these benefits.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises the interaction between set-aside and certain aspects of the EU Water Framework Directive. In particular, buffer areas, especially next to water courses, offer benefits both for wildlife and for water quality. As a provision implementing the Water Framework Directive, the Water Environment (Diffuse Pollution) (Scotland) Regulations 2008 include general binding rules which prohibit tillage within two metres of a watercourse and the application of fertilisers close to watercourses. These rules came into effect in April 2008.</p>

  <p>In addition there is an option in the Scotland Rural Development Programme where funding can be applied for in respect of enhanced buffer areas over and above the two-metre margin, where such a measure would have benefits for wildlife or water quality.</p>

  <p>I have asked Karen Watt, Chief Executive of The Scottish Housing Regulator to respond.</p>

  <p>Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Housing Regulator has published a Regulatory Code of Governance which describes the regulatory requirements relating to the governance of registered social landlords (RSL). This code and the supporting guidance is statutory guidance.</p>

  <p>The public record of governing body meetings and sub-committee meetings should be freely available, for example upon request by a service user, tenants organisation or member of the public, or by being placed on the internet if the RSL has established a website.</p>

  <p>There may be occasions when access to minutes needs to be restricted, for example on data protection grounds, or where information is judged to be commercially sensitive. Decisions to refuse access to information on these grounds should be made with reference to the circumstances of each case.</p>

  <p>The fuel poverty programmes we inherited from the previous administration do not allow measures to tackle such homes effectively. The Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing re-established the Scottish Fuel Poverty Forum on 22 May 2008 to advise on the future shape of these programmes and has specifically asked them to consider the needs of fuel poor households in rural areas. The forum is expected to report in September 2008.</p>

  <p>As part of the stock transfer arrangements Hebridean Housing Partnership received &pound;175,000 in 2006-07, &pound;325,000 in 2007-08 and will receive &pound;275,000 in 2008-09 to ensure that their stock meets the Scottish housing quality standard. This funding allocation takes into account the types of dwelling in the Western Isles.</p>

  <p>Funding is allocated to councils for investment in private sector housing through the Private Sector Housing Grant. The level of annual baseline funding has increased since its inception in 2003-04 and currently stands at &pound;67.3 million. Additional funding above baseline has also been made available with an additional &pound;40 million being awarded over the last two years alone. Allocations to Western Isles Council have averaged over 5% of national expenditure, the fifth highest allocation of any council.</p>

  <p>With &pound;1.6 billion available over the Programme period 2007-13, the SRDP offers a substantial level of resources to meet the demands placed on it.

  <p>The Scottish Government is sourcing Saltire flags and other promotional goods for use in the celebrations of St Andrew&rsquo;s Day 2008 from Scottish Government approved suppliers according to procurement guidance. The buying decision is made on quality, price and required delivery time. I can confirm that Scottish-based suppliers will be amongst those invited to submit bids for goods to be used in the celebration of St Andrew&rsquo;s Day 2008.</p>
