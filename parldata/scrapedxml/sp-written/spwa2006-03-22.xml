  <p>No local authorities have approached Executive officials to discuss possible funding for major cycle infrastructure projects since question S2W-9677, which was answered on 3 November 2005. The development and funding of such projects is now a matter for the statutory regional transport partnerships.</p>

  <p>Discussions have been on-going with the south-east Scotland transport partnership (SESTRAN), through Falkirk Council, regarding support funding in relation to the Round the Forth Cycle Route since October 2004. In May 2005 the Scottish Executive agreed to match-fund 50% of the &pound;120,000 requested by SESTRAN, for a period of three years, ending in 2007-08.</p>

  <p>The statutory guidance on regional transport strategies that was published on 10 March 2006 is based on planning for integrated transport networks that take account of the needs of all users and of the contribution that can be made by all modes, including cycling. It is for the regional transport partnerships themselves to agree their own regional objectives and priorities in line with the process set out in that guidance and consistent with the objectives of the forthcoming National Transport Strategy. There are no plans to specify funding percentages per mode.</p>

  <p>No revenues have been raised directly by the Executive or its agencies from the sale of carbon rights in trees. However, Forestry Commission Scotland is part of the Scottish Forest Alliance &ndash; a collaboration working to expand native woodland on sites managed by RSPB Scotland, the Woodland Trust Scotland and Forestry Commission Scotland &ndash; which has attracted private investment for the establishment of native woodland in return for potential access to carbon rights.</p>

  <p>A claim for public interest immunity may be advanced where it is considered that disclosure of a document would be harmful to the public interest. If disclosure of a document might be harmful to the public interest consideration will be given to whether the public interest in its disclosure outweighs the interest in its non disclosure. This will depend on the facts of the case; how important the document is to the rights or interests of the person who seeks its disclosure; the degree of risk and the nature of the harm to the public interest which might result from disclosure.</p>

  <p>The only potential effect on public health that might be anticipated as a result of exposure to radioactive materials from the Chernobyl incident is an increase in the incidence of some forms of cancer such as thyroid cancer in children. However, no trends in cancer incidence suggestive of an effect of radioactive fallout from Chernobyl have been demonstrated by the comprehensive systems currently in place for the collection and analysis of cancer statistics in the UK. The results of various programmes of monitoring of the levels of radioactive substances in food and the environment suggest that a detectable increase in any cancer types is unlikely for any areas of the UK.</p>

  <p>No specific investigation into the health impact on the population of areas of Scotland affected by the Chernobyl incident has therefore been made.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-23740 by Mr Andy Kerr on 10 March 2006, what research it has carried out into patient deaths or serious illness resulting from misdiagnoses by NHS 24 and consequent failure to attend a consultant-led accident and emergency hospital.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-03-22.S2W-24330.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80057" speakername="Mr Andy Kerr" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0322.htm#7">

  <p>Whilst specific research into patient deaths has not been undertaken, NHS 24 and its partner NHS boards communicate regularly and feedback from clinicians in other parts of the service is actively encouraged by NHS 24 and local out-of-hours services.</p>

  <p>Along with patient/caller complaints, comments and compliments, this feedback mechanism forms part of NHS 24&rsquo;s robust and thorough quality improvement and performance management programme, which ensures that calls and patient records are reviewed as part of any investigation. On-going training and development requirements for each individual member of staff are included in the resource requirements of the service.All frontline staff are supported by an individual Professional Development Plan, regular call consultation reviews and robust support and supervision by their team leader. All learning, including that from partner and patient comments, complaints and compliments, is fed back both to the individual and into the organisation. This includes the examples of best practice that are routinely highlighted by call and consultation review.NHS 24&rsquo;s nurses are not asked to make a diagnosis of a caller&rsquo;s symptoms &ndash; their clinical assessment determines the best next step in a patient&rsquo;s care, primarily during the out-of-hours period when GP practices are closed. This may be self-care advice, to allow the patient to look after themselves at home without the need to be referred to another part of the service; it may be that the patient is asked to attend a local Primary Care Emergency Centre to see a doctor or nurse face-to-face; a GP home visit may also be arranged &ndash; these outcomes are based on clinical need. Details of contacts with out-of-hours services are then sent to the patient&rsquo;s own GP practice the next working day, for follow-up if required and for information.NHS 24&rsquo;s outcomes direct patients to the most appropriate care setting &ndash; as do those of the Scottish Ambulance Service. NHS 24&rsquo;s nurses use a computer-based system as a support tool and they are encouraged to exercise their own clinical judgment to determine the most appropriate outcome for patients. Both services differentiate between local Minor Injury Units (MIUs) and Accident and Emergency departments and will arrange attendance at the most appropriate place for the individual&rsquo;s clinical needs. Varying levels of service may be provided in different locations, and this is managed by local NHS boards.It is important to remember that, for immediately life-threatening conditions, people should always call 999 for an emergency ambulance. NHS 24 can, however, transfer calls to the Scottish Ambulance Service if an ambulance is required &ndash; it is then up to the ambulance crew where they take the patient, based on their own assessment of the patient&rsquo;s needs.</p>

  <p>The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court 1998 permits the International Criminal Court to exercise its jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute crimes when the national authority is unable or unwilling to prosecute.</p>

  <p>Scots law is perfectly equipped to deal with the crime of torture. In Scotland if there is credible and reliable information that a crime has been, or is to be committed, it is for the police to investigate. If they secure sufficient evidence for consideration of criminal proceedings, the police will report the result of their investigation to the Procurator Fiscal. Procurators fiscal and the police will act if and when the information available justifies such action.</p>

  <p>The national strategy makes clear that the Executive would expect the full range of contraceptive methods to be made available to patients.</p>

  <p>The National Sexual Health Advisory Committee has set up a number of sub-groups to consider the implementation of various aspects of the strategy. The provision of appropriate contraception including the use of long acting reversible contraception is being considered by one of these sub-groups. The guidelines developed by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence will be reviewed as part of this.</p>

  <p>The Executive has written to all NHS boards copied to local authorities asking for information on progress with regard to the recommendations within the strategy and about their inter-agency strategies and clinical plans. This will be reported to the National Sexual Health Advisory Committee (NSHAC), and it is our intention to publish an annual progress report, with the first one due in the summer of 2006. These annual reviews will be complemented by a more comprehensive five yearly review, carried out by NSHAC.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-22467 by Patricia Ferguson on 31 January 2006, whether it will outline how it believes the investment made in transport by it in 2005-06 to 2007-08 will bring &quot;competitive advantage&quot; to Scotland.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland will work with First ScotRail, Network Rail and industry partners to ensure that the services delivered on these new links maximise the benefits to the people of Scotland and the economy. In addition, the planned investment in rail links to Edinburgh and Glasgow Airports will improve Scotland&rsquo;s connectivity.</p>
