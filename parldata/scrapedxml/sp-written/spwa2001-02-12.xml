  <p>The Scottish Executive and its agencies support job creation and training for new employment through a variety of programmes. In the event of significant redundancies, a team of local agencies is quickly brought together under the Executive&#8217;s Partnership Action for Continuing Employment framework to support all those affected find new work. I was pleased to note that in the recent restructuring announcement by Corus there were no plans to close or make significant job cuts at the company&#8217;s steel works in Lanarkshire.</p>

  <p>In agreeing pay for 2000-01, the Scottish Executive targeted increases of 7.1% for newly qualified MLSOs and up to 26% for MLSO trainees. For 2001-02 a pay offer has recently been made for all NHS non-Pay Review Body staff of 3.7% or &#163;380, whichever is the greater. In addition to this, further adjustments have been proposed to the MLSO pay scales. The combined effect would increase the starting salary for a newly qualified MLSO to over &#163;15,200, a total increase of up to 16.7%. Corresponding increases would see trainees able to earn over &#163;12,500 (an increase of up to 16.2%) and experienced MLSO 1 and MLSO 2 staff over &#163;18,500 and &#163;24,400 respectively, an increase of up to 7.9%.</p>

  <p>The Registrar General&#8217;s 1999 mid-year estimate of Scotland&#8217;s population was 5,119,200. This represents a fall of 17,400 since 1995, reflecting estimated net out-migration and other adjustments of 10,895 and a natural decrease (more deaths than births) of 6,505. However, the fall in population between 1998 and 1999 is estimated to have been only 800, reflecting estimated net in-migration and other adjustments of 2,917 offset by a natural decrease of 3,717. Particular caution should be attached to the estimates for a single year&#8217;s change.</p>

  <p>The General Register Office for Scotland estimates that Scotland will experience a net loss of 1,000 people per annum between now and 2020, the majority of which will be young highly-skilled people. The Executive takes this issue seriously and both the newly formed Scottish Labour Market Intelligence Unit, now called &quot;Future Skills Scotland&quot;, and the Enterprise Networks plan to look into this matter over the coming year.</p>

  <p>It is for each health board to assess the health and health care needs for its population, taking into account the nature of existing services; there are no specific plans to encourage other health boards to follow the Borders example. The Executive proposes, however, to produce in the course of this year a national sexual health strategy, which will provide a framework within which health boards and other interests can develop their sexual health services. More generally, the Executive is providing &#163;3 million over three years for the Healthy Respect national health demonstration project to develop and share best practice in the promotion of sexual health, prevention of unwanted teenage pregnancies and reduction of sexually transmitted diseases. The Executive also expects the NHS at local level to work in partnership with local authorities and voluntary sector organisations to ensure that young people have access to appropriate sexual health support and services.</p>

  <p>When these partnerships reached the end of their 10-year life in 1998-99, continuation arrangements were put in place with special funding from the Executive for three years through to March 2002. We have concluded that after that date the Glasgow Alliance and the Capital City Partnership should be asked to take over responsibility for carrying forward the regeneration of Castlemilk and Wester Hailes. They will be asked to do this from additional resources which are being provided to support their strategies for delivering the social justice milestones and targets.</p>

  <p>In each of the two years 2002-03 and 2003-04 we shall be making available &#163;2.712 million to the Glasgow Alliance and &#163;2.118 million to the Capital City Partnership. They will be expected to spend at least 80% of this budget in the first year, and at least 60% in the second year, in Castlemilk and Wester Hailes; decisions about the use of these resources will be taken in consultation with the local community.</p>

  <p>For 2001-02 &#8211; the last year in the current three-year period &#8211; Castlemilk will receive &#163;2.26 million, including &#163;100,000 for support costs, and Wester Hailes &#163;1.765 million, including &#163;50,000 for support costs and &#163;50,000 for environmental work. We shall also be allocating an additional &#163;200,000 each to the Glasgow Alliance and the Capital City Partnership in 2001-02 to support their work in delivering the social justice milestones and targets.</p>

  <p>The new arrangements from 1 April 2002, supported by additional resources from the Executive, will enable the achievements of the partnerships in Castlemilk and Wester Hailes to be consolidated and sustained, within a framework which recognises the need to integrate this work with the city-wide strategies for the delivery of the social justice milestones and targets which have been developed and are being delivered by the Glasgow Alliance and the Capital City Partnership.</p>
