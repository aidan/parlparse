  <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service takes seriously the health, safety and welfare of its staff. It recognises that some staff are required to work by themselves for significant periods of time without close or direct supervision in the community or in isolated work areas. The ambulance service has developed a Lone Worker Policy and a Violence Risk Assessment designed to enable the service to meet its obligation to protect such staff &quot;so far as is reasonably practicable&quot; from the risks of lone working. The policy is made available to all staff who may find themselves working in this way.</p>

  <p>The information is not collected centrally in the form requested.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service began capturing information on the numbers of incidents of violence and aggression towards staff in August 2004 when it issued guidance to staff about the need to report such incidents. It does not disaggregate the numbers by the NHS board area in which the incident occurred, nor does it differentiate between emergency and non-emergency service staff groups and nor does it identify whether the staff member was operating on their own or as part of a crew. There were 265 incidents reported in 2005 and 299 in 2006.</p>

  <p>As set out in the Scottish Ambulance Service&rsquo;s lone worker policy, on arrival at the scene of the incident, the member of staff is required to conduct a dynamic risk assessment. If having completed this assessment they feel the risk is too great for whatever reason, they will inform ambulance control who will take the necessary steps to assist, such as calling the police, the fire brigade or sending a back-up ambulance crew.</p>

  <p>To attack or intimidate dedicated NHS staff or any other emergency worker who is trying to help people in need is abhorrent and totally unacceptable.</p>

  <p>Any Scottish Ambulance Service member of staff who has a concern about working on their own should in the first instance raise this with their line manager. The ambulance service runs a number of committees designed to address staff governance issues such as this. These include local and national Health and Safety committees, local and national Partnership Forums, a working group to prevent violence to staff and a consultative group.</p>

  <p>National Care Standards, published by the Scottish Government, require all care services including residential establishments for children to have a complaints procedure for children in their care.</p>

  <p>Nationally, the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001 requires the Care Commission to investigate complaints by individuals about a care service. Information about how to complain to the Care Commission must be made available by service providers.</p>

  <p>The Care Commission&rsquo;s complaints procedure can be viewed at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.carecommission.com/images/stories/documents/publications/documents/71.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.carecommission.com/images/stories/documents/publications/documents/71.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p>As part of that procedure, where the Care Commission considers it has a secondary role to an investigation by, for example the police or any other regulatory or statutory body, it will await the findings of fact of such investigations before determining what action to take.</p>

  <p>The guidance to Child Protection Committees provided in <em>Protecting Children: A Shared Responsibility</em> (1998) states that local authorities and other agencies who provide care and accommodation for children in residential placements, schools, foster care or other forms of accommodation should ensure guidance and procedures are in place to respond to allegations of abuse concerning children living away from home. The investigation of such allegations should include, as far as is practicable, an element of independence from the local authority or other agency.</p>

  <p>Yes.

There are plans to expand dental services at Coldstream and Hawick adding a further &pound;1.27 million to dental expenditure and it is estimated that an increase of &pound;0.25 million will be required to further develop dental services in Central Borders.</p>

  <p>NHS Borders projects that gross expenditure on general dental services will increase to &pound;6.52 million by 2008-09 offset by income of &pound;0.9 million, giving net expenditure of &pound;5.6 million, which will be above their population share of national spending.</p>

  <p>Procurators fiscal are provided with appropriate training, development opportunities and guidance material to enable them to carry out their varied duties. That includes specific guidance and training on environmental crime.</p>

  <p>A national network of prosecutors who specialise in environmental cases has been in place since 2004. They work closely with professionals from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), the police and other specialist agencies, and provide advice to prosecution colleagues as appropriate. One of our environmental specialists has completed a six months secondment with SEPA, assisting in the preparation of prosecution reports and providing legal advice.</p>

  <p>A joint environmental training programme for prosecutors and SEPA lawyers has been established, with at least two joint training events each year, including site visits, presentations and discussion. This has resulted in improved liaison between SEPA and Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service and enhanced knowledge of environmental issues and policy matters.</p>

  <p>Burden of disease is used as a comparator for research investment across different diseases. This is frequently measured in terms of disability adjusted life years (DALYs) which measure the sum of life years lost due to premature mortality and years lived with a disability adjusted for the severity and thus they take into account the impact of mortality and morbidity in a single measure. Trends in the level of research investment generally correlate with the overall trend in the DALY ranking. In a recent analysis performed by the UK Clinical Research Collaboration (UKCRC), it was clear that for lung disease the level of research funding was lower than the comparative burden of disease. Further information can be obtained from the UKCRC website <a href="http://www.ukcrc.org" target="_blank">www.ukcrc.org</a> .</p>

  <p>Research investment does not increase automatically in proportion to the number of people affected by lung conditions. However, when assessing the quality of research proposals, reviewers do take into account the burden and increased prevalence of disease.</p>

  <p>Scottish government officials already meet frequently with a wide range of older people&rsquo;s representatives to be able to implement the Adult Support and Protection (Scotland) Act 2007 effectively and they will continue to do so.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has any plans to improve advocacy services for elderly people in receipt of home care services.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises the important role that advocacy and similar support services can provide for those who may need such assistance. Various grant schemes operated by the Scottish Government provide considerable financial support to a range of national and local organisations to support and advise the elderly, including those in receipt of home care services.</p>

  <p>For those people with a mental disorder, including dementia, the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 places a duty on NHS boards and local authorities to ensure the provision of appropriate independent advocacy service for all. A number of local advocacy projects are also supported through the Mental Health Specific Grant scheme.</p>

  <p>The Adult Support and Protection (Scotland) Act 2007 also contains a duty on councils to consider the importance of providing appropriate services to an adult at risk, including advocacy, when it is considering intervening to protect the adult from harm.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Prison Service has no current plans to construct any new prisons other than the prisons announced following the consultation on the Prison Estate in 2002. In addition, a consultation exercise was held regarding the future of prison services in the northeast and it was made clear at the outcome of that consultation exercise that a final decision would be made after the result of the spending review in 2007 was known.</p>
