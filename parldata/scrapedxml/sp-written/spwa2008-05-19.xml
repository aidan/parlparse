  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-11099 by Nicola Sturgeon on 14 April 2008, how it accounts for the rise in clinical negligence payouts between 2005-06 and 2006-07; what impact these payouts had on budgets originally aimed at delivering frontline services; what steps are being taken to ensure that there is accountability for errors made; how many staff have been disciplined and by what methods, and whether it believes that steps can be taken to reduce the incidence of clinical negligence in the NHS in future years.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-05-19.S3W-12661.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80396" speakername="Nicola Sturgeon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa0519.htm#4">

  <p>The rise in clinical negligence payments between 2005-06 and 2006-07 is attributed to a larger than normal number of high-value settlements, mostly birth related cases which can take several years to settle.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government operates an insurance scheme to indemnify boards against fluctuations in the awards of claims each year. This covers most of the value of claims that boards expect to be awarded and their contributions are based on an actuarial assessment of claims outstanding each year to minimise the impact on their funding.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are required to comply with clinical governance standards advised and monitored by NHS Quality Improvement Scotland. They are also required to comply with Scottish Government Staff Governance Standards. NHS boards are subject to audit and are required to sign a Statement on Internal Control that includes compliance with these standards. This should ensure that appropriate disciplinary procedures are applied in respect of failures to apply appropriate guidance by NHS bodies and their staff.</p>

  <p>Information on disciplinary action resulting from cases of medical negligence is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>Patient safety is a major strategic development priority for NHS Scotland. The Scottish Patient Safety Alliance and Programme will systematically aim to reduce harm to patients as a result of health care interventions. This is the first time that a patient safety programme will have been implemented across a whole health care system, and it signals the Scottish Government&rsquo;s absolute determination to secure improvements for those using the NHS, and for those who work in it.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive when it will make an announcement on the outcome of the consultation on independent scrutiny.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-05-19.S3W-13114.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80396" speakername="Nicola Sturgeon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa0519.htm#5">

  <p>The report of the outcome of the independent scrutiny consultation is now available at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/Recent" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/Recent</a> and copies are available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 45609).</p>

  <p>You will note from the report that the majority of respondents indicated that:</p>

  <p>independent scrutiny was a positive step forward which would improve public confidence in relation to major service changes;</p>

  <p>the consultation paper&rsquo;s preferred model of independent scrutiny, the expert panel, was seen as the best option - the strength of the scrutiny panel approach being the independence and skill mix of the panel members;</p>

  <p>the role of the panel should be to assess the safety, sustainability, evidence base and value for money of proposals for major service change, and</p>

  <p>the panel should assess the evidence and options during the process of public engagement prior to consultation and provide a commentary on these that would be available to the board and ministers in reaching decisions.</p>

  <p>I would also like to take this opportunity to reiterate some of the other key messages from my opening address at the parliamentary debate on this subject. Specifically, that:</p>

  <p>independent scrutiny will only be applied to cases of major service change and only where the benefits outweigh the costs. This will be judged on a case-by-case basis by ministers but the bar will be set high;</p>

  <p>independent scrutiny will take place early in the process and will help to ensure that there is an agreed evidence base for the subsequent decision-making process, including option appraisal. Should issues relating to the evidence emerge later, it would be possible to reconvene the panel, and</p>

  <p>there is a delineation between the current role of the Scottish Health Council (assessing NHS board process of engagement) and the role of independent scrutiny panels (scrutinising the evidence and options for change).</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government through its work with sportscotland under the National and Regional Sports Facilities Strategy are investing in a range of new and enhanced facilities across Scotland some of which will be designated as high-performance centres. These facilities are of a standard that will enable Scottish performance athletes to train in Scotland.</p>

  <p>It should also be noted that there are a number of established sport specific and generic high-performance training centres already existing throughout Scotland.</p>

  <p>Sportscotland is working with Scottish Governing Bodies to ensure they can establish a quality national training base in Scotland.</p>

  <p>They are also working with the UK Sport and UK Governing Bodies to attract more British programmes to Scotland by offering the appropriate environment for elite athletes to live and train. Our aim is to encourage more elite athletes to locate and train in Scotland by providing world-class facilities and support service provision.</p>
