  <p>The question of closing Balnain House is a matter for the operating company. Nevertheless, the Scottish Arts Council and local partners, who have supported Balnain House for many years, have explored all possible options for maintaining it as an arts centre. The Arts Council is keeping the Executive informed of developments, including collaboration with local partners to place support for traditional arts and music in the Highlands on a more secure basis from now on.</p>

  <p>The work to consider the prospect for strengthening the objective is well in hand, and should be available at the end of March. The most significant area of work will be advice from the Department of Health&#8217;s Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollution (COMEAP) on the chronic effects of air pollution. To date the health implications of particle air pollution have tended to focus on the acute short-term effects. Evidence is now beginning to emerge which suggests that the long-term chronic effects of particle air pollution may be considerably more significant. This advice from COMEAP may, if relevant, be used to support a quantification of the benefits to health from reducing concentrations of particles. A comprehensive study of the costs of emission reduction measures is also under way, and is expected to be completed in February or March. The latest modelling work, that will show what impact the recently announced policy measures are likely to have on concentrations of particles over the next few years will also be completed in February.</p>

  <p>Once the results are available, the Scottish Executive expects to be in a position to consult on proposals for a new objective for particles over the summer.</p>

  <p>Section 43 of the recently published Housing (Scotland) Bill will extend the powers available to local authorities to provide cash grants to tenants. Specifically, this section, as currently drafted, will allow local authorities to prepare a scheme for designated pressured areas which would allow for grants to be paid both to its own tenants and to tenants of registered social landlords living within a designated area if they chose to do so. The Bill also gives Scottish Ministers powers to issue guidance on the form and content of these schemes and this will be prepared in due course and contain advice on eligibility criteria and the determination of grant payments.</p>

  <p>As far as the funding mechanism is concerned, it is intended that grants to tenants under these schemes in designated pressured areas will be paid by local authorities from resources made available for housing by Scottish Ministers.</p>

  <p>Where a tenant has exercised his or her right to buy their council property, they should be allowed the full enjoyment and use of the house as owner. However, if ownership of the building is shared between the local authority and RTB owners, specific conditions may be put in place to cover arrangements for carrying out factoring services and repair and maintenance work. In general terms, such conditions may be required to ensure that all parties will pay their share of the costs towards any communal work carried out. The precise conditions of sale are a matter for agreement between the landlord and purchaser and it is for each party to satisfy themselves, in consultation with their legal advisors prior to completing the transaction, that all terms are reasonable. Any dispute over the conditions would normally be resolved by the Lands Tribunal for Scotland.</p>

  <p>We have continually urged universities and NHS Trusts to work together to minimise the drop-out rate of student nurses and midwives, by addressing a range of issues including:</p>

  <p>the preparation of the clinical mentors who support students during placements;</p>

  <p>the timing, nature and support provided for students&#8217; early experiences of clinical placements;</p>

  <p>course design to facilitate student progression through successive academic challenges and clinical experiences;</p>

  <p>availability of student support services for nursing students.</p>

  <p>The discontinuation rate can most accurately be measured retrospectively, after each cohort has completed its programme of study. Figures calculated on this basis by the National Board for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting for Scotland, give evidence of an improvement over recent years.</p>

  <p>In 1997 a Planning Audit Unit was set up within Planning Services Division of the Scottish Executive. Its initial purpose was to work with authorities to assist in securing improvements in the delivery of their development control service. As well as continuing to do this, it is now also working with authorities to improve their development planning functions.</p>

  <p>We also seek to keep national planning policy up to date. In November 2000 we published a revision of <i>National Planning Policy Guideline 1: The Planning System</i>. We will shortly be publishing a revision of <i>Planning Advice Note 40: Development Control</i> which will provide, inter alia, best practice advice on development control services.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive keeps the financial needs of small business under continued review. I am very pleased that the change of status afforded to Scottish Equity Partners - formerly Scottish Development Finance, Scottish Enterprise&#8217;s investment arm - has allowed the company to raise &#163;80 million for a new Venture Capital Fund aimed at early stage and growth technology companies. This will provide access to equity funding for an increasing number of Scottish small businesses.</p>

  <p>There are no plans to introduce a statutory obligation on local authorities, but through our work on the community legal service and national debtline we are working to improve access to free, impartial, quality legal and money advice throughout Scotland. My colleague Jim Wallace has set up a working group to bring forward proposals on how a community legal service can be established in Scotland and is reviewing the law on diligence, which will include consideration of a debt arrangement scheme. I will be piloting our plans for a National Telephone Debt line later this year and I am also pursuing with COSLA how the money and debt advice services provided by local authorities can be improved.</p>
