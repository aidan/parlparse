  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-6589 by Mrs Mary Mulligan on 11 March 2004, what the remaining &#163;170 million from the initial budget of &#163;350 million for the delivery of the free central heating programme has been spent on.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, the Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>&#163;350 million was a 2001 estimate of the cost of providing the central heating programme, derived from information looking back to 1996. This has since been revised leading to the estimated cost being reduced to &#163;180 million.</p>

  <p>The original commitment remains in place that funding is being made available to ensure that any applicant who meets the eligibility criteria set out in the central heating programme, and comes forward before the programme&#8217;s close, will receive a central heating system.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how funding gained from the sale of Crofters Commission land at Beechwood Farm, Inverness, has been allocated.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2004-04-15.S2W-7132.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80128" speakername="Allan Wilson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-04/wa0415.htm#2">

  <p>Beechwood farm is owned by Scottish ministers and is used to provide bulls and rams for the Livestock Improvement Schemes, which the Crofters Commission runs on behalf of Scottish ministers.</p>

  <p>Two small pieces of land on Beechwood have been sold recently for a total of &#163;8,676.25.</p>

  <p>The annual Capital Budget for the Crofters Commission makes provision for the forecast level of related capital receipts to offset related capital expenditure. The 2003-04 budget approved by the Parliament made provision for Crofters Commission capital receipts of &#163;1,000. Any excess receipts, in the case of the commission, or any other part of the budget, are used in the first instance to offset any shortfall in planned receipts elsewhere and thereafter to reduce overall budget outturn.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how it will respond to section 3.34 of Audit Scotland's report, <em>Following the Public Pound - Controller of Audit's report and Accounts Commission's findings</em> , which states that "the survey indicates that councils were unable in all cases to identify the purpose of the funding provided and statutory authority under which the expenditure was incurred".</p>

  <p>It is for local authorities, in the first instance, to ensure that such arrangements secure Best Value. This became a statutory obligation on commencement of relevant sections of the Local Government in Scotland Act 2003, and is now backed by an audit and enforcement framework in which the Accounts Commission for Scotland takes a key role.</p>

  <p>In addition, the management of funding agreements is one of the issues covered in the Code of Guidance on Funding External Bodies and <em>Following the Public Pound </em>(the Code<em>)</em> published by COSLA and the Accounts Commission. The Scottish Executive welcomes the decision to review adherence to the code in light of the Local Government in Scotland Act 2003, and to revise it as necessary. The Accounts Commission&#8217;s recent report, <em>Following the Public Pound</em>, is part of this review process.</p>

  <p>Once this review has been completed Scottish ministers intend to use powers provided by Section 51 of the Local Government in Scotland Act 2003 to require compliance with the Code.</p>
