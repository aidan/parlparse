  <p>In 2001-02 Renfrewshire Council installed central heating in 121 dwellings under the Executive&#8217;s central heating programme. In 2002-03 they should install central heating in another 121 dwellings and in 2003-04 in 395 dwellings. All council stock in Renfrewshire should then have central heating.</p>

  <p>The central heating programme provides grant to install central heating, insulation and safety alarms in (a) dwellings owned by local authorities and housing associations which currently lack any form of central heating, and (b) dwellings occupied by home owners or private renters where the head of household or spouse is aged 60 or over and the dwelling lacks central heating. In both categories (a) and (b) some householders will be pensioners, but others will not. Information on the number of pensioners and non-pensioners benefiting from the programme is not collected.</p>

  <p>Renfrewshire Council have estimated that they have around 640 dwellings without central heating. They will be given grant to install central heating in all those dwellings by March 2004. One housing association in the area is taking part in the programme. It estimates that it has 14 dwellings without any form of central heating and, on current plans, it will be given grant to install central heating in them all by March 2004.</p>

  <p>Eaga manage the central heating programme for owner-occupiers and private renters. The main criteria for inclusion in the programme as administered by Eaga are that the head of household or spouse must be aged 60 or over and that the dwelling must lack central heating. In late 2000 the Executive estimated that around 40,000 households in the private sector met these criteria. All eligible households in the private sector should have central heating by March 2006.

  <p>We acknowledge that access to NHS dental services in Grampian is becoming more difficult.

  <p>As an employer, the Scottish Executive is committed to carrying out an equal pay review. For further information regarding this, I refer the member to the answer given to question S1W-27237 on 29 July 2002. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament's website, the search facility for which can be found at:</p>

  <p><a ref="../../../webapp/wa.search">www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a>.</p>

  <p>The Close the Gap Campaign is the main initiative supported by the Scottish Executive that focuses on raising awareness of the gender pay gap and to take steps to address it. More widely, the Scottish Executive is committed to mainstreaming equal opportunities in all its policies and legislation. Many of the Scottish Executive&#8217;s policies relating to education, training and economic development include reducing the barriers to women getting into work, being promoted at work or starting and maintaining a successful business.</p>

The Close the Gap Campaign information packs contain information about employees&#8217; rights to equal pay and how employees can make a complaint about unequal pay to an Employment Tribunal.

In relation to the new arrangements for funding local authority expenditure on private housing, for 2003-04, our intention is to write to local authorities for advice on the extent to which they wish to covert existing borrowing consents within their agreed, overall single capital allocation to private sector housing grant. Final allocations will be determined when this information is to hand. Allocations for 2004-05 and beyond, when the new arrangements are fully implemented, will be determined in due course.</p>

  <p>Financial assistance to owner-occupiers in blocks of flats mainly owned by local authorities or registered social landlords is provided through Housing Improvement and Repairs grants, administered by the local authority. Most grants are paid at the discretion of local authorities, at rates of up to 50% or up to 75%, depending on circumstances. The amount of grant which may be made available makes no distinction between types of owners. At present, installation of secure entry systems would not normally be eligible for grant, although it might be included with a wider programme of improvement, or if required to make the property suitable for a disabled occupant.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive intends to implement changes made in the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001, under which the installation of a main door entry-phone system in buildings in common ownership will be specifically identified as work eligible for grant. The amount of grant will depend on the income of the applicant.</p>

  <p>In Scotland, the Scottish Executive has convened a steering group for the European Year of Disabled People 2003.</p>

  <p>Most of the organisations on the steering group are from the voluntary sector, including the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations. We will look to steering group members to promote EYDP through their networks and partnerships and facilitate participation by the voluntary sector.</p>

  <p>For information on the activities planned by the Scottish steering group I refer the member to the answer given to question S1W-33375 on 23 January 2003. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&#8217;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a ref="../../../webapp/wa.search">www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a> . The Scottish steering group is focussing on national activity and has no plans for a local event in North Ayrshire.</p>

  <p>Local organisations may be planning their own events around Scotland. However, we are unaware at this stage of any specific events taking place in North Ayrshire.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Department for Work and Pensions is running a grant scheme for local and national projects. There are 22 successful projects in Scotland as follows.</p>

  <p>The voluntary sector plays an important role in the delivery of public services.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s review of its policies to promote the social economy, which was published on 27 January, sets out how the Executive and other public sector and independent agencies might help the sector to realise its potential in this area. This is underpinned by &#163;6 million of new funding over the years 2003-04 to 2005-06. Copies of the report are available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>The water industry hardship fund has been set up to assist those organisations suffering hardship as a result of having had their relief on water and sewerage charges withdrawn &#8211; care homes are already able to apply to the fund on this basis.</p>
