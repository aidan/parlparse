  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-4398 by Peter Peacock on 9 December 2003, how funding for 2004-05 and 2005-06 will be split between additional teachers and the Spark project and what the estimated cost will be of introducing maximum class sizes of 20 in S1 and S2 and 25 in P1.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2004-01-12.1.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80097" speakername="Peter Peacock" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-04/wa0112.htm#1">

  <p>Overall the funding allocation for 2004-05 and 2005-06 for additional teachers and the Spark project is &#163;29 million and &#163;49 million respectively. As the Scottish Executive is currently engaged in the procurement process for the project formerly known as Spark, it is not possible to separate out funding for each element due to commercial confidentiality. However, the split is heavily weighted in favour of recruiting additional teachers.</p>

  <p>Our class size commitments sit alongside our commitments to significantly increase teacher numbers to 53,000 by 2007 and to increase the number of specialists working across the primary secondary boundary. In later years the salary costs of our class size commitments will be approximately &#163;45 million.</p>

  <p>Any need for additional classrooms in particular schools, consequent on our commitment to reduce class sizes will be influenced by issues such as local school occupancy levels, future pupil numbers and effectiveness of timetabling. It is for education authorities to consider these issues in the first instance.</p>

  <p>There are no plans to introduce class sizes of a maximum of 20 in primary schools. Practical classes in secondary schools already have a class maximum of 20. The Executive has set out its aim for class sizes in S1/S2 Maths and English to fall to a maximum of 20 in time for academic year 2007-08. The partnership agreement sets no interim targets.</p>

  <p>As part of the implementation of Hungry for Success, we expect all schools to end the active promotion or advertising of full fat crisps, confectionery or fizzy sugary soft drinks within the dining room before the set dates (December 2004 for primary and special schools, December 2006 for secondaries).</p>

  <p>The Executive has also given a commitment in its partnership agreement to end the advertising of unhealthy foods in schools, work with local authorities to promote healthy eating, and actively discourage the availability of unhealthy food and drinks in schools as a condition of becoming health promoting schools. The Scottish Executive has set a target for all schools in Scotland to be health-promoting schools by 2007.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to a further education sector which delivers the maximum value for the record levels of funding now being invested. That criterion is reflected strongly in ministers&#8217; guidance to the Scottish Further Education Funding Council, which has responsibility for funding Scotland&#8217;s further education colleges and for securing adequate and efficient further education in Scotland. The guidance forms the basis of funding agreements between the Funding Council and individual colleges.</p>

  <p>Ministers rely on the judgement and expertise of college boards of management in determining the optimum provision of further education within the communities served by each college, and in securing best value from the resources which boards administer. Boards continue to address these requirements in a range of ways, including the pursuit of internal efficiency savings, collaborative initiatives and joint delivery of further education with other colleges and providers, and by examining the scope for college mergers.</p>

  <p>The Funding Council continues to work with colleges, both individually and collectively, to identify opportunities for rationalisation and effectiveness in further education provision and in matching supply and demand. A proportion of the Funding Council&#8217;s resources is used to support strategic change.</p>

  <p>The provision of bus services is a matter for the operating companies concerned, subject to the requirements of their licenses.</p>

  <p>The bid specification for the ScotRail franchise was primarily concerned with the provision of rail services. However, in line with the priorities set out in Scottish ministers&#8217; directions and guidance to the Strategic Rail Authority, bidders were also asked to submit a plan regarding inter-modal travel/integrated transport. These plans will be assessed as part of the overall evaluation process.</p>

  <p>As with any business, any requirements of competition law that may apply to operators of rail or bus services in Scotland must be met. However, competition is a reserved matter and the Scottish ministers have no functions in this area.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Social Services Council is responsible for setting the qualifications criteria for registration with the council. Consultation on the criteria for workers in the adult care sector has just been completed and no decision has yet been made on what the criteria will be. Their decision is expected by March 2004.</p>

  <p>In October, the Executive announced an additional &#163;9 million over the next three years for local authorities to invest in training. Ministers have made it clear that staff, who work in partnership with local authorities, i.e. independent providers from the voluntary and private sector, will benefit from this funding.</p>

  <p>The Executive also provides training grants under section 9 of Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 to promote an acceptable level of practice competence in areas of social work covered by the voluntary sector. This enables voluntary organisations involved to provide or secure training for their paid staff and voluntary workers which would not otherwise be available to them.</p>

  <p>Currently, the Scottish Social Services Council is undertaking an investigation of all the key funding streams available for training in the social work sector and this will include the voluntary sector.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>Under the Modernising Government Fund all 32 Scottish Councils will be working towards the deployment of smartcards for young people and a further consortium of 11 Scottish councils working towards a national model for smartcards in Scotland. One of the key deliverables over the next 18 months is the availability of smartcards for pupils to access school meals and vending.</p>

  <p>As at the end of September 2003 for those councils in the consortium, there are 16,700 cards in use for catering and vending operating in 17 schools. Through this programme we will work with councils to collate information on the uptake of smartcards.</p>

  <p>Glasgow City Council has already implemented cashless catering through the young person&#8217;s card. All 29 secondary schools in Glasgow are using this card. A pilot is also being implemented in April 2004 involving six primary schools to extend the use of the card. Since the introduction of cashless catering in 1996 until December 2002, free school meal uptake has risen from 45% to 78%.</p>

  <p>Scotland is in the vanguard of improving food in schools with our flagship policy Hungry For Success. By putting in place nutrient-based standards for school meals, we are leading the way among European countries. Local authorities have been awarded significant funding radically to improve the school meals service in Scotland. Although it is too early to say how far individual authorities are in the implementation process, we are encouraged by the signs we are already seeing and their enthusiasm for the initiative.</p>

  <p>We have a detailed monitoring plan in place to ensure that these recommendations are in place by December 2004 for primary and special schools, and December 2006 for secondary schools. This is detailed in the expert panel&#8217;s report and the timetable for this evaluation is as follows:</p>

  <p>Level 1 will involve education authorities reporting, through National Priorities in Education, on the provision and uptake of free school meals.</p>

  <p>An annual census on school meals is already undertaken and included in the reporting system. It has been altered to include questions on the provision of drinking water, free fruit and the use of anonymised paying systems such as smart cards. The Scottish Health Promoting Schools Unit will be developing an accreditation system which will allow education authorities to provide the information on health promoting schools. This reporting requirement will be introduced into the National Priorities reporting system in 2005.</p>

  <p>Level 2 monitoring, school inspections, will take place in a percentage of primary and secondary schools over the next three years.</p>

  <p>Level 3 monitoring, a published report evaluating school meals provision will be drawn from the school inspections and may include a number of dedicated inspections.</p>

  <p>Level 4 monitoring, independent research assessing the implementation and the impact of the recommendations will be commissioned after the 2006 deadline for implementation in secondary schools. We are in the process of commissioning baseline research which will inform this later project.</p>

  <p>The research will include both quantative and qualitative methods.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, since the issue of investment in its infrastructure is an operational matter for the Chief Executive of Scottish Water, I have asked him to write to you about this matter.</p>

  <p>*to date</p>

  <p>The number of students whose application for DSA is refused after being referred to an access centre is extremely small. If a student is referred he or she is already considered eligible to receive a DSA award. The purpose of referral to an access centre is to establish the students needs and the level of award required.</p>

  <p>As DSA is provided as an entitlement, future expenditure will be dependent on the number of students applying in future years and their assessed needs.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Higher Education Funding Council (SHEFC) continues to work with universities and colleges to widen access to higher education in Scotland. There are various widening access initiatives at both national and local level including the Wider Access Regional Forums established by SHEFC in 1999 as part of an initiative to encourage wider participation.</p>

  <p>SHEFC provides core teaching grants to higher education institutes on condition that they have policies and actions to help widen access. As well as this core grant it provides specific grants to cover provision for initiatives such as the Students with Disabilities Initiative, Disabled Students Premium and Equality Challenge Grant. Decisions on the allocation of funding to these initiatives are made by SHEFC on an annual basis. The following table gives the amount of grant specifically for widening access allocated in the last three academic years and the current year:</p>
