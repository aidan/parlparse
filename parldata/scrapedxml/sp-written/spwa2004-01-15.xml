  <p>The size of awards paid in recognition of victims&#8217; injuries is fixed according to a tariff set in accordance with the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act 1995. There are 25 levels of compensation for injuries ranging from &#163;1,000 to &#163;250,000. Compensation may also be paid for lost earnings and/or special expenses, with the maximum combined amount payable under the scheme being &#163;500,000.</p>

  <p>The Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme is a Great Britain scheme and therefore applies in England and Wales as well in Scotland. A full guide to the scheme is available from the authority&#8217;s website at www.cica.gov.uk.</p>

Local authority planning functions will be extended and replace the informal, non-statutory development consent arrangements currently operated by the Crown Estate.</p>

  <p>Scotland&#8217;s tourism industry benefits greatly from this country&#8217;s cultural history and Burns is one of Scotland&#8217;s greatest cultural icons. His work is well known around the world, and Burns Night presents an excellent opportunity for the promotion of Scotland as a tourist destination. How this is done is primarily a matter for VisitScotland and other agencies. However, the Scottish Executive does promote Burns within its tourism and cultural strategy. A wider understanding of his work has been encouraged through the Executive&#8217;s commitment of &#163;300,000 to the Scottish Arts Council over the last three years to develop a range of socially inclusive Burns projects. In addition the Executive provided &#163;100,000 for the second Burns and a&#8217; that Festival last year, which provided an opportunity for Scots and visitors alike to celebrate the life and works of Robert Burns. And the 250th anniversary of Burn&#8217;s birth in 2009 will be used to attract many more visitors to Scotland to see his homeland for themselves.</p>

  <p>The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 is a UK reserved matter.

  <p>In Scotland the Mobility and Access Committee for Scotland who advise ministers on transport needs of disabled people and how to improve accessibility of transport have helped ferry operators look at accessibility issues. This included accessibility for people with visual impairments.</p>

  <p>Since we do not operate compulsory treatment programmes in Scotland, such a comparison is impossible to make. Those community disposals, including drug treatment and testing orders, containing a treatment component require the offender to indicate a willingness to participate before the court imposes the order.</p>

  <p>There is evidence, however, that both voluntary treatment and community disposals have positive impacts on levels of illicit drug misuse and offending.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what its position is in respect of the statement by Historic Scotland that Castle Tioram in Moidart should be &quot;ruins in a landscape&quot; and whether it has any plans to allow the castle to be restored and, if so, what steps it will take to facilitate the restoration.</p>

  <p>Castle Tioram is a scheduled monument and thus of national importance for its archaeological and historic interest. At the public local inquiry held in 2001 into an application for scheduled monument consent for the restoration of the castle, Historic Scotland argued the case for consolidation. Scottish ministers subsequently refused scheduled monument consent for the application.</p>

  <p>Any future application for scheduled monument consent in respect of the castle would be considered on its merits and in line with Scottish Executive policy.</p>

  <p>The national policy context is laid out in the <em>Framework for Maternity Services</em> (2001) and the report of the Expert Group on Acute Maternity Services (EGAMS 2002). This report provides guidance for NHS boards on levels of care ensuring that all women have access to the appropriate level of care.</p>

  <p>The report does not stipulate that each NHS board should have a consultant-led unit for intrapartum care but recommend that local maternity services should be planned in a regional context to provide services as close to a women&#8217;s home as is consistent with safe clinical care.</p>

  <p>The majority of antenatal and postnatal care will be provided on a local basis within, usually, a consultant-led service. For more highly specialised care, this may not be available locally, and patients may have to travel, but it will be within an integrated regional service.</p>

  <p>High prisoner numbers are being tackled through record levels of investment by SPS in existing and new prisons.

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>No such comparison is possible.</p>

  <p>Both public and private providers provide similar opportunities for offenders to address their offending behaviour. These include programmes subject to independent expert accreditation on the same basis for public and private providers. The best available proxy measure for the impact of prison on reducing offending is the return to custody rate. Since many prisoners spend their sentence at more than one prison, it is not possible to disaggregate the return to custody data meaningfully between public and private providers.</p>

  <p>The most recent Return to Custody Bulletin is available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 30506).</p>

  <p>In relation to commercial leases we have received one substantive representation that the rent review process should be made to follow the position in England and Wales. This proposal suggested restricting the use of upwards-only rent reviews and the introduction of an automatic right for business tenants to renew a lease when it expires. The law in Scotland favours a freedom of contract approach, and the Executive believes that this permits commercial tenants and landlords to tailor a lease to suit their own circumstances without significant statutory intervention. Consequently, we have not adopted these proposals, although we do of course remain open to further representations. Otherwise, we have received very few enquires about general leasing law.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Law Commission has kept the Executive informed of its work on long leases and on irritancy clauses in leases. These issues are outlined in the answer to question S2W-4934 on 15 January 2004.</p>

  <p>We have also received some representations on hutting in Scotland, as discussed in particular in the answers to parliamentary questions S1W-30533 on 7 November 2002, S2W-2164 on 22 September 2003, S2W-3141 and S2W-3146 on 31 October 2003.</p>

  <p>We do not have any immediate plans to conduct a general review of leasing law. We shall, however, continue to monitor the recent and on-going work of the Scottish Law Commission in relation to two specific leasing issues. These are the <em>Commission&#8217;s Report on Irritancy in Leases of Land</em> (June 2003 - Scot Law Com No 191) and its discussion paper on the <em>Conversion of Long Leases</em> (April 2001 &#8211; D.P.

  <p>The Executive intends to introduce 80% mandatory rate relief for sports clubs which are registered as community amateur sports clubs with the Inland Revenue. This will require primary legislation.</p>

  <p>Local authorities in Scotland have discretionary powers to grant up to 100% rate relief to qualifying sports clubs. The level of relief granted varies between local authorities. Any relief granted is funded entirely by the Executive.

  <p>Schemes to install roundabouts at the A737/A760 Roadhead Junction and the A737/B777 junction at Head Street on the Beith Bypass are being progressed with a view to construction in 2004-05. Amey Highways is acting as agent for the Scottish Executive for the Roadhead Junction scheme and North Ayrshire Council is agent for the Head Street Junction scheme.</p>

  <p>The following Accident Investigation and Prevention (AIP) schemes are also being programmed and prioritised by Amey Highways for implementation in 2004:</p>

  <p>Middleton to St James Roundabout (improved signing, lining and reactivation of St James Roundabout signals).</p>

  <p>Dalry and Highfield (improved signing and lining).</p>

  <p>Any appropriate measures identified in Howwood to Barrodger AIP study (due end January 2004).</p>

  <p>Any appropriate measures identified in Linclive Junction AIP study (due end January 2004).</p>

  <p>In addition the A737 is due to be reconstructed and widened in 2004 between Barrmill Road Junction and Manrahead Roundabout. The Scottish Executive is also contributing to the Dalry Town Centre Traffic Management Scheme currently being carried out by North Ayrshire Council.</p>

  <p>Road and road junction improvements are usually identified in Route Strategy Studies, Accident Studies or following a study of a discrete section of road/road junction. Any of these studies might be undertaken by Amey Highways Ltd although other agencies can also carry out this work on behalf of the Executive. As the A737 is a trunk road, responsibility for initiating and financing improvement schemes generally lies with the Scottish Executive except where schemes are brought forward as part of a developer&#8217;s contribution to infrastructure required as part of a planning development.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in the light of reports in <em>The Herald</em> on 2 and 3 January 2003 that nearly one third of its suppliers are not paid within its target period of 30 days, what the precise reasons are for this; what steps it has taken, and what further steps it will take, to address this situation; what estimate it has made of the impact of late payments of these bills on businesses in Scotland, and whether any late payments have resulted in interest being added onto such unpaid bills and, if so, at what rate and in what proportion of cases.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2004-01-15.S2W-5303.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80057" speakername="Mr Andy Kerr" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-04/wa0115.htm#28">

  <p>I recognise the importance to business of prompt payment of invoices. This is why our policy is to aim for payment within 30 days. The Scottish Executive&#8217;s 2002-03 accounts reported that 68.5% of invoices were paid within the target period that year. This reflected difficulties some staff had in making payments following the introduction of a new computerised financial and accounting system. The Executive acted promptly to deal with the difficulties, and continues to take specific action when particular problems arise. As the accounts record, performance had improved to almost 80% by March 2003, and has since improved further, with over 87% of invoices paid within 30 days in December, very similar to the average performance in 2001-02. I am keen to improve the performance even more.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to assess accurately the impact of delays on business, because of the variability in the nature of the businesses, and the different delays that might be encountered. No late payments resulted in interest being added to unpaid bills.</p>

  <p>Working conditions for teachers are negotiated through the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers (SNCT). The make-up of the teachers&#8217; side of the SNCT is a matter for the teachers&#8217; panel, which is made up of the various teachers&#8217; organisations. The headteachers&#8217; associations have both recently withdrawn from the panel. The Executive has no statutory powers to intervene but has made it clear our view that we regret both that headteachers were not previously represented at the main SNCT, and their subsequent withdrawal from the teachers&#8217; panel. We remain committed to supporting a place for Headteachers&#8217; Association of Scotland (HAS) on the SNCT. The Executive meets regularly with HAS and we welcome their perspectives to help inform our work.</p>
