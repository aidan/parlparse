  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will review the operation of the low income, low assets (LILA) route to bankruptcy and (a) abolish the &pound;100 application fee and (b) provide access to LILA for homeowners.</p>

  <p>A review of the low income, low assets (LILA) route into bankruptcy after one year of operation is currently being conducted by the Accountant in Bankruptcy and a report will be published by the end of September 2009.</p>

  <p>The &pound;100 application fee is payable by all debtors who apply for bankruptcy not just those who demonstrate eligibility by virtue of the LILA criteria. The fee is intended to meet the administration costs associated with the award process. We do not expect the review to produce evidence to support the abolition of the debtor application fee. If there were no fee, the administration costs would otherwise have to be borne by the public purse.</p>

  <p>By definition, LILA allows for assets of low value only. The amendment of the LILA criteria to allow access through this route to homeowners would result in increased costs for debtors, and for the Accountant in Bankruptcy, to establish that there was little or no equity in the home.</p>

  <p>We are looking at alternatives to allow access to bankruptcy for a wider group of people by way of a certificated route. This will allow homeowners access to bankruptcy if they consider this is the best course of action for them.</p>

The project is currently providing a broadband service to over 2,100 premises previously unable to receive a broadband service due to distance from the exchange, including 37 properties on Eigg.</p>

  <p>HMIE assesses and reports on the quality of education provision in Scotland&rsquo;s colleges on behalf of the Scottish Further and Higher Education Funding Council (SFC). The quality framework that HMIE and most colleges use to underpin their judgements about standards and quality contains four themes relating to sustainable development. HMIE reports arising from the evaluative activities include, where appropriate, references to sustainability. In addition, HMIE include examples of sector leading and innovative practice on sustainability on its website. HMIE will publish an aspect report on sustainability in October 2009.</p>

  <p>In September 2008, HMIE introduced more streamlined models of inspection in primary and secondary schools. These models now place a much greater emphasis on the school&rsquo;s own self-evaluation and reduce the burden of documentation and administration required of schools. As part of HMIE&rsquo;s new, proportionate inspection process, they evaluate and report on five National Quality Indicators (QIs) in school inspections. The quality of the school&rsquo;s curriculum is one of these five indicators. Amongst other aspects, there is an expectation that sustainable development education will form an increasingly important part of the evaluations arrived at during an inspection, particularly in coming to a view on the quality of the curriculum.</p>

  <p>HMIE reports on colleges do not contain explicit sections on sustainable development and sustainable development education. This is the same situation as for primary and secondary school reports. This is because sustainability is seen as one of many potential cross-curricular aspects which can be reflected in many areas of the work of a school or college. The framework of quality indicators and themes used in school inspections and college reviews include themes relating to sustainability and these are considered as part of the inspection and review process. As a result, references are made regularly to aspects of sustainability in report text without it being an explicit section. In addition, reports from each of these three sectors may include, where it is warranted, examples of sector leading, good practice in sustainability.</p>

  <p>There are specific references to sustainability and sustainable development education in the current version of <em>How Good Is Our School?</em></p>

  <p>In the National Quality Indicator (QI) 4.2, <em>The school&rsquo;s success in working with and engaging the wider community,</em> the level 5 illustration (for a &quot;very good&quot; evaluation) refers to &quot;environmental aims&quot; and includes the statement &ndash; &quot;We educate for sustainability&hellip;&quot;</p>

  <p>In QI 6.3, <em>Planning for improvement</em>, one of the key themes is &quot;Planning for Sustainability&quot; and the level 5 illustration refers to the need to &quot;&hellip; take account of sustainability in planning improvements.&quot;</p>

  <p>In QI 8.3, <em>Management and use of resources and space for learning</em>, there is direct reference to the use of the local environment and the level 5 illustration includes the statement, &quot;Our resources are managed in a sustainable way.&quot;</p>

  <p>In QI 5.1, <em>The Curriculum</em>, the indicator relates to the ways that aspects of the curriculum develop pupil&rsquo;s capacities as defined in <em>Curriculum for Excellence</em>. It is implicit therefore that, in order to achieve a positive evaluation in this QI, these aspects must be present. In <em>Curriculum for Excellence</em>, to enable young people to become responsible citizens, for example, reference is made to the need to evaluate environmental, scientific and technological issues and develop informed, ethical views of complex issues. Sustainability and sustainable development education are unambiguously included in the outcomes frameworks for several subject areas, including the sciences and social studies.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how reducing the number of pupils eligible for the Education Maintenance Allowance by over 6,000 per year is consistent with its desire for a better-educated Scotland.</p>

  <p>Based on an analysis of recipients of EMA in academic year 2007-08, it is estimated that around 3,700 young people will not qualify for an Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) due to the removal of &pound;10 and &pound;20 payments.</p>

  <p>We know from previous research carried out under the last administration that some young people would have stayed on at school regardless of EMA and that the maximum &pound;30 award has a greater impact on young people&rsquo;s participation than the &pound;10 or &pound;20 awards.</p>

  <p>We also know that some of our most vulnerable young people &ndash; from the lowest income families &ndash; do not want to stay at school and are not ready to go to college. That is why we are reinvesting the money saved from refocusing the EMA in developing our pilots of Activity Agreements.</p>

  <p>For some of our most vulnerable young people, learning in a community or third sector setting will be the best option when they reach their school leaving age. Activity Agreements will, for the first time, treat this as a genuinely mainstream option for young people and improve the way they and their families are supported.</p>

  <p>The EMA programme has been fully devolved since 2007-08 and the English and Scottish EMA programmes are not directly comparable.</p>

  <p>No young people will be made worse off as the changes to the system are only being introduced for new entrants. Young people who have previously qualified for EMA will continue to be eligible at the previous rates.</p>

  <p>The changes we have made this year removed eligibility for the &pound;10 and &pound;20 awards. A young person from a family with a household income of &pound;25,000 would previously have been eligible for a &pound;20 award. On average, young people in receipt of the &pound;20 award received &pound;744 in total in academic year 2007-08.</p>

  <p>On 25 August 2009, I met Jim Knight, Minister of State for Work and Pensions, to discuss a range of matters. I again highlighted the importance of joint working to develop and implement policies to support people into sustained work. We agreed to establish regular contact on the issue.</p>

  <p>On 7 September, the First Minister and I met the Secretary of State for Scotland at the Economic Quadrilateral meeting with the Scottish Trade Unions Council and CBI Scotland. The agenda for that meeting focussed on the rise in unemployment and all parties agreed to take forward communication and improvement of the support available to the unemployed at a conference to be held later this year.</p>

  <p>I also requested a meeting with Yvette Cooper, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. This will take place in November.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to supporting and accelerating uptake of renewable energy technologies to allow people to tap into Scotland&rsquo;s abundant local sources of renewable heat and power thereby helping them be more energy self-sufficient.</p>

  <p>We have tripled support for community and microgeneration to &pound;13.5 million per year and through our Energy Saving Scotland Home Renewables and Community And Renewable Energy Scheme (CARES) grant programmes, provide funding and free independent advice to householders and not-for-profit community-based organisations to help them install renewable energy technologies.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-21692 on 1 April 2009. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="../../../Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx</a> .</p>

  <p>The &pound;3.6 million allocated to Energy Savings Trust to manage the Energy Assistance Package is drawn down monthly on a flat profile therefore &pound;1.545 million has been spent to end August.</p>

  <p>Citizens Advice Direct has received funding of &pound;40,000 from a total annual grant of &pound;80,000 to provide income maximisation checks under EAP as part of a wider programme of financial inclusion activity.</p>

  <p>&pound;2.5 million has been allocated to local authorities and RSLs to deliver insulation measures in social sector accommodation. Spend against this budget is historically drawn down in the third and fourth quarters of the financial year.</p>

  <p>Spend to date against the &pound;44.5 million for stage 4 and legacy fuel poverty programme measures is &pound;10.2 million. This is in line with the expected profile as spend on installation measures is traditionally weighted towards the last two quarters of the financial year.</p>

  <p>All local authorities offer assisted family history searches, provided by the registrar of births, deaths and marriages. A joint family history centre brings together that service with access to the other local authority sources of most interest to family historians &ndash; notably those held in the local archives and library. Very few authorities integrate all these sources but we are aware of the following local centres, involving the local registers of births etc and more than one of the other sources:</p>

  <p>Dundee City Council: Dundee</p>

  <p>East Ayrshire Council: Kilmarnock</p>

  <p>Glasgow City Council: Glasgow</p>

  <p>The ScotlandsPeople partnership between the General Register Office for Scotland (GROS), the National Archives of Scotland (NAS) and the Court of the Lord Lyon has made the key central government records more easily accessible &ndash; at the ScotlandsPeople Centre in Edinburgh and on the internet at <a href="http://www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk</a> . The same records are being made available to local authorities which set up family history centres bringing together the range of local sources of interest to genealogists. We see ancestral tourism as an important way to promote economic growth and we welcome the establishment of local centres which help spread that benefit throughout Scotland, as well as improving access for residents who want to research their ancestry locally.</p>

  <p>As I explained in my previous reply, decisions on how the review process is progressed, such as the order in which each job family is dealt with, are taken in partnership at local level. Different boards will, therefore, be dealing with the Healthcare Sciences staff group at different times and in different ways.

  <p>Of the four boards who have completed all reviews in this staff group, Borders finished in July 2008, Orkney in October 2008, Western Isles in March 2009 and NHS National Services Scotland completed reviews for this job family in June 2009. Greater Glasgow and Clyde aim to complete reviews by the end of 2009 with the exception of staff employed in the Regional Virus Laboratory who are involved in flu pandemic work. For such staff operational priorities may necessarily delay review completion. However, Greater Glasgow and Clyde are currently undertaking additional job matching training courses to increase the pool of job matchers thereby ensuring sufficient resources are in place to complete the review programme as quickly as possible.</p>

  <p>We have no plans to amend planning legislation to require applicants to obtain the authorisation of owners of land before applying for planning permission for said land.</p>

  <p>The planning application process is concerned with whether a particular development proposal at a particular location is acceptable in planning terms. It is for any prospective developer to obtain, amongst other things, the necessary property rights &ndash; through lease or purchase for example - to exercise a planning permission. The latter is not part of the planning application process.</p>

  <p>Temporary staff are used by the Scottish Government to cover temporary staffing needs for a number of reasons including pressures arising from maternity leave, sick leave, project work, unanticipated crisis and critical vacancies. Fixed term appointments are generally used when the staffing need is temporary, but longer term or the agencies are unable to supply.</p>

  <p>The cost of employing temporary and agency staff in 2008 was &pound;7,530,909.</p>

  <p>There are no comparable costs for 2004 to 2006 as the costs for these years only include the costs of agency staff. Costs of fixed term appointments are only available from September 2007. The figure for 2007 includes the costs of fixed term appointments from September 2007.</p>
