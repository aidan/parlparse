  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-3010 by Lord Hardie on 21 December 1999, whether the Crown Office was advised by the Ministry of Defence as to whether all of the software defects in the Chinook FADEC system were removed by the time the FADEC system went into production.</p>

  <p>The information which Crown Office obtained from the Ministry of Defence focussed on whether there were any defects in the FADEC system which could conceivably have contributed to the crash. The Ministry of Defence explained that there were no such defects. As I explained in my answer to question S1W-2002, and repeated in my answer to question S1W-3471, the allegations in relation to the FADEC software were considered fully by the House of Commons Defence Committee in March 1998 and that Committee concluded that there was no evidence to support claims that design flaws in the aircraft or its components (including the FADEC system) contributed to the crash.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has powers to fund Gaelic broadcasting, but there is no statutory provision for government to provide financial support to independent radio stations. Organisations running radio stations may in certain circumstances be eligible for support from Local Enterprise Companies and other public bodies, although the Broadcasting Acts limit the level of public funding. The Scottish Executive has no plans to seek to alter these arrangements.</p>

  <p>I am aware of the annual report which includes a list of 28 shortfalls in service for which funding was not available from Women&#8217;s Aid.</p>

  <p>Bids for grant from the Domestic Abuse Service Development Fund will be considered in accordance with the Application Guidance issued on 1 December 1999. It may well be that some of these shortfalls could be addressed through the fund.</p>

  <p>Funding for local women's aid groups is the responsibility of the local authorities. The Scottish Executive has no plans at present to disburse funds directly to local groups. However, we expect them to benefit from the Domestic Abuse Service Development Fund.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Partnership on Domestic Abuse will make costed recommendations on levels of service standards throughout Scotland, which we will consider very carefully.</p>

  <p>However, the majority of organisations working in the field of drug misuse are funded at a local level by the relevant statutory authorities and details are not held centrally. It is for the statutory authorities, in liaison with local Drug Action Teams (DATs), to ensure the appropriate level of service provision and targeting of services in line with national guidance and in support of the national objectives contained in <i>Tackling Drugs in Scotland: Action in Partnership.</i></p>

  <p>The Executive is currently monitoring the work of the DATs in this area.</p>

  <p>The Survey of Aggregate Working in Scotland is carried out every four years. The last published results, for the year 1993, were issued in 1995. The most recent survey covered the year 1997 but a relatively poor response rate from aggregate producers, coupled with other factors including confidentiality rules and local authority reorganisation, has to date prevented publication of the results. Ways of resolving these difficulties are currently being considered and it is not yet possible to state when, or indeed if, the 1997 results will be published.</p>

  <p>Scottish Executive officials were present at all the technical discussions with the French on the Date Based Export Scheme and aimed at encouraging the French to comply with their obligations in respect of this scheme under EU legislation.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether Her Majesty&#8217;s Government informed the First Minister or the Scottish Rural Affairs Minister at any point prior to 14 December 1999, of the French Government&#8217;s views on an exemption of Scottish beef from the current ban on UK beef imports to France.</p>

  <p>The French Prime Minister&#8217;s comments on a UK herd-based export scheme, which might have included Scottish herds, were never translated into a formal offer and were in any event unrealistic because they were at odds with the negotiated arrangements for lifting the ban, and also with the underlying Florence Agreement framework.</p>

  <p>Accordingly, the French Prime Minister&#8217;s views were not considered in the technical discussions with the French on the Date Based Export Scheme.</p>

  <p>We do not plan to publish a 1999 edition of <i>The Scottish Abstract of Statistics</i> . This compendium was published annually up to 1996 and then in 1998. If we continue with a volume in this format, the next edition would be that for 2000.</p>

  <p>All welfare problems which come to light are dealt with as a matter of urgency.

  <p>Enforcement of welfare on farms is a matter for the State Veterinary Service acting on behalf of the Scottish Executive. Under the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1968 officers are fully authorised to enter premises to inspect animals and to offer advice on how to improve the welfare of the livestock concerned. Where necessary, there are measures under the Protection of Animals (Scotland) Act 1912 to allow animals to be taken into care to prevent further suffering.</p>

  <p>I am currently considering the need for a wide-ranging review of the diligence system as a whole. Any such review would include a review of the summary warrant procedure. It is already open to local taxpayers, prior to the grant of a summary warrant, to appeal where they consider that there has been an error in calculating their liability for council tax. The appeal, in the first instance is to the relevant council and, if a mutually acceptable solution cannot be reached within two months, the appeal would then be considered by a Valuation Appeal Committee.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1O-803 by Sarah Boyack on 9 December 1999, whether the rail passenger transport scheme is the only fund controlled by the Shadow Strategic Rail Authority which can be used to fund investment in new railway infrastructure in Scotland, what resources are available from this scheme in 1999-2000, and what resources are available from this scheme in 1999-2000 for new railway infrastructure in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Shadow Strategic Rail Authority administers the Rail Passenger Partnership (RPP) scheme and the Infrastructure Investment Fund (IIF) on a GB-wide basis. RPP is available for new or enhanced local and regional rail services that are not commercially viable. IIF is aimed at &quot;pinch point&quot; infrastructure projects which cannot be undertaken by Railtrack on a commercial basis. The launch of IIF is awaiting the outcome of the Office of the Rail Regulator&#8217;s Regulatory Review of Railtrack. RPP and IIF are in addition to the franchise payments made by the Authority to the 25 train operating companies, which are more than &pound;1 billion in 1999-2000.</p>

  <p>The total fund available under RPP and IIF is &pound;105 million over the three years between 1999 and 2002. The budget for 1999-2000 is &pound;20 million. There is no separate allocation for Scotland. Proposals for projects in Scotland will be assessed against criteria applied to all applications from across GB.</p>

  <p>There are video conferencing facilities in each of the main Scottish Executive buildings in Edinburgh and Glasgow. These are available for use by Scottish Ministers and officials of the Executive. In addition there are facilities in the offices of the Scotland Office in Dover House, London, which are available for use by Scottish Ministers and Scottish Executive officials when required; and Ministers may use the video conferencing suite in the Parliament Committee Chambers at George IV Bridge provided for MSPs.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive's good practice guidance on meetings, available to all Ministers and officials of the Scottish Executive, advises anyone arranging a meeting to consider the options available, including video conferencing. Operational guidance on the use of the video conferencing facilities is provided at each facility in the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>No such study has been commissioned. However, the Scottish Executive recognises that video conferencing is a very cost-effective means of conducting meetings in certain circumstances. We are continuing to develop and extend the use of video conferencing where this has the potential to save time or money.</p>

  <p>Scottish Executive officials are discussing with colleagues in the Confederation of Scottish Local Authorities the further development of video conferencing among Scottish local authorities and between them and the Scottish Executive. The use of video conferencing facilities between the Executive and London-based Departments is already well-established. <br /></p>
