  <p>The additional funding to Highlands and Islands Airports Ltd, which was recently announced in the Spending Review settlement, will allow the company to operate 10 airports in the Highlands and Islands, and keep airport charges at a level that will encourage the further development of air services including those operated by no frills carriers.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s <em>Plan for Action on alcohol problems</em> , which was published in January, sets out that alcohol problems services should be sensitive to the needs of particular groups including women. The Executive published an <em>Alcohol Problems Support and Treatment Services Framework</em> on 5 September, which identifies women as one of the groups who might need support to access services.</p>

  <p>The Health Education Board for Scotland, Alcohol Focus Scotland and the Scottish Association of Alcohol Action Teams are currently establishing a women and alcohol network. The network will provide a vehicle for the development and dissemination of good practice in working with women.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive takes these issues very seriously.</p>

  <p>Between 2000 and 2003-04, we invested &#163;25.5 million in programmes to reduce offending and anti-social behaviour among children and young people. In June, we announced &#163;15 million end-year funding to support the Executive&#8217;s 10-point plan to tackle youth crime. The Scottish budget will increase the amount of new money available to reduce youth crime by &#163;33 million a year by 2005-06.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers gave a commitment to examine carefully the potential to deliver court services at an alternative venue in Peebles if one could be found which met the needs of the court.</p>

  <p>In line with that commitment the Scottish Court Service (SCS) has met with officials of Scottish Borders Council to examine the scope for using the council buildings at Rosetta Road, Peebles for both district court and sheriff court business.</p>

  <p>These discussions are still at an early stage and a number of practical issues need to be resolved. However, with the continued co-operation of Scottish Borders Council, I am satisfied that the potential exists to achieve an outcome, which meets the desire of the local community to retain a court in Peebles.</p>

  <p>I have therefore asked the SCS to delay issuing a consultation paper until those discussions are concluded.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, the SCS will make available the consultants&#8217; report on the existing Peebles Sheriff Courthouse. The SCS remain of the view that it is not feasible to adapt the existing building to the standards required by modern court practice. I have asked the SCS to pay careful regard to the historical and architectural importance of the current sheriff court building in the context of Peebles High Street in any arrangements which may be considered for its disposal and future use.</p>

  <p>During September and October of 2001, Greater Glasgow NHS Board carried out a survey of attendances at adult accident and emergency units. The data collected over that period indicated that the number of patients who used public transport to attend accident and emergency units was less than one in 10 patients.</p>

  <p>It is, however, of paramount importance that all current transport systems and travelling patterns are fully analysed against the new acute services configuration proposals to identify and address any mismatches. This will be essential in underpinning the plans in their entirety.</p>

  <p>As I said during the parliamentary debate on 12 September, the NHS board has commissioned work to assess the broader transport implications of its future acute services configuration for staff, patients and visitors. The results of that work will be available later this month. I expect the NHS board to fully involve local communities in any changes to transport arrangements.</p>

  <p>A number of individuals from a variety of clinical backgrounds and who have undertaken appropriate postgraduate training in cognitive therapy may use the title of cognitive therapist.</p>

  <p>We have recently launched <em>Working for Health, the Workforce Development Action Plan for NHSScotland</em>, which has set a critical path for creating a robust development function integrating workforce planning and service planning across all services in NHSScotland, including those providing psychological treatment through cognitive behaviour therapy.</p>

  <p>The transfer of the Scottish Borders housing stock to Scottish Borders Housing Association is progressing. The independent valuation required to be updated to reflect the basis of the sale e.g. intervening right to buy sales, rent increases and capital investment undertaken by the council. This work has been completed and Scottish Borders Housing Association is in the process of updating its business plan which is now due for submission by 31 October. The formal consent of ministers&#8217; should be available thereafter, allowing the transfer to complete by the end of the year.

  <p>The Scottish Executive is taking a number of steps to increase the number of junior doctors.</p>

  <p>The total Specialist Registrar establishment was increased by 100 in 2001, a rise of 9%, with many of the increases being in the specialties with the highest levels of vacancies. Additional funding for a further targeted increase of 375 junior doctors was announced on 2 April 2001, for the period to 2004.</p>

  <p>The great majority of junior doctors in Scotland start as medical students in Scotland. The Executive has commissioned Sir Kenneth Calman to undertake a review of basic medical education in response to recommendations contained in <em>Future Practice</em>, Professor John Temple&#8217;s report of his review of the Scottish medical workforce.</p>

  <p>Other measures include a review of medical careers, which will be undertaken by Professor John Temple as part of a co-ordinated national approach to NHS and health careers that promotes and attracts professionals to work in Scotland.</p>

A variety of factors are taken into account when the quantum of compensation is assessed.

  <p>The 20-day standstill movement is an important element of the Scottish Executive's animal disease control strategy. If there were to be a further outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease or another infectious disease the 20-day standstill would greatly reduce the risk of disease spread and increase the chance of the disease being identified before animals from the infected farm were moved to other farms or markets.</p>

  <p>The present 20-day movement restriction will be reviewed once a detailed cost benefit analysis into its impact on the industry has been completed.</p>

  <p>As employers in their own right, the Members of the Scottish Parliament are responsible for the training and development of their staff. The SPCB is, however, committed to providing basic induction training for MSP staff, particularly as this relates to the use of services supplied by the SPCB. Two such training courses were run this year in response to requests from members. The take-up for these was, however, disappointing and, consequently, there are no plans to run further courses until after the 2003 elections.</p>
