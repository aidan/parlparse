  <p>The setting of council tax is a matter for local authorities and they have to justify the levels they set to local taxpayers. However, we have provided record levels of investment to local authorities and we have made clear to councils that we expect that this, coupled with the work they are taking forward on efficiency, aligning resources to priorities and improving council tax collection, means council tax rises should be kept to a minimum.</p>

  <p><em>Delivering for Health</em> committed the Executive to strengthening primary care services in deprived areas to deliver &quot;anticipatory care&quot;. This approach, which is being taken forward through the &lsquo;Prevention 2010&rsquo; pilots, will ensure that people at greatest risk of preventable ill health are actively and systematically identified, contacted and offered health checks and risk assessment, improved access to NHS and other services and regular monitoring and follow-up. Prevention 2010 will enable earlier identification, prevention and treatment for conditions such as type 2 diabetes.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Diabetes Action Plan, which was published last month, places a responsibility on each diabetes Managed Clinical Network to undertake during <br /> 2007-08 a needs analysis of their population to identify disadvantaged groups and describe the provision of services required to meet their needs in terms of diabetes care.</p>

  <p>There is no threat of which we are aware of immediate cessation. The Commission has welcomed the steps that the Executive is taking to tender the Clyde and Hebrides Ferry Services and thus bring the subsidy arrangements into line with European law, including State aid rules.</p>

  <p>In any case, the imposition of a PSO would not exempt the Executive from the State aid rules and would not solve any State aid problems that existed. PSOs are imposed under the Maritime Cabotage Regulation which is entirely separate from the State aid rules.</p>

  <p>The most recent figures by postcode sector for Dundee and Angus, based on the 2001 Census, are available in the NHS Health Scotland&rsquo;s Community Profiles, through the following link: <a href="http://www.scotpho.org.uk/web/site/home/Comparativehealth/Profiles/CommunityProfiles/Tayside/Tayside.asp" target="_blank">http://www.scotpho.org.uk/web/site/home/Comparativehealth/Profiles/CommunityProfiles/Tayside/Tayside.asp</a></p>

  <p>Estimates of life expectancy for smaller areas are less reliable than those for larger areas. This is reflected in the confidence intervals (the range of values the actual value lies in, with 95% probability) that accompany the figures in the &quot;graphs page&quot; of the profiles.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what amounts at current prices were paid in government grants in each year since 1997 to meet any annual deficits where the cost of pensions exceeded the amount of contributions made in respect of each of the pay-as-you go pension schemes identified in <em>Public sector pension schemes in Scotland</em> by Audit Scotland.</p>

  <p>Audit Scotland published a report entitled <em>Public Sector Pension Schemes in Scotland</em> on 20 June 2006. The Executive pointed out to Audit Scotland before the report was published that, in relation to the NHS and Teachers Schemes is was inaccurate and (potentially) misleading to present the funding of pensions as if current contributions by employees and employers directly fund current payments.</p>

  <p>For these schemes there is no direct relationship between current contributions and current pension payments. The funding from the Exchequer through the SPPA reflects the payment of past contributions.</p>

  <p>With regards to the NHS and teachers Schemes, contribution rates are set by Actuaries to fully meet the cost of future benefits accrued. It follows that both employees and employers pay contributions to meet their future benefits. It would therefore be inappropriate to suggest that the difference between contributions and pension payments in any given year resulted in a surplus or deficit requiring government grant for that year.</p>

  <p>The police and fire services scheme do not involve a pension fund. Rather, current pension liabilities are met by contributions from current members and Grant Aided Expenditure. Accordingly, contributions are not set at a rate to meet future liabilities, rather they are used to meet current liabilities. Future liabilities will be met from Grant Aided Expenditure and employee contributions at the appropriate time.</p>

  <p>Scottish Ministers will spend approximately &pound;1.9 billion in subsidy payments to First ScotRail over the seven year life of the franchise. The level of subsidy is based on the operating costs incurred by First ScotRail in delivering the contracted level of service as well as an agreed level of profit.</p>

  <p>The subsidy paid to First ScotRail represents payment of these costs net of the revenue generated from ticket sales. The Executive has driven, through the franchise agreement and their funds, greatly improved levels of service, punctuality and quality as well as implementing the various performance regimes contained in the franchise agreement.

  <p>Transport Scotland officials meet with First ScotRail at least weekly across a range of topics to ensure that all contracted commitments to improvement are delivered and to discuss improvements to existing services and the introduction of new services.</p>

  <p>The franchise agreement requires First ScotRail to produce a number of specific reports on performance. These reports are closely scrutinised by Transport Scotland officials who look to First ScotRail to deliver the best performance for the public subsidy. There are robust performance regimes contained within the franchise agreement to ensure that the standard of rail services provided by the franchisee continually improves over the life of the franchise.

The lower drive-through lay-by provides parking for all other vehicles. Rubbish and waste has been uplifted and disposed of and the whole area tidied.

  <p>The Scottish Executive sees no need to carry out any audit or test of our reporting of the consultation process for Bills and has no plans to do so. Copies of the actual responses are always made available to the public, except where the respondents have asked for them to be treated as confidential. A report of the consultation process or summary of the responses is simply a helpful reference document pulling together the main views and issues raised during the consultation. It is not, and was never intended to be, a substitute for the detail contained in the actual responses.</p>

  <p>The Executive has not yet been formally notified of the Commission&rsquo;s findings, however, it seems unlikely that a further review will be required. Following Lord Fraser&rsquo;s Inquiry and report on the Holyrood project the Executive has published revised guidelines on construction procurement, the <em>Construction Procurement Manual</em> (published on December 2005). Adherence to the processes set out in the <em>Construction Procurement Manual</em> should ensure equal treatment and transparency. In light of the measures already taken to address the issues identified by Lord Fraser, a further review would not serve any useful purpose at this point.</p>

  <p>Note: all costs up to 2004-05 exclude overheads such as accommodation, IT, HR and finance functional support, which were absorbed by NHS Quality Improvement Scotland. These support costs are included in the figures given for 2005-06, 2006-07 and 2007-08.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) reviews and advises NHS boards on the use of all drugs receiving licences. The SMC has developed its role over a period of years, and the number of such drugs has increased considerably. In order to ensure well informed and evidence-based recommendations it has been important to have strong health economic and pharmacy-based input. The SMC also aims to support the NHS in anticipating and planning for the introduction of significant new medications. The SMC is designed to eliminate &quot;post code&quot; prescribing and to ensure that all medications it recommends are made available to the people of Scotland to meet clinical need.</p>
