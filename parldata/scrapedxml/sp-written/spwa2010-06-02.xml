  <p>The Crofting Reform (Scotland) Bill, currently undergoing Scottish parliamentary scrutiny, proposes to make the Crofters Commission more accountable by providing for elected commissioners. The Scottish Parliament approved that principle of the bill at the debate held on 13 May 2010. The government anticipates that the earliest date by which elected crofting commissioners may take up post would be late 2011.</p>

  <p>Commissioners such as the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman, Public Appointments Commissioner etc are appointed by Her Majesty the Queen following recommendation by the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB) and fall out with the remit of the Scottish Government and we are therefore unable to comment on those types of commissioner appointments.</p>

  <p>EventScotland - has supported the Gourock Highland Games, the European Pipe Band Champions in Inverclyde and the East Renfrewshire Food Festival. Through Homecoming, events celebrating Burns were supported in North Ayrshire and St Andrew&rsquo;s Day celebrations were supported in each local authority area.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Arts Council - awarded a total of 61 awards to the West of Scotland during 2008-09 and 73 awards during 2009-10. These awards represent a range of activity, which will include performances, exhibitions, publications, as well as outreach or other activity that would meet a broad definition of a &quot;cultural event&quot;. A significant amount of those awards were made to local authorities in respect of Youth Music and capital / infrastructure awards.</p>

  <p>The National Parent Forum Scotland (NPFS) is now represented on the Curriculum for Excellence Management Board and a NPFS representative attended the management board meeting on 22 April 2010.</p>

  <p>Several of the forum members have been involved in a range of opportunities to contribute to developments on Curriculum for Excellence, including curriculum assessment review groups and the ADES Partnership group. The forum was also represented at a meeting of parent bodies which met on 4 May 2010 to discuss how the parental perspective could be reflected in the developing materials on new assessment arrangements to support Curriculum for Excellence. The forum have been looking at opportunities locally to share information with parents on the 10-point action plan and on Curriculum for Excellence more generally.</p>

  <p>Many schools involve pupils in demonstrating Curriculum for Excellence to parents through events, displays and open days. The National Parental Involvement Co-ordinator and officials will continue to work closely with the forum and with local authorities to involve parents and parent councils and pupils and pupil councils, in improving Curriculum for Excellence communication.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Government has worked in close partnership with EIS and others on the implementation programme for Curriculum for Excellence (CfE) through the CfE Management Board since August 2008. It is also represented on Qualifications Governing Group. The implementation programme is designed to put in place all the measures necessary to enable teachers to deliver the CfE with confidence. The ten point plan to support implementation is designed to enhance confidence in the CfE among teachers. At my recent meetings, I have assured EIS that I will consider carefully any further proposals it may wish to submit.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Pupil numbers have been rounded up or down to the nearest five e.g. one, two round to 0; three, four round to five.</p>

  <p>2. The method of collecting and collating EMA data has been improved continually over the years of operation of the scheme. Care must therefore be taken when making comparisons between data from the first two years of operation (2004-05 and 2005-06) and that from later years.</p>

  <p>3. The academic year 2008-09 is the latest complete academic year for which information on EMA is available.</p>

  <p>The EMA scheme was introduced for eligible 16-year-olds in the academic year 2004-05. It was extended to eligible 17-year-olds in 2005-06, eligible 18-year-olds in 2006-07 and eligible 19-year-olds in 2007-08. Prior to its introduction, EMA was piloted in four local authorities including East Ayrshire. It was available for the full-age range (16-19) in each of the pilot areas from 2004-05 onwards.</p>

  <p>These ballot results mean that only a majority of tenants in Inverclyde have voted for a stock transfer proposal since 1 January 2006. In common with the answer to question S3W-33794 on 2 June 2010, this table only lists stock transfers of 500 properties or more.

  <p>River Clyde Homes is the only Registered Social Landlord in Scotland that has been involved in housing stock transfers in terms of actually taking ownership of transferred stock. Another four organisations were involved in stock transfers at the time of each ballot but never took on any of the stock due to the failure of each ballot. Of these, only Ferguslie Park Housing Association was a Registered Social Landlord. The other three organisations were Renfrewshire Housing Association, Highland Housing Association and Housing Stirling but all three were never actually registered as social landlords due to the negative ballot results.</p>

  <p>The five stock transfer proposals listed in my answer to question S3W-33795 on 2 June 2010 were balloted upon on the following basis:</p>

  <p>Note: In broad terms, these figures are the projected value of rental income in the 30 years after transfer minus all projected investment, management and maintenance costs expected over the next 30 years all expressed in today&rsquo;s prices i.e. adjusted downwards for future interest rates and inflation. This method of calculating the value of the bid is known as a &quot;Net Present Value&quot; calculation. Where the value of the bid is negative, a larger payment to the landlord is usually required (to reflect expected future interest rates and inflation) than that indicated here as the subsidy is usually paid over a number of years rather than being paid in advance of need.</p>

  <p>This table excludes stock transfer proposals which involved under 500 properties and only covers stock transfers where ballots took place after 1<sup> </sup>January 2006.</p>

  <p>The figures above are from a survey which takes a random sample of the Scottish population. At smaller geographical areas the sample is limited to people from that area and so for smaller areas, estimates are less reliable.</p>

  <p>Only a few analyses are published for areas below Scotland level and are not published at Local Authority level. At sub-Scotland level estimates are published for the proportion of individuals in relative poverty in urban and rural areas and in deprived areas.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government are aware of the demand for local authority level poverty figures and are carrying out work to improve the quality of income information recorded by the Scottish Household Survey with the aim of producing local authority - level estimates. For further detail please see the feasibility study which was carried out for this work in the government website or contact the income and poverty statistics team on 0131 244 0794 or <a href="mailto:social-justice-analysis@scotland.gsi.gov.uk">social-justice-analysis@scotland.gsi.gov.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>On the income and poverty website there is also a &quot;data sources and suitability&quot; page which discusses some of the main data sources available to researchers interested in income and poverty in Scotland and their strengths and weaknesses. This discusses some of the indicators which are currently available at local authority level to find out about income and poverty in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The figures above are from a survey which takes a random sample of the Scottish population. At smaller geographical areas the sample is limited to people from that area and so for smaller areas, estimates are less reliable.</p>

  <p>Only a few analyses are published for areas below Scotland level and are not published at local authority level. At sub-Scotland level estimates are published for the proportion of individuals in relative poverty in urban and rural areas and in deprived areas.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government are aware of the demand for local authority level poverty figures and are carrying out work to improve the quality of income information recorded by the Scottish Household Survey with the aim of producing local authority - level estimates. For further detail please see the feasibility study which was carried out for this work in the government website or contact the income and poverty statistics team on 0131 244 0794 or <a href="mailto:social-justice-analysis@scotland.gsi.gov.uk">social-justice-analysis@scotland.gsi.gov.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>On the income and poverty website there is also a &quot;data sources and suitability&quot; page which discusses some of the main data sources available to researchers interested in income and poverty in Scotland and their strengths and weaknesses. This discusses some of the indicators which are currently available at local authority level to find out about income and poverty in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Futures Trust (SFT) have today completed the process of informing all local authorities of when they can expect to receive funding for the 35 school building projects which have been announced so far in the first tranche of Scotland&rsquo;s Schools for the Future, the Scottish Government&rsquo;s school building programme.</p>

  <p>Eight councils had already been informed of their funding timetable earlier this year, and today the SFT informed the remaining 24 authorities of when they will receive their funding. The timetable for the 35 projects is set out in the following table.</p>

  <p>This represents much needed government investment worth over &pound;300 million in new schools, benefitting pupils, teachers, families and communities the length and breadth of Scotland.</p>

  <p>Of course authorities contributing from their own resources may be able to start procurement, design and &ndash; in some cases &ndash; building prior to SFT resources coming on stream, should they wish to do.</p>

  <p>Funding Available from Financial Year</p>

  <p>I can confirm that SEPA is fully committed to the wellbeing of its staff and SEPA senior management fully engage with staff before taking decisions that will significantly affect SEPA staff. Any proposed changes to SEPA&rsquo;s organisational structure and to the way it delivers its services are operational matters for the agency itself.</p>

  <p>Forestry Commission Scotland (FCS) serves as the Scottish Government&rsquo;s forestry directorate and is consulted where necessary on any forestry issues that may arise when creating new designated wildlife sites. Although the detail of such advice depends on particular circumstances, it is formulated within the context of FCS&rsquo;s biodiversity programme for 2008-11 which is published as <em>Woods for Nature</em> .</p>

  <p>Yes. The Scottish Forestry Strategy, launched in 2006, set challenging targets across all its key themes, including environmental quality and biodiversity.</p>
