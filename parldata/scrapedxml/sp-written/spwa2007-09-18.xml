  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Householders can and do make a contribution towards the cost of their central heating system if the cost of installing the system is above the maximum grant available. This can occur if householders choose to have additional, voluntary work carried out such as the installation of further radiators and the associated pipe work.The Programme Managing Agent (Scottish Gas) has indicated to Communities Scotland that the number of householders who have made a contribution to their central heating installation since October 2006 is 2,428. Scottish Gas has indicated that all contributions, so far, have been for the additional, voluntary works and no payments have been made as a result of the maximum grant limit being insufficient for the installation of basic measures.</p>

  <p>To date, almost 30,000 National Entitlement Cards have been issued to eligible young people. This is 16% of the total eligible population. 31% of the current budget of &pound;23.85 million is committed to the scheme. In addition, the current budget for promotion of the scheme is &pound;250,000.</p>

  <p>Whilst the scheme is operated in a non-smart card basis it is not possible to establish how many people have used the younger persons concessionary travel scheme and what proportion of the total eligible population has used the scheme at least once. However, it has been calculated that an average of 28,000 bus journeys have been made each month during the first seven months of the scheme. This does not include rail or ferry travel.</p>

  <p>The cost of producing and translating the document is around &pound;35,000 (including the web version, the design, printing and the summary in eight languages and a full Gaelic version). Distribution of the document cost a further &pound;5,000, and the cost of the launch event was &pound;8,000. The total cost of launching the national conversation to date is therefore &pound;48,000.</p>

  <p>The costs of carrying out the conversation will depend on how its structure develops, in light of responses from the people of Scotland as to how they wish to be involved. The work is being carried out within existing resources from the government&rsquo;s constitutional policy and communications teams.</p>

  <p>It is the responsibility of each individual local authority to determine its own level of council tax taking into account the total resources available to it and its local needs and priorities. That is why I am in constructive discussions with local government to determine how best a council tax freeze can be achieved for 2008-09.</p>

  <p>The monthly fee paid by CalMac Ferries Ltd is a composite figure that has been calculated to cover all of Caledonian Maritime Assets Ltd (CMAL) ports and it does not represent an aggregation of charges for individual ports. Consequently there is no further breakdown available for individual ports. This fee is based on the costs of maintaining the ports. In addition, CalMac Ferries Ltd meets the costs of harbour operations and harbour management, functions it is required to carry out on behalf of CMAL and the cost of these functions is not included in the monthly figure of &pound;110,583.33.</p>

  <p>Private sector operators wishing to use CMAL port facilities are free to approach CMAL regarding harbour fees. CMAL are currently reviewing the rates applied by the former Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd. CMAL intend to treat all operators who utilise their facilities in an equitable manner.</p>

Services at a district general hospital could include: consultation with specialist clinicians (consultant medical staff, nurses, dieticians, physiotherapists and a wide range of other professionals); emergency treatment following accidents; routine and complex surgery; specialist diagnostic procedures, and close observation and short-term care of patients with worrying health symptoms.</p>

  <p>Plans are currently being developed for evaluation of the strands of summary justice reform for which qualitative data will be necessary. This includes the provision of signing services to the public. The reforms to summary justice will require time to bed in and for this reason results from the evaluation are expected to become available in 2009.</p>

  <p>Notes:1. The information in the table has been extracted from the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service&rsquo;s case management database. The database is a live, operational database used to manage the processing of reports submitted to procurators fiscal by the police and other reporting agencies. If a Procurator Fiscal amends a charge submitted by a reporting agency, the database will record details only of the amended charge.2. The database is charge-based. The figures quoted therefore relate to the number of charges rather than the number of individuals charged or the number of incidents that gave rise to such charges.3. The table reflects the position at 6 September 2007.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Legal Aid Board&rsquo;s system which records receipt of property recovered or preserved, and expenses from opponents, does not record whether the opponent was the pursuer or defender in the case. SLAB summarises in its <em>annual report</em> , a copy of which has been placed in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib number 41341), information on the amount of expenses and awards recovered from opponents, whether pursuer or defender.

</table></p>

  <p>It will be noted from the table that in four of the last five years, over 70% of the sums recovered by the Board from opponents relate to reparation cases. The vast majority of legally aided parties in such cases are pursuers, meaning that the vast majority of these sums will have been paid by defenders. In judicial review, all of the expenses will have been paid by defenders (or, more accurately, respondents). For other types of case, including family cases, legal aid may be granted to either the pursuer or defender and so it is not possible to say how much of the amounts recovered in these cases comes from defenders.</p>

  <p>There is no legal basis for extending agreements under these schemes which expire in 2007. However, participants in these schemes whose agreements are expiring in 2007 will have the opportunity to enter into Rural Development Contracts under the new Scotland Rural Development Programme which we expect to secure EU approval later this year. The annual payments for agreements expiring in 2007 is estimated to be (a) &pound;3.75 million (for Rural Stewardship), (b) &pound;1 million (for Environmentally Sensitive Areas) and (c) &pound;160,000 (for Organic Aid).</p>

  <p>At present, new entrants to farming and crofting who wish to access Single Farm Payment support may only do so, in accordance with EC Regulation 1782/2003, by purchasing entitlements on the open market or through inheritance of entitlements. Recognising the difficulties faced by new entrants, we have included in the proposed Scotland Rural Development Programme a measure that will make an additional &pound;10 million available to them, and I have also asked the Tenant Farming Forum to consider other ways in which we can help new entrants.</p>

  <p>East Dunbartonshire is supplied from Milngavie water treatment works. The failed tests for trihalomethanes in 2006 were directly attributable to the limited treatment at Milngavie water treatment works. Scottish Water is currently investing &pound;120 million to improve the treatment process at Milngavie and this includes addressing the level of trihalomethanes. 250,000 customers served by Milngavie are already being supplied with improved quality drinking water and the final 450,000 will officially be switched over to the new supply on 3 October 2007.</p>
