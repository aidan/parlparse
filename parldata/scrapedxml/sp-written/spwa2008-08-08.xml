  <p>We are committed to delivering more effective government and to continuous improvement of public services. As part of this it is important to regularly review whether individual public organisations continue to be the best way to deliver services for which they are responsible; and how these services might be improved in the future.</p>

  <p>When the Scottish Agricultural Wages Board was last reviewed in 2005, a decision was taken to retain it, but with provision for a further review no later than 2010. In bringing forward this review of the board, we are seeking views on whether it should retain its statutory powers, be replaced by an advisory body or be disbanded altogether, without any replacement body.</p>

  <p>As the extension to the central heating contract was intended to continue delivery of the existing programme without any service change, we did not consider it necessary to consult with stakeholder organisations. However, we are consulting a number of charitable and voluntary sector bodies through the Scottish Fuel Poverty Forum on the long term future of the programme.</p>

  <p>It is estimated that on average around 20% of the Cycling, Walking and Safer Streets grant paid to local authorities is allocated to cycling projects.</p>

  <p>The School Travel Coordinator grant is used to fund posts within local authorities to encourage active travel to school, including the promotion of cycling. From 2008-09 this grant will be rolled up into the local authority block grant as stated in the concordat agreement with COSLA.</p>

  <p>I consider the skills health visitors contribute to be an important part of meeting the needs of patients. I also know, from recent correspondence from NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde in relation to their review of health visiting services, that they also see health visitors as a core and integral part of the primary health care team.</p>

  <p>The aim of the Board&rsquo;s review was to make the best use of health visitor skills, continuing to provide universal services, but with a stronger focus on the most vulnerable families.</p>

  <p>NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde have advised the Scottish Governemnt of the outcomes of its review of health visiting service which was conducted as part of its wider policy of integrating services for children and young people in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde area.</p>

  <p>NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde acknowledge and accept that some of the key messages that set out the context for the review and the drivers for change may not have been set out clearly enough to facilitate wider discussion and enable understanding and ownership of any changes.</p>

  <p>I have sought assurances from NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde about the importance of working in partnership with the local medical council and local GPs. I satisfied that the local groups established to take forward the health visitor review have been charged with ensuring that proposals for change take account of the concerns of local GPs and are reflective of extensive engagement with wider primary care team members. I am advised that this level of engagement will continue over the summer.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government outlines its plans to encourage workers across all sectors to continuously upgrade their skills in <em>Skills for Scotland &ndash; a Lifelong Skills Strategy</em> .</p>

  <p>In the strategy we recognise that an important factor in employee learning is the commitment of employers to training and learning. To this end we are working with the sector skills councils who, through their four primary objectives highlighted in the strategy, we believe are well placed to encourage employers to continue to invest in training and learning and to raise demand for this from their workers.</p>

  <p>Alongside increasing the demand for training and learning we believe that the way jobs are designed has a direct impact on how the skills gained by workers can be deployed in the workplace. The Scottish Government are investigating how skills are currently being utilised in the workplace and if there is a potential role for government in improving this utilisation to enable workers to have an immediate positive impact to their workplace after a period of training or learning.</p>

  <p>We believe that it is important to recognise the valuable contribution that the Scottish credit and qualifications framework can make to encourage workers to continuously upgrade their skills. Many workers receive informal &quot;on the job&quot; training and by recognising this learning we hope to promote the learning experience. Evidence has shown us that trade unions help to engage workers and raise their aspirations in the workplace, which is why the Scottish Government provides funds to support Scottish union learning.</p>

  <p>Beyond this, it is usual for ministers to refer in general terms to the operational activities of bodies for which they are responsible in an effort to be as helpful as possible. Questions about the detail of these activities however, particularly while Business Stream is operating as a commercial retailer in a competitive market, remain entirely matters for it.</p>

  <p>The cost of residential short breaks depends on the needs of the person requiring care, the type of provision and the locality. The respite task group estimated average costs of &pound;629 per week in 2006-07, although the group noted the uncertainty in this estimate due to a lack of evidence. Uprating that figure for inflation to 2008-09, using GDP deflator figures of 3.25% for 2007-08 and 3.00% for 2008-09, gives an estimated cost of &pound;6.7 million for 10,000 weeks of short breaks in residential settings.</p>

  <p>The respite task group estimated average costs of &pound;12 per hour in 2006-07 for short breaks at home. The weekly cost varies widely depending on the level of need and therefore the number of hours provided.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland&rsquo;s strategic road safety plan sets out an action plan of the agencies targeted objectives for the trunk road network. It highlights the need to remove risk and prioritise initiatives aimed at preventing accidents and mitigating the effects when accidents do occur. Transport Scotland reviews the accident records of the A8, M8, A77 and A82 annually as part of the screening process for the entire trunk road network. Locations identified as having accident clusters or higher than average accidents rates are studied further and where required detailed accident investigation and prevention initiatives are implemented. These can include such things as improvements to signing and lining regimes, provision of high friction anti-skid surfaces, passively safe signposts and barrier terminals, and vehicle activated signs.The current programme of investment in the trunk road network, which includes the A8, M8, A77 and A82 is available on the Transport Scotland website at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk/files/documents/roads/Motorways-Trunk-Road-Programme-June2007-final.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk/files/documents/roads/Motorways-Trunk-Road-Programme-June2007-final.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p>The strategic transport projects review is examining the longer term needs of Scotland&rsquo;s nationally strategic transport network and will deliver its findings to Scottish ministers later this summer.</p>

  <p>Through the road safety expert group, other contributors to road accidents are also being studied.</p>
