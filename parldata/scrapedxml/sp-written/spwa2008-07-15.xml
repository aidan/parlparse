  <p>The information requested is only available from March 2007. The tables present information as at March, June, September and December 2007. They do not represent the percentages of people in each community health partnership who are registered. Registrations (numerator) are based on the postcode of the practice where the patient has registered with a general dental practitioner. The population (denominator) is based on where the patient resides, in this case the community health partnership. In some cases, the number of registrations may exceed the actual number of &quot;people&quot; in the chosen population.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Based on patients whose registration status indicated &quot;withdrawn&quot; between the dates considered. This occurs when there is a request for the registration record to be withdrawn (made usually by the dentist, and subsequently approved by the NHS board). The numbers also include withdrawals carried out where more than one active registration exists for the same patient as part of data cleansing. Some patients whose registration has been withdrawn may register with another dentist under NHS arrangements elsewhere. There may also be retrospective additions to these data.</p>

  <p>2. If a patient has been withdrawn from more than one dental practice, they will be counted each time this happens. It is also possible for a patient to be counted in more than one NHS board if they have moved to a dentist in a different NHS board area and have been withdrawn from practices in each NHS board where they have received NHS general dental services.</p>

  <p>We are determined to tackle the continuing rise in the number of people in Scotland with diabetes.</p>

  <p>The two main modifiable risk factors in relation to type 2 diabetes are smoking and unhealthy bodyweight. We want to build on the success of the ban on smoking in public places, and in May 2008 published <em>Scotland&rsquo;s future is smoke-free, a smoking prevention action plan</em>. Backed by &pound;9 million over three years, the plan includes action to restrict the display of cigarettes and other tobacco products at the point of sale, and update statutory controls on the sale of tobacco products.</p>

  <p>Population level interventions to reverse obesity trends are a key factor in reducing the incidence of type 2 diabetes. In June 2008 we published <em>Healthy Eating, Active Living: an action plan to improve diet, increase physical activity and tackle obesity (2008-2011)</em>. This outlines our plans to spend over &pound;56 million on diet, physical activity and the promotion of healthy weight, and gives a particular focus to action to support children in their earliest years.</p>

  <p>SIGN Guideline 97 on risk estimation and the prevention of cardiovascular disease recommends the use of the ASSIGN risk calculator so that those at greater than a 20% risk of cardiovascular disease over 10 years can be offered lifestyle interventions or considered for treatment. ASSIGN has been designed to suit Scottish circumstances by the inclusion of family history and social deprivation. Its use is being piloted in association with the first wave of the &quot;Keep Well&quot; programme, which provides anticipatory interventions for those aged between 45 and 64 within deprived communities at high risk of CHD and diabetes.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-13021 by Shona Robison on 2 June 2008, why the answer states that no conditions were placed on the new practice as far as out-of-hours services were concerned, when paragraph 9 of the NHS Tayside medical practice vacancy specification document for the Kinloch Rannoch Medical Practice states &quot;OOH (out-of-hours) care will be a core component of the specification&quot;.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are under a statutory duty to ensure the provision of primary medical services throughout their areas. It is open to NHS boards to offer contracts for the performance of such services. The vacancy specification document stated that NHS Tayside would work with the successful applicants with a view to seeking innovative solutions to the provision of the out-of-hours component. No bids, however, were received that included out-of-hours cover. Consequently, NHS Tayside awarded a contract on the basis of the proposals for core hours and has itself continued to provide out-of-hours services.</p>

  <p>No. I clearly set out the timeline of events in my statement to the Parliament on 18 June 2008. I made clear in the BBC interview that I was first aware of the cases of clostridium difficile (C. diff) at the Vale of Leven in late May. I advised that on 6 June 2008, a local Dumbarton newspaper informed me that it intended to report a possible five deaths from C. diff at the Vale of Leven Hospital.</p>

  <p>On 10 June 2008, the Scottish Government was advised by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde that, in addition to a range of other actions being taken, a full look-back review had been conducted. That review has now identified a total of 55 cases of C. diff infection from December 2007, including nine deaths where C. diff was the main cause of death and another nine cases where it was a secondary cause.</p>

  <p>The infection control team met on 10 June 2008 and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde updated issued a press release on 11 June 2008. I received an interim report on the situation from NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde on 13 June 2008 and a further report on 17 June 2008.</p>

  <p>Section 61 of the Custodial Sentences and Weapons (Scotland) Act 2007 enables the Scottish ministers to prohibit the manufacture, sale, hire, etc. of swords, and to provide defences for religious, cultural and sporting purposes. No such prohibitions or defences are yet in place. The policy memorandum for the bill made it clear that use relating to historical re-enactment will be recognised as one of the defences. It is not relevant to these provisions whether historical re-enactment is a form of theatre.</p>

  <p>However, section 60 of the Custodial Sentences and Weapons (Scotland) Act 2007 does refer to theatre, and will provide a new defence in section 141 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 relating to the manufacture, sale, hire, etc. of offensive weapons for the purposes of theatrical performances. Those defences will apply to all offences weapons covered by section 141.</p>

  <p>The Custodial Sentences and Weapons (Scotland) Act 2007 does not change the law on the carrying of swords or other weapons in public. It is an offence under section 49 of the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995 to have any article which has a blade or is sharply pointed in a public place without good reason or lawful authority. Any individual instance will be a matter for the police, and ultimately the courts, but having a sword for the purpose of historical re-enactment would generally appear to be a good reason. Under section 47 of the same act it is an offence to carry an offensive weapon, which might for example be an axe or pike. Section 47 also includes a defence of &quot;reasonable excuse&quot; which has generally been seen to include historical re-enactment.</p>

  <p>Section 141 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 deals with the manufacture, sale, hire, lending and giving of specified offensive weapons. It covers possession only where possession is for the purposes of sale or hire. Section 141 already provides limited defences relating to museums and galleries, and lending by such institutions for cultural, artistic or educational purposes.</p>

  <p>Section 60 of the Custodial Sentences and Weapons (Scotland) Act 2007 contains amendments to section 141 including new subsections (11A) to (11E) which will provide defences relating to theatre, film and television. It also provides a power in new subsection (11G) for the Scottish ministers to vary the application of section 141 in relation to any description of weapon. That power could be used, if desired, to provide further defences on cultural, sporting or other grounds.</p>

  <p>The weapons to which section 141 of the 1998 act applies are set out in the Criminal Justice Act 1988 (Offensive Weapons) (Scotland) Order 2005 and include knuckledusters, swordsticks and butterfly knives. That Order excludes antique weapons.</p>

  <p>Section 47 of the Criminal Law (Consolidation)(Scotland) Act 1995 places prohibitions on the carrying of offensive weapons but allows the defence of having lawful authority or good reason.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are responsible for organising maternity care at a local level in line with national guidelines. The Framework for Maternity Services in Scotland supports the principle that good health before and during early pregnancy benefits both mother and baby. Care is tailored to the needs of the individual woman, including careful monitoring of the mother and her baby&rsquo;s development. Women are encouraged to eat as healthily as possible and the government is making available funding of &pound;19 million between 2008-11 to improve nutrition of women of childbearing age, pregnant women and children under five in disadvantaged communities. By the end of 2008 the government will publish guidance for NHS boards on locally delivered healthy weight strategies. This will highlight the needs of key groups such as pregnant women.</p>

  <p>I recognise the importance of mental health services as a national priority. We have established four national performance targets for mental health services which between them will deliver significant change across Scotland between now and 2011. As you will be aware, I have also asked my officials to look at the extent to which mental health services could, for the first time be brought into the 18 week waiting times target. This work is due to be completed by the end of the summer.</p>

  <p>I am advised by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde that the Vale of Leven Hospital is cleaned in accordance with The National Cleaning Specification and monitored in accordance with the National Monitoring Tool. Returns for the standard of cleanliness are submitted to Health Facilities Scotland on a monthly basis in accordance with national reporting arrangements for cleaning services.</p>

  <p>Terminal and Isolation cleans are completed in line with NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde Infection Control Policy Standard Operating Procedures when they are required. Terminal cleans involve domestic services and nursing staff thoroughly cleaning all surfaces and equipment within the clinical environment. This includes the removal of curtains and bed screens for laundering, beds, lockers and drip stands etc. In the majority of cases a hypochlorite based cleaning solution is used but this may vary according to any advice provided by the Infection Control Team on specific precautions to be taken.</p>

  <p>In addition, when a patient is being treated in isolation for an infection, specific &quot;Isolation Cleans&quot; are carried out twice a day in the area in which the patient is being nursed. Isolation Cleans are thorough cleans of all the patient and nurse contact areas which minimise the risk of contamination.</p>

  <p>Wards at the Vale of Leven hospital undergo terminal cleans for a variety of reasons and I have been advised by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde that 13 terminal cleans have taken place in various wards at the hospital since December 2007. I am also advised that a rolling programme of terminal cleans of all wards at the Vale of Leven began on 13th June and that this was completed on 28 June 2008.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-10033 by Shona Robison on 29 February 2008, whether it accepts that the actual number of people in Scotland who have Parkinson&rsquo;s disease could be more than double the estimate captured through the Practice Team Information scheme, in light of the findings of the Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease Society that peer-reviewed prevalence data suggests that more than 10,200 people in Scotland live with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, of whom most will have idiopathic Parkinson&rsquo;s.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-07-15.S3W-14772.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80379" speakername="Shona Robison" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa0715.htm#12">

  <p>The answer to question S3W-10033 on 29 February 2008 made clear that the estimate of prevalence given (4,800) was based on the Practice Team Information arrangements. The study cited by the Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease Society (von Campenhausen et al, 2005) found an average prevalence of 130 per 100,000, which would equate to some 6,650 people in Scotland. The estimate of 10,200 people cited by the Society appears to be based on the single study which provided the highest prevalence estimate in the von Campenhausen review.</p>

  <p>Overall, existing research suggests that the prevalence of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease in Scotland, although very likely to be higher than the number estimated to consult a general practice in a single year, is unlikely to be more than double that number. Further work would be required to determine more precisely the number of those in Scotland with the disease.</p>

  <p>Whatever the exact prevalence, the Scottish Government takes very seriously the needs of people with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, and welcomes the fact that NHS Quality Improvement Scotland is developing clinical standards relating to the condition.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-10033 by Shona Robison on 29 February 2008, whether it will revise its estimate of the number of people with Parkinson&rsquo;s, in light of the findings of the Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease Society that peer-reviewed prevalence data suggests that more than 10,200 people in Scotland live with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, of whom most will have idiopathic Parkinson&rsquo;s.</p>

  <p>The number of people in Scotland with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease is, on the basis of current evidence, uncertain. Applying to the Scottish population the results of seven previous UK studies suggests that between 5,550 and 10,250 people in Scotland may currently have the disease. Individual estimates are themselves subject to uncertainty, however. For example, the study on which the Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease Society&rsquo;s estimate of 10,200 is based noted a potential prevalence rate of anything from one in 333 to one in 1,000, equating to between 5,100 and 15,350 people in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government issues guidance to all police forces and police boards in the form of police circulars. These cover a range of topics including the impact of new legislation and changes to police pay and allowances. During each of the last five years the number of circulars issued has been as follows:</p>

  <p><table width="25%" border="BORDER" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#CCCCCC">
<tr>
<td width="60%" valign="top"> 2007</td>

  <p>In addition to the distribution of police circulars, ministers and officials are in regular contact with chief constables on a wide range of matters.</p>

  <p>Our concordat with COSLA includes a commitment to deliver progress towards an extra 10,000 respite weeks per year. We have been working closely with COSLA to agree delivery of this commitment. We have now agreed that, taking Audit Scotland&rsquo;s 2007-08 respite performance indicator figures as a baseline, local authorities will provide an extra 2,000 weeks over the baseline in 2008-09, an extra 6,000 weeks in 2009-10 and an extra 10,000 weeks in 2010-11.</p>

  <p>We launched the report of the review of community penalties last November, which makes recommendations for the improvement of the quality, effectiveness and perception of community penalties and to allow prisons to focus on those who need to be there. Work is being undertaken on a number of fronts to implement the report&rsquo;s recommendations and to allow courts to have greater confidence in the standard of delivery of these disposals in anticipation that this will lead to their greater use.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Prisons Commission&rsquo;s report published on 1 July 2008 also contains some challenging ides about the use of custody particularly in respect of the treatment of the under 18s. We are considering all of the report&rsquo;s recommendations and will announce our decisions later.</p>

  <p>We have already taken a range of measures to improve alternatives to custody. For example, we have rolled out across all courts in Scotland the mandatory use of Supervised Attendance orders in dealing with those defaulting on fines not exceeding &pound;500. It is anticipated that this measure alone will remove approximately 3,000 receptions to custody per year including substantial numbers of under 21s. We have provided an additional &pound;500,000 per annum for extension of supervised bail schemes to ensure that all courts have access to this option in dealing with accused who might otherwise have been remanded to custody.</p>

  <p>More than &pound;1 million per year has also been provided for the Turnaround project in the north Strathclyde and south west Scotland community justice authority areas, for offenders aged 16 to 30 along the lines of the successful 218 centre project in Glasgow for women offenders. We expect the piloting of drug treatment and testing orders with lower tariff offenders, which commenced in the majority of courts in the Lothians and Borders sheriffdom in June, to provide an additional sentencing option for courts in dealing with young offenders with serious addictions issues.</p>

  <p>We are using the funds recovered from criminals under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 to support an expanded range of activities for children and young people in sports, culture and arts. These initiatives are designed to increase the likelihood of positive long-term outcomes including impact on offending behaviour.</p>
