  <p>At 11 March 2003 a total of 104 devolved public bodies had submitted codes of conduct under the Ethical Standards in Public Life etc. (Scotland) Act 2000. Consideration of the codes of conduct for members of devolved public bodies will be finalised shortly and the bodies will then be notified of ministers&#146; decisions. This will be completed well in advance of the 1 May commencement of the ethical standards framework.</p>

  <p>Thirty-five codes have yet to be submitted from bodies which will come within the ethical standards framework on 1 May 2003. These relate to boards of management of further education colleges whose sectoral code has only recently been agreed with the Association of Scottish Colleges.</p>

  <p>The codes for The Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park and The Cairngorms National Park are not required to be submitted until 1 September and 1 December 2003 respectively. This was specified in the Ethical Standards in Public Life etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 (Stipulated Time Limit) Order 2003 (SSI/2003/122).</p>

The Ethical Standards in Public Life etc (Scotland) Act 2000 (Register of Interests) Regulations 2003 (SSI/2003/135), made on 5 March 2003, stipulates that the register should be open to public inspection at an office of the applicable council or devolved public body at all reasonable hours and without charge.</p>

  <p>This year, from 10 to 14 March (during the second week of Fairtrade fortnight) each Executive staff restaurant will have a promotional stall allowing staff to sample Fairtrade Mark products. Also, posters promoting fair trade products are being prominently displayed in staff restaurants. The Executive has also taken other steps to help support Fairtrade labelled products. For example, by the end of April 2003 each staff restaurant will offer staff a choice of fairtrade tea and coffee. We are also working with our catering contractor to ensure that, in future, tea and coffee served at official meetings will carry a recognised fairtrade label.</p>

  <p>The Executive issued a resource pack with information on occupational health to approximately 77,000 small- and medium-sized enterprises in December 2001. This includes guidance on the development of workplace drug and alcohol policies.</p>

  <p>Scotland&#146;s Health at Work (SHAW) provides free policy advice and guidance to help and support organisations to develop health promoting workplaces. SHAW will receive funding of &#163;750,000 in 2003-04 and is targeted with doubling the participation of small- and medium-sized enterprises within its scheme.</p>

  <p>Representatives from the disability sector have been fully involved in developing proposals to mark the European Year of Disabled People in Scotland. A steering group of disability organisations and others with an interest was established during 2002 and has agreed aims and objectives and a programme of activity for the year. The steering group&#146;s programme seeks to cover all types of disability, including autism, and seeks to ensure engagement across all sectors.</p>

  <p>The steering group has no plans specifically to consult with the Scottish Society for Autism, the National Autistic Society and other autism groups regarding the European Year of Disabled People.</p>

  <p>The funding programme for the European Year of Disabled People 2003 is a UK programme run by the Department for Work and Pensions and funded by the European Commission and the UK Government. There were no autism groups among the 22 organisations in Scotland which were successful in their applications for funding under this programme.</p>

  <p>The Regulation of Care Project Team in the Scottish Executive prepared draft Care Commission complaints procedures under sections 6 and 64 of the act on the commission's behalf. They consulted widely on them between 4 September and 20 November 2001. All responses were passed to the commission with a report on the consultation. The Care Commission then considered the outcome of the consultation and submitted revised proposals for ministers' approval. The approved complaints procedures were implemented from 1 April 2002, when the Care Commission became operational.</p>

  <p>The review of the complaints procedure established by the Care Commission under sections 6 and 64 of the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 1995 is an operational matter for the commission itself. Ministers must consent to any variation of the procedures, however. There have not yet been any such reviews.</p>

  <p>I have today published a list of the projects that are to be supported through the Intensive Support Fund (Bib. number 26831) and Youth Crime Prevention (Bib. number 26832) in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>The Intensive Support projects will increase the number and range of places providing intensive supervision for young people who offend. The Intensive Support Fund will also improve programmes in secure accommodation, and after care for young people leaving secure accommodation. The Youth Crime Prevention projects will provide additional constructive activities to divert young people from offending behaviour, assist families in preventing offending behaviour and increase the number of restorative justice projects, including those which support the victims of youth crime.</p>
