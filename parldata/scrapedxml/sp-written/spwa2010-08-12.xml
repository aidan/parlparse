  <p>So far, one country has made a booking, three countries have expressed an interest and discussions are taking place with a further three countries in basing their athletes in pre-games training camps in Scotland for the 2014 Games.</p>

  <p>However, at this time, the focus of Commonwealth Games Associations (and those who are also National Olympic/Paralympic Committees) is the Youth Olympics and Delhi Games. It is after then that the nations we are targeting will turn their attention to finalising their plans for future Games. In the interim, we are exploring options for Scottish Enterprise to host an event for Commonwealth Games Associations during the Delhi Games.</p>

  <p>Better Cancer Care recognised that early detection of cancer is crucial to increase the chance of a positive outcome for the patient. Through the Scottish Cancer Taskforce, the Scottish Government is working to improve awareness of possible symptoms of all cancers amongst the public and medical staff. This activity includes supporting the wider sharing of GP data and best practice on cancer diagnosis as this will contribute to more effective and efficient primary care pathways, increasing the possibility for earlier detection.</p>

  <p>Medical training includes the ability to diagnose a range of conditions, both common and rare, from the signs and symptoms presented by patients. For GPs in training, the new Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) curriculum includes as one of its key competencies, &quot;managing primary care contact with patients dealing with unselected problems&quot;. The curriculum recognises that doctors cannot be experts in everything but do need to know where to access information in order to make appropriate and speedy referrals.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, to support GPs to refer patients with suspected cancer as early as possible, referral guidance was published in 2007, called the <em>Scottish Executive Health Department Letter (2007) 9: Scottish Referral Guidelines for Suspected Cancer</em>. In early 2009, the guidelines were shortened into a user-friendly version for quick reference. All GPs across NHS Scotland have been sent a copy of this guidance, which is also available on the Scottish Government website: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/quickreferenceguide/suspectedcancer">www.scotland.gov.uk/quickreferenceguide/suspectedcancer</a>.</p>

  <p>Private and voluntary nurseries have an important role to play in implementing the early years framework and improving outcomes for our young children. We are keen to ensure that there are a range of service providers and that high quality and flexible services are available which meet families&rsquo; needs.</p>

  <p>Decisions on matching services with needs and circumstances are best taken at local level by councils and partner providers in the private and voluntary sectors working together. Scottish Government financial support for local early years services is included within the overall local government settlement to allow councils more flexibility to meet local needs.</p>

  <p>Scottish Government ministers and officials are in regular contact with a wide range of children&rsquo;s charities. We provide around &pound;7.2 million per annum through the Children, Young People and Families Unified Voluntary Sector Fund to support such charities.</p>

  <p>Matching local service provision with local needs and circumstances is for local authorities and their partners to decide. Scottish Government funding to support early years services is incorporated in the overall local government settlement.</p>

  <p>We also work closely with other organisations, including Learning and Teaching Scotland, who have produced a range of materials to help embed the Curriculum for Excellence in the early years. The Care Commission and Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education ensure that standards of care and education are maintained and improved in early years settings.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government supports a range of measures to encourage young people to study STEM subjects. Science and Engineering 21: An Action Plan for Education in the 21st Century launched in March this year sets out a framework and actions aimed at raising the profile of STEM subjects and associated career paths. The actions include highlighting real-life applications of science learning, building on the &quot;Do something creative. Do science&quot; marketing campaign, and showcasing science role models through the STEM Ambassadors Programme which brings practising scientists and technologists into schools to assist with activities, talks and careers events.</p>

  <p>Last year, the Scottish Government introduced the Scottish Baccalaureate in Sciences which encourages more young people to study sciences in upper secondary school and aims to help equip them for the transition to tertiary education and employment. On 5 August, 89 young people received the first ever Science Baccalaureates awarded.</p>

  <p>16+ Learning Choices ensures an offer of a suitable place in post-16 learning for every eligible young person who wants it. This will include staying on at school, entering further or higher education, taking up employment, participating in a National Training Programme, volunteering, or taking part in personal skills development in a community learning and development setting or a third sector organisation.</p>

  <p>It is an integral part of Curriculum for Excellence and is central to facilitating delivery of the national indicator for positive and sustained post-16 destinations.

  <p>It should be noted that prescribing rates can be influenced not only by prevalence and detection rates of depression, but also prescribing practice around the dosage and duration of the prescription &ndash; for example the same people might be staying on antidepressants for longer periods, or they may be receiving a higher dose.</p>

  <p>We will ensure those who need antidepressants will continue to receive them in accordance with clinical guidelines, while investing in alternatives that increase choice for clinicians and service users through improved access to evidence based interventions such as psychological therapies.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3M-33983 by Keith Brown on 2 June 2010, whether the role of the Scottish Futures Trust in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s school building programme has involved more than informing local authorities of their funding allocations and, if so, what work it has carried out.</p>
