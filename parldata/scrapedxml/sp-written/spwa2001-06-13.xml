  <p>Refugees and asylum seekers with permission from the Home Office to work on either a temporary or a permanent basis are eligible to benefit from European Social Fund grants available since 2000 under the Highlands &amp; Islands Special Transitional Programme, the Objective 2 Western Scotland Programme and the Scottish Objective 3 Programme, provided that the individuals meet the eligibility criteria set out for each programme.</p>

  <p>In particular, Objective 3 Priority 2 aims to address social exclusion and has one Measure worth 71 million euros over seven years specifically to assist excluded groups such as refugees and asylum seekers.</p>

  <p>The EQUAL Community Initiative, of which Scotland has been allocated about 33 million euros, will also tackle issues relating to those groups most disadvantaged in the labour market. It will be delivered in Scotland through seven Development Partnerships, which will be operational from November this year. An additional strand &#8211; to be administered across the UK by the Department for Education and Employment and worth 19 million euros &#8211; will be devoted to action to promote the social and vocational integration of asylum seekers.</p>

  <p>This is an operational matter for Scottish Natural Heritage and I have asked Professor Roger Crofts CBE, chief executive of SNH to reply. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Scottish Natural Heritage has formally consulted Glasgow City Council in relation to a planning application affecting this site. Access to the railway tunnel at Thornwood has been requested by SNH in order to determine the usage of the tunnel, if any, by bats. Until this study has been completed, no assessment can be made of the implications upon the proposed development.</p>

  <p>The &quot;Other Items&quot; line in Table 7 of <i>Government Expenditure and Revenue in Scotland 1998-99</i> is a subset of &quot;Other Expenditure&quot;. &quot;Other Expenditure&quot; captures items included in National Accounts measures of expenditure which are not included as part of conventional expenditure on services by the public sector. The National Accounts adjustment figures are based on <i>Public Expenditure Statistical Analyses, 2000-2001</i> , adjusted by the Treasury to accord with UK Total Managed Expenditure. The Scottish values under this header are Scottish Executive estimates, based on the UK values.</p>

  <p>Table 1 sets out expenditure on the categories that make up &quot;Other items&quot; in <i>Government Expenditure and Revenue in Scotland 1998-99</i>. It shows expenditure for both Scotland and England, and Scotland&#8217;s share of the UK expenditure.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive discussed the concerns that the Food Standards Agency (FSA) had about the possibility of dioxins released from pyres being present in milk from some 60 dairy farms within 2 km of these pyres in the Infected Area. The FSA felt that it was necessary to issue information to these farmers about this slight risk if the farmers consumed their own milk exclusively. The FSA also made it clear that there was no risk to the public when milk from these farms was mixed with other milk.</p>

  <p>In addition to the discussions with the FSA the Scottish Executive also discussed these concerns with the Scottish Dairy Association and the National Farmers&#8217; Union of Scotland.</p>

  <p>No, the Scottish Executive has no plans to review planning legislation in this regard.</p>

  <p>The current contractual arrangements between the Road Network Management and Maintenance Division (RNMMD) and the Operating Companies managing the trunk road network on their behalf require the Operating Company to visit all planning application sites, take photographs and make a report to RNMMD to include accident statistics and all other relevant information. There is no requirement to consult with applicants, although RNMMD would, where appropriate, carry out such consultations themselves. Any subsequent objection by RNMMD does not necessarily lead to a case being called in, nor does a case being called in necessarily lead to a public local inquiry being held.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, chief executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The cost of payments made or being processed this month under the SPS Special Bonus Scheme, to staff who worked a full shift or more on the day of the unlawful strike on 23 April 2001, is some &#163;67,000. The SPS Board took the decision to make these payments in recognition of the loyalty and exceptional performance of those of our staff who worked, mostly under conditions of greatly aggravated difficulty, on the day in question, protecting the public by maintaining basic good order and care in our prisons. Since the strike we have had an arbiter&#8217;s award on attendance patterns, and working together on its implementation will be a good vehicle for improving morale.</p>

  <p>Scotland does not currently participate in the Open University (OU) Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) programme. Institutions are able, however, to offer any course on a part-time basis provided it meets the requirements set out in the Guidelines for Initial Teacher Education in Scotland. No proposals have been received for such a course from the OU since 1992.</p>

  <p>Registration with the General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTCS) is a requirement for teaching in all education authority schools in Scotland. All teachers who have not trained in Scotland and who wish to teach here must seek exceptional admission to the GTCS register. As long as a teacher with a qualification through the OU in England fulfils the council&#8217;s requirements with regards to academic qualifications, professional training and relevant experience there should be no difficulty in gaining entry to the register of persons entitled to teach in Scotland.</p>

  <p><i>The Supply of Teachers</i> report, 1st Edition - January 2001, details the background to the current position on the collection of information relevant to teacher supply and outlines planned improvements to current methods. Copies of the report are in the Parliament&#8217;s reference centre (SPICe &#8211; Bib. no. 10751) and it is on the Executive&#8217;s website. As reported in this edition, we are presently unable to provide detailed answers to questions about teacher supply and shortages in specific areas. The position is outlined at paragraphs 28-36 of the report. In light of this, initiatives are being developed to identify the current number of teachers relevant to demand.</p>

  <p>As proposed in this first edition of the report, the department is currently piloting an exercise with a sample of education authorities to gather data on teacher vacancies and shortages aimed at establishing a reliable baseline figure from which to improve the planning of teacher supply across Scotland.</p>

  <p>Updates of <i>The Supply of Teachers</i> report will be placed in the Parliament&#8217;s reference centre and on the website as the position develops and new systems of gathering information are put in place. The regular publication of the report will ensure all relevant current information is available to members of the Scottish Parliament and also in the public domain.</p>
