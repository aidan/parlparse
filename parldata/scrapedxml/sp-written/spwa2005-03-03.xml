  <p>Free personal care removes the added worry of financial hardship for people with dementia in care homes. This also benefits families and carers.</p>

  <p>We have also raised the quality of care expected in care homes and have established the Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care to ensure compliance.</p>

  <p>We are also encouraging innovative approaches for dementia services. For example, the new Community Health Partnerships will include attention on integrated dementia services and we are investing in proposals for a managed care network in Tayside.</p>

  <p>With Alzheimer Scotland - Action on Dementia, we have published guidance on improvements which is already influencing change. We are helping fund Alzheimer Scotland workshops to promote further change.</p>

  <p>I am meeting with Alzheimer Scotland again later this month to discuss this continuing agenda and will be addressing the Dementia Care Conference in April.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-03-03.S2W-14384.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80064" speakername="Lewis Macdonald" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa0303.htm#4">

  <p>The proportion of the total Scottish salmon angling catch that is subsequently released has risen year on year from 8% in 1994 to 55% in 2003. The adoption of the practice is therefore growing and widely practised. The report, <em>The Economic Impact of Game and Coarse Angling in Scotland</em> , published in March 2004, estimated that 47% of angler days fished and 66% of angler expenditure was attributable to non-Scottish visiting anglers. It is likely, therefore, that a high proportion of visiting anglers practise catch and release.</p>

  <p>Article 5 of the Border Rivers Order does not make any provision concerning the Environment Agency&rsquo;s rod licensing functions. It specifically refers to functions of ministers of the Crown, and rod licensing is a duty placed directly on the Environment Agency by the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act 1975.</p>

  <p>The Executive is undertaking a wide range of activities to ensure that everyone in Scotland knows the law will be on their side if they stand up to antisocial behaviour, and that those who break the law know the consequences if they refuse to change their ways.</p>

  <p>Last week, the First Minister launched a public information campaign to raise awareness of the measures in the new act. The public information campaign includes local radio, local press and bus advertising. We will also be distributing a leaflet to every household in Scotland that will carry the same message, as well as telling people where they can go locally if they need help.</p>

  <p>A meeting took place in November 2004 involving officials from the National Asylum Support Service, COSLA, Glasgow City Council, Greater Glasgow Health Board and the Scottish Executive. This meeting discussed the suggestion put forward by COSLA that there were unmet costs associated with provision for refugees and asylum seekers in Glasgow, including costs to the NHS, and that the Scottish Executive should meet these costs. COSLA subsequently made a submission setting out their position and this is being considered by ministers.</p>

  <p>The Arbuthnott formula is the method of distributing resources to NHS boards. This takes account of population increases and also of aspects such as deprivation. Glasgow&rsquo;s budget is now over &pound;1 billion for 2004-05. The formula is adjusted each year to reflect population change, and this will take into account the number of asylum seekers, and will reflect deprivation in the areas where they live.</p>

  <p>I have asked Dr Paul Stollard, Chief Executive of the Scottish Building Standards Agency, to answer. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The Scottish building regulations set mandatory standards for energy efficiency in new homes. These cover:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>Thermal insulation to building fabric (currently the most demanding standards in the UK);<br />
              Efficiency of heating and hot water systems;<br />
              Heating controls;<br />
              Insulation of pipes, ducts and hot water tanks, and<br />
              Commissioning of the heating and hot water services equipment.</p>
</blockquote></p>

  <p>The energy efficiency levels that are set at present will be re-examined in the recently commenced review of these standards, to be consulted on in spring 2006.</p>

  <p>The conditions set in relation to European Regional Development Fund grants to upgrade Nigg Bay dry dock were set by the then Scottish Office as Implementing Authority for the programme. These were set following detailed consultation between the European Commission, Department of Trade and Industry and The Scottish Office.</p>

  <p>The grant conditions were:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>1. In order to meet the European Commission Audit requirements of the programme, project sponsors are required to retain financial and accounting records for three years following the final payment made under the programme.</p>
<p>2. Within three months of the date of this offer, the project sponsor must submit to the (programme) Executive (and not the Scottish Office) details of the arrangements established, to fully monitor and evaluate this project and to measure its impact against targets contained within the Single Programming Document. No payment will be made until satisfactory details have been submitted.</p>
<p>3. The Highlands and Islands Partnership Programme will not normally consider applications for increased costs relating to an approved project. A request will only be considered in the most exceptional cases and at the discretion of the Programme Management Committee.</p>
<p>4. If the yard is to provide for works relating to oil rig decommissioning an Environmental Impact Assessment for the new work to be carried out will be required to be submitted.</p>
<p>5. A satisfactory agreement between the applicant and BARMAC should be reached, as to reversion of the asset if the Nigg facility, or that part of it relating to the project, is closed. </p>
<p>6. The output of the yard shall not include metal hulled, self propelled ships, unless approval is granted by the Secretary of State for Scotland. Any such approval would only be given following consultation with the European Commission.</p>

  <p>Family Mediation Scotland receives grant assistance under sections 9 &amp; 10 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 paid through the Children, Young People and Families Unified Voluntary Sector Fund. Awards of core grant are made on a three year cycle with the current awards applying to financial years 2004-05, 2005-06 and 2006-07. The organisation may then reapply to the Fund. We are providing additional funding of up to &pound;250,000 in 2004-05 and 2005-06 for four national family support organisations, including Family Mediation Scotland, to secure the delivery of more integrated administration geared to improving services to clients.</p>

  <p>The Executive has long recognised the importance of family relationship services - counselling and mediation - in helping families to resolve difficulties without recourse to the law or court intervention. This will continue to be the case under our proposed reforms to family law. We provide grant assistance to four national family support organisations under the Children, Young People and Families Unified Voluntary Sector Fund. The focus of central funding from the Executive is on national organisations, while local voluntary sector services are expected to source their funding locally. We are considering how best to secure an integrated approach to the needs of families in transition by aligning family relationship support services more closely with other important services to children and families provided or secured by local government.</p>

  <p>Forestry Commission Scotland does not set annual targets for private sector new planting. The average area of new planting in the last ten years, between 1995 and 2004, the most recent year for which we have figures, was just less than 10,000 hectares per annum. However, it should be noted that this figure includes a recent three year period of reduced activity as result of foot-and-mouth disease and uncertainty about the effects of Common Agricultural Policy reform.</p>

  <p>The average area that was re-stocked following felling operations in the last ten years, between 1995 and 2004, the most recent year for which we have figures, was just less than 3,300 hectares per annum.</p>

  <p>Incentives for private sector new planting are offered through Forestry Commission Scotland&rsquo;s Scottish Forestry Grants Scheme and Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department&rsquo;s Farmland Premium. The current budget for these grant schemes is &pound;24.2 million. Following the 2004 spending review, this will increase to &pound;25.5 million in 2005-06, &pound;27.4 million in 2006-07and &pound;28.9 million by 2007-08.</p>

  <p>We have just laid before the Parliament regulations to increase prescription and other National Health Service charges in Scotland from 1 April 2005. There will be a cash increase in the prescription charges of 10p (1.57%) from &pound;6.40 to &pound;6.50 for each quantity of a drug or appliance dispensed.</p>

  <p>The cost of a prescription prepayment certificate will rise to &pound;33.90 for a four month certificate and &pound;93.20 for an annual certificate. These offer savings for people needing more than five items in four months or 14 items in a year.</p>

  <p>Prescription charges are expected to raise some &pound;44 million for NHSScotland in 2004-05.</p>

  <p>Charges for elastic stockings and tights, wigs and most fabric supports supplied through the hospital service will be increased similarly.</p>

  <p>The maximum patient charge for a single course of dental treatment begun on or after 1 April 2005 will increase from &pound;378 to &pound;384.</p>

  <p>We have restricted the prescription charge increase to the same cash amount as the previous five years and other increases are in line with this percentage increase.</p>

  <p>In order to provide help with the cost of spectacles or contact leases to children, people on a low income and individuals with complex sight problems, optical voucher values will increase by 2.5%.</p>

  <p>Historic Scotland plans to continue the significant progress achieved in recent years in enabling free access to its properties. There are in excess of 250 sites throughout Scotland to which the general public have free access all year round.</p>

  <p>Progress has also been made on a number of initiatives including the Free Weekend, held annually in April. Last year, 58,500 visitors took advantage of the Free Weekend to visit the 74 paying sites throughout Scotland, including Edinburgh, Stirling and Urquhart Castles. There is also free access to Edinburgh Castle, St Andrews Castle and St Andrews Cathedral on St Andrew&rsquo;s Day each year.</p>

  <p>Historic Scotland also operates a free educational visit scheme which attracted 66,660 free visits last year.</p>

  <p>In recent years, Historic Scotland has focused on community engagement and significantly increased its levels of community based activity and access.</p>

  <p>The pilot was scheduled to run for eight to 12 months from July 2004. It aimed to test both the single survey concept and whether it would be viable on a voluntary, market-led basis. It was hoped that the market could deliver 1,200 surveys.</p>

  <p>We believe that the rationale for the single survey remains strong, providing in-depth information on property condition to both sellers and potential buyers. But as only 74 surveys have been commissioned it is clear that the potential marketing advantages do not provide sufficient incentives for house sellers to take part. We have therefore concluded that the market will not deliver the single survey on a voluntary basis and that we should now evaluate the outcomes of the pilot with a view to designing a mandatory scheme.</p>

  <p>In 2003-04 the expenditure shown was met from Private Sector Housing Grant (PSHG) totalling &pound;50 million, which was provided by the Scottish Executive for this and other types of investment in private sector housing.

  <p>The Scottish Executive&rsquo;s published proposals for the Scottish Human Rights Commission do not include it having formal enforcement powers. Enforcement of compliance with human rights legislation is a matter for the courts. The commission will be able to investigate and report on generic or sectoral human rights issues.

  <p>Under the Scottish National Party&rsquo;s proposal to set up a Scottish Trust for Public Investment (STPI), borrowing would cost more than claimed, unless guaranteed by the Scottish Executive/Treasury in which case would require investments to be controlled within block &quot;public expenditure&quot; totals and &quot;on balance sheet&quot;.</p>

  <p>PFI is not simply about borrowing money to fund construction costs from the private sector but is about creating a structure in which better value for money is achieved by looking at the project as a whole over its life.</p>

  <p>Whilst the cost of finance is a component of this structure, cheaper finance in itself does not necessarily mean better overall value for money. The optimisation of risk allocation, competition and innovation which PFI brings should more than offset the additional costs of financing.</p>

  <p>In 2004-05, the estimated unitary payments for signed NHSScotland PFI contracts is &pound;100.184 million. This represents 1.26% of forecast revenue expenditure for NHS boards.</p>

  <p>The total costs under the PFI/PPP contract reflect not just the cost of constructing facilities but the provision of defined services over the period of the contract. Charges payable to the private sector provider are agreed locally in advance and parcelled up into annual payments. These are constant in real terms, the only increase being to take account of inflation and agreed variations in services provided. Payment levels are therefore known and budgets planned accordingly. Any NHSScotland body has to be able to demonstrate the affordability of the scheme within a full business case prior to finalising the contract.</p>

  <p>Profit streams from NHS PPP contracts relating to private sector contractors are commercially sensitive. It is the responsibility of the procuring public sector body to ensure that the PPP procurement route shows value for money compared to a conventional procurement route.</p>

  <p>There are 65 specialist cardiac nurses in the NHS in Scotland.

They have supported two heart failure nurses in Dumfries and Galloway and we are awaiting the outcome of a national mapping exercise of heart failure services they are conducting.</p>

  <p>We have a good story to tell in Scotland with our cardiac services. Our chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke Strategy brought &pound;40 million funding over three years. Some NHS boards &ndash; including Greater Glasgow and Ayrshire and Arran &ndash; have spent some of this money on heart failure services. Last week, we announced that Scottish patients have the shortest waiting times in the UK for diagnosis and treatment of coronary heart disease. The Executive is pressing ahead with plans to ban smoking in all enclosed public places &ndash; which the British Heart Foundation called: &quot;a bold decision&hellip; showing how seriously they take the health of their country&quot;. And above all else, we have cut the rate of premature death from CHD by 38% since 1995.</p>

  <p>The Executive recently completed a public consultation exercise on draft regulations to govern a scheme to recover NHS costs in cases of personal injury compensation. Although the full analysis of the responses to the consultation is still under way, one of the key messages to come out of our initial analysis was that high levels of concern remain about the insurance market&rsquo;s ability to cope with the scheme. I have therefore decided that now is not the right time to introduce such a scheme. However, we remain committed to the principles that underpin the scheme and it is our intention to introduce it by 1 October 2006.</p>

  <p>No. The Care Commission&rsquo;s role is to regulate care services defined in the <em>Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001</em> , which includes care home services. When inspecting a care home, Care Commission staff look for evidence that medicines management systems in the home are safe. The Commission is not however responsible for monitoring the clinical advice, treatment and prescribing practices of GPs to their patients in care homes. Prescribing advisers in NHS boards monitor prescribing trends, and support prescribing practices, for prescribing by GPs for patients in care homes who are registered with their practices.</p>

  <p>Following completion of the A92 Route Action Management Plan in November 2004 a number of proposals to improve road safety on the A92 between New Inn and the Tay Road Bridge have been approved and will be implemented during 2005-06. These include:</p>

<p>The renewal of road markings, the installation of bollards and the provision of red textured surfacing at all junctions;<br />

  <p>Development trusts in rural areas are supported in a number of ways. The Scottish Rural Partnership Fund offers grant aid through a competitive bidding process for development trusts to build community capacity and provide local services or facilities. Development trusts are also eligible to apply for support through Communities Scotland&rsquo;s Futurebuilders programme aimed at building the capacity of social enterprise. The Executive through Communities Scotland is also funding the Development Trusts Association Scotland which has good representation from rural trusts. Support may also be available via the Enterprise Networks&rsquo; Business Gateway.</p>

  <p>1. The Western Isles did not participate in SALSUS 2002.</p>

  <p>2. Data up to 1998 is based on biennial surveys of S1 to S4 schoolchildren in Scotland by the office of National Statistics and National Centre for Social Research and the National Foundation of Education Research.</p>

  <p>3. Data is only collected at a Scotland level, except for SALSUS 2002, which collected data at the level of health boards.</p>

  <p>4. Since 2002 trend data is extracted from the Scottish Schools Adolescent Lifestyle and Substance Use Surveys (SALSUS) of S2 and S4 pupils which are carried out biennially.</p>

  <p>5. For the purposes of these surveys, a regular smoker is defined as someone who usually smokes one or more cigarettes a week.</p>

  <p>As announced last October, the Scottish Executive has allocated &pound;13 million over the next three years for the Strategic Timber Transport Fund. &pound;3 million has been allocated for 2005-06 and &pound;5 million for each of the following two years.</p>

  <p>Forestry Commission Scotland has been working closely with the Timber Transport Forum to produce the criteria governing the Strategic Timber Transport Fund. These have now been agreed and will be published shortly.</p>

  <p>It is not our intention to use the fund to finance investment on items like sea access equipment, which could be assisted by other methods such as the Freight Facilities Grant. I would expect the fund to complement other work by, for example; providing in-forest road links to port or rail facilities that take pressure off fragile roads or reduce disruption to rural communities.</p>

  <p>It is entirely appropriate that Forestry Commission Scotland, as the Executive&rsquo;s Forestry Department, remains the final arbiter in respect of any decision. However, whilst the Commission will administer the fund and take final decisions regarding applications, the Timber Transport Forum and Regional Timber Transport Groups may also be asked for their advice on certain applications. I am delighted that the various organisations involved in the forum agreed to help with this important work and that they managed to agree the criteria and procedures so quickly.</p>

  <p>The National Waste Plan, published in 2003, envisages that energy recovery from municipal waste will increase to 7% by 2010 and 14% by 2020. The overall impact of the plan, including significant reductions in landfill and increased recycling and composting, is estimated to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by some 2.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2020.</p>

  <p>Dumping sewage on land is illegal in Scotland.</p>

  <p>I explained the research that has been undertaken into the impact of sludge recovery by land-spreading in response to question S2W-5087 from Karen Gillon MSP on 5 January 2004. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="/webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a>.</p>

  <p>More recently, research was carried out in Scotland by HW Erhard and SM Rhind of the Macaulay Land Use Research Institute, Aberdeen, in which sewage sludge was used as a vector for real-life environmental pollutants. Some results were published in <em>The Science of the Total Environment 332,</em> pp 101 &ndash; 108.</p>
