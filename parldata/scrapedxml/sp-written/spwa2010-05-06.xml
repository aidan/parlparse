  <p>The following table illustrates the expenditure allocated to energy efficiency and renewable energy initiatives for financial year 2010-11. For the purposes of our policy and programme objectives, energy efficiency initiatives and energy reduction initiatives are treated as the same thing.</p>

  <p>In addition to the expenditure outlined below, energy efficiency and renewables are supported through a number of other schemes that focus on other policy objectives. It is not possible to accurately estimate the level of energy efficiency and renewables expenditure which such schemes will incur in 2010-11. Similarly, energy efficiency and renewables expenditure by agencies is an operational matter for those agencies.</p>

  <p>Section 94 of the Climate Change (Scotland) Act requires an annual carbon assessment of the Scottish Budget, with the Scottish Government producing a report describing the direct and indirect impact on greenhouse gas emissions of its expenditure plans.</p>

  <p>The first such carbon assessment was published alongside the Draft Budget in September 2009, including the impact of both energy efficiency and renewables expenditure.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s discussion paper, Towards a Low Carbon Economy for Scotland, reported in March that from a baseline of around 70,000 jobs in 2008, the low carbon sector in Scotland could support an additional 60,000 jobs by 2020, of which 26,000 jobs could be created in the renewable energy industry.</p>

  <p>By 2015 it is estimated that almost 32,000 jobs could be created in the low carbon sector, of which around 13,500 jobs could be created in the renewables sector. The remainder of the low carbon jobs are expected to be created in the environmental management and emerging low carbon technologies sectors.</p>

  <p>There are currently no forecasts of the number of jobs that could be created over the next 20 years in Scotland&rsquo;s low carbon and renewable energy sector.</p>

  <p>The transition to a low carbon economy presents major opportunities for Scotland to develop new industries, skills and jobs, and the Scottish Government works through the enterprise agencies to realise those opportunities.</p>

  <p>For instance, this year, in conjunction with the Crown Estate, we have hosted three very well attended offshore wind supply chain &quot;share fair&quot; events in Scotland. These events highlighted both the range and scale of the market opportunity to Scottish firms associated with the planned expansion of the offshore wind sector.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Government is developing a Low Carbon Strategy to maximise Scotland&rsquo;s economic potential in the global low carbon market.</p>

  <p>More generally, The Carbon Trust and Energy Saving Trust are funded by the Scottish Government to provide energy efficiency advice to all sizes of business. This advice ranges from site surveys to identify where energy savings can be implemented, to training events which raise awareness of the business benefits from introducing low carbon practices in the workplace.</p>

  <p>Through our Energy Saving Scotland small business loans scheme, SMEs can access interest-free loans for a range of energy efficiency and renewables measures, offering business opportunities through mechanisms such as the Feed-in Tariff for electricity generation.</p>

  <p>Scottish Fish Producer Organisations are responsible for managing the uptake of quotas allocated to them in a way that best suits their members. The Scottish Government monitors their performance.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has drawn the attention of the producer organisations and other fisheries stakeholders to the fact that the continuation of fishing activity at its current rate could lead to the early closure of whitefish and nephrops fisheries. On a number of occasions in recent weeks it has discussed with representatives of the fishing industry how fishing opportunities might best be managed in the context of the opportunities available and the uptake to date in terms of both landings and fishing effort.</p>

  <p>The following table notes uptake of available quota on 28 April 2010:</p>

  <p>Note: *For West of Scotland Haddock and Cod, figures quoted are for ICES Area Via.</p>

  <p>Consultations with the fishing industry have involved stakeholders from all parts of the country and from each of the industry sectors. They have focussed on a number of points, including ways in which available fishing opportunities can be increased; methods by which the uptake of opportunities can be better rationed over the course of the year, and, ways in which greater flexibility can be introduced into licensing and other regulatory arrangements to provide fishing businesses with greater scope to adapt and grow.</p>

  <p>The government is committed to working closely with the catching sector to help ensure a full year fishery, and will manage the non-sector vessels for which it has direct responsibility to achieve that outcome. It is for producer organisations to assess the consequences for the marketing of their produce of any failure to ensure continuity of supply.</p>

  <p>European Regulations (Article 20(5) of EC Regulation 2371/2002) already provide for the exchange of fishing opportunities between EU member states, which have traditionally been pursued through international quota swaps. The Scottish Government and Scottish Fish Producer Organisations seek to increase fishing opportunities through the use of these provisions.</p>

  <p>The following table shows the percentage of qualifiers from the University of Abertay and the University of Dundee who were in full-time employment six months after qualifying. This is based on the Destination of Leavers from Higher Education (DLHE) survey carried out by higher education institutions and collated by the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA). This survey is not repeated at 12 months so data for the percentage of qualifiers in full-time employment at that stage is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Futures Trust (SFT) has no official role collecting data on local authority waste management infrastructure requirements. However, as a one off exercise in partnership with COSLA, SFT is collecting data to enable the public and private sector to have a clearer picture of the 32 local authority waste infrastructure plans to help meet both landfill diversion and recycling targets.</p>
