  <p>A person who has been adopted in Scotland upon reaching the age of 16 years has an automatic right of access to her or his original birth details, and the court process papers from the adoption case and any freeing. Once an adopted person has access to her or his original birth details they may be able to trace the names of their grandparents through the records held by the Registrar General for Scotland or his equivalent.</p>

  <p>The Registrar General for Scotland must also maintain an index of the entries in the Adopted Children Register, and keep such other information to enable a connection to be made between an entry in the Adopted Children Register and the adopted person's original birth details.</p>

  <p>The Registrar General for Scotland may only provide such information to the adopted person themselves, specified counsellors acting on their behalf, or if ordered to do so by Order of the Court. In a case where the adopted person is deceased, it would be open to the family to make an approach to the sheriff of the court that granted the adoption requesting an order for the relevant information to be released to them.</p>

  <p>Adopted children under the age of 16 have no automatic right of access to information that would allow them to trace their original birth details, but adoption agencies are able to provide information in appropriate circumstances, while recognising the need to involve the adoptive parents.</p>

  <p>Phase II of the Adoption Policy Review, which commenced on 18 March, will consider the legal framework for adoption and fostering. As part of that consideration, it will review the issue of tracing and access to adoption records. It is expected to make recommendations to ministers late in 2004.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to the current UK-wide process to establish the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management (CoRWM). CoRWM will consider all options for Intermediate and High Level Waste. No decisions have been taken about what to do with the waste, and so questions about siting at this stage are hypothetical.</p>

  <p>Openness and transparency is essential in order to inspire public confidence on radioactive waste management issues. Therefore, following CoRWM's recommendations to ministers, there will be a public debate on how to implement the preferred option(s).</p>

  <p>The management of radioactive waste is a devolved matter, as are the land-use planning and environmental control regimes. Decisions about policy on radioactive waste storage and disposal in Scotland are, therefore, for the Scottish ministers and Parliament.</p>

  <p>We introduced a rate relief scheme for small businesses with effect from 1 April 2003. All businesses, including rural businesses, with a rateable value of &#163;10,000 or less are eligible for a discount of between 5% and 50% on the rate poundage. In addition, we introduced a rate relief scheme for qualifying new farm diversification enterprises and an extension to the agricultural exemption from rates to certain buildings used in connection with agricultural operations. In areas designated as rural by the Scottish ministers, we have extended the scope of the existing rural (village shop) rate relief scheme to qualifying hotels/public houses, petrol filling stations and small food shops and we have exempted cashline machines from paying rates.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to ensuring that all of Scotland benefits from the relocation of public sector jobs. In his November 2001 answer, Angus MacKay said that SNH was one of several bodies then about to undertake a relocation review under the Executive's dispersal policy. Ministers' decision to relocate SNH's Edinburgh headquarters to Inverness clearly demonstrates that the Executive means to deliver on the dispersal of public sector jobs around Scotland.</p>

  <p>The move to Inverness will bring benefits in terms of the development of the relocation policy which outweigh purely financial considerations. SNH currently works between two buildings in Edinburgh. A move to a single energy-efficient headquarters building away from the extremely competitive Edinburgh labour market will realise significant long-term efficiency gains. Over a 30-year period the move to Inverness will cost in the region of &#163;22 million in net present value terms. On the same cost basis, the other options considered (including the status quo) ranged from over &#163;15 million to &#163;22 million. The other locations set out in the DTZ Pieda relocation report and considered by ministers were the status quo and a new combined site in Edinburgh, Perth, Stirling and West Lothian. I met separately with SNH management and its Trade Unions to hear their views before ministers reached the Inverness decision.</p>

  <p>We acknowledge that the relocation will cause SNH some short- to medium-term problems, including the possibility that some staff may leave rather than undertake the move. But as mentioned above, a new sustainable headquarters building in Inverness will realise significant long-term efficiency gains. A package of measures is being designed to ensure that the relocation goes ahead as smoothly as possible. It will provide assistance for SNH staff and minimise disruption to SNH's core work over the transitional period. All efforts will be made to minimise the scope of redundancies and ensure that any necessary redundancies are negotiated on a voluntary basis. SNH is firming up the estimated cost of a new building in Inverness as part of an overall project plan. The cost of this will be partly offset by the sale proceeds of the Hope Terrace headquarters, currently estimated at approximately &#163;1.75 million, and of SNH's current buildings in Inverness which may realise some &#163;2 million.</p>

  <p>The timing of the move will partly be determined by the lease break occurring at the Anderson Place headquarters, which gave rise to the relocation review. The lease will expire on 31 March 2005 and it is expected that the vast majority of staff currently based there will have relocated to Inverness by that date. The disposal of the Hope Terrace headquarters will depend on the timing of securing appropriate accommodation in Inverness. I am asking SNH to work up a project plan to address these and other aspects of the relocation and submit this to ministers in due course.</p>

  <p>Increased access to high quality sports and other recreational facilities is essential to ensure that the health, educational and other benefits of an active lifestyle are achieved.</p>

  <p>Local authorities are the major providers of sports facilities and opportunities in Scotland and the Executive, through <strong></strong>sportscotland, will continue to work with local authorities to ensure that they continue to play a key role in delivering sport for young people.</p>

  <p>One of the key targets in Sport 21 2003-07 is to ensure that over 500 sports halls will be available to the public so that 70% of Scots have access to a hall within 20 minutes walk. Another key target is to ensure that every local authority area's community planning process contributes to the delivery of sport.</p>

  <p>In addition to the current investment of &#163;52 million by the New Opportunities Fund in new and improved sports facilities for young people, the Executive is committed to investment of nearly &#163;2 billion to improve the school estate. This will include high quality sports facilities to meet the needs of the schools and their local communities.</p>

  <p>Visitscotland.com's annual business plan requires the approval of VisitScotland. It sets out visitscotland.com's business strategy and targets, and the actions needed to achieve them. Visitscotland.com is a commercial company and its business plan targets for bookings and turnover are commercially sensitive.</p>

  <p>At the outset of its operations, visitscotland.com entered into a service-level agreement with VisitScotland and the 13 participating area tourist boards, which sets out performance standards for the operation of the website and the contact centre at Livingston. The agreement provides incentives to meet or exceed these standards, which can only be done by meeting and exceeding customer expectations and thereby increasing the volumes of business generated by visitscotland.com. Any failure to meet consistently the standards set out in the agreement is addressed through a full range of provisions covering <em>inter alia</em> response times, call abandonment rate and customer satisfaction, which trigger either service credits or service defaults.</p>

  <p>Our Major Events Strategy, which we published In November 2002, sets out the Executive's vision of Scotland becoming one of the world's foremost events destinations by 2015. The strategy was developed in close partnership with <strong> </strong> key players in the public sector already involved in major events, including <strong></strong> sportscotland, VisitScotland, the Scottish Arts Council, Scottish Enterprise, Highlands and Islands Enterprise, COSLA and the cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow.</p>

  <p>The strategy is now being taken forward by EventScotland, which is a joint venture between the Executive and VisitScotland; it has been allocated &#163;10 million funding from the Scottish Executive via VisitScotland in the next three years (&#163;2 million this year, &#163;3 million in 2004-05 and &#163;5 million in 2005-06). EventScotland is working with a wide range of partners, including the area tourist boards, VisitBritain, other tourism organisations and local authorities to develop a portfolio of major events that will help attract visitors to Scotland, and to enhance Scotland's international profile.</p>

  <p>None. This is an operational matter for the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, carried out as a matter of course in discharging its duty to regulate landfill. The operator is shortly expected to apply for a new permit to comply with the Landfill (Scotland) Regulations 2003. Consideration of this application will enable the agency to address the operation of this site in great detail.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-32193 by Mr Jim Wallace on 12 December 2002, whether it will meet representatives of Grampian Police, Northern Constabulary and the army to discuss Operation Youth Advantage; whether it will replicate this scheme throughout Scotland, and what assessment it has made of the success of the scheme with regard to turning young people away from a life of crime and offending and towards being good citizens.</p>

  <p>Operation Youth Advantage is a project that for the past two years has been run by the British Army Careers Team. Both Northern Constabulary and Grampian Police have been involved in the scheme which gives young people the opportunity to participate in courses that are intended to give them a more responsible attitude and discourage them from becoming involved in criminal and anti-social behaviour. We are committed to addressing youth crime and welcome police participation in projects such as this. I understand that the army are looking at extending the scheme to other areas. In that case, it will be for individual forces to decide on the extent of their involvement.</p>
