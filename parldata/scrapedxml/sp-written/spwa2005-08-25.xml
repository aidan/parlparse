  <p>SmartWater is a property marking solution which has been privately developed for commercial purposes and is aimed primarily at organisations and companies with an interest in the prevention and detection of crime. I understand that Aberdeen City Council piloted the technology in several streets at the start of the year, the first authority in Scotland to do so. Due to the reduction in housebreaking in these areas, the council is now funding a roll-out of the scheme across the city with the assistance of neighbourhood and community wardens, many of whom are funded by the Executive. We therefore have a clear interest in the scheme and I have asked my officials to monitor and evaluate progress.</p>

  <p>The Executive believes that members of the public should have access to the final report of the Cultural Commission, which was published on 23 June. The document is available via the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s website - <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Arts-Culture" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Arts-Culture</a> &ndash; and can be accessed online in public libraries. An electronic &quot;html&quot; version is also being produced for posting on the Executive&rsquo;s website.</p>

  <p>The commission was responsible for printing the report. Since the launch &ndash; for which the commission had 100 copies printed, all of which have been distributed - the Scottish Executive has arranged for an additional 1,000 printed copies of the report to be produced. They are being distributed to main public libraries, local authorities, those who provided assistance to the commission, including respondents who have not yet received copies, and others who have requested a copy.</p>

  <p>Funding for local authorities is now mainstreamed within the general allocation. Original allocations were determined by a range of factors influencing their spending needs, including the impact of depravation and sparsity.</p>

  <p>Between 2001-02 and 2003-04 NHS treatment funding was allocated on the basis of the substance misuse formula drawn from Arbuthnott. Additional funding in 2004-05 was concentrated in areas of high prevalence. For 2005-06 to 2006-07 the allocation of additional funding for drug treatment and rehabilitation was made on the basis of drug action team proposals which detailed projected improvements in numbers into treatment, waiting times and the range of services available locally. The funding will be issued to NHS boards in the first instance.</p>

  <p>Funding for drug action teams was allocated on the same basis as treatment funding and has remained constant for the past six years.</p>

  <p>Tables are available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre. Table 1 (Bib. number 37263) shows the combined figures for acute and psychiatric hospital discharges with an explicit diagnosis of alcohol related conditions and drug misuse for the period 1999-2000 to 2001-02. Complete data on psychiatric discharges are unavailable for 2002-03 and 2003-04. This has been reported as discharge information because the detail is drawn from two datasets and one of these datasets records discharge data only.</p>

  <p>Table 2 (Bib. number 37264) provides information on discharges from general acute hospitals only for the period 2001-02 to 2003-04. The table with the 2003-04 figures are provisional. For acute hospitals, only discharge data exists.</p>

  <p>During the drafting of the Fire (Scotland) Bill and its subsequent introduction to the Scottish Parliament and scrutiny, Scottish Executive officials liaised with colleagues in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) regarding the reform of fire safety legislation.</p>

  <p>Included in those discussions was the future of the Fire Precautions (Sub-Surface Railway Stations) Regulations 1989. The Scottish Executive and the ODPM agreed that a consistent approach across the UK was desirable and that no proposals would be made to revoke these regulations until such time as sector-specific fire safety guidance, showing how all necessary protections currently afforded by the 1989 Regulations are continued by other laws, had been made available.</p>
