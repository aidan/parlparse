  <p>Cancer services in Scotland are delivered by clinicians working within managed clinical networks. The number of oncologists employed in any health board area and the ratio of these to population is therefore not an indicator of the level of patient access to these highly specialised services.</p>

  <p>The Executive has invited public comment on the Scottish Charity Law Review Commission&#8217;s recommendations. The consultation period ends on 30 September. The Executive will consider the comments received before preparing a full response to the report. In doing so it will also take account of the wider strategic review of the social economy, which is currently under way.</p>

  <p>It is anticipated that the Executive&#8217;s response will be published early in 2002.</p>

  <p>I understand that the distribution of <i>Your World: Biotechnology &amp; You</i> on a pilot basis was arranged by Scottish Enterprise after discussion with Learning and Teaching Scotland (the umbrella organisation for the Higher Still Development Unit) and Her Majesty&#8217;s Inspectorate of Education. Discussions are under way to determine whether the continued distribution would be useful to Scottish Students.</p>

  <p>The Biotechnology Institute, the American organisation which publishes <i>Your World,</i> is currently funded by contributions from foundations and non-profit making organisations, corporate grants and teacher subscriptions. In general no donor contributes more than 5% of the total funding of the institute. I understand the financial contributors to the institute do not have a role in reviewing, editing or approving the <i>Your World </i>issues.</p>

  <p>Estimates of employee jobs in Scotland are produced by the Office for National Statistics from their Annual Business Inquiry (ABI). This survey has run from December 1998, replacing the Annual Employment Survey (AES) which last ran in September 1998.</p>

  <p>The AES estimates for Scotland were compiled by aggregating site level values, whether collected directly through the survey or estimated, for all workplaces in Scotland. The improved methodology developed for the ABI survey collects information from head offices and estimates are made for Scotland using imputation and modelling routines. More information on the differences between AES and ABI is given in &quot;The launch of the Annual Business Inquiry&quot; which was published in the May 2001 edition of <i>Labour Market Trends</i>.</p>

  <p>The change to ABI in 1998 resulted in a rise of about 110,000 employee jobs in Scotland but only a small number of these (about 8,500) were in the manufacturing sector. In the final results of the AES, the number of employees in manufacturing in Scotland was 316,000, 15.6% of Scotland&#8217;s total employees. In the first results of the ABI the figure was 325,000, 15.2% of the Scotland total.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what measures are in place to minimise public exposure to endocrine disrupters and other dioxins.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2001-08-22.13.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80135" speakername="Rhona Brankin" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-01/wa0822.htm#9">

  <p>The Scottish Executive recognises the seriousness of the impact of endocrine disrupters and dioxins on human health. The risk of direct exposure through air, water and soil is very limited, and the majority of human exposures to dioxins arise through the consumption of food. Measures are therefore in place to limit the amount of dioxins reaching the food chain.</p>

  <p>Pollution control legislation, including the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and the Municipal Waste Incinerators Directives, which came into force in the UK in December 1996 has greatly reduced emissions of dioxins and other endocrine disrupting chemicals in the UK. The provisions of the new Pollution Prevention and Control (Scotland) Regulations 2000 will continue this trend.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) include conditions within Consents to Discharge under the Control of Pollution Act 1974 that limit discharges of certain endocrine disrupting compounds into the aquatic environment.</p>

  <p>The Food Standards Agency (FSA) oversees the implementation of guidelines on tolerable intakes of dioxins for the UK. The FSA has a programme of research and surveillance, including endocrine disrupters, that seeks to ensure that consumers are protected, and has represented the UK in European discussions on European Commission proposals to introduce stricter community-wide limits on dioxin concentrations in foodstuffs and animal feed. The agency is also seeking the advice of the Committee on Toxicology (COT) on the safety of dioxins in foodstuffs, and will use this advice in the further development of policy.</p>

  <p>Scottish drinking water comes from upland or groundwater free from sources of endocrine disrupting chemicals or dioxins. Safeguards against subsequent contamination of drinking water by materials used in the treatment or distribution of water are included in the Water Supply (Water Quality) (Scotland) Regulations 1990. These require that all relevant chemicals or materials are approved by the Scottish ministers on the recommendation of the (UK) Committee on Products and Processes for use in Public Water Supply.</p>

  <p>The most important step in tackling the effects of foot-and-mouth disease was to eradicate the disease as quickly as possible so that recovery measures could be introduced. The last reported case in Scotland was on 30 May, since when we have been able to remove most of the restrictions on access to the countryside for the benefit of tourism and have removed constraints on the movement of livestock as far as it is prudent to so do. We have also permitted a limited resumption of livestock markets from 20 August, with a more general re-opening of markets planned from 1 September. This will benefit many farmers and related businesses such as haulage companies. The European Commission has agreed to our proposals for a private storage aid scheme for UK sheepmeat which will help to remove some of the anticipated surplus from the market later in the year. I am also pressing the case for the early resumption of exports of meat and livestock from Scotland which would represent a further important step in the recovery process. Businesses affected by the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak are also benefiting from the &#163;30 million of financial support which we have announced over the past few months.</p>

  <p>When a medicine receives a UK marketing authorisation, either from the Medicines Control Agency or the European Medicines Evaluation Authority, it becomes prescribable on the NHS unless it is added to Schedule 10, or in certain circumstances, Schedule 11 to the NHS (General Medical Services) (Scotland) Regulations 1995.</p>

  <p>Health boards determine their prescribing policy on new medicines, taking into account local needs and advice from their Area Drugs and Therapeutic Committee (AD&amp;TC). A Scottish Medicines Consortium will be established this autumn to support AD&amp;TCs by providing a single Scottish evaluation of new medicines at or near the time of marketing. In addition, some new medicines will be evaluated by the Health Technology Board for Scotland. The advice of the National Institute of Clinical Excellence is also made available publicly.</p>

  <p>Health boards&#8217; unified budgets include provision for the cost of prescribed medicines and are set to allow for the introduction of new medicines and the greater use of existing therapies. As these funds form part of their unified budget, health boards have the flexibility to decide locally how to use them. It is for health boards and Trusts to agree the amount to be set aside for new medicines or treatments.</p>

  <p>It is not our intention that the liability of landowners in respect of those visiting their land should increase as a result of the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill.

  <p>Reducing the incidence and impact of smoking requires action on a number of fronts. The UK Government estimates that a ban on tobacco advertising and promotion might lead eventually to a 2.5% reduction in the number of smokers.

  <p>The Executive is taking forward a range of measures to reduce smoking levels and the appeal of smoking among young people.</p>

  <p>These include health education and promotion of a holistic approach to healthy lifestyles, for example the &quot;Confidence to Learn&quot; training package being developed by HEBS for primary school teachers in order to help younger children to develop decision-making skills and the ability to cope with peer pressure. In addition &quot;Young Scot&quot; have produced a pack aimed at teenagers to encourage healthy lifestyles including advice on smoking.</p>

  <p>HEBS has undertaken mass media advertising, including the highly acclaimed STINX advertisement, aimed at teenagers, which promotes the message that smoking is neither healthy nor &quot;cool&quot;. The new <i>&quot;</i>Aliens<i>&quot;</i> advert and competition, which was launched on 16 August, continues the anti-smoking drive.</p>

  <p>The authorities are expected to take their decisions on expenditure with due regard to the principles of government accounting concerning the regularity, propriety and economy, efficiency and effectiveness of their proposals. Given the number of projects undertaken at any one time by the authorities, it would not be appropriate for the Executive to monitor each of these on an individual basis. Projects exceeding the delegated authority are required to be submitted to the Executive for approval.</p>

  <p>Guidance to ensure that best value is obtained in contracts has been issued to the three water authorities. It is issued in the context of the Financial and Management Memorandum and Scottish Executive Finance Guidance notes. This guidance is reviewed periodically.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what monitoring it undertakes of different public works contract procedures used by the water authorities; what plans it has to review these procedures to ensure best practice, and whether it will issue guidance to introduce common practices across the authorities.</p>

  <p>As I mentioned in my answers to questions S1W-17483 and S1W-17484, water authorities are expected to take their decisions on expenditure with due regard to the principles of government accounting concerning the regularity, propriety and economy, efficiency and effectiveness of their proposals. It is for the water authorities to establish the best means of securing this.</p>

  <p>Guidance is currently being prepared for Scottish Water. It will include, amongst other subjects that establish how the new authority will be run, guidance to ensure that decisions on expenditure are taken with due regard to the principles of government accounting concerning the regularity, propriety and economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the proposals.</p>
