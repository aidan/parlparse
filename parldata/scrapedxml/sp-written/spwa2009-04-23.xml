  <p>The Scottish Government is keen to look at ways to maintain and enhance the quantity of Scottish music played on radio stations. A voluntary quota and other ways of ensuring a stronger commitment to support the music industry in Scotland will therefore be considered over the next few months.

  <p>No. There is a long history of dentists providing a mixture of NHS and private treatment and we see no problem with a properly constituted dental body corporate providing NHS dentistry. Dental bodies corporate require to have a majority of directors that are registered dentists or dental care professionals, or a combination of both.</p>

  <p>In contrast, general practice accounts for the vast majority of patient contacts with the NHS and often deals with the most important of life events. General practices are the gatekeepers to the rest of the NHS and it is essential that they are owned and run by individuals personally involved in the delivery of NHS services. That is why the Scottish Government does not consider the delivery of general practice by commercial organisations, driven by financial interest of shareholders, to be compatible with our policy of a mutual NHS.</p>

  <p>I am aware from your recent letter to the First Minister of the case of your constituent who had a job offer withdrawn but then re-instated whilst awaiting a disclosure check. I will provide a full and considered response to that letter in due course.</p>

  <p>Disclosure Scotland is generally dependent on other information providers when carrying out disclosure checks and this can on occasion affect turnaround times. In addition, between November 2008 and March 2009 there were delays to Disclosure Scotland&rsquo;s service due to the introduction of a major and necessary IT disaster recovery solution. I am happy to report that Disclosure Scotland has since been returning certificates within its service level agreement.</p>

  <p>On 3 February, the Scottish Government was notified of an outbreak of Clostridium difficile in NHS Orkney (NHSO). Seventeen patients, including one member of staff, had been confirmed as Clostridium difficile positive since the start of January 2009. This compared to a total of 26 cases for the whole of 2008. Seven cases were identified in the community, 10 in hospital. Of the 17, three have died, with Clostridium difficile recorded on two of the death certificates, in both cases as a contributory cause of death.</p>

  <p>Immediately the situation became known, the Chief Nursing Officer (CNO) asked Health Protection Scotland (HPS) to visit to fully explore the circumstances and to provide support, which they did on 6 February. The CNO, supported by members of the Scottish Government HAI team and HPS also visited the board on 10 February, and an action plan was produced. Through weekly monitoring, I am being kept informed of progress.</p>

  <p>The detail of the <em>Clostridium difficile</em> outbreak was reported publicly through local media and the NHS Orkney, HAI Reporting template (HAIRT), and the HAIRT was discussed at the NHSO board meeting on 19 February 2009. A copy can be accessed through the NHSO website using the following link <a href="http://www.ohb.scot.nhs.uk/images/pdf/OHB114 Orkney HAI.doc" target="_blank">http://www.ohb.scot.nhs.uk/images/pdf/OHB114%20Orkney%20HAI.doc</a>.</p>

  <p>I spoke to the Chair of NHS Orkney on 5 February and met him on 4 March. He reassured me that the outbreak was contained and the action plan was in place, and I have asked that NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (QIS) review the clinical governance arrangements in place across NHS Orkney, which is consistent with their remit to provide advice and guidance on effective clinical practice.</p>

  <p>A further review of infection control arrangements will also be undertaken by HPS by the end of September 2009.</p>

  <p>Since the announcement of the establishment of the Low-cost Initiative for First-Time Buyers in October 2007, a total 1,217 interest free loans have been provided. Of this total, 736 people have been able to purchase a home through the Open Market Shared Equity Pilot scheme (OMSEP) and 481 through the New Supply Shared Equity scheme (NSSE).</p>

  <p>No interest free loans are provided to housing associations. Housing associations receive Housing Association Grant (HAG) to build New Supply Shared Equity properties and the purchasers of these homes receive the interest free loan.</p>

  <p>Since May 2008 we have been able to monitor how many people participating in our shared equity schemes are first-time buyers. 85% of new supply and 94% of open market purchasers fall into this category. As well as first-time buyers the schemes also prioritise people in the Armed Forces or veterans and people living in social housing. The schemes can also help people who are looking for a new home after a significant change in their household circumstances, people who have a disability and own a house which does not suit their needs or owner occupiers who are affected by demolition plans as part of a regeneration scheme.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will provide a report of the recent visit to China by the First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-04-23.S3W-23141.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80381" speakername="Michael Russell" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa0423.htm#17">

  <p>The First Minister and the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning travelled to China this April in order to advance Scotland&rsquo;s relationship with China as set out in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s International Framework, and more specifically the refreshed China Plan published on the 7 May 2008. The First Minister&rsquo;s and Cabinet Secretary&rsquo;s visit was part of on-going programme of engagement with China and built on previous ministerial visits by this and previous administrations. The preparation for the visit included meetings with Amnesty International and the Scottish Human Rights Commission, as well as Scottish Enterprise and other partners with an interest in China.</p>

  <p>The visit provided the opportunity to promote Scotland as a key economic partner with a world-leading contribution in education and innovation &ndash; a nation that is very much open for business. This will support our purpose of increasing sustainable economic growth.</p>

  <p>The indications are that China will lead the global economy out of recession and expanding trade with such a major market can be an important contributing factor in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s own Economic Recovery Plan. The visit was a vital part of realising this potential with real benefits for jobs and businesses in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Cabinet Secretary and First Minster, building on the achievements of Ms Hyslop and Mr Swinney&rsquo;s visits last year, pursued activity framed around the Scottish Government&rsquo;s key sectors:</p>

  <p>Energy: The First Minister helped Scotland&rsquo;s Sgurr Energy officially launch their ground-breaking wind measurement device into the Chinese market. The First Minister also made the keynote address to a major renewable energy conference in Beijing and met Professor Lu Yongxiang, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and one of the eleven Saltire Prize challenge committee members. In Hong Kong, the First Minister met Hong Kong Electric International, who have been invited to explore opportunities for investment in Scotland, in particular using their expertise in subsea transmission systems.</p>

  <p>Creative Industries: The Cabinet Secretary supported the signing of a memorandum of understanding between Abertay Dundee University and Shanghai University following up from last year&rsquo;s visit and witnessed a further agreement, making Peking University&rsquo;s School of Software and Microelectronic Engineering an additional International Partner of the UK&rsquo;s first Centre of Excellence in computer games education, Abertay University.</p>

  <p>Financial and Business Services: The First Minister championed the long-term strengths of the financial services industry in Scotland and promoted new opportunities in growth areas such as asset management in his meetings with the Vice Mayor and the Financial Services Director-General, Dr. Fang Xinghai, and in speaking at the Sino Scottish Asset Management Forum.</p>

  <p>Food and Drink: The First Minister officially launched the &quot;Scotch&quot; element of The WhiskyLIVE Festival which is to run May 8 to 9 in China. In his meeting with the Chinese Minister of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ) Mr Wang Yong, the First Minister raised the issue of securing Geographical Indication of Origin for whisky along with other areas of trade including seed potato export and co-operation in food safety. As a direct result of this meeting, it is expected that there will be rapid progress towards protecting Scotch Whisky and in developing a food safety partnership between a Scottish company and the Chinese Academy of Inspection and Quarantine Sciences.</p>

  <p>Life Sciences: The Cabinet Secretary announced a new modern apprenticeship framework for life sciences in Beijing when she helped to launch the world&rsquo;s first commercially available multi-articulating bionic hand by Scottish prosthetics company Touch Bionics and its Chinese distributor ENJOYLIFE Prosthetics and Orthotics Company. The First Minister attended the signing of a memorandum of understanding between The University of Edinburgh&rsquo;s Centre for Regenerative Medicine, directed by Sir Ian Wilmut, and China&rsquo;s National Centre for International Research in Stem Cells based at Peking University.</p>

  <p>The Cabinet Secretary also launched a pioneering new partnership under which Chinese health professionals will learn from Scotland&rsquo;s leading medical experts. The collaborative training programme between NHS Scotland, the University of Edinburgh, China&rsquo;s Ministry of Health and China&rsquo;s Shandong based pharmaceutical giant Asiapharm will further boost educational and commercial ties between our two countries.</p>

  <p>Tourism: In Beijing the First Minister announced details of the &quot;Scottish Prestige Golf Club&quot; which offers China&rsquo;s 1 million golfers membership to &quot;Scotland - the Home of Golf&quot; as a result of a new scheme encouraging them to visit Scotland and play golf at some of the country&rsquo;s leading courses. He also promoted the Year of Homecoming throughout his visit, including to the Hong Kong Chambers of Commerce which have a significant Scottish membership.</p>

  <p>Universities: The Cabinet Secretary progressed a number of partnerships between institutions in Scotland and China as previously outlined. A new venture which enables Edinburgh Napier University to provide business expertise to Scottish companies seeking to expand in Hong Kong and China was launched. The Cabinet Secretary was the first representative of an overseas delegation to meet the new Vice Minister at the Ministry for Education, Mr Hao Ping. Formal approval was secured last week for a jointly funded programme of research partnerships. The Cabinet Secretary also launched a new programme of scholarships for Masters scholars from China, jointly funded by the Scottish Government and Scottish universities.</p>

  <p>The First Minister and the Cabinet Secretary held a number of high level government meetings. In discussion with the Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Li Hui, the First Minister commended the Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, who has said that during his recent visit to the UK he always carried a copy of Adam Smith&rsquo;s Theory of Moral Sentiments. The First Minister noted that Adam Smith prized justice as the quality above all others, that justice had the power to transform lives and transform whole nations, and this quality had an important place in China&rsquo;s on-going reform process which has already seen 600 million people lifted out of poverty. The First Minister also highlighted these issues in his public speaking engagements.</p>

  <p>The meetings with the Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister of AQSIQ, Hong Kong&rsquo;s Chief Executive and Shanghai&rsquo;s Vice Mayor were highly productive and agreement was made upon willingness to develop collaboration in trade, investment and education. The First Minister also met President Chen Haosu of the Chinese People&rsquo;s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, the organisation which facilitated the ministerial visit. Further bilateral cooperation between Scotland and China was agreed at this meeting.</p>

  <p>The outcomes of this visit are far reaching and are part of a sustained and focused programme of engagement with China which will generate, and in some cases is already generating, long-term benefits for Scotland.</p>

They offer support in a number of different ways including supply chain development and trade missions.</p>

  <p>Through a number of overseas visits, including my visits to Canada, the United States, Norway, Russia and Brussels, we have promoted the skills, knowledge and experience of the Scottish oil and gas industry to current and potential investors and also supported visits to Aberdeen such as that of President Calderon of Mexico.</p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise also keeps in close contact with the industry to assess current conditions and to offer additional help where possible. They are currently developing a number of initiatives to try and help counter the downturn. These include an advanced initiative for the development of an offshore decommissioning supply chain and increased access to specialist support.</p>

  <p>We continue to support the work of the Oil and Gas Academy in Aberdeen and are committed to working with them and Cogent to ensure that we have a skills and qualifications system which is responsive to the needs of their employers.</p>

  <p>This information is not held by the Scottish Government.</p>

  <p>The Care Commission was set up to regulate for improvement in the quality of care. It does not close care services immediately as a result of a failure to achieve acceptable grades in one or more quality themes.</p>

  <p>Where care services fail to achieve an acceptable standard of care, the Care Commission works with the provider to ensure that the quality improves. This may be partly through the use of formal enforcement action and through increased inspection and supervision.</p>

  <p>Ultimately, the commission can propose to cancel the registration of a service if it does not meet the improvement notice. This means that the care service would no longer be able to operate. The Care Commission sees closure of a care service as a last resort. Where a provider is failing to supply an adequate standard of care, additional support will be offered.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether allegations of unreasonable delay, incompetence or unfairness of any kind by the Highland Council in the handling of applications from Aviemore resort hotels were made to ministers or civil servants and, if so, who made the allegations and on what dates, whether any evidence supported the allegations and what steps were taken to ensure that incorrect allegations were refuted.</p>

  <p>Mary Scanlon MSP wrote to Scottish ministers on 7 December 2007 expressing concern that the planning application by Aviemore Highland Resort was being delayed by Highland Council, Cairngorms National Park Authority (CNPA), Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and Transport Scotland. Officials sought information from the CNPA about the timetable for the handling of the planning application. The First Minister subsequently wrote to Ms Scanlon to reassure her that the CNPA, as planning authority, was handling the application as promptly as possible.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-20740 by Stewart Stevenson on 2 March 2009 and given the imminent cessation of the Scottish Community and Householder Renewables Initiative programme, how it will monitor demand for the scheme in light of the proposed changes to permitted development rights for domestic microgeneration equipment.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-22259 on 9 April 2009. Support offered through the Scottish Community and Householder Renewable Initiative (SCHRI) will not cease, but will run under two distinct programmes from April 2009.</p>

  <p>The householder stream will continue to operate as it does at the moment but under the new banner of Energy Saving Scotland &ndash; home renewables, while the community stream will operate under the new name of the Community and Renewable Energy Scheme (CARES). The decision to separate support through SCHRI reflects the distinct needs of the different customer groups, and allows the individual delivery bodies to focus on the areas where they have the greatest expertise.</p>

  <p>Household grant support through the Energy Saving Scotland &ndash; home renewables will continue to be managed on our behalf by the Energy Saving Trust (EST) in Scotland. EST already report to my officials quarterly on the performance of the household grant scheme and this will not change as a result of the re-branding. These reports will be reviewed quarterly against current demand for the scheme, and against the formal annual evaluation of the EST programmes, to see if there has been an impact as a result of the changes to permitted development rights. Should significant changes in demand be experienced, further evaluation would be carried out to ascertain the cause.</p>

  <p>There are no plans to ring-fence funding for care home fees for the next three years. The Scottish Government is providing local government in Scotland with record levels of funding over the period 2008-10. The total package of funding over the two year period will see an investment of &pound;23 billion. The vast majority of the funding, including funding for care home fees, is being provided by means of a block grant. It is the responsibility of each local authority to allocate the total financial resources available to it on the basis of local needs and priorities, taking account of its statutory obligations and commitment to deliver the outcomes agreed jointly with the Scottish Government.</p>

  <p>In relation to care home fees for publicly funded clients, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities negotiates with representatives of the independent care home sector annually to set appropriate and consistent fee levels across Scotland as part of the National Care Home Contract. They have just agreed a settlement for the next two years which will mean that the fee base rate will be increased by 2.8% for 2009-10 and by 2.7% in 2010-11.</p>

  <p>No; this section of the A9 is in urgent need of major maintenance investment and we are taking the opportunity to provide an enhanced standard. The Strategic Transport Projects Review has identified dualling of the A9 as a strategic transport priority for Scotland. Our investment hierarchy is to maintain and safely operate our existing networks, make best use of these networks and finally, invest in targeted infrastructure improvements.</p>

Various discussions have taken place over the last nine months or so at official and ministerial level about the possibility of a further grant, which is not possible under the new arrangements for funding local projects by local authorities.</p>

  <p>The concordat with local authorities reinforces the principle that local delivery decisions should be made locally to ensure the delivery of local outcome agreement. Third sector organisations such as Community Service Volunteers can make a contribution to delivering single outcome agreements by engaging with community planning partnerships and local authorities.</p>

  <p>On 5 February 2009, I met the Director Scotland and a board member of CSV to discuss the contribution it could make to advancing volunteering. Officials from the Third Sector Division met representatives of CSV on 24 November 2008 and 2 February 2009 to discuss their request for a further grant for its Retired and Senior Volunteers programme, which matches volunteers to local projects. No minutes were taken of these meetings.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is currently conducting research into how the third sector contributes to its strategic objectives. The final report is expected at the end of April 2009. We recognise the potential for social enterprises to deliver health benefits and the work on health-related objectives will inform future research that will be carried out to help identify any opportunities for social enterprises in relation to health.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to produce figures which cover the last 30 years as this information is not held centrally. The statistical database of the General Register Office for Scotland holds details of the place of death only in respect of those deaths which were registered with effect from 1 January 1996. Prior to the recent incident which resulted in four deaths, there were eight recorded deaths by drowning since January 1996 for which &quot;Loch Awe&quot; was mentioned in the &quot;place of death&quot; part of the death certificate.</p>
