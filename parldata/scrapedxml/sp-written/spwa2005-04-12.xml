  <p>The Executive is aware of the concerns expressed by Alzheimer Scotland about the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) preliminary recommendations on the use of donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine and memantine in the treatment of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</p>

  <p>NICE provides technology appraisal guidance for the NHS in England and Wales. In Scotland, NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (QIS) is a consultee in the NICE consultation process. This allows NHS QIS to consider any specific implications arising from draft NICE guidance which will affect its use in Scotland. Because NHS QIS is involved in the NICE appraisal process, it allows them to issue advice to healthcare professionals in Scotland at the same time as the NICE guidance issues to healthcare professionals in England and Wales.</p>

  <p>NHS QIS is currently considering the draft NICE appraisal on donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine and memantine and have sought the views of a number of consultees in Scotland, including Alzheimer Scotland. These views will be reported to NICE.</p>

  <p>The NICE appraisal process involves a further consultation on their Final Appraisal Determination. At that stage, NHS QIS will seek further comments from their consultees about any important differences that may have an impact on the suitability of the final guidance for Scotland. NHS QIS will take these comments into account in assessing whether the final NICE guidance is valid for Scotland.</p>

  <p>Information about the NHS QIS process for commenting on NICE guidance can be accessed at: <a href="http://www.nhshealthquality.org/nhsqis/files/NICE%20Guidance%20process%20.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.nhshealthquality.org/nhsqis/files/NICE%20Guidance%20process%20.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p>Donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine are licensed for the treatment of mild to moderately severe dementia in Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</p>

  <p>In 2001, the then Health Technology Board for Scotland (HTBS) (now part of NHS Quality Improvement Scotland), commented on an appraisal by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence on the use of these drugs. The HTBS estimated that, in Scotland, there were approximately 23,000 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. Of those patients, 11,500 may be eligible for treatment and approximately 40% (4,600 patients) were expected to respond to treatment and to remain on treatment in the longer term. The comment can be accessed at <a href="http://www.nhshealthquality.org" target="_blank">www.nhshealthquality.org</a>.</p>

  <p>Memantine is licensed for the treatment of moderately severe to severe dementia in Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</p>

  <p>In August 2003, the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) undertook an assessment of memantine and advised that it was not recommended for use in NHSScotland. Following a resubmission by the manufacturer, the SMC assessed memantine again in December 2003 and on review of the evidence submitted by the manufacturer did not recommend it for use in NHSScotland. The SMC view is that the clinical trials for memantine have involved an extremely low number of patients and its effect on people with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease appeared to be marginal. The manufacturer failed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product or identify a subgroup that might benefit from it. In addition, the economic case submitted by the manufacturer did not support a recommendation that use of this drug would be cost effective relative to standard practice in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) is currently reviewing the clinical and economic evidence on the use of four drugs used in the treatment of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease &ndash; donepezil (Aricept), galantamine (Reminyl), rivastigmine (Exelon) and memantine (Ebixa).</p>

  <p>In Scotland, NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS) will consider any specific implications arising from the NICE guidance which will affect its use in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Until new guidance is issued to the NHS, not expected until October 2005, the existing guidance dating from 2001 on donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine continues to apply. That guidance can be accessed at <a href="http://www.nhshealthquality.org" target="_blank">www.nhshealthquality.org</a>.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) has assessed memantine in August and again in December 2003. The SMC advice can be accessed at <a href="http://www.scottishmedicines.org" target="_blank">www.scottishmedicines.org</a>.</p>

  <p>I have been assured by the Scottish Ambulance Service that any proposals which would result in fundamental changes being made to the way in which it delivers its services would be discussed with the local health board, GPs and other stakeholders before any final decisions were made.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service constantly monitors its performance to ensure that resources meet demand effectively and efficiently. I understand that for one week in March the accident and emergency (A&amp;E) ambulance from the Douglas station which was rostered on the night shift was strategically deployed so that it could respond to areas of high accident and emergency demand throughout South Lanarkshire, particularly in Lanark, Carluke and Larkhall. Additional night shift resources in the form of rapid response units were also deployed in Lanarkshire to support the response to Category A (life-threatening) calls. The A&amp;E unit is now based back at the Douglas station.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many (a) adults and (b) children have been registered with a dentist in each year since 1985.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-04-12.8.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80011" speakername="Rhona Brankin" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa0412.htm#5">

  <p>Prior to 1 October 1990 patients did not register with a dentist under NHS arrangements. Registration data is therefore not available from 1985 to 1991. The first year for which complete registration data exist is the year ending March 1992.</p>

  <p>Prior to September 1996, adult registrations lapsed after 24 months and child registrations lapsed at the end of the following calendar year, unless the patient returned to the practice. All registrations now lapse after 15 months, unless the patient returns to the practice. This change in registration regulations must be taken into account when interpreting the data, as it impacts on the number of registrations from January 1998 onwards.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive consider the outcomes of research when formulating early years policy. Current Scottish Executive research includes the Early Years Longitudinal Study <em>Growing Up in Scotland</em> which is still in its early stages but will develop an evidence base for early years including providing information on the benefits or effects of pre-school education. The Executive has also funded other relevant research such as <em>Review of Childcare and the Development of Children 0-3: Research Evidence and Implications for Out-of-Home Provision</em> by Colwyn Trevarthan of the University of Edinburgh and <em>A Baseline Study of Outcome Indicators for Early Years Policies in Scotland</em> by Fran Wasoff and colleagues at the Centre for Research on Families and Relationships, University of Edinburgh.</p>

  <p>In addition the Executive also takes account of relevant research published by other bodies such as the EPPE study (<em>Effective Provision of Pre-School Education</em>) undertaken by the Institute of Education at the University of London for the Department for Education and Skills in England.</p>

  <p>Assumptions Underlying Figures:</p>

  <p>The above figures assume delivery over 33 weeks per year (current provision is for 412.5 hours per year of free pre-school education, i.e. 2.5 hours per weekday over 33 weeks per year).</p>

  <p>The figures given are for the additional cost of increasing provision, i.e. they do not include current expenditure on pre-school education.</p>

  <p>The figures assume that additional provision could be delivered between the local authority, voluntary and private sectors and would not require additional capital costs.</p>

  <p>Engine power is checked as part of an agreement between MCA and the UK Fisheries Departments and requires checks to be made against the details that have been registered for all vessels. All fishing vessels must be registered with the correct mcep. If there is any disparity, MCA are responsible for checking and ensuring the power is correctly registered.</p>

  <p>Vessels which fall into the survey regime have their engine plate details checked on initial build and thereafter every four or five years depending on the survey regime. In November 2002, vessels between 12 metres and 15 metres length overall (LOA) were no longer required to be surveyed, a consequence of the introduction by MCA of the 15 to 24 metres code.</p>

  <p>However, vessels between 12 metres and 15 metres are now included in the Small Code. The code does not require a survey but all vessels under 15 metres are inspected to ensure that they comply with the code and therefore any engine discrepancy found as a result of an inspection is resolved and the correct power registered.</p>

  <p>No vessel owners have been prosecuted for infringements in relation to registered engine power in any of these years.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to eliminating mixed sex wards in all NHS hospitals, and very good progress has been made. All NHS hospital wards in Scotland comply with current guidelines, with the exception of certain areas within the Royal Edinburgh Hospital.</p>

  <p>The Executive is working closely with NHS Lothian to ensure that the Royal Edinburgh Hospital complies fully with the guidelines as soon as possible. We understand from the board that work on three formerly non-compliant wards is now complete, and remedial work on the remaining wards is scheduled for completion next month.</p>

  <p>There are no plans to offer fiscal fines to persistent offenders who are on a course of criminal conduct. It is intended, however, to extend the use of fiscal fines and to introduce other alternatives to prosecution that will be appropriately used on the basis of clear guidelines prepared by the Lord Advocate. This will allow our courts to operate more speedily and effectively. <em>Smarter Justice, Safer Communities</em> &ndash; <em>Summary Justice Reform Next Steps</em> , published on 22 March 2005, outlines how these penalties will be used. It can be accessed from the Summary Justice Reform website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/about/JD/CP/00019008/Homepage.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/about/JD/CP/00019008/Homepage.aspx</a> .</p>

  <p>We consider that fixed penalty notices, correctly and appropriately used, are an important part of a modern criminal justice system. They offer a quick, proportionate and effective response to a number of instances of minor offending making clear to the offender, and the local community, that such behaviour will not be tolerated. As announced in <em>Smarter Justice, Safer Communities</em> on 22 March 2005, we remain committed in principle to a further extension of the use of fixed penalty notices, with appropriate guidelines and safeguards in place. We will monitor the operation of the antisocial behaviour fixed penalty pilot scheme before reaching any decision to extend their use further.</p>

  <p>At all times, all clinically urgent calls are dealt with immediately by NHS 24 nurse advisers. During peak times, less clinically urgent calls are prioritised and receive a call back by a nurse adviser within a specific timescale. All callers who are categorised in this way are advised that should their condition deteriorate or they become concerned they should immediately contact the service again.

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>*NHS 24 was launched on 8 May 2002.</p>

  <p>**Call back standard for Priority 1 calls changed from 30 minutes to 60 minutes from November 2004. Call back standard for Priority 2 calls changed from 60 minutes to 120 minutes from December 2004.</p>

  <p>***Figures available for January and February 2005.</p>

  <p>It should also be borne in mind that NHS 24 did not roll out to the whole of Scotland until November 2004, so these figures over each year are not yet comparable.</p>

  <p>The rationale for changes in call back targets for Priority 1 and Priority 2 calls, which were agreed by NHS 24&rsquo;s Executive Team in December 2004, related to risk management balancing clinical appropriateness, managing demand and available resources. NHS 24&rsquo;s Executive Team agreed that, subject to appropriate clinical prioritisation and on-going monitoring and review of the call back queue, the clinical cases in Priority 2 could safely be clinically assessed within two hours. All calls awaiting call back are regularly reviewed by experienced nursing staff and can be re-prioritised based on clinical need.</p>

  <p>The review of NHS 24 which was announced in February will identify performance improvements to ensure that it realises its full potential in delivering high quality services for patient. The use of call back and how it can be reduced is part of the NHS 24 review team&rsquo;s remit.</p>

  <p>The cost of school meals in the future is a matter for individual local authorities. Authorities are provided with funding to administer their school meals service, but the Scottish Executive does not specify how much of this resource should be targeted on the cost or subsidy of individual meals. It is up to authorities to decide what they charge, and costs can vary greatly between authorities, depending on individual purchasing requirements and economies of scale.</p>

  <p>Free school meals are provided by local authorities. The estimated total cost to local authorities of free school meals for the last five years was as follows: &pound;33.4 million in 1999-2000; &pound;29.3 million in 2000-01; &pound;28.7 million in 2001-02; &pound;27.5 million in 2002-03, and &pound;29 million in 2003-04. The Scottish Executive does not make projections regarding the cost of free school meals for future years. Cost per meal figures are based on the total gross expenditure by authorities on school meals divided by the total number of school meals provided, and are irrespective of whether a meal is paid for or free. Costs would not therefore change if free school meal uptake was 100%.</p>

  <p>Statutory provision exists to ensure children from lowest income families receive free school meals. The Scottish Executive continues to invest in the Hungry for Success programme in order to revitalise the school meals system for all pupils, whether or not they receive free school meals, and to provide a high quality and attractive service which eliminates stigma and which children and young people will actively choose in preference to less healthy alternatives. As a result of Hungry for Success, school meals are more nutritious, dining surroundings more inviting and food culture better connected to the curriculum to enable children to learn about healthy eating for life.</p>

  <p>We are not aware of evidence suggesting sectarianism damages Scotland&rsquo;s image abroad. However, any issue which could portray Scotland negatively is of concern and we are committed to tackling sectarian bigotry however it manifests itself.</p>

  <p>We have had a number of discussions with the Northern Ireland Office, the office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister for Northern Ireland and other organisations in Northern Ireland involved in tackling sectarianism. While we recognise that there are significant differences between the Scottish and Northern Irish experiences of sectarianism, we also recognise that good ideas can be adapted and, for example, this has contributed to the development of Executive initiatives such as the recently launched anti-sectarian education resource.</p>
