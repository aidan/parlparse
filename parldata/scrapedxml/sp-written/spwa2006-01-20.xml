  <p>The new EU budget 2007-13 was agreed in December 2005. The total budget for EU expenditure 2007-13 has been set at &euro;862.3 billion.</p>

  <p>Within this, provision for Pillar II of the CAP which funds agri-environment schemes and other rural development measures, was reduced during the budget negotiations and now stands at &euro;69.75 billion for the seven year period. The UK share of Pillar II funds for 2007-13 is not yet known.</p>

  <p>When developing drug treatment and rehabilitation services, drug action teams and their local partners assess the level of need in their areas and have to ensure that the treatment needs of their local drug using population are met.</p>

  <p>An additional &pound;4 million was allocated for drug treatment and rehabilitation in 2005-06. Performance contracts have been agreed between the Scottish Executive and 22 local drug action teams. These include specific targets for widening the range of treatments available locally, increasing capacity, and reducing waiting times. This would result in an estimated 2,600 additional treatment places. The performance contracts run from 2005-06 until 2006-07, when it is envisaged the targets will be achieved.</p>

  <p>The investment we have made in drug treatment and rehabilitation since 2000 is reflected in new figures released in the publication <i>Drug Misuse Statistics Scotland 2005</i>. These show a 35% increase in the number of new individuals able to access drug treatment and rehabilitation services between 2000-01 and 2004-05.</p>

  <p>The Management Statement between the Scottish Executive and the Scottish Enterprise Network states that projects with economic objectives should generally be undertaken only where there is the prospect of a net benefit at the level of the Scottish economy. However, where a project is aimed at one or more narrower geographical areas which are considered to merit priority treatment, it may be legitimate to support the project although it brings only a local benefit to the area or areas in question. The networks are required to comply with state aid rules and H.M. Treasury guidance on appraisal when considering if assistance can be given to businesses.</p>

  <p>On 15 November 2005, the Scottish Executive issued a consultation paper on a proposal to require the catering sector to inform consumers about the origin of the beef they serve. Views on the proposal are sought by 28 February 2006, at which point all views will be considered.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it had to meet the costs of police officers from outwith Scotland being deployed in Scotland in relation to policing the G8 summit and related events, such as the Make Poverty History march, and, if so, what the accumulated cost was of doing so.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-01-20.14.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80053" speakername="Cathy Jamieson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0120.htm#9">

  <p>The Scottish Executive was responsible for the bulk of the cost of policing last year&rsquo;s G8 summit, and associated events. The total policing cost was <strong>&pound;71.976 million</strong> . The UK Government agreed to provide <strong>&pound;20 million</strong> towards meeting that cost.</p>

  <p>A breakdown of the cost of policing the event has been provided to the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 38309) and is available on the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s website at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/International-Relations/G8/costofpolicing" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/International-Relations/G8/costofpolicing</a></p>

  <p>Mutual aid was provided by police forces across the UK as a result of an agreement between the Chief Constable of Tayside Police and Chief Constables/Chief Officers of other forces for those forces to provide assistance during the G8 summit. This was in recognition of the fact that policing an event of this magnitude was beyond the resources of Tayside Police alone.</p>

  <p>This mutual aid comprised the additional staffing costs incurred by police forces - north and south of the border - who contributed to the operation. &pound;21.495 million of the total spending on mutual aid went to English and Welsh forces (including the British Transport Police) with Scottish forces (including the SDEA) receiving &pound;23.165 million.</p>

  <p>We expect each primary medical services practice to establish appropriate access arrangements in accordance with local circumstances and to meet the requirement of the guarantee. Funding is provided to this end through the Scottish General Medical Services Contract arrangements.</p>

  <p>The 48 hour access target is currently included in the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) under the new GP contract arrangements. This means that practices participating in the QOF are rewarded for the achievement of the 48 hour access target. In 2004-05, some 97% of participating Scottish practices qualified for and received the &quot;access bonus&quot; through the QOF. Similarly high levels of compliance were reported by NHS boards through the 2004-05 Performance Assessment Framework.</p>

  <p>The 48 hour access target should not preclude the ability of patients and practitioners to pre-book routine appointments.</p>

  <p>Information on the guarantee and the guidance issued to NHS boards is available publicly from the 48 hour access website <a href="http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/sehd/48houraccess" target="_blank">http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/sehd/48houraccess</a>.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has not carried out any research into the reasons that 144.8 per million males under one year old are the victims of murder. I believe this figure reflects the fact that four such babies were counted in 2004-05, when three of these were alleged victims of the same mother over the previous 30 years. Technically this gives a rate of 144.8 per million males under one, care should be taken in drawing conclusions from this figure.</p>

  <p>Almost 54% of patients treated in NHSScotland hospitals are admitted immediately and never join a waiting list. Of those who do wait, over 40% are admitted within one month and almost 70% within three months.</p>

  <p>For those who have to wait longer, the maximum waiting time guarantee was reduced from 12 months to nine months at the end of 2003 with a further reduction to six months from 31 December 2005. On 30 September 2005, 1,249 patients with a guarantee had waited more than six months for in-patient and day case treatment - a reduction of 6,263 since 30 September 2004. This guaranteed waiting time will be further reduced to 18 weeks by the end of 2007.</p>

  <p>With regard to first out-patient waiting times, over 54% of patients are seen within nine weeks of referral and 66% within 13 weeks. For those who have to wait longer, we have set a national maximum waiting time target of 26 weeks from referral to consultation, from 31 December 2005. On 30 September 2005, 11,854 patients to whom the target applied had waited more than 26 weeks for a first out-patient appointment &ndash; a reduction of 41,725 since 30 September 2004. The target will be reduced to 18 weeks from the end of 2007</p>

  <p>The NHS in Scotland has delivered a high standard of performance against the maximum waiting times commitments so far and is on track to meet the challenging waiting times we have set for the future.</p>

  <p>Information on waiting times for a first out-patient consultation and for in-patient and day case treatment for each quarter since 31 December 1997 is set out in the table. I have arranged for the information requested for NHS boards to be placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 38641) as it runs to 30 pages. Waiting times information for 31 December 2005 will be published by NHS National Services Scotland on their website on 23 February 2006.</p>

  <p>No such figures are available. SPS calculate annually an average cost per prisoner place which is reported in our Annual Reports and Accounts. It would not be cost effective to attempt to disaggregate all cost elements to attempt to arrive at a total average cost for each prison.</p>

  <p>There is no central record held of complaints of a racial nature made against the Scottish Executive. In the period 1999-2004 there has been only one such recorded complaint made by a Scottish Executive member of staff, in 2002. Figures for 2005 are not available yet.</p>

  <p>Of the 8,009 people registered as social workers with the Scottish Social Services Council (SSSC) at 11 January 2006 (this includes people who have a social work qualification but are not practising as social workers), 6,237 had completed the equal opportunities form which is a voluntary part of the registration process. Of the 6,237, 123 declared themselves as being from black and minority ethnic backgrounds, representing 1.97% of the total who completed the form. Registration of social workers commenced in 2003 and this is the first year in which comprehensive data has been available. A report on registered social workers will be published by the SSSC in April 2006.</p>

  <p>In 2005, information on staff ethnicity was collected for the first time as part of the Annual Census of Staff of Scottish Local Authority Social Work Services. The results of this census will be published in April 2006.</p>

  <p>Under the terms of an agreement with the Home Office, the Scottish Executive pays a percentage of the total UK cost of both compensation payments made under the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme, and the administration costs of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority and Appeals Panel. That percentage is based on a rolling average of Scottish claims on the scheme over the previous three years. Over the past few years this has fluctuated between 11-13%. In 2004-05 the Executive&rsquo;s contribution was &pound;20.6 million (11%).</p>

  <p>On 18 September 2002 ministers announced specific plans to reconfigure the secure estate with the creation of an additional 29 extra secure places.</p>

  <p>Distribution of the additional 29 places announced on 24 March 2003. These will be able to offer much needed facilities for girls only and, as far as possible, avoid under 16s being remanded to young offenders&rsquo; institutions.</p>

  <p>When complete by 2007 the secure estate will therefore consist of:</p>

  <p>18 boys only at Kibble</p>

  <p>24 mixed at St Philip&rsquo;s</p>

  <p>18 girls only at Good Shepherd</p>

  <p>18 mixed at Rossie</p>

  <p>31 mixed at St Mary&rsquo;s</p>

  <p>12 mixed in Edinburgh</p>

  <p>four mixed in The Elms.</p>

  <p>By 2007, Scotland will have an increase of 40 places since 2000.</p>
