  <p>No. The operation of concessionary travel schemes (including schemes for taxis) is a matter for individual local authorities, based on local needs and circumstances. As part of their concessionary travel schemes, a number of local authorities provide taxicard initiatives which offer reduced taxi fares to provide mobility for those unable to use conventional public transport.</p>

  <p>There are many different approaches to treating drug misusers, and a wide range of statutory, non-statutory and voluntary organisations are involved in the provision of services. Thus, there are several routes through which drug misusers can receive treatment. For example, GPs will refer patients to specialist drug treatment services, as will other agencies such as Social Work Departments who encounter clients with drug misuse problems. Some specialist drugs services will also accept self-referrals from patients.</p>

  <p>A range of services support families of drug misusers, including GPs and other health workers, drug agencies, Social Work Departments, carer and family support organisations, and community-based projects.</p>

  <p>It is certainly important that drug misusers and their families are aware of where help, advice and treatment are available. Drug Action Teams already provide such information, but the point is re-inforced (including practical advice) in the Effective Interventions Unit&#146;s (EIU) report on the provision of integrated care for drug misusers, which has been given wide distribution. Another EIU report on Families and Carers of Drug Users lists a broad range of agencies which provide support and advice, either in relation to the needs of the family, or in assisting families to support drug misusers.</p>

  <p>In addition, there is a free Know the Score Directory which includes national organisations, Drug Action Teams, and local/community services. The directory can be obtained via the free Know the Score Informationline and it is also available on the Know the Score website.</p>

  <p>We have allocated &#163;180,000, from recovered criminal assets, to family support groups which deal with the problems which drug misuse can bring. We are working with these groups to determine the optimum way to distribute these resources.</p>

  <p>There are no plans to introduce routine drug testing in accident and emergency departments. Accident and emergency staff are trained in the recognition of substance abuse. They are aware that it may be a causal factor in a patient&#146;s attendance at the department and that it may affect the clinical management of the patient.</p>

  <p>Similarly, there are no plans for routine drugs testing in police stations. Police officers can request the attendance of forensic medical examiners, who could take biological samples from the person for testing. This could include, for example, drug testing where drug misuse is suspected.</p>

  <p>The planned reduction in the grant-in-aid for education provision at the Scottish Agricultural College reflects a continuing reduction in student numbers at the college. Numbers have now fallen by around 40% over the last six years.

  <p>As specified in guidance made available on 9 January 2003 to accompany the reports of the <i>Review of Scotland&#146;s Cities</i> , release of cities&#146; allocations from the City Growth Fund will be dependent on satisfactory outputs from the proposed City Vision exercises and a brief but clear submission to the Scottish Executive outlining how the money will be spent and what outcomes will be delivered.</p>

  <p>Authorities' submissions to the Scottish Executive concerning the use of the City Growth Fund will be expected to include:</p>

  <p>a list of projects or service outcomes the funds are intended to buy;</p>

  <p>notional expenditure on each of these, with appropriate value-for-money considerations;</p>

  <p>target dates for delivery;</p>

  <p>identification of other sources of funds levered in to the projects;</p>

  <p>consideration of any potential State Aids or other issues impacting on the use of the funds;</p>

  <p>consultation with community planning partners and the business community in the city, and</p>

  <p>output of consultation with authorities and business interests in the city region.</p>

  <p>It is anticipated that local stakeholders will work to ensure that activities supported by the City Growth Fund and other funds administered by the Scottish Executive, for example the Quality of Life funds, should be mutually reinforcing where possible. The Scottish Executive recognises that many of the projects involved are likely to have long lead-in times and potentially to face other administrative requirements. Therefore, it is accepted that initial submissions will in some respects be provisional.</p>

  <p>Authorities will also be expected to provide a brief annual report on those activities supported by the fund, and a final report after three years, detailing the outcomes achieved as a result of support by the fund. The Scottish Executive will write to the local authorities concerned in the next few weeks, to confirm these requirements.</p>

  <p>2. The SVDLS includes only that vacant land which is either located within an urban settlement (with a population of 2,000 or more) or which is located within 1km of such settlements, and which would commonly be considered as having the characteristics of urban vacant land.</p>

  <p>3. For those councils that did not provide data for a particular year, data from the previous SVDLS has been used. Previously published figures for 1999-2001 have been revised on the basis of recent council returns.</p>

  <p>4. Figures are not available for East Dunbartonshire and East Renfrewshire in 1993 and 1994 as these councils did not exist before the reorganisation of local government in 1996. As part of the 1995 survey (which was published in 1996), councils were asked to provide figures for 1995 for the new council areas. The present East Dunbartonshire Council area comprises the former Bearsden and Milngavie District and part of the former Strathkelvin District. East Renfrewshire Council area comprises the former Eastwood District and part of the former Renfrew District. The table shows the area, in hectares, of vacant and derelict land in these districts in 1993 and 1994.</p>

  <p>Copies of the 1993, 1994, 1995 and the 2001 (which contains figures for 1996 to 2001 inclusive) Surveys are available in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. numbers 25952, 25953, 25954, and 20466 respectively).</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>On 2 January at HM Prison Shotts, a large number of prisoners in A Hall and some in B Hall were involved in concerted indiscipline. The SPS resolved the incident at 15:00 the following day. One member of staff suffered a broken leg. There was damage to the prison accommodation.</p>

  <p>On 7 January, in a separate incident also at HM Prison Shotts, an episode of concerted indiscipline resulted in three members of staff receiving stab wounds which resulted in them being detained in hospital. The SPS brought the incident to a conclusion at 05:30 the following day.</p>

  <p>The SPS has well established procedures for reviewing such incidents which are now in progress involving the staff who handled the incident on the ground, the Incident Control Teams at SPS Headquarters and senior Governors of other establishments. Ministers were briefed at the outset, during and after each incident.</p>

  <p>Both incidents are the subject of police investigations and criminal charges have been brought in relation to the second. This, and SPS&#146;s role as a law enforcement agency, properly restrict what I can say about the action we will take following the incidents. We are in touch with other law enforcement agencies, the emergency services and others to review learning points and actions we can take to reduce the risk of such incidents occurring and further improve our response to them. The same process is under way internally, and at a time of high prisoner numbers we are revising contingency plans following the loss of accommodation at Shotts as a result of these incidents.</p>

  <p>I would like to place on record SPS&#146;s concern for the well-being of the staff injured in these incidents and our appreciation of the professional and effective response of staff and managers at Shotts and other establishments to these difficult and dangerous incidents and in the major dispersal operation which followed the first.</p>

  <p>The Executive has already put in place a range of national initiatives to develop the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) and approaches to core skills training across Scotland. The Executive is committed to achieving universal access to the internet through its digital inclusion strategy and under the Public Internet Access Points Initiative we are creating over 1,000 new public internet access facilities. We have also committed substantial funding to Community Learning Partnerships across Scotland, which is enabling the delivery of a wide range of community-based programmes to develop individual ICT skills. In addition, Executive funding is also assisting such partnerships to develop and implement Literacies Action Plans. The activity in social inclusion partnership areas therefore complements these national initiatives.</p>

  <p>Local community sports trusts have the potential to make a valuable contribution to how sport is delivered at the local level. It is important that they have support from their local authority if that potential is to be realised.</p>

  <p>Sport 21 Time to Speak Up is currently out for consultation. <strong></strong>Sportscotland is also reviewing all its programmes following its organisational review.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive why there is no uniformity across police forces as to what constitutes an informal or a formal warning; whether these warnings are recorded at force level, as recommended by the ad hoc Ministerial Group on Youth Crime, and why only five out of the eight police forces could provide annual figures for warnings issued, as identified in the Audit Scotland report, <i>Dealing with offending by young people</i> .</p>

  <p>Action point 6 of <i>Scotland's Action Programme to Reduce Youth Crime 2002</i> , which we announced in summer 2002, was to develop a Scotland-wide system of cautions/warnings. At the time, we recognised that there were variations across Scotland in the approaches adopted by police forces in relation to warnings. In December 2002, following discussion with the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland, we made available &#163;250,000 to the Scottish Police Service, across all forces, to enable the police to put in place formal training and support for restorative justice methods linked to warnings. The next stage will be to commission researchers to gather information on existing activity and to produce national guidance (including guidance on standards and recording) under the auspices of a steering group involving representatives from the main public and voluntary organisations with an interest. Future funding would then be linked to the criteria set in that guidance.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what its response is to the statement in paragraph 44 of the Audit Scotland report, <i>Dealing with offending by young people</i> , that &quot;data on the number of young people committing offences, being warned, referred to the children&#146;s hearings system or the procurator fiscals are poor&quot; and what changes it has made to the collection and classification of such data since May 1999.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Children's Reporter Administration has successfully implemented major changes to the collection and classification of data since May 1999. The Referrals Administration Database is now fully operational across Scotland. It records all children referred to Children&#146;s Reporters and the process in the Children&#146;s Hearings system.</p>

  <p>The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) database is designed to be an operational case-tracking system rather than a purely statistical database. At the time data was requested from COPFS by Audit Scotland, there was a major roll-out of an upgraded case-tracking system. COPFS are now in a position to provide this type of data for current cases.</p>
