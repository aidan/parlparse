  <p>Scottish Government Officials met with the directors of The Gathering 2009 Ltd on 12 May 2009 and discussed the potential provision of a loan from the Scottish Government. Following the event and the financial difficulties faced by The Gathering 2009 Ltd, the First Minister and the Minister for Culture, External Affairs and the Constitution met with the company&rsquo;s directors on 16 September 2009 and discussed potential courses of action.</p>

  <p>The ministers had available an independent economic assessment, which showed that the Gathering had generated over &pound;10 million of income for Scotland - a return on investment of 21-1 against a target of 8-1.</p>

  <p>Officials were asked to examine the Gathering&rsquo;s financial position and as a result of that analysis it was considered that repayment of the loan was not possible.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government are supportive of plans to hold a further Gathering given the positive economic impact of the 2009 event.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government wrote to the director of The Gathering 2009 Ltd on 1 June 2009 with the offer of a loan for &pound;180,000. That letter set out that The Gathering 2009 Ltd would repay the loan in full with 14 days of the company receiving payment from World Pay (the payment processing business of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group) and no later than 31 August 2009. On 5 June 2009, the director of The Gathering 2009 Ltd accepted the loan on the basis of the terms and conditions set out.</p>

  <p>Information relating to the private sector creditors of The Gathering 2009 Ltd is commercially sensitive and, as such, it would be inappropriate to list these creditors.</p>

  <p>Given the circumstances of the company, the judgement was taken that the debts were irrecoverable. As a result, the Scottish Government, Historic Scotland and the Scottish Ambulance Service took the decision to write off the amounts owed to them by The Gathering 2009 Ltd. Debt written off by the public sector totals &pound;316,000.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of the Forth Valley healthcare associated infection (HAI) report and reports indicating the continued procurement and use of swan neck taps, whether it will instruct all NHS boards (a) not to procure swan neck taps and (b) to replace all taps not approved with appropriate sensor-controlled or lever taps.</p>

  <p>Current guidance available to NHS boards from Health Facilities Scotland on the provision of sanitary assemblies and infection control advises against the procurement of swan-neck taps.</p>

  <p>This guidance further advises that in existing facilities, when such fittings become damaged or in need of repair, they should be replaced by an appropriate alternative component as specified in the guidance.</p>

  <p>Scottish Health Technical Memorandum 2040: <em>The control of legionellae in healthcare systems</em> provides further guidance to NHS boards on risk management procedures for those fittings which remain in use.</p>

  <p>NHS pay is considered on a UK-wide basis through the Pay Review Body process which makes recommendations for the individual consideration of UK ministers and ministers in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>

  <p>The lowest paid staff in the NHS are covered by the Agenda for Change system and there is currently a three year pay deal in place covering the period 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2011. Under this deal, the lowest hourly rate currently available in NHSScotland is &pound;6.76, which is significantly above the present minimum wage of &pound;5.80 per hour. On 1 April 2010, this lowest hourly rate will rise to &pound;6.98. It should also be noted that all Agenda for Change staff receive incremental progression as well as cost of living increases. These are, therefore, the bottom points on scales which staff move up on a yearly basis as their experience increases.</p>
