  <p>Margaret Beckett and Ben Bradshaw represented the UK at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Luxembourg on 21 and 22 April 2004.</p>

  <p>The Council concluded its consideration of proposals to reform four Common Agricultural Policy regimes: those for cotton, olive oil, tobacco and hops. Agreement on all four was eventually reached by qualified majority. This was a difficult negotiation but the outcome was highly satisfactory from a UK perspective. Overall, the agreement followed the main principles of the June 2003 reforms with partial decoupling in all four sectors from 2006. The rates vary but that for cotton is 65%, a small increase over the 60% originally proposed, and in the case of tobacco, the rate will be 100% from 2010. Although the UK would have supported higher rates of decoupling in all sectors and an earlier move to full decoupling, this agreement sends positive signals to our trading partners by marking a further step towards a more liberalised and market focussed agriculture in the EU.</p>

  <p>No fisheries items were discussed.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what guidance is given to public sector bodies, including local authorities, with regard to investment appraisal where the use of public funds is being considered or undertaken.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2004-05-10.9.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80057" speakername="Mr Andy Kerr" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-04/wa0510.htm#4">

  <p>The Scottish Public Finance Manual (SPFM) requires public sector bodies such as the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body, the Scottish Executive and relevant bodies sponsored by the Scottish Executive to secure and maintain best value. The characteristics of an organisation which secures best value include systematic approaches to risk management, asset management, strategic procurement, and the integration of review and options appraisal into management arrangements. Public bodies are also reminded that recommendations should be based on financial analysis and whole life costs.</p>

  <p>Best value is a statutory duty for local authorities by virtue of the Local Government in Scotland Act 2003 (the act) and guidance on best value characteristics has statutory status by virtue of the section 2 of the act.</p>

  <p>The SPFM is consistent with and recognises the latest edition of the HM Treasury Green Book. It also includes specific guidance on appraisal and evaluation and major investment. While the guidance is aimed primarily at constituent parts of the Scottish Administration it is equally applicable, so far as appropriate, to all other bodies subject to the requirements of the SPFM. In addition, Scottish health boards are required to have regard to the Scottish Capital Investment Manual, which is relevant to the development of capital projects.</p>

  <p>The SPFM does not apply formally to Scottish local authorities, although it is available to them for reference. Like other public bodies they are also encouraged to have regard to any guidance deemed relevant and appropriate to their circumstances whether or not it is published by the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>The act also requires local authorities to have regard to generally recognised<strong>,</strong> published Codes of Practice in the arrangements they make to secure best value; and, more specifically, to have regard to codes which are given statutory designation by Scottish ministers. Most of these codes are relevant to investment appraisal and include:</p>

  <p>The <em>Prudential Code for Capital Finance in Local Authorities</em> published by Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA)</p>

  <p>The <em>Code of Practice for Treasury Management</em>, also published by CIPFA</p>

  <p><em>Following the Public Pound</em>, published jointly by the Accounts Commission for Scotland and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for ensuring that the public purse receives value for money from property transactions rests with NHSScotland bodies</p>

  <p>For every property transaction an NHSScotland Body must have a property adviser and in major or potentially complex disposal cases must have in addition an independent valuer. It is the responsibility of these professional advisers to confirm that the price at which the property is being sold represents the market value of the property having regard to its full potential. This is especially important when property is being sold without exposure on the open market as it ensures that in respect of these transactions value for money is being achieved.</p>

  <p>The role of the Scottish Executive is to monitor that transactions have been completed in accordance with procedures detailed in the <em>NHS Scotland Property Transactions Handbook</em>. This has been done and no issues were raised by the trust&#8217;s auditors.</p>

  <p>Non-completion rates are not currently published for higher education institutions (HEIs) in Scotland. The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) produces and publishes annual performance indicators for all UK HEIs on behalf of the four UK funding bodies. The performance indicators include a projected outcome for new entrants to full-time first degree courses at the end of their first year of study. These give some indication of expected completion and non-completion rates. The latest figures available cover students who entered courses in 2000-01.</p>

  <p>The following table shows the percentage of new entrants in 2000-01 whose projected outcome at the end of their first year was neither an award or a transfer to another HEI.</p>

  <p>The first phase of this campaign took place over Christmas and New Year, and involved posters in licensed premises in Scotland, and leafleting of town and city centre clubs and pubs. Additional information materials, including a DVD, video and a drink cover, will be available shortly. Drug-assisted sexual assault is also covered in new advice for parents about drugs.</p>

  <p>ACPOS has already issued guidance to investigators on drug assisted sexual assault, and preparatory work is under way to develop new guidance for police forces on handling sexual assault cases, including drug assisted sexual assault.</p>

  <p>Exact information is not available centrally. Information from samples of GP records in practices across Scotland, whose population is nationally representative, suggests that approximately 6,700 patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis were seen by GPs in the year ended December 2003. However, this complex condition may be recorded in different ways by GPs, which might lead to some significant undercounting. The Executive&#8217;s Short Life Working Group, on the basis of published prevalence rates and population figures, estimated that at least 10,000 people in Scotland were likely to be affected by ME.</p>

  <p>For the financial year to 31 March 2004, 56 orders were made under the 1995 act. Orders of &#163;1,356,347.45 were in respect of drug related crime and &#163;114,809.46 in respect of other offences, but none relating to alcohol or cigarettes. In the same financial year one order was made under the 2002 act for &#163;23,208.14, which was in respect of drug related crime.</p>

  <p>For the financial year 1 April 2004 to date, one order has been made under the 2002 Act for &#163;8,403.28. This was in respect of credit card fraud.</p>

  <p>The civil recovery powers under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (POCA) came into force on 24 February 2003. From then until 31 March 2003, no civil recovery orders were made. In the year from 1 April 2003 to 31 March 2004, one civil recovery order was made, in the sum of &#163;23,986.29. This sum was alleged to be the proceeds of drug dealing.</p>

  <p>The specific provisions of POCA in relation to cash seizure came into force on 30 December 2002. Between that date and 31 March 2003, there were no final orders for forfeitures.

  <p>The payback period in a public private partnership project will depend on the specific project, however PPP contracts for accommodation facilities typically last 25 to 30 years.

  <p>The Executive/STUC staffing protocol covers several areas relating to staffing issues in PPP projects. In general, consultation and communication with trades unions is more prominent and is started earlier on in the PPP process than previously. There are more public bodies, particularly local authorities with their schools PPP projects, considering the different ways in which facilities management services can be delivered within a PPP project. It is too early in the protocol&#8217;s implementation to judge its effect on the two tier workforce issue.</p>

  <p>It is for the public sector procuring body to monitor compliance with the protocol. The Executive is in regular contact with public bodies undertaking PPP projects and is able to provide guidance and advice on various issues, including compliance with the protocol. Both the Executive and the STUC will keep the operation of the protocol under review.</p>

  <p>An estimate of the capital spending provided by the private sector in all public private partnership signed projects in Scotland in total to date is &#163;2.3 billion. The rate of interest paid to lenders by PPP consortia for the provision of this capital is not collated centrally. This is a matter for individual public sector procuring bodies.</p>

  <p>The public private partnership procurement route must show value for money against a conventional procurement route before being selected. This involves consideration of whole life costs and benefits, for example risk transfer, for the length of the contract. So, whilst costs may initially seem higher, approved PPP projects present better value for money than a conventional procurement route over the lifetime of the project.</p>

  <p>Since May 1998 the NHS in Scotland has had a policy of publishing full business cases for signed projects. The Scottish Executive introduced a similar policy for all its PPP projects in June 1999, and all public sector bodies are expected to follow suit. One of the conditions of funding for the schools PPP projects is that the full business case be made public.</p>
