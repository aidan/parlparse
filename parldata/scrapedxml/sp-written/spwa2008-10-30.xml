  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>*The SAS IT systems record data under the previous structure of 15 geographic health boards.</p>

  <p>**Any journey which is cancelled on the same day as it was due to take place is counted as an aborted journey. In addition, where the SAS has not been notified of a cancellation and proceeds to pick up the patient, that is counted as an abort and the return journey is also counted as an abort (rather than a cancellation).</p>

  <p>However, average costs of patient transport service journeys are published annually in the ISD Scotland Cost Book. This information can be found at:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) has been liaising closely with NHS boards and community health partnerships through a series of workshops, liaison groups and multi disciplinary patients transport project groups to find a way of reducing aborted journeys.</p>

  <p>The SAS Patient Transport Strategy will be fully revised during 2008-09 to ensure it addresses issues arising from Scottish Government policies and strategies, including national transport strategies and the Better Health, Better Care Action Plan which outlined the need for NHS Scotland to engage more effectively with the seven Regional Transport Partnerships (RTPs), given the statutory duty on RTPs to develop local transport strategies which support the provision of health care.</p>

  <p>In order to continuously develop patient transport services, further collaborations with NHS boards, local authorities and voluntary agencies continue to be explored to improve the cohesion and efficiency of collective health and social care transport resources.</p>

  <p>SAS will continue to work towards ensuring flexibility and efficiency in meeting the health transport needs of patients.</p>

  <p>Helping Scots cope with the impact of high fuel bills and tackling fuel poverty forms part of our six point programme aimed at reducing the impact of the global financial crisis. The Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing announced last week that we are investing a further &pound;10 million to provide more central heating systems this year.</p>

  <p>We have also announced our intention that from April 2009 our fuel poverty programmes will for the first time, help tackle fuel poverty amongst families on income support with children under five or with disabled children under 16 beyond basic insulation measures.</p>

  <p>We will set out the detail of the inclusion of families in future fuel poverty programmes in due course, along with the eligibility criteria and anticipated numbers who will benefit.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises the importance of school clothing grants in assisting families with the expenses involved in ensuring children have adequate and suitable clothing to take full advantage of local authority school education. We set up a working group in January 2008 to review the levels of support provided by school clothing grants, with a view to making recommendations to Scottish ministers on where improvements can be made to the system to best meet the needs of children and their families. The report from the working group is expected to be with ministers shortly and we will discuss the recommendations in the report with COSLA.</p>

  <p>The application for funding to the Equality Unit that was approved in principle by the First Minister, subject to agreement by officials of a detailed proposal, is detailed in the answer to question S3W-16025 on 2 October 2008. The First Minister has an interest in every portfolio across government, and has sight of many applications which have funding implications. It would be impractical to attempt to identify all the applications which fall into this category since May 2007.</p>

  <p>All the National Performing companies, as independent charitable companies, are responsible for monitoring and managing their income from a variety of sources. The risk of losing commercial income is regularly assessed by the companies&rsquo; boards. The Scottish Government routinely monitors and discusses with the companies all aspects of their operations including their risk registers. While at the moment there appears to be little immediate impact on artistic activity from the economic climate, we will monitor the situation closely with the companies with regard to longer term trends.</p>

  <p>As part of the concordat, we have significantly reduced the level of ring fencing around funding streams. This was delivered at the request of local government, and agreed with COSLA. Removing the ring fencing and regulation gives councils more freedom and flexibility to allocate their resources according to their local priorities and in line with their single outcome agreement. We have put a record level of investment in local government, &pound;34.9 billion. Education remains a priority for local government and their delivery partners.</p>

  <p>A variety of additional funding for educational purposes was provided to North Lanarkshire Council between 2001-02 and 2007-08. Some of these funds remain as specific national funds and others are now included in the general local government settlement. These are set out as follows.</p>

  <p>While we are aware of a number of expected closures of large plants in Scotland over the next few decades, we do not hold precise information on the level of current capacity expected still to be in place at these dates, given the variety of sources of generation and in some instances the flexibility regarding operating life.</p>

  <p>However, we are undertaking some research into future projections of electricity supply which we hope to publish shortly. These will make some assumptions about future levels of generating capacity.</p>

  <p>We are keen to keep up the pressure on energy companies and UK Ministers to take action to minimise the impact of high fuel prices, particularly on our most vulnerable people. The Minister for Communities and Sport attended the Ofgem summit on 23 April, and the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing participated in the UK Inter-Ministerial Group on Fuel Poverty on 15 July. Ministers are keen to continue this dialogue. In addition, officials will join the Home Energy Savings Programme Project Board and Steering Group and ensure that Scottish interests are represented in emerging policy leading from the Prime Minister&rsquo;s 11 September announcements.</p>

  <p>We are taking action to better align and promote a greater take up of our domestic energy saving programmes. We are also discussing with UK officials on a range of UK-wide energy saving initiatives to ensure that Scottish consumers receive at least a fair share of the benefits.</p>

  <p>More generally, we are continuing to press the UK government as well as energy companies to take action to minimise the impacts of price increases and to ensure vulnerable customers in Scotland are not charged unfair high prices. We are also applying pressure to see if retail prices can more closely reflect lower prices on the wholesale market. Finally, we have also said that greater powers over energy matters would allow the right decisions to be taken on energy policy for Scotland, as part of the National Conversation.</p>

  <p>We are fully committed to protecting all our World Heritage Sites. I know concerns have been raised about a retaining wall in New Lanark and Historic Scotland is involved in on-going discussions with New Lanark Trust about this. They have already provided grant aid of &pound;86,000 towards the repair of the retaining wall that collapsed earlier this year and are awaiting information from New Lanark on costs for the repair of further sections of the wall.</p>

  <p>All the World Heritage Sites in Scotland have an important role to play in education, cultural tourism and events such as Homecoming 2009. I know the New Lanark Trust is considering several options in relation to Homecoming 2009.</p>

  <p>As historic and natural sites of international significance World Heritage Sites are well placed to contribute to the Curriculum for Excellence. They inform not only our understanding of history but also have a role to play in the discussion of issues relating to global citizenship. The New Lanark Trust has a well established educational programme and I am pleased that they are already filtering the draft objectives into this.</p>

  <p>There have been no representations made to UK ministers for a specific scheme to allow financial services trainees to remain in Scotland beyond their time on the Fresh Talent: Working in Scotland Scheme (FT:WiSS).

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what action it is taking in response to the report of the Administrative Justice Steering Group, chaired by Lord Philip, Options for the Future Administration and Supervision of Tribunals in Scotland.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-10-30.S3W-16725.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80341" speakername="Kenny MacAskill" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa1030.htm#13">

  <p>The Scottish Government participated in Lord Philip&rsquo;s review, as part of the commitment given in the First Minister&rsquo;s 30 January 2008 statement to Parliament, to &quot;look at the case for an integrated Tribunal Service for Scotland&quot; in order to meet the public service reform objective of &quot;[bringing] together organisations with similar skills, expertise and processes&quot;.</p>

  <p>Tribunal reform has been prioritised by inclusion in the Programme for Government (3 September 2008), which said, &quot;we will identify ways to streamline and improve the operation of tribunals in Scotland, in light of the review being led by Lord Philip.&quot;</p>

  <p>Independent research has been commissioned into tribunal training provision and judicial training needs, as referred to in the report, and the results will be published before the end of January 2009.</p>

  <p>The immediate next steps are for three of the five options presented by Lord Philip, including the government&rsquo;s preferred option of an integrated Tribunal Service for Scotland, to be evaluated in further detail, within the context of recommendations from Lord Gill&rsquo;s forthcoming review of the civil courts, Lord Philip&rsquo;s own further report into administrative justice and changes arising in Scotland from UK Government&rsquo;s implementation of Tribunals Courts and Enforcement Act 2007.</p>

  <p>However, neither the status quo nor the option of UK-wide integrated service will be further considered. Lord Philip reports that the status quo does &quot;not provide good value to the taxpayer&quot; and is characterised by a &quot;duplication of effort&quot;. It is not fit for a modern purpose and is described correctly as an incoherent, inconsistent system arising from unplanned growth and comprising a confusing mix of devolved and reserved responsibilities.</p>

  <p>Lord Philip has also effectively dismissed the case for a UK-wide integrated service, when he argues that integration of devolved Scottish tribunals within the UK system &quot;does not make sense&quot;, requiring &quot;aspects of the legal system in Scotland to be administered in England&quot;, concluding that this option would be &quot;inconsistent with the principle of devolution&quot;.</p>

  <p>Policy responsibilities for Tribunals in Scotland are &quot;split between the UK and Scottish Governments&quot; but we agree with Lord Philip when he asserts that &quot;users are unlikely to be concerned with whether a tribunal is reserved or devolved, or by whom it is administered&quot; and concludes that there is &quot;a strong argument from the legal perspective&quot; for &quot;a new Scottish Tribunals Service to support both [reserved] GB tribunals within Scotland and [devolved] Scottish tribunals&quot;.</p>

  <p>Exploratory discussions have already been held with the UK Government on the proper and effective administration of tribunals in Scotland, and these discussions will continue against the background of the national conversation on choosing Scotland&rsquo;s future.</p>

  <p>As the previous answer stated, we receive a number of different representations on energy policy matters, including nuclear power. Some of these are in written form and others are oral, such as through ministerial meetings with companies and organisations.</p>

  <p>While some correspondents question the current policy on nuclear, others support our position. As this Parliament has agreed, we are focusing attention on development of our renewable potential, coupled with clean baseload and energy efficiency.</p>

  <p>With regard to publication, in the main the majority of such formal correspondence comes from individuals. It is not normal practice for such correspondence to be published unless part of a formal consultation process which is not the case in this instance. Publication of correspondence would raise issues relating to privacy especially in the case of responses from individual members of the public. We therefore do not intend to publish the details of any correspondence received on this issue.</p>

  <p>After the announcement by Electricit&eacute; De France (EDF) on 24 September 2008 regarding their offer for British Energy (BE), the First Minister spoke with Vincent de Rivaz, Chief Executive of EDF, by telephone to discuss the implications of the offer for Scotland. Following this conversation EDF have committed to keep an office presence in East Kilbride. As they are also increasing their investment in renewables, they anticipate increasing activity in Scotland. EDF have also expressed a clear intent to maintain and develop further their portfolio in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The First Minister is due to meet Bill Coley, Chief Executive of British Energy shortly to discuss the future of the company in Scotland, both in terms of keeping existing headquarter jobs in Scotland, but also the possibility of new investment in renewable opportunities in Scotland.</p>

  <p>In addition, I am due to meet with EDF soon to highlight the advantages of investing in Scotland, especially in terms of the existing skill and supplier base but also to highlight the fact that Scotland has considerable skills and capability in renewable energy.</p>

  <p>The Minister for Schools and Skills met with North Lanarkshire Council on 9 September 2008 where budgets and teacher employment were included in the general discussions. No individual discussions have been held with North Lanarkshire on education spending or teacher employment in particular since May 2007, although discussions during the signing of the single outcome agreement on 28 July 2008 with the Cabinet Secretary referred to the concordat with local government which states that specific funding was provided in the local government settlement to enable local government to maintain teacher numbers at August 2007 level.</p>

  <p>The current Third Sector funding package provides &pound;93.6m for the sector over three years. The package provides: investment funding for the sector through the Scottish Investment Fund (&pound;30 million) and the Enterprise Fund (&pound;12 million); activities to support enterprising behaviour and address barriers facing the sector as outlined in the Enterprising Third Sector Action plan (a number of these through competitive tendering and contracting), and direct support to third sector infrastructure bodies and specialist intermediaries providing services to third sector bodies.</p>

  <p>The following grant funding figures are for 2008-09 and do not include the Scottish Investment Fund, or Enterprise Fund, which will be reported on separately, or funding which has been contracted for through competitive tendering, rather than allocated through a grant. Grants or funding allocated below &pound;1,000 are also not included.</p>

  <p>Third sector infrastructure bodies currently allocated grant funding during 2008-09 are as follows:</p>
