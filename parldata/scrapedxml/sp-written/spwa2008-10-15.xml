  <p>Yes. We have now removed the main barrier to the continued charitable status of colleges. This was achieved through the Charity Test (Specified Bodies) (Scotland) Order 2008, approved by Parliament on 25 June 2008, which exempted colleges from the standard requirement that a charity must operate independently of ministers.</p>

  <p>We will shortly introduce a further draft order to make a technical change to the legislation which deals with the position of ministers in relation to property disposals by colleges. We hope to introduce a draft order before the end of the year.</p>
