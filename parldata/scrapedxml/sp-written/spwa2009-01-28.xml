  <p>We must recognise that invertebrates make up around 98 per cent of Scotland&rsquo;s animal species, and within that broad category are many species which can either be beneficial or harmful to farming. However, all pesticides used in the UK are strictly regulated and, before being approved for use, are scientifically assessed for their potential risk to the environment. This includes a risk assessment to invertebrates. The independent Advisory Committee on Pesticides provides scientific advice to the Scottish Government on all aspects of pesticides, including their effects on invertebrates.</p>

  <p>I am not aware of any evidence which proves a causal link between the use of pesticides and the decline in bee populations. That decline has been fairly recent, whereas insecticides have been used for many years with a fairly static usage pattern.</p>

  <p>We receive scientific advice on topics relating to crop health from the Scottish Agricultural College (SAC) and from Science and Advice for Scottish Agriculture (SASA). Non-chemical control measures under investigation to reduce the impact of pests and diseases include rotations, time of sowing, use of genetic resistance including the use of variety mixtures, more durable host defence, and crop characteristics which enable plants to tolerate or escape the disease</p>

  <p>We have not met the Soil Association to discuss this matter. It is not yet known whether currently-available pesticides will become unavailable in future. Decisions will only be taken as individual products are assessed for re-authorisation when their current authorisations expire. That process will take some years.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) has advised that, due to short notice sickness absence, there were five occasions over the last six months when one air ambulance aircraft has been grounded. On these occasions, the remaining three aircraft were in operation. The SAS have advised that no requests for an air ambulance were declined due to the unavailability of the aircraft on the five occasions in question.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-01-28.S3W-19999.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80396" speakername="Nicola Sturgeon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa0128.htm#5">

  <p>The Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) is considering the implications for Scotland of the NICE methodology changes for appraising end of life drugs. However, the SMC already has the ability to exercise considerable flexibility.</p>

  <p>The SMC assesses the cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) of new drugs as part of its appraisal of health benefits. However, the SMC does not employ a rigid threshold in appraising drugs.</p>

  <p>There is a two stage appraisal process. This involves a rapid assessment of the evidence by the New Drugs Committee (NDC) to provide a recommendation about the costs and benefits of using the medicine. This is followed by the SMC appraisal which looks again at the evidence together with the NDC advice, the case put forward by the patient interest groups and the company&rsquo;s response to the NDC advice.</p>

  <p>This approach ensures the SMC can consider all drugs flexibly, taking account of wider considerations as well as the economic evidence provided.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally. The National Objectives and Standards for Social Work Services in the Criminal Justice System, which are currently being revised, will require offenders sentenced to community service to commence work within seven working days of the order being imposed by the court in most circumstances.</p>

  <p>To measure the impact of the additional &pound;1 million funding being made available to Community Justice Authorities from 2009-10, for the delivery of speedier and more immediate community penalties, it is intended to carry out an early audit of current timescales for the start of placements and to repeat the exercise 12 months later.</p>

  <p>Extradition relations with category 1 territories are governed by Part 1 of the Extradition Act 2003. Part 1 implemented the Framework Decision on the European Arrest Warrant (EAW). The decision on extradition under Part 1 is entirely a judicial function and the Scottish ministers have no role in these proceedings.</p>

  <p>Extradition relations with category two territories, are set out in Part 2 of the Extradition Act 2003. Category 2 territories are certain, designated, non-EU countries.</p>

  <p>Part 1 Requests (European Arrest Warrant)</p>

  <p>The Extradition Act 2003 requires surrender of an individual under an EAW for an extradition offence. That is defined as either a crime that requires to meet the test of dual criminality or is one of the framework list offences. If it is the former, the EAW must contain a description of the facts of the criminal conduct that constitutes the offence and a legal definition. The Scottish court must be satisfied that criminal conduct if it had occurred in Scotland would be a crime known to the law of Scotland before it can be satisfied it is an extradition offence under the Extradition Act 2003. This is the dual criminality test.</p>

  <p>If it is a framework list offence there is no requirement for such a test/conversion to be undertaken as it is recognised that across EU member states these crimes have a commonality of criminal conduct, such as murder, rape and fraud.</p>

  <p>No evidence is required to be produced by the issuing judicial authority in support of request to surrender a person under the Extradition Act 2003.</p>

  <p>The Scottish ministers have no role in the execution of EAWs.</p>

  <p>Part 2 Requests</p>

  <p>Where an extradition request is made in the approved way the Scottish ministers must issue a certificate to that effect. This certificate and certain accompanying documents are then sent to the Sheriff at Lothian and Borders in order to allow an extradition hearing to take place.</p>

  <p>The court at the first appearance of the individual must be satisfied the Scottish ministers have sent: the extradition request, particulars of the person whose extradition is requested, particulars of the offence, and either a warrant to arrest issued in the requesting state or a certificate of conviction and sentence. If the court is not satisfied on these issues it must order the person&rsquo;s discharge.</p>

  <p>The Secretary of State has authority to designate countries for the purposes of the Extradition Act 2003.</p>

  <p>Countries can be designated so that they are not required to produce &quot;evidence which would be sufficient to make a case requiring an answer by the person if the proceedings were summary proceedings in respect of an offence alleged to have been committed by the person (except that for this purpose evidence from a single source shall be sufficient).&quot; If the country is not so designated then evidence is required to be produced.</p>

  <p>All offences alleged to be committed in a Part 2 territory require to satisfy the dual criminality test. If they do not, the court must order the person&rsquo;s discharge.</p>

  <p>Yes. Sewel motion S1M-3608 consented to the conferral on the Scottish Ministers of executive functions in relation to extraditions to and from Scotland. The functions in question are contained in Part 2 of the Extradition Act 2003 and relate mainly to extradition requests made by certain designated, non-EU countries (&quot;category 2 territories&quot;). An example of the Scottish ministers&rsquo; functions under the 2003 act can be found at section 93 (Secretary of State&rsquo;s consideration of the case) which has to be read in conjunction with section 141 (Scotland: references to the Secretary of State). Following the receipt of an appropriately made request and the consideration of certain prescribed factors by the sheriff at Lothian and Borders, section 93 provides, among other things, that the Scottish ministers must decide whether or not they are prohibited from ordering a person&rsquo;s extradition by virtue of the factors listed in section 93(2) and more fully detailed in sections 94 (death penalty), 95 (speciality), 96 (earlier extradition to the United Kingdom from another territory) and 96A (earlier transfer to the United Kingdom from the International Criminal Court). If the Scottish ministers decide these questions in the negative they must order the person to be extradited unless any of paragraphs (a) to (c) of section 93(4) apply.</p>

  <p>The motion and further details can be found at:</p>

  <p>The Homecoming &quot;Caledonia&quot; advert was seen by three million Scots (60 per cent of the population) when it premiered on TV in November and in Scotland the evidence of awareness is emphatic, with a You Gov poll in early December 2008 showing that 66% of Scottish people are aware of Homecoming.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has had discussions regarding Homecoming Scotland 2009 with the Stakeholder Engagement Team at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Officials there have received a core briefing pack on Homecoming and were sent copies of the new Events Guide shortly after it was launched by the First Minister and opposition party leaders on 18 December 2008. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office are also promoting Homecoming by placing a link to the Homecoming website on 150 in-country post websites.</p>

  <p>VisitScotland staff are in regular contact with staff at VisitBritain and, as a result, VisitScotland&rsquo;s own Homecoming promotion is being significantly extended through collaboration with VisitBritain who are actively promoting Homecoming through their offices worldwide with websites, e-comms and PR and trade activity. This includes a significant presence for Homecoming across the VisitBritain network of 40 country market sites which are translated in 19 languages from Russian to Mandarin and Japanese, and which attract 10 million users. In addition, the VisitBritain global PR Conference in 2008 was themed around Homecoming and trade events across the globe have used Homecoming as their main theme.</p>

  <p>Formal activity plans were agreed between VisitScotland and VisitBritain in 2008 and the delivery against these plans is being closely monitored by VisitScotland.</p>

  <p>Objections to applications for planning permission should be made to the planning authority. It is for the planning authority to reach a decision on planning applications and in doing so they are required to make decisions in line with the development plan for the area unless material considerations indicate otherwise. It is for the planning authority to decide what weight to give to objections from the public, along with any other considerations which might be material, when determining an application.</p>

  <p>There is no further planning procedure for objectors to challenge a decision once it has been issued by the planning authority. It would be for the objectors to consider taking legal advice for example on what avenues may be open to them in the circumstances of the case.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has no powers to intervene once a local authority has made and issued its decision on a planning application. Scottish ministers do hold powers to call in any live planning application for their own determination, but would consider doing so only where a proposed development raises issues of genuine national interest.</p>

  <p>These same powers and policy on their use apply in relation to applications for retrospective planning permission.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Alcohol-related issues may surface during induction interviews. Providing the prisoner is prepared to engage he/she will be referred for participation on Alcohol Awareness. Attendance is then prioritised using liberation dates to allow participation prior to release where possible.</p>

  <p>A referral list of those suitable is constantly changing throughout the year with short-term prisoner turnover, numbers assessed as suitable for Alcohol Awareness are not available.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>A total of 1,061 substance related programmes or approved activities were completed in Scottish prisons during 2007-08. This was 181 completions above the target of 880 set at the beginning of the year. The following table provides details.</p>

  <p>SPS delivers a suite of Programmes and Approved Activities that address substance misuse issues which is continually evolving to keep pace with current practice and changes in substance abuse trends in the community. For example, the delivery of Lifeline concluded in 2007-08 as it was being replaced by the Substance Related Offending Behaviour Programme (SROBP) which was piloted that year.</p>

  <p>These interventions range from basic awareness sessions to programmes aimed at addressing criminogenic need. This reflects the range of potential clients from those serving short sentences to those with long sentences with associated offences. The duration of these interventions also reflects what each is trying to achieve ranging from 16 hours for Alcohol Awareness to approximately 120 hours for SROBP.</p>

  <p>The assessment processes are similarly diverse, for example:</p>

  <p>Alcohol Awareness &ndash; alcohol-related issues may surface during induction interviews. Providing the prisoner is prepared to engage he/she will be referred for participation on Alcohol Awareness. Attendance is then prioritised using liberation dates to allow participation prior to release where possible. The referral list of those suitable is therefore constantly changing throughout the year with short-term prisoner turnover.</p>

  <p>SROBP - has a more complicated and sophisticated selection process, including a file review, interview and multi-disciplinary discussion.</p>

  <p>As waiting lists change throughout the year due to prisoner turnover the numbers assessed as suitable for each intervention is not available.</p>

  <p>The Strategic Transport Projects Review used a number of data sources to help inform the Review, one of which was the Transport Model for Scotland (TMfS). The reports, which are available on the Transport Scotland website, indicate that TMfS predicts that for the A96 between Aberdeen and Inverness there will be a 26% increase in total trips between 2005 and 2022.</p>

  <p>The current annual average daily traffic levels can be up to approximately 35,000 vehicles in the dual carriageway sections of the A96 near Inverness and Aberdeen, and drop to approximately 7,000 vehicles in the middle of the corridor on the single carriageway sections.</p>

As set out in the Action Plan, specific measures relating to illicit sales of tobacco will be included in the proposed scheme to secure more rigorous enforcement of tobacco sales law which is being developed in partnership with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the Society of Chief Officers of Trading Standards in Scotland. Discussions which have taken place with HMRC/the UK Border Agency in this respect have been extremely constructive and details of the specific agreements reached will be announced shortly as part of the launch of the proposed Enhanced Tobacco Sales Enforcement Programme.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government engaged closely with Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) as part of the process of reforming the organisation. As a result of these reforms, HIE&rsquo;s resources are focused on those interventions that will have the maximum impact on the government&rsquo;s purpose of increasing sustainable economic growth.</p>

  <p>No specific discussions regarding the withdrawal of funding to local sports councils have taken place with HIE. This is clearly an operational matter for HIE.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of the withdrawal of funding for local sports councils in the Highland Council area, whether alternative sources of funding have been determined between it, Highlands and Islands Enterprise or other local agencies to ensure the continuation of these sports councils.</p>

  <p>While Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) no longer provides generic funding to local area sports councils in the Highland Council area, any individual sports club able to make a persuasive case for growth and which would contribute to the objectives of GES would be welcome to approach HIE. In other cases, HIE staff will continue to provide positive referrals to alternative sources of funding, such as the lottery, local authorities, and the grant giving charitable sector.</p>

  <p>Where appropriate, referrals would also be made to sportscotland, where there are processes in place for any local sports council to make an application for funding, which would be handled accordingly.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many (a) independent and (b) mature students would benefit if the Young Students&rsquo; Bursary scheme were extended to these groups using its current income thresholds.</p>

  <p>In academic year 2007-08, 20,475 independent full-time Scottish domiciled undergraduate and post graduate diploma in education students studying in Scotland received support from the Student Awards Agency for Scotland (SAAS). Six hundred and twenty-five of these students already received Young Students Bursary (YSB).</p>

  <p>Of the remaining 19,845 students, 2,605 had declared benefactor income which was below the threshold for YSB. In addition 16,430 of these students were assessed as exempt from parental or spousal contributions to their support and therefore benefactor income details were not provided to SAAS. There are no income details for a further 350 of these students, either because they have not declared income or because their income is extremely low.</p>

  <p>If we assume that everyone in these three groups would be entitled under an extended Young Student&rsquo;s Bursary scheme, a maximum total of 19,385 students would benefit. 14,885 of these students would be considered &lsquo;mature&rsquo; i.e. aged 25 or over.</p>

  <p>The estimated number who benefit may be lower if the income of partners was taken into consideration as was introduced with the new means testing rules for higher education student support in academic year 2008-09. In 2007-08, the income of partners was not included in the means test for student support.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-19187 by Fiona Hyslop on 9 January 2009, whether students in the (a) exempt from parental/spousal contribution and (b) income not declared/required category would receive full means-tested support.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-01-28.S3W-19989.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80330" speakername="Fiona Hyslop" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa0128.htm#30">

  <p>(a) It is not possible to say if all the students in the exempt from parental/spousal contribution would be eligible to receive full means-tested support if bursary support was extended to independent students using the current income thresholds. The answer to question S3W-19187 on 23 January 2009 provided details of the number of independent student supported by SAAS in 2007-08 by age and residual income. However, these figures may be lower when the income of partners is taken into consideration as was introduced through the new means testing rules for higher education student support introduced in academic year 2008-09. In 2007-08, the income of partners was not included in the means test for student support.</p>

  <p>(b) Under current rules SAAS are able to assess the support entitlement of some categories of students without the need for them to provide a detailed income statement. These students are shown in the income not declared / required category as answered in S3W-19187. It is therefore not possible to say how many of them would receive full means-tested support under a revised student support policy, because we don&rsquo;t hold any records of their income at present.</p>
