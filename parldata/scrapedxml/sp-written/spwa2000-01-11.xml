  <p>The Scottish Executive welcomes the report prepared by the Commissioner for Public Appointments in response to complaints she had received concerning the appointment of Dr Harold Mills as Chairman of Caledonian MacBrayne.</p>

  <p>The Executive will be acting on the constructive criticism Dame Rennie Fritchie has made and the Minister for Finance announced on 13 December that a consultation paper on future public appointments in Scotland will be issued. This is aimed both at widening the range of people who are selected for public appointment and ensuring that the process used commands the confidence of the public.</p>

  <p>The Commissioner concluded that Dr Mills was appointed on merit; that there was no suggestion of improper conduct; and that the appointment process was generally conducted with diligence and fairness. In these circumstances there is no case for the process to be reopened and I understand that the Commissioner is of the same opinion. I have full confidence in Dr Mills&#8217; abilities to provide the strong Chairmanship which the company needs.</p>

  <p>I have arranged for a copy of the Commissioner&#8217;s report to be placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre.</p>

  <p>Interested agencies and individuals have had the opportunity to comment on the UK Government proposals for the 2001 Census, issued in March 1999, in a White Paper (Cm 4253 <i>The 2001 Census of Population</i> ). Scottish Ministers have taken account of the proposals set out in the White Paper and comments received since its publication in deciding what topics to propose in the draft Census Order in Council, which has laid before the Scottish Parliament on 10 January.</p>

  <p>Parts of the draft Order are subject to affirmative resolution and the remainder is subject to negative resolution procedures. Paragraphs 1 to 5 of the Schedule to the Census Act 1920 list certain matters about which particulars may be required and which are subject to negative resolution. However, where the draft Order relates to particulars which fall within paragraph 6 of the Schedule to the Census Act 1920, that is, &quot;Any other matters with respect to which it is desirable to obtain statistical information with a view to ascertaining the social or civil condition of the population&quot; then those particulars are subject to affirmative resolution.</p>

  <p>The Census Act 1920 contains provision allowing for those parts of the draft Order subject to affirmative resolution to be modified with the agreement of the Parliament.</p>

  <p>The draft Order will be considered by the Subordinate Legislation Committee and by the lead committee designated by the Parliament. The Subordinate Legislation Committee will report to the lead committee within 20 days of the draft Order being laid. The lead committee is required to report to Parliament no later than 40 days after the draft Order has been laid. The lead committee will set out its recommendations in its report, taking into account any recommendations made by any other committee. If the lead committee recommends that the draft Order be approved with or without modifications, the Parliamentary Bureau shall by motion propose that the Parliament so approve the draft Order.</p>

  <p>Primary responsibility for the protection of land from flooding lies with the landowner concerned. Nevertheless, the Scottish Executive has ensured that local authorities have the necessary powers and resources to mitigate the risk of flooding of non-agricultural land.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Flood Prevention and Land Drainage (Scotland) Act 1997, commenced in July 1997, imposed duties on councils to maintain watercourses where this would reduce the likelihood of flooding, to assess watercourses and to publish biennial reports on flooding.</p>

  <p>The provision of flood prevention schemes is a local matter for the councils concerned, who set the priorities for their own capital expenditure. There has been no need for potential flood prevention schemes to be prioritised by the Scottish Executive and therefore the need to develop criteria has not arisen.</p>

  <p>Schemes promoted by councils under the Flood Prevention (Scotland) Act 1961, and confirmed by Scottish Ministers, are supported by the Scottish Executive with grant at the rate of 50% of eligible costs. Every flood prevention scheme that is confirmed is eligible for grant following construction.</p>

  <p>It is not appropriate for the Scottish Executive to comment on how long it will take for councils&#8217; flood prevention measures to be implemented. It is for the councils concerned to decide on the timing of any work they intend to carry out.</p>

  <p>The single capital allocation that councils receive for their non-housing capital programme includes provision for flood prevention measures, however, funding for major capital schemes is considered separately.</p>

  <p>Whilst several councils have discussed their proposals with officials, the only schemes where the council concerned has completed its preparations and submitted them to Scottish Ministers, are:</p>

  <p>EAST DUNBARTONSHIRE</p>

  <p>River Kelvin Flood Prevention Scheme. This scheme was the subject of a Public Local Inquiry which was completed earlier this month, the report of which is awaited.</p>

  <p>RENFREWSHIRE</p>

  <p>1. Moredun Playing Field Flood Prevention Scheme, Paisley. A Public Local Inquiry has been requested to resolve outstanding objections.</p>

  <p>2. Collier St. Flood Prevention Scheme for Johnstone. Objections have been made to the scheme, which the Council are still attempting to resolve.</p>

  <p>The question of completion dates, and commencement of construction, is for the councils concerned and not for the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>In approving the Dumfries and Galloway Structure Plan on 10 December, the Scottish Ministers took full account of all relevant national planning policy guidelines.</p>

  <p>In relation to minerals the Scottish Ministers were content that a detailed minerals policy and criteria for assessing planning applications will be set out in Dumfries and Galloway Council&#8217;s forthcoming Minerals Subject Plan. However, a modification to the Structure Plan was made in respect of the policies on opencast coal.</p>

  <p>In relation to waste management the Scottish Ministers were satisfied that the Structure Plan provides a reasonable interim strategy until such time as a longer term waste management strategy is prepared.</p>

  <p>Information is not collected on "drop-out" rates for universities but non-completion rates have been compiled and were published on 3 December 1999 for 1996-97 as part of a package of Performance Indicators.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will place in the Parliament&#8217;s Information Centre evidence in writing from the Commission of the European Monetary Union for the proposition that EU Law does not permit the continuation of the derogations that are available under the 1995 Dairy Products (Hygiene) Regulations for Milk-Based Products with Traditional Characteristics and, if not, whether the granting of such derogations remains strictly within the discretionary power of member states.</p>

  <p>Article 8(2) of Council Directive 92/46 provides that Member States may, in so far as certain requirements of this Directive are likely to affect the manufacture of milk-based products with traditional characteristics, be authorised by the Commission to grant individual or general derogations from Article 7A(1) to (4), which includes certain standards for processing establishments, certain standards for wrapping and packing, and the microbiological criteria.</p>

  <p>Article 1 of the Commission Decision 96/536 established the criteria for milk-based products with traditional characteristics and granted derogations from certain structural, equipment and packing requirements, but not from the microbiological criteria, for products listed in the Annex to the Decision. A second Commission Decision 97/284, replaced 96/536 in its entirety. This Decision authorises Member States to grant derogations to establishments, which manufacture traditional products from structural, equipment and packing requirements as in Decision 96/536, but again, not from the microbiological criteria. The position is therefore that the UK is not authorised by the Commission to maintain the derogation given in Regulation 9(11) of the Dairy Products (Hygiene) (Scotland) Regulations 1995 for microbiological criteria under European law.</p>

  <p>Arrangements are being made for Council Directive 92/46/EEC and Commission Decision 96/536 to be placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Information Centre.</p>

  <p>Consultation on the draft Dairy Products (Hygiene) (Scotland) Regulations 1999 ended on 11 October.</p>

  <p>The consultation on these Regulations were extensive and sought views on the effect which removing these derogations will have on industry.</p>

  <p>There are no proposals to extend the consultation period in Scotland. I am advised that the consultation period in England and Wales has not been extended. However, discussions are still ongoing with the Specialist Cheesemakers in respect of structural, equipment and wrapping derogations.</p>

  <p>We currently have no plans to actively promote the use of mediation procedures in medical negligence claims in Scotland.</p>

  <p>All medical negligence claims in Scotland are handled through the Central Legal Office (CLO) who advise Health Boards and NHS Trusts accordingly. The CLO do consider and offer mediation to the pursuers of action when they feel it is appropriate. It is also open to pursuers to seek mediation. Despite these options, to date no cases in Scotland have been settled as a result of the mediation process.</p>

  <p>The relocation of hospital services from Law Hospital in Carluke to the new General Hospital in Wishaw (some three miles north) is unlikely to increase travelling times for patients to any significant degree since Wishaw is at least as accessible from most parts of Clydesdale as Carluke.

  <p>A logistic regression using 1996 SHCS data on people who have bought under RTB and their properties, established statistically the quantitative significance of age of head of household, income, and type of property inhabited (i.e. whether flat or house) to the decision to take up RTB.</p>

  <p>The 43,000 households were classified into one of six groups depending on these criteria, and the likely take up on a group specific basis was computed. The take up for each group was then totalled to give an overall estimated take up rate of 2%.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. These Special Adviser appointments are held for a period which cannot extend beyond the end of the term of office as member of the Scottish Executive of the person whom he is appointed to advise; until the end of the Scottish Cabinet; or in the event of a General Election to the Scottish Parliament on the day after Polling Day.</p>

  <p>2. Mr Ghibaldan advises the Deputy First Minister across the range of the Executive&#8217;s work.</p>

  <p>The Policy Unit is based in St Andrew&#8217;s House. Its members are engaged in developing the strategic capacity of the Executive and working up new policies. Those who are Special Advisers also give political advice to Ministers.</p>

  <p>I announced the arrangements which I have put in place regarding Special Advisers&#8217; pay in Scotland on 22 November (<i>Official Report</i> Vol. 3 No 5; S1W 2650 Mike Watson MSP).</p>

  <p>Provision of pre-school education is subject to scrutiny by authorities&#8217; own internal auditors, to ensure proper separation of interests and the achievement of value for money from public funds. These disciplines apply no less to pre-school education than to other services where local authorities have a multi-functional role. The Accounts Commission are reviewing practice by local authorities in commissioning pre-school education places with a view to developing recommendations on good practice.

  <p>Under the terms of their contract of employment, Special Advisers are Civil Servants and as such are paid from public funds. Mr Rafferty will therefore receive what he is due under the terms of his contract. Mr Rafferty&#8217;s departure did not rest on a breach of the Civil Service Code. A copy of the model contract of employment for Special Advisers is available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe).</p>

  <p>There have been no further developments affecting Queensberry House since my answer of 10 December to Ms Margo MacDonald (S1W-3026). This reported that there are no plans to demolish Queensberry House and that the SPCB is awaiting the results of detailed specialist investigations and the associated cost estimates of remedial works. The SPCB will continue to keep MSPs informed about the Holyrood building at key stages in the project. <br /></p>
