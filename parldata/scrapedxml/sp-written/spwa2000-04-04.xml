<ques id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-04-04.S1W-5908.q0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80161" speakername="Karen Gillon (Clydesdale) (Lab)" spid="S1W-5908" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa0404.htm#5908">

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many requests under the Code of Practice on Access to Scottish Executive Information were handled in the period 1 July to 31 December 1999.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-04-04.S1W-5908.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80252" speakername="Mr Jim Wallace" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa0404.htm#5908">

  <p>In the first six months of the operation of the Code a total of 29 formal Code requests were dealt with. 10 requests were categorised as formal because information was refused. Of the 29 formal requests, the target time of 20 days for public bodies to respond was met on 26 occasions, and charges were levied for the provision of information in two.</p>

  <p>It should be emphasised that all requests for information are considered under the Code of Practice on Access to Scottish Executive Information, whether or not the applicant refers to the Code. For monitoring purposes, however, &quot;formal&quot; Code requests are defined as only those:</p>

  <p>which specifically mention the Code; or</p>

  <p>for which a charge is levied; or</p>

  <p>for which information is refused under one or more of the Code exemptions.</p>

  <p>The total number of 29 formal requests should therefore be considered alongside the estimated overall volume of correspondence handled by the Scottish Executive and other public bodies in the same six month period, which was in excess of 100,000 items. I also understand that, during the period 1 July to 31 December 1999, no complaints under the Code were received by the Scottish Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration.</p>

  <p>As I indicated in reply to question S1W-2058, two members of staff are employed in such a capacity. In addition, there are some 20 or so staff in the Scottish Executive Health Department&#8217;s Chief Scientist Office with responsibility for encouraging and supporting research to improve the health of the people of Scotland and the services provided by the National Health Service.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what impact it estimates the implementation of the Climate Change Levy (CCL) will have on employment in Scotland in each of the next five years and whether it will make representations to Her Majesty&#8217;s Government requesting that introduction of the CCL be delayed until such time as it can be implemented in a way which minimises the impact on jobs.</p>

  <p>As a tax measure, the Climate Change Levy is a matter reserved to the UK Government. The levy is to be revenue neutral and is not expected to have an unfavourable overall impact on employment.</p>

  <p>Scottish Executive policy and practice is that local groups should be supported locally. This allows for the operation of local democracy, and ensures local accountability and involvement. It is for the statutory agencies such as health boards and local authorities to develop and sustain drug misuse services according to local needs and priorities.</p>

  <p>I understand that the Aberdeenshire Council will be meeting on 17 April to discuss future funding support for the voluntary agencies. This will be followed by a meeting of the Aberdeenshire Drug Action Team on 19 April to consider the future role and funding of Grampian Addiction Problem Service within the overall pattern of service provision in the Aberdeenshire area.</p>

  <p>The Strategic Plan for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service for 2000-03 is at an advanced stage of drafting and was considered by the Law Officers, Crown Office Senior Management and Regional Procurators Fiscal at a meeting on 22 March. The strategic aim of the department will continue to be to play a pivotal role in the achievement of the purpose of the criminal justice system of maintaining the security and confidence of the people of Scotland by providing just and effective means by which crimes may be investigated and offenders brought to justice. This aim is supported by particular objectives relating to the several aspects of the work of the department and by very detailed objectives and targets applying to all of the activities of the department. These include training and performance management, in which connection it should be noted that the department achieved Investors in People status in 1998 and is committed to the retention of that status. A new generation computer system is being put in place and the department is playing a leading role in the integration of Scottish criminal justice system information technology. Particular attention is being paid to issues relating to children in the criminal justice system, to victims, to drug offences and to the incorporation of ECHR.</p>

  <p>Funding of local Rural Partnerships is met from the Executive&#8217;s Rural Strategic Support Fund, part of the Scottish Rural Partnership Fund. Grants are limited to the minimum needed for the partnership to succeed, subject to a maximum of &pound;40,000 in Year 1. Executive support is for up to three years only, staged degressively to encourage an exit strategy by the organisation concerned.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive expect that the implementation of joint ticketing and pricing initiatives will be driven by the commercial acumen of operators and transport strategies of local authorities. Such arrangements should have regard to competition legislation and where necessary guidance should be sought from the competition authorities. Beyond this the Executive will consider the nature and extent of any guidance which may be required to encourage the take up of our proposals for buses in the forthcoming Transport Bill.</p>
