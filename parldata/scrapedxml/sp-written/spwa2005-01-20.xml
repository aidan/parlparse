  <p>The Scottish Executive, along with the UK Government is committed to eradicating child poverty within a generation. The Executive&rsquo;s Closing the Opportunity Gap approach to tackling poverty works both directly and indirectly across all its departments, and within numerous spending streams. Universal services such as health, education and child care benefit all children, with an emphasis on meeting the needs of the most vulnerable. Expenditure targeted on areas of deprivation such as the Community Regeneration Fund also has an impact on children. A number of funding streams are specifically directed at disadvantaged children such as Sure Start funding. The range of spending that has an impact on children in poverty means it is not possible to give a total figure for previous or future years.</p>

  <p>The key low income results, above, are for 60% of both the relative and absolute GB median thresholds. Estimates on the full range of income thresholds and explanation of how these estimates are calculated are published in <em>Households Below Average Income, 1994-95 &ndash; 2002-03</em>, copies of which are available in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 32212).</p>

  <p>The relative low income measure compares against the median of the same year. The absolute measure compares against the median in the baseline year of 1996-97, uprated to remove the effects of inflation. The figures are estimates based on a sample survey and are therefore subject to sampling variation. As such, small percentage changes are not significant when considered on a year-on-year basis; identification of trends should be based on several years of data.</p>

  <p>Decisions on treatment interventions and options for addressing other needs are for individual patients and their medical and social care professionals.</p>

  <p>The evidence shows that the key to addressing the multiple problems experienced by many drug misusers is to plan and deliver services in an integrated way. The Executive&rsquo;s Effective Interventions Unit has produced evidence based guidance on integrated care for drug users. Drug Action Teams, in collaboration with partner agencies, are developing models of integrated care relevant and appropriate to their local needs and circumstances.</p>

  <p>Drug Action Teams and their local partners assess the level of need in their areas and have to ensure that the treatment needs of their local drug using population are met. Guidance on the development of service provision for psychostimulant users, including cocaine and crack cocaine was issued in October 2002 by the Executive&rsquo;s Effective Interventions Unit, based on the work of the Scottish Advisory Committee on Drugs Misuse.</p>

  <p>There are many uncertainties associated with behaviour of carbon in Scotland&rsquo;s high organic soils. In light of this, the Executive has commissioned, jointly with the National Assembly for Wales, research based on modelling the behaviour of carbon and nitrogen in organic soils which will run until 2006.</p>

  <p>In addition, climate change is a cross-cutting theme in the strategic research strategy for the Environment and Rural Affairs Department. The current five year Programme of research includes work which will seek to improve our understanding of how we might minimise carbon loss from - and promote carbon sequestration in - Scottish soils, including peatlands.</p>

Non-EU students graduating from a Scottish institution with a HND, degree, Masters or PhD will soon be able to stay on in Scotland for up to two years without requiring a work permit. There are no plans to extend to this to students who are here for a very limited period of time.</p>

  <p>However, there are a number of other elements of the initiative which will benefit students who come here for a short time, for example on placements or internships, as well as those completing a degree or other course.

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to giving every child the best possible start in life. Improving child health has benefits which last into adulthood, and our health improvement challenge focuses on the early years. We have already achieved a lot.</p>

  <p>This includes:</p>

  <p>Developing an Integrated Early Years Strategy to ensure all services for young children work together effectively;</p>

  <p>Supporting breastfeeding;</p>

  <p>Examining how child health can be improved by providing parents in deprived areas of Glasgow with extra support and access to enhanced community-based resources, through the Starting Well national health demonstration project;</p>

  <p>Improving diet and raising physical activity levels for schoolchildren, through healthier school meals and the recruitment of over 600 Active School Coordinators;</p>

  <p>Making children and young people a priority in the National Programme for Improving Mental Health and Well-being, and</p>

  <p>Ensuring all children and young people who need it have an integrated package of health, care and education support, as part of our <em>Closing the Opportunity Gap</em> work.</p>

  <p>The numbers given in the table show the number of <u>people</u> assessed as homeless by local authorities. The annual statistics show the number of <u>households</u> assessed as homeless and there is often more than one person per household.</p>

  <p>The definition of a rural local authority used here is: "A local council which has a population density of less than 100 persons per kilometre, all of whose area is regarded as rural except for settlements with a population of more than 10,000". This definition was defined by the Scottish Household Survey and is used by the Scottish Rural Partnership Fund.</p>

  <p>Figures are not available at a level lower than local authority level.</p>

  <p>Figures prior to 2002-03 are estimated and rounded up to the nearest 100.</p>

Because of the small number of houses identified in the survey as below the tolerable standard the survey cannot provide estimates for individual councils.</p>

  <p>Councils provide the Executive with annual estimates of the number of below tolerable standard dwellings in the council area. Research conducted on behalf of the Executive into the basis for local and national estimates &ndash; <em>Research into the basis for local and national estimates of the number of BTS houses in Scotland</em> by DTZ Pieda Consulting in association with Dr J I Ansell - concluded that there were significant variations between councils in the way in which they interpret the standard when compiling their estimates, and that there are also weaknesses in the estimates stemming from the use of unsatisfactory baseline data and imperfect methods used to update estimates. This report has been published by Scottish Executive Central Research Unit in 2000 and is available on the Scottish Executive website (<a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/cru/resfinds/drf90-00.asp" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/cru/resfinds/drf90-00.asp</a>).</p>

  <p>The table gives estimates of total number of occupied dwellings below tolerable standard for local authorities classed as being rural.</p>

  <p>The definition of a rural LA used here is: "A local council which has a population density of less than 100 persons per kilometre, all of whose area is regarded as rural except for settlements with a population of more than 10,000". This definition was defined by the Scottish Household Survey and is used by the Scottish Rural Partnership Fund.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Through the Partnership Agreement, ministers have given a commitment to ensure that more houses are barrier free.</p>

  <p>In 2003-04, 96% of the new build houses approved for Housing Association Grant funding through Communities Scotland complied with Housing for Varying Needs standards. In addition, where the Executive has a role to play in private sector housing developments, 99.4% of all new build housing funded was barrier free. In all other properties, private developers have to address the implications of barrier free building required by the current Building Standards (Scotland) Regulations.</p>

  <p>Information about the number of charges is not available for the period before April 2002 because of changes to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service&rsquo;s database in financial year 2001-02.</p>

  <p>Information available before these changes relates only to the number of reports containing charges under section 52 of the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995. The number of reports received in the financial years 1999 to 2002 were provided in answer S1W-29917 but are not directly comparable with the figures above because a report may contain more than one charge under section 52 of the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995.</p>

  <p>A separate charge code for offences of careless driving involving a road accident fatality was introduced in March 2002. This additional information will enable a fuller statistical picture on such offences which are proceeded against in court, such cases to be available in the statistics for 2003 onwards. Publication of the summary statistics on court proceedings concluded in 2003 is currently planned for March 2005.</p>

  <p>Criminal proceedings relating to road accidents causing serious but non-fatal injury cannot currently be separately identified in the statistics held centrally, though the feasibility of linking statistical records on road accidents involving serious injuries with those on any resulting criminal proceedings is being investigated.</p>

  <p>2. It is not possible to assume that those doctors who did not progress into a SHO post in Scotland all left the country as there may be other reasons (for example, a PRHO not attaining GMC registration within the year).</p>

  <p>We currently train more than our proportion of doctors in the UK, both at undergraduate and junior doctor level. At September 2003, Scotland had a higher ratio of Hospital and Community Health Service (CHS) Training Grades (which includes SHOs and SpRs) to population than both England and Wales, as contained in Table 2.</p>

  <p>Progress towards implementation of the Act has been kept under review on the basis announced in my answer to parliamentary question S2O-4466 on 9 December 2004. Although it would be possible to continue to work to the original timetable, in my view the risk of slippage of key elements is now such as to make it prudent to announce a short delay to commencement. Making this decision now will give service users, carers, professionals and managers confidence that each of the elements necessary for successful implementation will be in place when the act comes into force and enable them to plan effectively for the new commencement date which will be in October of this year. The Mental Health (Care and Treatment)(Scotland) Act 2003 is world leading legislation and it is our intention that the quality of the implementation will match the vision set out in its drafting.</p>

  <p>This holiday period was the first in which NHS 24 had been fully operational and provided the access point for Out of Hours services across Scotland. In the run up to the festive period &ndash; and with the full support of the Health Department - NHS 24 and the health boards agreed contingency plans to ensure that patients would continue to receive an effective response from the NHS during what was expected to be a very busy time.</p>

  <p>Between Christmas Day and the 4 January, the Health Department received daily status reports on the position of NHS 24 and the Out of Hours services it supported. At the end of the period a report on how the service had performed was submitted to the Health Department. The initial assessment was that the festive period had indeed been an extremely busy time with 89,700 calls being dealt with by NHS 24 between Christmas Day and 4 January. Whilst response times had lengthened due to the demand, NHS 24 and its partner organisations had coped. A further wash-up report is expected once NHS 24 and the health boards have identified the learning points coming out of the performance over the winter period.</p>

  <p>This is an operational matter and therefore primarily for NHS Lothian. I understand from the board that the public electricity supply to the hospital was interrupted for a few seconds around midnight on 6 to 7 January. This led to some parts of the hospital being without mains power for periods of up to 1 hour 50 minutes. I am told, however, that risk evaluation took place on an on-going basis during this time, and no patients were placed at risk.</p>

  <p>Standby power systems came into operation during the period. These systems ensured that most parts of the hospital continued to function normally. However, some aspects of the standby system did not function as expected. But the NHS board reports that there was no additional risk to patients, and in particular no threat to patients&rsquo; lives.</p>

  <p>Clearly there are lessons to be learned from what has happened. I expect that the board will consider carefully what further steps need to be taken with their contractors to reduce the impact of any future mains power interruption on the operation of the hospital.</p>

  <p>I announced in <em>Fair to All, Personal to Each</em> , published on 15 December 2004, that a new system for recording NHS waiting times will be introduced by the end of 2007. The new approach will be fairer, more open to scrutiny, and more understandable than the present approach under which patients can be excluded from the Executive&rsquo;s waiting times guarantee in certain circumstances. The new approach will also help to put patients at the centre of their care.</p>

  <p>A key aspect of the new approach will be to balance the responsibility of the NHS to provide care and treatment quickly with the responsibility of patients to accept and keep a reasonable offer of an out-patient consultation or hospital admission for treatment. Where an appointment has been agreed in advance and the patient does not turn up without giving prior warning, they will return to the start of the waiting queue, unless there are clinical or other compelling reasons for them to be treated more quickly.</p>

  <p>Technical definitions for and guidance on the use of the new waiting times recording system are being prepared and will be ready in advance of implementation at the end of 2007.</p>

  <p>In 2000, following the removal of the general scheme of direction of legally-aided clients with birthdays in January and February to the Public Defence Solicitors&rsquo; Office (PDSO), the Scottish Legal Aid Board (SLAB) and the Edinburgh Bar Association (Summary) agreed that, from 2001 onwards, a fixed percentage of the Edinburgh Sheriff Court plan would be allocated to the PDSO. It was also agreed that SLAB would keep the size of the allocation under review. Since 2001, the percentage allocation has been:</p>

  <p>There is no statutory basis for local or public holidays.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers are responsible for setting bank holidays in Scotland. The Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971 provides the statutory basis for UK bank holidays. Schedule 1 prescribes Scottish bank holidays. Section 1(2) of the act provides for alternative days to be appointed as bank holidays by Royal Proclamation where a day specified in schedule 1 to the act is inexpedient in any particular year. Section 1(3) of the act provides that special days may be appointed as bank holidays by Royal Proclamation either throughout the United Kingdom or in any place or locality in the United Kingdom.</p>

  <p>The consultation for this Electricity Act application, submitted in November 2004 is still underway and the final response is not expected until the end of June. At this stage it is not possible to say when a decision will be made, but the time to determination in respect of previous large wind farm applications suggests that it is unlikely that a decision will be made in the course of 2005.</p>

  <p>For target H, the Executive is working with an Advisory Group of representatives from key delivery agencies and rural communities to agree the rural areas to be targeted, to consult with local communities to identify the key services to be improved, and, later in 2005, to agree with the relevant community planning partnerships the specific targets for improvements to be achieved in terms of accessibility and quality. For each area and target, measurements will be made at baseline and in 2008 and changes from baseline calculated. Research will shortly be commissioned to establish local views on key services and how they might be improved and to collect data to measure baseline service provision. As target improvements for access and quality are agreed with community planning partnerships, further details of the measurement process will be made available on the Scottish Executive Closing the Opportunity Gap website:</p>

  <p>The period of 30 years adopted for the appraisal is appropriate since it matches the rental period specified in the Invitation To Tender documentation issued to developers. This is consistent with the guidance on economic appraisals published by HM Treasury in the so called <em>Green Book</em> . The decision whether to rent or purchase the building will depend on an appraisal of costs and benefits which will include a residual value for the asset at the end of the 30 year period. This decision will not be taken until the end of the construction phase at which time details of the appraisal will be published.</p>

  <p>Visitscotland.com continues to act as a highly-effective shop window for Scottish tourism. The joint venture continues to generate significant business for the tourism industry in Scotland, with over &pound;23 million worth of business generated since its inception.</p>

  <p>Due to the nature of the joint venture, it was always anticipated that it would take a number of years for visitscotland.com to become profitable. However, as a shareholder in the company, VisitScotland has reported that it is currently performing well against business plan targets and is projected to achieve profitability in the next three to four years.</p>

  <p>VisitScotland recently issued a proposed organisational structure for the new tourism network to all Area Tourist Boards (ATB) and VisitScotland staff, which included an initial analysis of the current number of posts in the ATBs and VisitScotland (1,062), and a proposed number of posts for the new network (1,025). The difference, of around 35 to 40 posts, includes some posts which are already vacant. Most of the other reductions are expected to be achieved by means of voluntary severance.</p>

  <p>High-quality in every aspect of Scottish tourism is vital to ensure that the expectations of our visitors are fulfilled during their visits to Scotland. That is why the Executive has given VisitScotland an additional &pound;3 million over two years to work with the tourism and related sectors to widen and enhance the impact of its current voluntary Quality Assurance schemes.</p>

  <p>In 2004-05 EventScotland has a budget of &pound;3 million and this will rise to &pound;5 million in 2005-06 as it strives to secure a viable portfolio of events to attract visitors to Scotland. VisitScotland will use the many opportunities that arise from hosting major events to promote all that Scotland has to offer as a great place to visit throughout the year.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to supporting the developing employer-led network of Sector Skills Councils, which includes GoSkills, the Sector Skills Council for the passenger transport sector. The Executive also provides funding to the Scottish Union Learning Fund which supports projects run by transport unions, among others, to develop the skills of their members.</p>

  <p>In addition, the creation of the National Transport Agency as a centre of excellence should help to attract new skills to the Scottish transport industry.</p>

  <p>No. The main relevant legislation is the Waste Incineration (Scotland) Regulations 2003. These are consistent with the Waste Framework Directive (75/442/EEC) and the Waste Incineration Directive (2000/76/EC).</p>

  <p>Legislation to encourage manufacturers to reduce packaging already exists. Under the Packaging (Essential Requirements) Regulations 2003, anyone may complain to their local authority trading standards officer if they believe a product uses excessive packaging. The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 require businesses with a turnover of &pound;2 million and making or using over 50 tonnes of packaging a year to recycle or recover certain proportions of packaging waste. This acts as an incentive on them to minimise their packaging use.</p>

  <p>In addition, we support the Innovation Fund, run by the Waste and Resources Action Programme, to help retailers minimise waste from packaging and products.</p>

  <p>The Game (Scotland) Acts all predate the obligations placed on Scottish ministers by Council Directive 79/409/EEC, but they are not inconsistent with those obligations.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers have received no formal communication from the European Commission in relation to this matter.</p>

  <p>Any review of the Game Acts would take full account of obligations arising from international commitments and European legislation.</p>
