  <p>The procurator fiscal has a duty to enquire into all sudden, suspicious, accidental, unexpected and unexplained deaths but there is no requirement to report or investigate every death where alcoholism or alcohol intoxication is a contributory cause. It is likely that many such deaths are not reported to the procurator fiscal.</p>

  <p>In relation to the deaths that are reported to the procurator fiscal, current Crown Office information systems do not record cause of death in a way that allows statistical information of the kind sought to be extracted.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what action is being taken and what additional resources are being provided to improve access to qualifications, training and support for residential child care staff, in the light of the findings of the article by G Heron and M Chakrabarti, "Examining the perceptions and attitudes of staff working in community based children's homes: are their needs being met?", in <em>Qualitative Social Work</em> , Volume 1, 2002.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive, in partnership with employers, has made a significant investment in the training of the residential child care workforce. In 2001 the Executive established the Scottish Institute for Residential Child Care to ensure residential child care staff across Scotland have access to the skills and knowledge they require. This has already made a significant impact.</p>

  <p>The Regulation of Care Act 2001 has created a regulatory framework for staff and residential child care staff will be amongst the first group to be registered. The act has introduced national care standards for care homes for young people. The standards are explicit about the need for employers to ensure staff are suitable and properly trained for this demanding area of practice.</p>

  <p>The Child Strategy Statement issued by the Scottish Executive sets out the importance to all Scottish Executive Departments of taking account of the views and interests of children in developing policy that may affect them.</p>

  <p>The Executive commissioned Save the Children to develop the "re:action" Consultation Toolkit to facilitate consultation with children. Children&#8217;s views are being taken into account in a range of specific contexts: for example through the Scottish Youth Parliament, the Young Scot website and the Children&#8217;s Charter being drawn up in the light of the Child Protection Review <em>It&#8217;s everyone&#8217;s job to make sure I&#8217;m alright</em>. Children and young people participated in a wide range of events during the National Debate on Education.</p>

  <p>The views of young people leaving care have formed an important part of our work on throughcare and aftercare services, and Who Cares? Scotland have been commissioned to survey looked after children about their education attainments and improvements they would like to see.</p>

  <p>There is strict guidance on use of these no proceedings categories by procurators fiscal when marking cases. In particular, the &quot;time-barred&quot; category is only to be used when the offences are time-barred at the time the report is received from the police or other reporting agency.</p>

  <p>While the overall proportion of cases marked no proceedings has remained steady, the proportion marked no proceedings because of delay in reporting by the police has increased since 2001-02, largely because of reporting problems in the Strathclyde Area. This is attributable by the police to a number of factors around an increase in detection rates, reporting policies, technology and resources. It is a temporary problem, which has been identified and is being addressed by the police, in partnership with the Area Procurators Fiscal in Strathclyde.</p>

  <p>The draft bill, together with an accompanying policy statement on wildlife crime, will be launched on Tuesday 11 March. Consultation on the bill will run until Friday 6 June 2003. Introduction of the bill to Parliament, following consultation, will of course be a matter for a future administration.</p>

  <p>The draft bill builds upon a raft of successful recent Executive initiatives in the fields of natural heritage and the environment, including the delivery of high-priority wildlife crime measures in the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill, the current consultation on a new Scottish Biodiversity Strategy and the recent passage of the Water Environment and Water Services Bill.</p>

  <p>Publication of the draft bill not only fulfils an undertaking by the First Minister in his speech to Parliament of 30 May last year, but also delivers on our long-standing Programme for Government commitments to improving the system of nature conservation and to working with local communities to achieve effective protection for Scotland&#8217;s natural heritage.</p>

  <p>The draft bill will focus on three key policy strands &#8211; the conservation of biodiversity; improved protection for sites of special scientific interest and further measures to tackle wildlife crime. It will do so by updating the existing Wildlife and Countryside Act and by recognising the central role which land managers and local communities must play in achieving conservation goals.</p>

  <p>Our overarching objective in this draft bill is to establish a new system of nature conservation which is tailored to the nature of Scotland, but which also sets the protection and enhancement of our natural heritage firmly within the wider, global context of biodiversity conservation and sustainable development.</p>

  <p>Prescription data collected centrally is not patient-specific.</p>

  <p>The decision on whether or not to prescribe a drug for a patient is always a matter for the clinical judgement of the patient&#8217;s doctor, informed by advice and guidance about the drug.</p>

  <p>The Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001 removed the distinction between residential care homes and nursing homes and all such services are now known as care homes.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care (the Care Commission) in regulating services against the legislative requirements and the relevant national care standards requires providers of care homes to keep accurate up-to-date records of all medicines for the use of service users. These records are kept on the premises from which the care service is provided.</p>

  <p>Tenders were received from six contractors who were asked to price the work to replace the failed section of road and bridge. All prospective contractors need to satisfy the Scottish Executive of their financial security and competence to undertake specific types of work before being placed on an approved list.

  <p><em>Scottish Abstract of Statistics</em> was published annually up to 1996 and then in 1998. Following consultation with users, there are no plans to publish future volumes. Updated versions of information which appeared in the 1998 Abstract have already been published in a variety of ways, for example, on the Scottish Executive website.</p>

  <p>The <em>Social Focus</em> and <em>Scottish Economic Statistics</em> publications have replaced the <em>Scottish Abstract of Statistics.</em></p>

  <p><em>Social Focus</em> is an annual compendium that concentrates on a particular topic each year. The first edition of <em>Social Focus</em> concentrated on gender issues including health, education and the labour market. The 2003 edition will compare a range of statistics across urban and rural Scotland.</p>

  <p><em>Scottish Economic Statistics</em> provides a range of data on the Scottish economy, as well as outlining the programme for economic statistics work in the Scottish Executive. In addition, it contains articles discussing current issues in economic statistics.</p>
