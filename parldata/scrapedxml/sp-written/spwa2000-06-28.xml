  <p>In October 1994 Canon was offered RSA of &pound;530,000 which was paid in full.</p>

  <p>In February 1996 Canon was offered &pound;3,000,000 which was reduced to &pound;2,530,435 in January 1999 and a total of &pound;1,500,000 was paid.</p>

  <p>Officials in the Monitoring department, Scottish Executive, are in touch with the company concerning RSA clawback.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it can give the allocation of end-year flexibility by department.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-06-28.7.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80201" speakername="Mr Jack McConnell" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa0628.htm#8299">

  <p>I announced yesterday a total end-year flexibility allocation of &pound;435 million. Table 1 shows end-year balances generated by vote.</p>

  <p>In discussion with my Cabinet colleagues we agreed that departments should retain a total of &pound;362 million both to fund slippage in capital projects and to meet our agreed policy that departments retain a 75% share of the end-year balance. This generated a reserve of &pound;73 million. We have allocated a further &pound;38 million to portfolios which did not benefit from budget consequentials, mainly to rural affairs, communities, environment and education and lifelong learning. This leaves an unallocated reserve of &pound;35 million.</p>

  <p>Table 2 sets out the total allocation of end-year flexibility by portfolio. My colleagues will make further announcements on the detailed allocation of these resources.</p>

  <p>Resources carried forward through end-year flexibility will be taken up in a budget revision this autumn, which will be subject to scrutiny by the Finance Committee.</p>

  <p>Since 1994 the Scottish fish processing industry and related sectors have received a total of &pound;19.7 million, and payments continue to be made. The Executive has not received any formal applications from fish processors for financial assistance in respect of the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive. At recent meetings between industry representatives and officials, the possibility of making a fully costed bid for resources was discussed. Assistance may then be available under the new Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG) which we expect to open to applications later this year.</p>

  <p>The Clinical Standards Board for Scotland is a statutory body, established as a special health board in April 1999. Its role, in line with the Scottish Executive&#8217;s commitment to quality, openness and public accountability, is to promote public confidence that the services provided by the NHS are safe and that they meet nationally agreed standards.</p>

  <p>The Health Technology Board for Scotland was established as a special health board in April 2000 to provide boards and other decision-makers with advice on the clinical and cost-effectiveness of new and existing health technologies. Boards will be expected to justify any decision not to follow the advice of the new board; both in the public eye (the advice of the board will be public) and within clinical governance.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) has published over 40 guidelines since it was formed in 1993. We are aware that these evidence-based national recommendations published by SIGN are translated by local practitioners into protocols which reflect particular local circumstances.</p>

  <p>The appointment of members to the boards of special health boards such as the Clinical Standards Board and the Health Technology Board, is made by me on behalf of Scottish Ministers. These appointments are made on merit by fair and open process and are subject to independent assessment by the Health Appointments Advisory Committee. Consideration is given to the balance of the boards and to the skills which individuals can contribute.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to reviewing and modernising the system for making public appointments in Scotland and responses to a review on public appointments is currently being considered by Scottish Ministers.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN), which was formed in 1993, is an independent network of clinicians and healthcare professionals and as such is not subject to the public appointments system. Patients and public views are represented on SIGN through the Scottish Association of Health Councils.</p>

  <p>Of the Meat Industry Red Tape Review&#8217;s 35 recommendations, three were rejected, three were for Agricultural Departments and 29 were for the Food Standards Agency (FSA).</p>

  <p>Of the 29 recommendations for the FSA, six require EU approval. As anticipated, four of these will be addressed in the context of the Commission&#8217;s proposals for new food hygiene law, the first element of which is due to be published later this month (numbers 1, 6, 10, 11). Steps have been taken to progress the other two issues (7, 33). 23 recommendations do not require EU approval &#8211; four have been completed (numbers 17,19,20,22), one requires action next year (number 5) and the remaining 18 are being acted on.</p>

  <p>One of the recommendations (number 18) was the establishment of an Efficiency Review of the Meat Hygiene Service. The terms of reference for the review have been approved by the Deputy Chair of the Food Standards Agency and have been published in the Official Journal of the European Community. Independent consultants will be appointed to carry out a two-stage review. It is expected that an initial report will be with the FSA by the end of the year.</p>

  <p>NHS Trusts are responsible for the operation of staff disciplinary procedures. The Scottish Executive has worked with Trusts and others to put in place a range of measures to improve and streamline the disciplinary process for medical staff. Trusts have been encouraged to consider alternatives to avoid unnecessary suspensions. Where suspension is considered necessary, the new measures will shorten the time that individuals spend on suspension and therefore reduce costs.</p>

  <p>We are currently aware of two NHS hospital doctors suspended on full pay. The doctors have been suspended since April and May 2000 respectively. One other doctor, an honorary consultant employed by a University, has been suspended for three years. This suspension pre-dates the recent work to improve the disciplinary process. The circumstances surrounding this case would not have occurred under the revised arrangements but these arrangements cannot be applied retrospectively. We expect those concerned to bring the matter to a satisfactory conclusion.</p>

  <p>In November 1999, we published <i>Social Justice &#8211; a Scotland where everyone matters</i> , which set out our commitment to tackling exclusion and disadvantage wherever it occurs. At a local level, action to achieve the milestones is being taken by our network of Social Inclusion Partnerships.</p>

  <p>Earlier this year I confirmed our continuing financial commitment to the Blantyre/North Hamilton and Motherwell North Social Inclusion Partnerships by providing them with funding allocations totalling over &pound;2.5 million from the Social Inclusion Partnership Fund for 2000-01. Further details of their progress and their plans for the coming year will be set out in the annual reports which both Social Inclusion Partnerships will produce by the end of June 2000.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s Sure Start Scotland initiative, with funding of &pound;42 million over three years, provides support for families with very young children. Local authorities also have statutory obligations in relation to children in need. Guidance on the implementation of The Children (Scotland) Act 1995, issued in 1997, notes the role of family support services which may include home helps or family aides. It is for local authorities to determine what services or support families in their area need.</p>
