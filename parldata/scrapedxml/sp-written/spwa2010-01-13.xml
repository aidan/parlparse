  <p>To date, the Scottish Government has committed to invest over &pound;13 million in the CashBack for Communities programme, which includes diversionary and participatory projects for young people across Scotland.</p>

  <p>&pound;4 million of this investment has been allocated to Youthlink Scotland. This includes the latest round of funding (&pound;1 million) which closed for applications on 31 October 2009. Funding distributed through the Youthlink Scotland local youth project grant scheme is recorded by local authority.</p>

  <p>The following successful applicants in Clackmannanshire and Stirling have been awarded funding from Youthlink round three:</p>

  <p>The assessment of Youthlink round three included independent assessment panels in all local authorities. The panels consisted of: local authority representatives (community learning and development and community safety in particular); the voluntary sector, and trained young people. These panels provided independent local knowledge to judge applications for the area.</p>

  <p>Youthlink Scotland make a huge effort to ensure youth organisations in all communities are aware of available funding through CashBack. Youthlink has three main networks: the members network, the policy forum and VOCOG (Voluntary Organisation Chief Officers Group). These networks cover areas like: local authorities, voluntary organisations, schools, youth justice, the Scottish Youth Parliament and youth work. Passing the information through these networks alerts organisations about the funding.</p>

  <p>Encouragement and help is also provided for organisations to complete the funding application from Youthlink. Local surgeries have been set up to guide applicants through the process and offer advice on what information should be included in an application.</p>

  <p>Our 2007 report <em>Mind the Gaps - Making a Difference</em>, which can be found in the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s Information Centre (Bib. number 44565), focused on improving awareness of the needs of those with co-occurring mental health and substance misuse problems; improving support and service provision, and influencing positive supportive attitudes toward this care group. Forward action from the report has reflected these aims by promoting and encouraging joined-up local and other services with attention on prevention and recovery.</p>

  <p>From the end of this year, the National Drug-related Deaths database will give a better indication of the circumstances behind each death. This will help us to target key resources and ensure services are better able to meet the needs of these vulnerable individuals most at risk of dying.</p>

  <p>Information on the number of drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities is not held centrally. However, information from the National Directory of Drug Treatment Services, maintained by the Scottish Drugs Forum, showed that 27 facilities currently offer residential places for rehabilitation. Of these, 16 facilities with 342 beds in total, have indicated that they offer services for clients with mental health problems. Services listed in the directory are primarily for the treatment of drugs though some facilities also treat clients for alcohol rehabilitation.</p>

  <p>In terms of alcohol rehabilitation facilities, this information is not held centrally. The Scottish Alcohol Needs Assessment report (published by the Scottish Association of Alcohol and Drug Action Teams) mapped the number of publicly-funded alcohol treatment provision falling within tiers 2, 3 and 4 modalities of care as defined by Models of Care for Alcohol Misusers (The National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse, 2006). It identified 97 services in Scotland in 2006-07 as providing specialist alcohol interventions, of which 10 were residential agencies and the remainder (87) were community-based. The majority (59.4%) provided services for both drug and alcohol misusers and 37.5% provided exclusively alcohol services. The report did not provide a breakdown or services by individual health boards (just groups of health boards) or the number of beds available.</p>

  <p>Contracted suppliers for the home insulation scheme are obliged to fully complete the householder&rsquo;s installation within 28 calendar days of the referral being passed to them and, apart from where the needs of the household prevent the supplier from doing so or other factors such as severe weather, installations are being completed comfortably within this timescale.</p>

  <p>Data which will allow for an accurate calculation of the average waiting time for the installation of insulation measures will be available shortly as the scheme develops.</p>

  <p>As acknowledged in the answer to the question S3W-29773 on 7 January 2010, the content and substance of each report held on NHS board websites has varied and has led to inconsistencies in the range of data being reported across NHS Scotland. The review of the structure and presentation of the HAI reporting template (HAIRT), currently being undertaken by a short-life working group led by NHS Scotland, is working to ensure consistency of reporting across all NHS boards. The revised HAIRT will be introduced from spring 2010 and will reinforce the requirement for specialty information to be included.</p>

  <p>The Care and Repair Working Group (CRWG) is no longer in existence. The group comprised of Scottish Government officials working with COSLA and the Care and Repair Forum Board. The decision was taken to disband CRWG as it was not considered representative of the range of stakeholders in the sector.</p>

  <p>The review of care and repair arrangements, carried out as part of the implementation of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, decided instead to focus on enhancement of the role of the national coordinating body, the Care and Repair Forum.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will continue to ensure that former CRWG members are involved in ongoing dialogue with members of the new board as required.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government published <em>Reviewing Care and Repair in Scotland 2009: Report of the findings of the review of Care and Repair</em> on 17 August 2009. The review identified the development of a national policy statement as an important role for the national co-ordinating body.</p>

  <p>Local authorities are responsible for developing schemes of assistance under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006. The Scottish Government underlined the role of care and repair services in statutory guidance issued to support the implementation of that act. The national co-ordinating body will wish to consider how best to continue to promote the contribution of care and repair services to schemes of assistance.</p>

  <p>It will also take a lead role in identifying and agreeing core services that all care and repair agencies should provide, and how these can be made available to users. The issue of a care and repair brand is linked to that of core services, and so the care and repair review also recommends that the national co-ordinating body act as steward of the brand on behalf of ministers.</p>

  <p>The funding available to local authorities between 2005-06 and 2009-10 for running costs for care and repair services is set out in the following table, rounded to the nearest thousand pounds.</p>

  <p>In financial years 2005-06, 2006-07 and 2007-08, funding for care and repair was separately identified and ring fenced. Local authorities were allowed to add to these allocations from Private Sector Housing Grant (PSHG) to fund services.</p>

  <p>From 2008-09, the ring fencing was removed and an equivalent amount added to PSHG, split between local authorities on a pro rata basis, in line with PSHG allocations. This included a specific condition of grant to maintain care and repair services.</p>

  <p>There is no fixed timescale for the implementation of recommendations from the review. Additional funding from the Scottish Government to support the national co-ordinating body in the changeover and implementation of review findings is available for a period of two years.</p>

  <p>The national co-ordinating body will be responsible for devising a suitable work plan to take forward the recommendations.</p>

  <p>The success of the national co-ordinating body will be reviewed when that period is over, and the implementation of the <em>Review of Care and Repair Projects</em> is likely to be fundamental to this broader review.</p>

  <p>An expert group comprising COSLA, the Association of Local Authority Chief Housing Officers (ALACHO), a local government finance officer and the Scottish Government considered all applications against the agreed principles and criteria. The group provided an initial assessment of applications and their recommendations were shared and then discussed with COSLA&rsquo;s Shared Services Board (for round one) and the Leadership Board (for round two). These bodies considered the advice and then formed an agreed position and recommendations which were considered by Scottish ministers in making a final decision.</p>

  <p>Applications were assessed against criteria relating to six overarching principles, as Parliament was informed in response to parliamentary question S3W-20310 on 5 February 2009. Due to the high demand for this fund from across the country, the expert group and the Shared Services/Leadership Boards had to ensure that applications met all the requirements set out in the criteria. One of the criteria is that the council has prudential borrowing or the capacity to use other sources of funding to fund the investment. The existing level of debt associated with Shetland Island Council&rsquo;s housing revenue account is already very high, the council has the highest debt per unit of all councils in Scotland. Whilst Shetland&rsquo;s proposed borrowing is from an internal source, it will still incur interest. Therefore, the fact that the borrowing will incur interest and will still need to be repaid meant that increasing the level of debt presented too high a risk to the sustainability of the housing revenue account.</p>

  <p>Moray Council received &pound;1.2 million subsidy from round one of the incentivising council house building fund to help build 48 new houses. In round two, Moray applied for &pound;1.125 million to help build 45 new houses.</p>

  <p>In round two, an expert group comprising COSLA, the Association of Local Authority Chief Housing Officers (ALACHO), a local government finance officer and the Scottish Government considered all applications against the agreed principles and criteria. The group provided an initial assessment of applications and their recommendations were shared and then discussed with COSLA&rsquo;s Leadership Board. The board considered this advice and then formed an agreed position and recommendations which were considered by ministers before making a final decision.</p>

  <p>Applications were assessed against criteria relating to six overarching principles, as Parliament was informed in response to parliamentary question S3W-20310 on 5 February 2009. A key principle in assessing proposals was deliverability, requiring evidence that the development would be on site within a year of funding allocations, including identified sites and the number of units to be built. Unfortunately, Moray Council&rsquo;s ongoing tendering exercise with developers meant that evidence was not available. Given the high level of demand for the available funding, it was considered that it would be more appropriate to allocate subsidy to applications which had the required site details and that Moray Council&rsquo;s application should not receive support at this time.</p>

  <p>The estimated uptake rate so far for people under 65 years in a clinical at-risk group is 48.3%, among individuals aged 65 years and over in a clinical at-risk group the figure is 42.3% and among pregnant women it is 45.0%. Overall, this equates to 45.6% for the whole clinical at-risk group.</p>

  <p>To date, an estimated 50.8% of eligible frontline health care staff have received the vaccination, and 32.1% of eligible frontline social care staff have been vaccinated.</p>

  <p>Data is not held in GP systems on the number of individuals who are a household contact of an immunocompromised individual and therefore there is no reliable denominator for this population to determine uptake rates at a national level.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is not aware of valuation appeals being progressed in the form of a class action, and it would seem only to be rarely that such an approach might be considered given that appeal is on a point of law only. Ministers are currently considering the recommendation in the Scottish Civil Courts Review, carried out by Lord Gill, the Lord Justice Clerk, that there should be a form of special multi-party court procedure in Scotland.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-28836 by Nicola Sturgeon on 23 November 2009, what the average waiting time was at each accident and emergency department in NHS (a) Greater Glasgow and Clyde and (b) Ayrshire and Arran in each year since 1999.</p>

  <p>The national waiting time target for accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department is that 98% of patients wait no longer than four hours between arrival at A&amp;E and admission, discharge or transfer. NHSScotland have consistently delivered this target since it was introduced at the end of December 2007.</p>

  <p>The median waiting times from arrival to departure for each A&amp;E department in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and NHS Ayrshire and Arran from 1999 to 2008-09 are provided in the following tables.</p>

  <p>Prior to 2007, A&amp;E waiting times was collected through an annual census covering three or seven days period in April. The census between 1999 to 2005 only covers the core A&amp;E hospitals. In 2006, the survey was expanded to cover A&amp;E departments, including minor injury units. Only information for core sites have been provided in table A. Information has also been included showing the average daily attendance and the percentage change in attendance from 1999.</p>

  <p>Since 2007, detailed data has been collected at all large hospitals containing an A&amp;E department (core sites). Smaller hospitals and minor injury units do not generally collect data at this level and are therefore not included in table B. Information has also been included showing the average daily attendance and the percentage change in attendance since 2007. Due to the nature of the different methods of data collection, the median waiting time information in tables A and B are not directly comparable.</p>

  <p>The Permanent Secretary attends weekly meetings in London as part of the leadership team of the UK Civil Service. A range of other meetings related to these responsibilities (including Permanent Secretary Sub-Group on Employee Relations, Permanent Secretaries&rsquo; Management Group, Learning Skills Board, Skills Strategy Delivery Board, Government Skills and Senior Leadership Committee) and Scottish Government business are scheduled around this weekly meeting.</p>

  <p>During 2009, the Permanent Secretary travelled to London for his regular weekly meeting on 35 occasions. This involved return air travel on 30 occasions and a mix of train and air travel outward and return on the other five.</p>

  <p>Air travel allows a full day&rsquo;s business to be conducted without the need for an overnight stay.</p>

  <p>This government takes a co-ordinated partnership approach to tackling sectarianism as part of our broader work on tackling all forms of religious intolerance and racism. Officials from a number of Directorates work on this important issue along with a range of partner bodies. We believe this is a much more effective way of tackling these serious problems rather than setting up a separate unit, which we have no current plans to do, although we do keep such matters under review.</p>

  <p>The different sources and levels of financial support, for academic year 2009-10, available to postgraduate taught students is publicly available and can be found on both the Student Awards Agency for Scotland website:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.student-support-saas.gov.uk/student_support/special_circumstances/postgrad_support.htm" target="_blank">http://www.student-support-saas.gov.uk/student_support/special_circumstances/postgrad_support.htm</a>.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Funding Council (SFC) allocates the research postgraduate grant to all Scottish Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). SFC has allocated &pound;27.9 million formulaically and has provided a contribution of &pound;1.5 million for research postgraduate studentships in academic year 2009-10.</p>

  <p>Apart from a funded place at a HEI, the other sources of funding available to a research postgraduate student are a studentship from one of the seven research councils, a studentship from a charity or a professional loan from a high street bank. The level of financial support varies. In academic year 2009-10, the minimum tax free stipend offered by the research councils was &pound;13,290.</p>
