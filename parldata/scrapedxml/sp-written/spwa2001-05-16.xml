  <p>Currently, the only official source of information about vacancies in Scotland is from Jobcentre records maintained by the Employment Service. The latest figures show that in March 2001 there were 45,700 vacancies at Jobcentres in Scotland. Surveys of employers have historically shown that only around a third of vacancies in the economy are notified to Jobcentres. Hence the estimate that, in Scotland, there are at least 100,000 vacancies. The Office for National Statistics has recently started a simple regular enterprise survey-based approach to provide a fuller measure of vacancies in the UK although this is still in the experimental phase.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&#8217;s Scottish Energy Efficiency Office (SEEO) operates the Energy Efficiency Best Practice Programme, providing free consultancy advice to businesses and other organisations to encourage more efficient use of energy. Funding in the current year is &#163;1.7 million and one particular aim of SEEO is to encourage take-up by small businesses. The introduction of the climate change levy, which has raised business energy costs, is designed to work in this direction and from this year an additional &#163;2 million a year is to be made available from the levy for additional energy efficiency programmes delivered jointly with the Carbon Trust.</p>

  <p>SEEO also funds the Energy Saving Trust&#8217;s Scottish programme, which is largely aimed at domestic energy use, but which offers interest free loans to small businesses for investment in energy efficiency through a scheme called Loan Action Scotland.</p>

  <p>We work closely with MAFF on a range of issues. A co-ordinated approach tends to be the preferable option in fisheries since Scottish fishermen fish off the coast of England and English vessels fish in the Scottish zone. For example, recent proposals for technical measures to protect juvenile haddock will apply to all UK vessels fishing in the Scottish zone of British fishery limits.</p>

  <p>We are not persuaded that an independent inquiry into the environmental impact of sea cage fish farming would be the best way to proceed at this time.

  <p>Any aid provided to the industry has to meet the requirements of EC State Aid guidelines. The measures I announced on 8 March, however, included an additional &#163;1 million for collaborative research into more selective fishing gears. This has already benefited several vessels which have undertaken trials using these gears. It is expected that more fishermen will benefit as further trials are undertaken. Arrangements for implementing the remaining measures in the &#163;27 million package are also being worked up as a matter of priority.</p>

  <p>This is a reserved matter. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE), which is responsible for gas safety in Great Britain, has published several leaflets on gas safety, including carbon monoxide risks and the need to have appliances regularly serviced by CORGI registered installers. This guidance applies to all gas consumers, including caravan users. HSE has also worked closely with the National Caravan Council and the Council for Registered Gas installers in developing guidance specifically targeted towards caravan users. A quarter of a million copies of this free leaflet were distributed last year to all caravan parks across Great Britain.</p>

  <p><i>The Same as You? A review of services for people with learning disabilities</i> recommended that services in the community for people with learning disabilities should be developed to allow the remaining long-stay hospitals to close by 2005. It also recommended that approximately 400 inpatient places should be retained for assessment purposes and for people requiring specialist treatment which cannot be met in the community. It is for health boards, NHS Trusts and social work authorities to work through the implementation of these recommendations locally. The pace of change will therefore be for local determination, subject to the overall aim of achieving the 2005 target.</p>

  <p>This will be taken forward mainly by the new Scottish centre for learning disabilities. We announced in March a grant of &#163;1.5 million to a consortium led by ENABLE to establish the new centre. One of the key elements in its remit is to promote public awareness and understanding about learning disabilities through changing negative attitudes and perceptions. It will work with other organisations to share knowledge and improve information services.</p>

  <p>We are also funding the national Anti-Bullying Network to help schools across Scotland share good practice in tackling bullying and provide training and consultancy services to support schools and local authorities in developing effective anti-bullying strategies. This will benefit pupils with learning disabilities.</p>

  <p>The Anti-Bullying Network and the Scottish centre will work together to promote awareness of learning disabilities in schools.</p>

  <p>Local area co-ordinators will be responsible for making sure that each person who wants to has the opportunity to develop a life plan. Guidance issued on 26 March to local authorities and health boards stating that the appointment of local area co-ordinators should be one of the priorities for use of change funds. <i>The same as you?</i> recommends that initial training for putting local area co-ordinators in place should begin in autumn 2001. Change funds of &#163;36 million over three years have been allocated from April 2001 to support these and other proposals.</p>

  <p>Work on this matter is proceeding.

Parallel to this, we have commissioned an update of a major 1993 report on Scotland&#8217;s potential renewable resource and its broad location.

  <p>I have already emphasised to SHEFC, in my guidance letter of November 2000, that improvement in human resource policies and management should be a priority for the sector. This report makes a helpful contribution to taking this agenda forward in the case of contract researchers. While the issues raised are primarily for those responsible for the employment and management of contract researchers, I expect that the report&#8217;s findings will also assist SHEFC in promoting good employment practice.</p>
