  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to ensure that there are sufficient numbers of health care workers trained to meet health care demand. Through our established process for workload and workforce planning, the Scottish Government will continue to plan for appropriate numbers that reflect both issues of supply and demand across Scotland.</p>

  <p>The specific information requested is not centrally available.

  <p>We work closely with the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman and the Scottish Health Council to ensure that the NHS complaints procedure is easy to use and effective.</p>
