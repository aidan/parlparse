  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many air ambulance flights originating in Orkney have been classified as &quot;emergency&quot; in each year since 1998.</p>

  <p>Between 1998 and 2003, the Scottish Ambulance Service categorised its air ambulance flights into four sections &ndash; emergency, very urgent, urgent and planned. The criteria for these four categories were:</p>

  <p>Emergency &ndash; 999 calls or doctors&rsquo; emergencies which require an aircraft to be activated as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>Very urgent &ndash; Time for air ambulance to be with patient up to six hours.</p>

  <p>Urgent &ndash; Time for air ambulance to be with patient up to nine hours.</p>

  <p>Planned &ndash; This category applied when ordering doctors considered it necessary, because of the patient&rsquo;s medical condition, that he/she was transported to hospital by air ambulance, but where it was not required to get the patient to hospital within the nine hour period. This category applied to most inter-hospital transfers.</p>

  <p>In January 2004, the categories were reduced to two &ndash; emergency and planned. The criteria for these two categories are:</p>

  <p>Emergency &ndash; Immediate threat to life or limb &ndash; a time factor can be agreed with the clinician ordering the air ambulance if they feel that is appropriate.</p>

  <p>Planned &ndash; For all cases where there is a time factor agreed with the clinician ordering the air ambulance.</p>

  <p>The following table shows the number of air ambulance flights from Orkney by case type in each calendar year since 1998.</p>

  <p>Of the 30 missions categorised as emergencies, 27 had a timescale which had been agreed with the requesting clinician. The ambulance service met the timescale in all but one of those cases &ndash; a performance of 96% against a target of 95%.</p>

  <p>There have been fluctuations in the number of calls classified as &quot;emergency&quot; in the past eight years and over the last year the ambulance service has been trying to ensure that the definitions for ordering air ambulance services - across the whole of Scotland - are followed more consistently. A new guidance leaflet describing the ordering process is due to be issued to clinicians shortly.</p>

  <p>There is a protocol between the Scottish Ambulance Service and the Ministry of Defence (MoD) for tasking MoD to carry out air ambulance missions. The MoD decides on the most appropriate response, one of which may be the deployment of the Coastguard. This is an operational matter for the ambulance service and MoD and it would be for those organisations to consider whether or not the protocol is published.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-02-23.S2W-22857.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80057" speakername="Mr Andy Kerr" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0223.htm#2">

  <p>Council of Europe recommendation R (83) 8 makes a number of recommendations in relation to AIDS. The recommendations dealt with the use of coagulation factor products prepared from large plasma pools; informing patients and recipients of the risks of blood products, and providing blood donors with information. Policy in Scotland in relation to blood products fully reflected these principles and recommendations. The risks of large plasma pools were recognised and appropriate warnings were provided on products. Clear warnings were also provided to blood donors by Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service (SNBTS) in 1983, specifically in relation to AIDS.</p>

  <p>An earlier Council of Europe Recommendation No. R (80) 5, concerning blood products for the treatment of haemophiliacs, was discussed with Scottish Haemophilia Directors and Directors of The Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service at a meeting organised by the Scottish Health Department in 1981, at which it was agreed that &quot;<i>policy and practice in Scotland were consistent with this</i> <i>document,</i> <i>subject to further consideration of the recommendation on the setting up of a haemophilia register&quot;. </i>It is believed that policy and practice in Scotland were also consistent with the subsequent Recommendation No. R (83) 8 concerning AIDS.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to linguistic access for Deaf people in Scotland and has noted the development of the SIGNVRS scheme.</p>

  <p>We have no plans at present to launch such a pilot scheme in Scotland. However, we are aware of the interest in the use of sign video relay technology and will explore with our BSL and Linguistic Access Working Group how we might learn from this development.</p>

  <p>From 1 April 2006 we are making an estimated &pound;90 million available to meet our commitment to reduce the existing poundage gap by half. We have committed to close the gap fully in April 2007.</p>

  <p>The Scottish non-domestic rate poundage for 2006-07 will be 44.9p. In 2005-06, the Scottish poundage rate was 46.1p and the English poundage rate was 41.5p. This is a difference of 4.6p. In 2006-07 the Scottish poundage rate will be 44.9p and the English poundage rate will be 42.6p. This is a difference of 2.3p, which is half of 4.6p.</p>

  <p>Average waiting times are not regarded as a particularly effective measure of the availability and efficiency of drug services. Rather, the information compiled by drug action teams and submitted to Information Services Division specifies the number of people who wait for less than a week, less than two weeks and so forth, for different types of intervention. Table 1 presents information on the length of time waited, by drug action team area, for (a) clients who have received drug intervention, which includes detoxification and (b) clients who are still waiting for prescribed drug intervention for the period July to September 2005, the most recent period for which comprehensive data is available.</p>

  <p>1. Prescribed drug treatment includes detoxification, maintenance or reduction programmes, and is defined as the prescribing of a substitute drug, (e.g. methadone, lofexidine, subutex) for facilitating the complete cessation of the use of illicit drugs, controlling withdrawal symptoms or reducing illicit drug use. GP prescriptions are not included in this data.</p>

  <p>2. The waiting time is measured from the date a decision is made regarding what is the appropriate treatment for the client to the first date offered for beginning the treatment.</p>

In the financial year 2004-05, the number of clients who accessed services (including community based treatment) and reported use of crack cocaine was 348.

  <p>Scottish Development International (SDI) has discussed the proposal for a trade promotion co-operation initiative with the International Cooperation office of Catalonia. The idea is at an early stage and it is not clear at this point that the industries and regions involved will be a sufficiently good match for Scottish interests to make this the best use of the limited resources available for Scotland&rsquo;s overseas trade promotion.

  <p>All blood products carry a risk of infection from blood-borne viruses, however small. It is estimated that about 200,000 women in Scotland will have been treated with anti-D immunoglobulin since its introduction in 1968. Anti-D immunoglobulin, which is administered to women who are rhesus D negative, is generally considered safe from blood-borne viruses when prepared by a method recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). The Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service (SNBTS) has always prepared anti-D immunoglobulin in accordance with WHO advice and its product has therefore always been considered safe from transmission of blood-born viruses. The SNBTS have confirmed there have been no cases of blood-borne virus transmission by anti-D, and there has been no evidence of any hepatitis C transmission.</p>

  <p>Following the introduction of testing in 1991, considerable work was carried out to trace any links between blood donors infected with hepatitis C and patients who had received infected blood. A look back exercise was undertaken by UK blood services from 1995 and completed in 1997.</p>

  <p>The look back exercise was based on tracing the past donations of blood donors found to be infected with hepatitis C. Where this was the case, a thorough search of records was carried out with the aim of identifying recipients of the blood and offering them counselling and testing for the virus.</p>

  <p>Where currently SNBTS is informed of any patient who is discovered to be infected with hepatitis C - and transfusion may have been the route of infection - a full investigation is carried out.</p>

  <p>Where returning blood donors from pre-1991 test positive for hepatitis C, or where patients present with hepatitis C infection which may be linked to blood transfusion, Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service (SNBTS) will investigate thoroughly the background and circumstances to these cases and will initiate look back procedures so that any patients potentially affected can be offered counselling and testing.</p>

  <p>The involvement of patients in clinical trials took place around the introduction of the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service (SNBTS) heat-treated Factor VIII product in 1987. Papers already released include correspondence in relation to eligibility for compensation for patients taking part in clinical trials. Although there were concerns expressed by clinicians about compensation arrangements, these issues were resolved and did not delay the introduction of a heat-treated Factor VIII product which was safe in terms of the transmission of hepatitis C.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to its written submission to the Health Committee as part of its consideration of the case for an inquiry into infection with hepatitis C as a result of NHS treatment, which lessons it and previous governments considered were necessary to be learned and which lessons were learned.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-02-23.S2W-22870.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80057" speakername="Mr Andy Kerr" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0223.htm#13">

  <p>The Scottish Executive, and previous governments, have consistently remained open to learning any lessons which would improve donor and patient safety. Current procedures demonstrate that lessons have been learned.</p>

  <p>Where returning blood donors from pre-1991 test positive for hepatitis C, or where patients present with hepatitis C infection which may be linked to blood transfusion, Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service (SNBTS) investigates thoroughly the background and circumstances and initiates look back procedures so that patients potentially affected can be offered counselling and testing. This allows SNBTS to trace archived specimens of blood from the original donations which can be tested and, if it is confirmed that those were the cause of the hepatitis C transmission, the patient&rsquo;s doctor is informed. Other donations from the implicated donor are then traced, tested and any positive results found lead to a search for the recipient of those positive donations so that those individuals can be informed. Since the introduction of testing for hepatitis C, traceability is closely monitored.</p>

  <p>During the period 1998-2004, SNBTS investigated 32 potential transfusion-transmitted infections related to hepatitis C and the results indicted that the number of cases arising from blood transfusions before 1991 is very small. SNBTS therefore have effective arrangements in place for tracing donors and recipients where there is a suspected link between hepatitis C and blood transfusions.</p>

  <p>The NHS is committed to becoming a better learning organisation, to using experiences and views of patients and staff to learn and build a culture of continuous quality improvement. A key element of this is developing a patient-centred approach which involves the sharing of information and decisions about treatment with patients in line with best professional practice. We are also aware that GMC guidance issued in October 1997 addresses the issues raised.</p>

  <p>There have been only two whole stock transfers in Scotland since the transfer of Scottish Borders Council&rsquo;s stock to Scottish Borders Housing Association. The price paid for Dumfries and Galloway Council&rsquo;s housing stock was an average of &pound;2,767 per unit and the price paid for Glasgow City Council&rsquo;s housing, before grant, was &pound;310 per unit. A small number of partial transfers have taken place at nil price mainly because of the high element of demolition and new build involved in these estate based regeneration projects.</p>

  <p>It is too early to judge the success of test purchasing in reducing illegal sales in Scotland as the new arrangements have not yet been rolled out across all local authority areas. However, the independent evaluation of the test purchasing pilots undertaken in South Ayrshire, Edinburgh, Stirling and Moray would suggest that test purchasing does act as a deterrent. A copy of the report is available on the Scottish Executive Website.</p>

We have published guidance for the public on resolving disputes without going to court and we are providing support and funding for a range of mediation and advice services. The Scottish Executive Health Department launched a three year pilot in conjunction with NHS Scotland&rsquo;s Central Legal Office in April 2005 to encourage settlement of clinical negligence disputes through the use of mediation as an alternative to litigation.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Teachers&rsquo; Superannuation Scheme provides a specific pension scheme designed for the teaching profession. The Local Government Pension Scheme in Scotland provides a pension scheme for a variety of local government (and similar) employees where they are not entitled to be members of another statutory public service pension scheme. It is therefore common for employees working in the same establishment to belong to different public pension schemes.</p>

  <p>In the School Estate Strategy which we published jointly with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities in 2003, the local authorities signalled a clear objective that the new school facilities would benefit local communities. It is very much for the authorities to address community needs, for sporting as for any other facilities, at the local level.</p>

  <p>No. The review of Sport 21 will build on the established vision for the development of Scottish sport but take into account the need to secure legacies from the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics and if successful, the 2014 Commonwealth Games. Therefore, it would be inappropriate for the review to exclude the key delivery partners.</p>

  <p>I certainly welcome positive approaches to diversification at ski centres. Our Enterprise Networks, Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise, provide business development support relating to such diversification when there is a good business case for doing so. Support has been given to all five ski centres.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive and Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) have separate responsibilities and powers under the Protection of Badgers Act 1992 for licensing the disturbance to badgers or their setts, determined by the nature of the works to be undertaken.</p>

  <p>Both organisations record the number of licences issued but not the number of applications received. Since 2000, the Scottish Executive and SNH have issued 175 and 76 such licences respectively. The time for consideration of individual licence applications varies depending on a range of factors including the circumstances and complexity of each case and no records of individual processing times are generally recorded.</p>

  <p>The licence to disturb a badger sett on the route of the Dalkeith northern bypass was issued by SNH, and I understand was issued within 24 hours from receipt of the application. As this is an operational matter for SNH, further information can be obtained from its Chief Executive.</p>
