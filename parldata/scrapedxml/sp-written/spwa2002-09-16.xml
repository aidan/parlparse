  <p>There is no procedure for adoption orders to be reviewed outside the judicial process.</p>

  <p>The effect of an adoption order is to transfer all parental rights and responsibilities to the adoptive parents, as if the child had been born into that family. This includes the right to have the child live with them or otherwise to regulate the child&#8217;s residence.</p>

  <p>However, an adoption order will only be granted if it is in the child&#8217;s best interests after careful inquiry. As part of the adoption process, a child aged 12 or over must give their consent to a proposed freeing or adoption, unless that child is incapable of so doing. The views of younger children on proposed adoptions should also be taken into account, when the child has the maturity to express a view.</p>

  <p>Should an adoptive family become unable to care for an adopted child, for whatever reason, the local authority assumes a responsibility for ensuring the child&#8217;s welfare, as would be the case in any other family.</p>

  <p>As farm dumps have hitherto been practically unregulated, there is limited information about them on which to base estimates of environmental risks or of the cost of regulation. The Scottish Executive published a consultation paper, <i>Safer Landfill</i> , <i> </i> on 29 August. This includes a draft Regulatory Impact Assessment on which it seeks comments: it is expected that consultation responses will provide more information on costs.</p>

  <p>The consultation paper has been sent to a range of representatives of the agricultural sector, including NFU Scotland, the Scottish Landowners Federation, the Crofters Commission, the Scottish Agricultural College and the Independent Farming Group. In preparing the paper we have been in close and regular contact with representatives of NFU Scotland. The paper states our intention to work with NFU Scotland and SEPA to consider ways in which the regulatory burden can be minimised. We are presently considering the membership and remit of a group to undertake this work.</p>

  <p>The consultation paper <i>Safer Landfill </i>is available in the Parliament's Reference Centre (Bib. number 23948).</p>

  <p>Under the EC Bathing Waters Directive (76/160/EEC ), bathing waters are required to be designated based on the traditional numbers of swimmers, and once designated, such waters are required to meet certain water quality standards. Local authorities have powers to erect signs on beaches under section 121(9) of the Civic Government Act 1982 to advise the public as to any danger or health hazard connected with those waters. The safety of those using coastal waters is a matter for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. In Scotland, the cause of death recorded on death certificates is coded using the World Health Organisation's International Classification of Diseases (ICD). The Ninth Revision of the ICD, which was in use up to 1999, did not have a specific code for mesothelioma. However, all cases where mesothelioma was mentioned on the death certificate were identified by the General Register Office for Scotland (GROS).</p>

  <p>2. The 10th Revision of the ICD, which has been used to code cause of death in Scotland since 1 January 2000, includes a specific group of codes for mesothelioma.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive's strategy for all cancers is to ensure patients have access to the best care possible through multidisciplinary managed clinical networks involving clinicians drawn from among relevant disciplines. There are therefore no centres of excellence vested within particular institutions or facilities.</p>

  <p>Through the Chief Scientist Office, the Scottish Executive funds a wide range of research into cancer. Many researchers and research groups are involved. Concentrating research in a single centre would not be an efficient way of ensuring that its benefits, in terms of improved treatment and organisation of care, are implemented as widely as possible throughout the health service.</p>

  <p>Her Majesty&#8217;s Government, working with the Broadband Stakeholder Group, has developed criteria to define competitiveness and extensiveness in line with the broadband target. In summary, competitiveness is defined as a composite measure of price, market regulation and consumer choice. Extensiveness is defined as a composite measure of addressable market and availability.</p>

  <p>As the target is for the UK as a whole, Scotland will not be considered separately from the rest of the UK market when judging whether it has been reached.</p>

  <p>Data about injury road accidents are collected by the police and reported to the Scottish Executive using the STATS 19 statistical report form. These returns cover only accidents in which one or more people were injured: they do not cover damage only accidents. The returns do not provide information about the causes of the accidents.</p>

  <p>UK Government research, published in 2000, into the incidence of drugs in fatal road accident victims, found that illegal drugs were present in 18% of the sample group and that medicinal drugs were present in 6%.

  <p>Minor changes to OECD procedures for student sampling and test administration were made to enable the 2000 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) to be run in Scotland.

  <p>The Ministerial Action Group on Languages made a number of recommendations relating to the provision of foreign language learning in schools in its report <i>Citizens of a Multilingual World</i> . These recommendations included a model for entitlement to language learning which encompassed both the primary and secondary school experience. The Scottish Executive accepted these recommendations and is providing additional funding to local authorities to support their implementation of the recommendations made by the action group and to ensure that a pupils&#8217; entitlement to language learning is put in place. As part of entitlement to language learning, local authorities are being encouraged to make foreign language learning available from at least P6 and improvements in provision will be carefully monitored and evaluated.</p>

  <p>The police have a duty to protect life and property and co-ordinate the multi-agency response by local authorities, emergency services and others to a civil emergency including flooding. In areas affected by flooding, multi-agency response groups can be brought together at the earliest sign of a potential risk. Through the Military Aid to the Civil Community Scheme the authorities can request the assistance of the services when appropriate. The Executive provides the police with specific grants for emergency planning for all types of civil emergencies including floods and can in certain circumstances offer further financial support under the Bellwin Scheme to councils incurring eligible costs in dealing with a large scale emergency.</p>

  <p>More specifically, the primary responsibility to protect property from flooding lies with the owners concerned. However, since 1997, councils have had a statutory duty to assess watercourses in their areas and maintain them in a due state of efficiency where this would substantially reduce the likelihood of flooding of non-agricultural land in their areas. The Executive also supports councils in their efforts to address flood risk to non-agricultural land through flood prevention schemes and has ensured that councils have the necessary powers and resources.</p>

  <p>Additionally, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) has powers to operate flood warning schemes. The Executive provided financial support to SEPA to enable the introduction, last November, of the Floodline flood warning service.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to helping councils protect vulnerable communities from flooding and consequently reducing the likely need for emergency action, demonstrated by the substantially increased resources it has made available for major flood prevention schemes.</p>

  <p>North Lanarkshire Council has wide powers under the Flood Prevention (Scotland) Act 1961 to mitigate flooding of non-agricultural land in its area. Under the act, the council is obliged to publish biennial reports specifying all occurrences of such flooding, the measures it has taken and the measures it considers that it requires to take to mitigate flooding in its area. Should the council decide to take measures, other than those of repair or maintenance, then it can only carry these out in accordance with a flood prevention scheme, made by the council and confirmed by Scottish ministers.

  <p>The single allocation North Lanarkshire Council receives for its non-housing capital programme includes, among other things, provision for flood prevention measures to mitigate flooding of non-agricultural land. More generally, and separately, the Executive has made additional resources available for major flood prevention schemes promoted by local authorities. Grant is available for the construction of confirmed flood prevention schemes subject to certain criteria.</p>

  <p>However, it is for North Lanarkshire Council to decide on its overall priorities for addressing flooding concerns in its area and come forward with suitable schemes. Should it do so, the needs of North Lanarkshire Council would be carefully considered in light of the resources available at that time.</p>

  <p>Local authorities already have wide powers under the Flood Prevention (Scotland) Act 1961 to mitigate flooding of non-agricultural land in their areas. Measures, other than maintenance or repair, have to be in accordance with flood prevention schemes, made by councils, widely advertised and submitted for confirmation to Scottish ministers. The Executive issued National Planning Policy Guidance, in 1995, to planning authorities to apply the precautionary principle so that flood risk is avoided where possible and managed elsewhere.</p>

The Health Technology Board for Scotland (HTBS) has recently recommended Etanercept and Infliximab for use in certain circumstances in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

  <p>I have asked Graeme Munro, Chief Executive of Historic Scotland to reply. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The repairs to Hallbar Tower were grant aided by Historic Scotland and were carried out in accordance with the terms and conditions that apply to the historic building repairs grant scheme.</p>

  <p>One of the conditions of the scheme is that work be carried out in accordance with an advisory report prepared by Historic Scotland architects. The advisory report is provided to guide the applicant&#8217;s professional adviser in the preparation of a comprehensive scheme of repairs.</p>

  <p>The advisory report for Hallbar Tower recommended the removal of the stone slab roof and its replacement with slate, the original roofing material. The stone slab roof was a relatively late element in the tower&#8217;s construction, having been introduced in the 1860s. It was not considered to be of archaeological importance and the slabs were re-cycled as footpaths round the tower and at the nearby bothy. The work was supervised on a day-to-day basis by the firm of architects appointed by the applicant, with periodic visits by a Historic Scotland architect to ensure that works progressed in accordance with the requirements of the advisory report. This is normal practice on a grant-assisted project.</p>

  <p>I have asked Graeme Munro, Chief Executive of Historic Scotland to reply. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The Buildings at Risk Register is maintained by the Scottish Civic Trust on behalf of Historic Scotland, an agency of the Scottish Executive. It comprises information on endangered historic buildings that are in need of rescue and publicises them to potential purchasers or tenants who might restore them. The register is a computerised database and information is available to the public on request in the form of illustrated printouts, tailored to suit individual requirements, for which a small charge is made. The <i>Buildings at Risk Bulletin</i> is published annually and is circulated widely. This contains an illustrated selection of properties from the register. In addition to funding the register, Historic Scotland is making additional resources available to the trust to make the full Buildings at Risk Register available on the internet. This improved service will be available to the public in the near future.</p>

  <p>&quot;Our arrangements were different from those in the other three countries, although we used the same ILA centre - Capita - as England and Northern Ireland but in a more limited role. That is significant in respect of the suspension.&quot;</p>

  <p>In Scotland learning providers had to be registered through the Scottish University for Industry (SUfI) and meet their requirements before they were accepted to deliver ILA-funded courses.

  <p>The Scottish ministers are responsible under the terms of The Parole Board (Scotland) Rules 2001 (the Rules), made under sections 20(4) and (4A) of the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Act 1993 (as amended), for the referral of relevant cases to the Parole Board. On the referral of a case, the Scottish ministers are required by the rules to send to the board a dossier containing any information in writing or documents which they consider to be relevant to the case, including, wherever practicable, the information and documents specified in the Schedule to the rules.</p>

  <p>Long-term prisoners, that is persons sentenced to a term of four years or more, may be released on licence after serving one-half of the sentence, if this is recommended by the Parole Board. The Parole Board makes its decisions on whether or not to recommend the early release on licence of such prisoners in private, under Part III of the rules. If the board recommends the early release of a long-term prisoner who has been sentenced to less than 10 years, the Scottish ministers are obliged, by law, to release the prisoner. In the case of a prisoner sentenced to 10 years or more, the Scottish ministers currently exercise discretion over whether or not to accept the board&#8217;s recommendation. Under provisions contained in Part 4 of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill it is proposed to remove that discretion so that Scottish ministers will be obliged to follow the board&#8217;s recommendation in all cases.</p>

  <p>In the case of life prisoners, when the punishment part of the life sentence has expired, an oral hearing is arranged by the Parole Board, under part IV of the rules, to consider whether or not the prisoner requires to continue to be confined for the protection of the public. Hearings normally take place in the establishment in which the prisoner is detained. In the dossier of information that is sent to the board in such cases there is normally a document recording the Scottish ministers&#8217; views on whether or not the prisoner should continue to be confined; and at the oral hearing the Scottish ministers are represented, normally, by an official of the Justice Department and a representative of the Scottish Prison Service. The prisoner, who is entitled to be present at the hearing, may also be represented.</p>

  <p>Where, in the light of the information provided to it and the views expressed at the oral hearing, the Parole Board is satisfied that a life prisoner no longer requires to continue to be confined for the protection of the public, it will direct the prisoner&#8217;s release on life licence. The Scottish ministers are obliged, by law, to release the prisoner on life licence.</p>

  <p>The Lord Justice-General and Lord Justice-Clerk issued a consultation paper on 14 May 2002 setting out their proposals for reducing delays in criminal appeals. These proposals have now largely been enacted by way of an Act of Adjournal. We propose to take forward one aspect requiring primary legislation by an amendment to the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill.</p>

  <p>Information is not readily available in the form requested. However, I understand that 120 appeals against conviction under solemn procedure from both the High Court and Sheriff Court covering a wide range of seriousness <strong> </strong> await a hearing before the Court of Criminal Appeal. As at 30 June 2002 the average waiting period for this category of appeal was 32 <strong> </strong> term weeks.</p>

  <p>The programming of business before the Court of Criminal Appeal is a matter for the Lord Justice General. He has recently introduced a number of measures to improve the management of appeals. These are set out in the Act of Adjournal (Criminal Appeals) 2002 (SSI 2002/387), made on 23 August 2002.</p>

  <p>Among the reforms is the introduction of a procedural hearing in appeals against conviction or conviction and sentence. This hearing will take place before a single judge who will consider the state of preparation of the appeal. Cases which are ready to proceed will then be allocated to an Appeal Court hearing. It is anticipated that these hearings will improve the rate at which cases proceed through the appeals procedure.</p>

  <p>Procedural hearings will be fixed for all new solemn appeals progressively over the next few months. The first diet of hearings will take place this September, with cases that are ready to proceed to a full hearing coming before the Appeal Court before the end of the year. There are no plans to increase the overall number of judges at the present time.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Court Service (SCS) notify the police in those cases where bail is granted to an accused person and a further condition, or conditions, is imposed in addition to the standard conditions irrespective of the type of offence.

  <p>I assume this is a reference to the investigative tribunals held under section 9 of the Bail, Judicial Appointments etc (Scotland) Act 2000. The Justice of the Peace (Tribunal) (Scotland) Regulations 2001 require these tribunals to sit in private for reasons of confidentiality. The tribunals are required to investigate whether a bench-sitting justice of the peace is unfit for office by reason of inability, neglect of duty or misbehaviour. Since such investigation might well extend to the private life of the justice it would not be appropriate to make the sittings of the tribunal public and the Executive has no plans to amend the regulations to that end.</p>

  <p>We have already issued guidance to the care agencies on the organisation of psychological intervention services which are designed around talking treatments that encourage self help as part of the treatment and support options.</p>

  <p>Local authorities have a key role in implementing the National Cultural Strategy. Following publication of the strategy in August 2000, a Joint Working Group of the Executive and COSLA was formed to develop good practice guidance for local authorities in relevant responsibilities. I am pleased to announce that <i>Implementation of the National Cultural Strategy: Guidance for Scottish Local Authorities</i> has been published for consultation by the Executive today. This is being sent to all local authorities, COSLA, cultural agencies and other interested organisations. Comments are invited by 13 January 2003.

  <p>Planning authorities can choose to deal with minerals extraction either as part of a comprehensive Local Plan or (usually in areas with significant minerals extraction activity) as a Minerals Subject Local Plan. The former North East Fife District Council adopted a Minerals Subject Local Plan in 1994. Four councils - East Ayrshire (for opencast coal only), Scottish Borders, Fife and South Lanarkshire &#8211; are all currently producing minerals subject local plans.</p>

  <p>Local authorities must take account of all the relevant interests at a number of key stages during plan preparation. A public local inquiry must be held if there are unresolved objections. The reporter&#8217;s recommendations are then sent to the planning authority for consideration. The Scottish ministers must be given formal notice when the authority intends to adopt the plan. Such notification is primarily for information. The Executive can decide to intervene although its general policy is that local planning matters are primarily the responsibility of planning authorities.</p>

  <p>The statutory requirements for plan preparation are set out in the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 and the Town and Country Planning (structure and Local Plans) (Scotland) Regulations 1983. Scottish Development Department Circular 32/1983 describes the general principles that the Scottish ministers consider should be taken into account when preparing plans. A copy of this Circular is available in the Parliament's Reference Centre (Bib. number 23755). National Planning Policy Guidelines (NPPGs) indicate to planning authorities a range of issues to be taken into account in the preparation of Development Plans. The relevance of any particular national planning policy issue will depend on the circumstances prevailing in any particular local authority area.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Retoxification of opiate addicts prior to release occurs only in a very small number of prisoners who have lost their tolerance to opiates while in custody and who, despite our best efforts, are intent on reverting to their old pattern of drug misuse upon liberation. This group are at risk of overdose and possibly drug-related death, and in many cases, have overdosed previously.</p>

  <p>No formal studies of retoxification have been undertaken.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Because the answer given to question S1W-27013 referred to an earlier response to question S1W-26061, performance points were converted back to ensure that the details of the number of assaults in each category were correct. Neither the raw data available on each incident nor the overall number of performance points incurred in respect of Schedule F for each period gave the response to the question which was asked.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>When a prisoner tests positive for more than one substance, the application of multiple disciplinary offences is not in the SPS&#8217;s view helpful in encouraging individuals to give up drugs. Treating a positive test for more than one substance as a single event for the purposes of applying performance points is consistent with this approach.</p>

  <p>In selecting new members for the board of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), we seek to produce a balance of backgrounds and experience to bring together a board which covers all aspects of the agency&#8217;s work and the various groups it deals with. While the appointments process is based on assessing skills and experience of candidates, the Executive recognises the importance of achieving balanced representation from across Scotland. Three previous members of the SEPA Board were based in the Highlands and Islands and I hope that suitable candidates from the area will emerge from current and future rounds of appointments.</p>

  <p>As well as the main board, SEPA also has a network of three regional boards; the North and West Region Boards include representatives from the Highlands and Islands.</p>

  <p>One representation was received recently about the prosecution rate in such cases in one area; we will reply shortly. Victims in such cases sometimes make representations where they are dissatisfied with the decision in the case which involves them. However, except where there is a clear and irremediable insufficiency of evidence (so that prosecution would be unlawful), decisions in rape and other serious sexual assault cases, as in other types of very serious crime, are taken by Crown Counsel and not by procurators fiscal.</p>

  <p>The regulation and control of medicines is reserved.</p>

  <p>The Medicines Control Agency has advised that the only vaccines in the routine UK childhood immunisation programme which contain thiomersal as an excipient in the final product are diphtheria, tetanus, wholecell pertussis (DTwP) and diphtheria and tetanus vaccines.</p>

  <p>In September 2001, the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) reviewed the available data relating to possible neurotoxicity of thiomersal in vaccines and advised that there is no evidence of harm caused by doses of thiomersal in vaccines, except for hypersensitivity reactions. The CSM concluded that the risk:benefit balance of thiomersal-containing vaccines remains overwhelmingly positive.</p>

  <p>Information about thiomersal in vaccines was provided in a letter issued to NHSScotland in November 2001 from the Chief Medical Officer, the Chief Nursing Officer and the Chief Pharmaceutical Officer. A copy of the letter has been placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 23701).</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive <a name="QuestionText">how Scottish Water has re-prioritised its investment programme following the recent contamination of water supplies by the cryptospiridium bacterium.</a></p>

  <p>The Cryptosporidium Directions required Scottish Water to carry out a risk assessment on all its supplies and introduced sampling appropriate to the assessed risk. The Drinking Water Quality Regulator (DWQR) audits the requirements of the directions annually. Following the recent events in Glasgow and Edinburgh I have asked the DWQR to carry out a review of the detailed workings of the directions. The outcome of this review will be available in about two months. In the meantime, my initial assessment is that the investment priorities for 2002-06 given in the Quality and Standards paper published in August 2001 were broadly correct.</p>
