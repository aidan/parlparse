<ques id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-09-25.S1W-28916.q0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80186" speakername="Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP)" spid="S1W-28916" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0925.htm#1" holdingdate="2002-09-18">

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, with regard to paragraph 1.10 of the <em>Draft Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Bill: Partial Regulatory Impact Assessment</em> , on what basis it determined that an absolute right to buy for tenant farmers could result in a legal challenge under the European Convention of Human Rights unless it compensated landlords for the cost of lost investment and how it calculated the exemplified total cost of such investment.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-09-25.S1W-28916.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80155" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0925.htm#se_Minister">

  <p>The Executive believes that the creation of an absolute right to buy could result in landowners incurring loss in the value of their assets. We also believe that a court of law might view provisions introducing an absolute right to buy as amounting to an interference of the enjoyment of the landlord&#8217;s possessions.</p>

  <p>As such, the provisions would be unlikely to comply with the provisions of Article 1 of the First Protocol to the European Convention of Human Rights if the Executive did not also ensure that landlords were reasonably compensated for their losses.</p>

  <p>Blight on the property would arise from the creation of the absolute right to buy because it would materially affect the private right of a landowner to determine how long they owned, used and obtained income from that holding. We believe the price a potential purchaser would be prepared to pay for such a holding would decrease in such a situation. This would reduce its value to the existing landlord.</p>

  <p>A cost of the order of &#163;100 million was estimated initially by the Land Policy Review Group in 1998. It was used to illustrate the likely scale of compensation involved. While we cannot exactly quantify the extent to which an absolute right to buy could depress land values (as the group could not), we estimate that each reduction of 1% in the &quot;marriage value&quot; of holdings with traditional secure tenancies could attract a potential compensation bill of around &#163;20 million. This is based upon estimates of the area of land under traditional secure tenancy arrangement and appropriate average land valuations. The actual figure may be higher, depending upon the fall in value experienced and the type of tenant eligible to exercise the absolute right to buy (e.g. if general partners in a limited partnership holding a secure tenancy were included).</p>

  <p>We believe that the costs of compensating a landowner would fall to the Executive following the creation of an absolute right to buy. While it might theoretically only fall to be paid when the landowner chose to realise the value of his or her asset or when a tenant chose to exercise the right, the blight would cover all affected land, even if a tenant did not seek to exercise this right. When the landowner&#8217;s loss fell to be paid, it could not be transferred to tenants who did not wish to exercise their absolute right to buy. We believe it could also be very difficult if not impossible to devise a mechanism which transferred the landlord&#8217;s loss to a tenant exercising this right in a way that guaranteed, over a long period of time, that landowners would be adequately compensated for the loss in their asset value without this being reflected in the price a purchasing tenant might have to pay. It is also worth noting that the tenant could have to pay for any transaction costs incurred by a landlord selling against his or her will as well as for any injurious affection.</p>

  <p>The annual accounts for the financial year 31 March 2002 will contain the equivalent information for that financial year. These amounts are not included within the Scottish Executive Balance Sheet: since the liabilities are, by definition, contingent they do not meet the definition of liabilities to be reflected on balance sheet. This accounting treatment is in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 12 as applied to the Scottish Executive by the Resource Accounting Manual.</p>

  <p>The Food Standards Agency is preparing a Regulatory Impact Assessment, which will provide a clear assessment of the likely effect of these proposals.

  <p>The algorithms are a copyrighted product used under licence by NHS 24 and are not widely available. NHS 24 involved Scottish clinicians in an extensive programme of structured review and adaptation of the algorithms in 2001. NHS 24 also arranges for clinicians to view the system on which the algorithms sit as required, and will share specific examples in order to gain clinical confidence in the algorithms and the decision support system used by it.

  <p>The algorithms, or series of logically structured questions, were initially developed by an American clinical software company. During 2001, NHS 24 involved Scottish clinicians in an extensive programme of structured review and adaptation of the algorithms, known as the &quot;Airth Process&quot;.</p>

  <p>The Clinical Standards Board for Scotland (CSBS) was informed of the detail of the &quot;Airth Process&quot; and acknowledged the process as an example of good practice. This process involved a clinical review of the algorithms by some 50 practising clinicians, including doctors, nurses, pharmacists, dentists, surgeons, accident and emergency consultants, paediatricians and other specialists, to incorporate best evidence or best practice where it existed, including reference to Scottish Intercollegiate Guidance Network guidelines. The review meetings took place in a structured manner allowing clinicians to concentrate on ensuring the algorithms were appropriately adapted to the Scottish clinical situation.</p>

  <p>NHS 24 is also implementing a quality strategy plan to demonstrate, among other things, the clinical effectiveness of its processes and is discussing with CSBS how an external review process should be put in place.</p>

  <p>NHS 24 is a confidential service for the public. The confidentiality extends to the standard NHS interpretation of "confidentiality" and all clinical and other patient information is bound by standard NHS confidentiality regulations. All patients are asked, in every consultation, whether they consent to information being passed on to their GP or other relevant service in order for them to obtain further care. If a patient requests that the information should not be transferred, then this will be respected.</p>

  <p>However, there are clearly situations where patients or others may be at significant risk &#8211; for example, where issues of child protection arise. Under these circumstances information may require to be shared among the social, health care or police services contrary to the patient's expressed wish. These circumstances are extremely rare and NHS 24 staff are trained in order to both recognise and deal with these situations in a sensitive and professional manner.</p>

  <p>There is no fundamental incompatibility. However, a basic distinction may be drawn between the adaptation for contemporary use of an occupied historic building and the restoration of a ruinous ancient monument. In the former case, where the historic interest may lie primarily in its architectural design, there generally need be no fundamental incompatibility between the adaptation of the building and our ability to interpret its historic interest. However, in the case of a ruinous structure, where the interest may be more likely to lie in our ability to document its historic importance and use, the very act of restoration may hide the evidence that allows the building&#8217;s structural history to be interpreted by visitors. By way of example, people living in a restored medieval castle do not normally wish to live within bare walls, but to cover these with plaster: this hides important evidence for the structural history of the building.</p>

  <p>Listed building consent is required for the alteration or extension of a listed building in any manner that would affect its character as a building of special architectural or historic interest. Scottish Executive policy on listed building consent is set out in the <em>Memorandum of Guidance on listed buildings and conservation areas</em> . Over 2,500 listed buildings receive listed building consent each year. The restoration of a scheduled ancient monument is subject to different procedures and restoration may remove a standing structure&#8217;s scheduled status.</p>

  <p>Every alteration to or restoration of a historic building has some positive and some negative effects on the preservation of historic fabric and our appreciation of it. The decision on whether or not to restore has to weigh these in the balance.</p>

  <p>There are a range of examples of listed buildings and scheduled monuments being restored each year. Fenton Tower in East Lothian is a good example as it was both scheduled and listed (at Category A). The Tower is a late 16th century/early 17th century towerhouse standing in agricultural land near North Berwick. It had been missing its roof and floors since at least the 19th century and was typical of a wide range of similar structures in Scotland. Historic Scotland was involved in the restoration of Fenton Tower on behalf of Scottish ministers. Working closely with the project team, Historic Scotland gave extensive advice, granted scheduled monument and listed building consents for the works and grant-aided some of the costs of reinstatement of the historic fabric.</p>

  <p>Historic Scotland is an Executive Agency within the Scottish Executive&#8217;s Education Department and is directly accountable to Scottish ministers and, through them, to the Scottish Parliament. The agency&#8217;s Framework Document, which is agreed by Scottish ministers, sets out its role and responsibilities. All functions performed by the agency are carried out on behalf of Scottish ministers.</p>

  <p>Legislation governing Scotland&#8217;s built heritage either empowers or places a duty on Scottish ministers, who then direct Historic Scotland to meet all aspects of their built heritage functions.</p>

  <p>The main legislation under which Historic Scotland acts, on behalf of Scottish ministers, is as follows:</p>

  <p>Historic Buildings and Ancient Monuments Act 1953;</p>

  <p>Protection of Wrecks Act 1973;</p>

  <p>Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979, and</p>

  <p>Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) (Scotland) Act 1997</p>

  <p>The agency&#8217;s work will also be guided by the Valetta Convention to which the UK Government has subscribed.</p>

  <p>I have asked Graeme Munro, Chief Executive of Historic Scotland to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Historic Scotland has no plans to mark and identify the tombs of former Scottish Kings, including Malcolm Canmore, Edgar, Alexander I, David I, Alexander II, Alexander III and Robert II. Alexander II is buried in Melrose Abbey, cared for by Historic Scotland on behalf of Scottish ministers, and this is noted in the official guidebook. Robert II is buried at Scone Abbey and the other kings mentioned are all buried in that part of Dunfermline Abbey which is not in the care of Historic Scotland.</p>

  <p>The judges referred to were appointed in 1989, 1987 and 1990 respectively. The Speculative Society was founded in 1764, and is a debating society for lawyers, advocates and other professionals. I did not consider it appropriate for ministers to take any interest in whether a particular judge may be a member of this society.</p>

  <p>Statutory responsibility for local libraries lies with local authorities. Each local authority is responsible for determining the level of resources allocated for the library service which they provide for the residents of their area. This includes the purchasing of books.</p>

  <p>In all cases the aim is to match care to assessed needs. This can involve a mix of hospital and community based care, as an individual's needs change. Where re-admission is required this is of course arranged. The aim overall is to provide the right care where and when it is needed in each case.</p>

  <p>There has been a planned reduction of in-patient beds, which reflects the policy of providing more care and support from community settings where this is appropriate. Information on hospital in-patient beds and patients admitted are provided in the following tables. The underlying reason for re-admissions cannot be identified.</p>

  <p>Planning policy regarding out-of-town retail development is to be found in <em>National Planning Policy Guideline (NPPG) 8: Town Centres and Retailing.</em> Through the use of a sequential approach, the policy contained in NPPG 8 gives priority to town centres for the location of new developments. While the policy does not exclude developments in other locations, they have to be subject to a rigorous examination, part of which includes the effect on existing town centres.</p>

  <p>Highland Council's proposed single allocation for non-housing capital will rise to &#163;23.2 million in financial year 2003-04, a cumulative increase over three years of 34.3%.

  <p>The Scottish Executive website is undergoing a programme of continuous development under the direction of the Web Editorial Board. The aim of this programme is to ensure that the website conforms to the Framework for Information Age Government Websites and adheres to the best practice guidance for government websites promulgated by the Office of the e-Envoy.</p>

  <p>A new search engine for the website is due to be implemented by the end of October. This will significantly enhance the present search facilities.</p>

  <p>The news section of the website has been significantly redeveloped over the last year, introducing additional features such as the Junior Executive pages and the use of multimedia. A news archive is also in operation and we plan, early next year, to integrate the current archive for First Minister&#8217;s Questions, Media Briefings and Weekly Review material with the news archive. From November, we also plan to begin introducing new topic page sections and topic mini-home pages to aid navigation through the website. These will be based on themes rather than on departmental portfolios, and will link to the current news and publication listings on the website.</p>

  <p>The functionality for searching publications has recently been improved through a facility to order them by date, subject and title headings. There is also a keyword search facility and users can browse by subject, display the most recent publications, and order publications by title.

  <p>The Scottish Crime Survey asks about all incidents of personal victimisation. Household surveys such as the Scottish Crime Survey are not, however, ideal for picking up sensitive information such as sexual victimisations. The small number of incidents picked up by the Scottish Crime Survey are not, therefore, published as they would be likely to provide misleading estimates.</p>

  <p>Crimes of a sexual nature reported to and recorded by the police are published annually in the Scottish Executive Statistical Bulletin on Recorded Crime in Scotland. Research suggests, however, that not all incidents will be reported to the police.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will issue new guidelines to local authorities restricting the signing of contracts for the disposal of waste through landfill or incineration.</p>

  <p>In general, local authorities are independent corporate bodies whose powers and duties are set out in statute law. Within the law they are free to exercise discretion in carrying out their functions and managing their day-to-day business. Ministers cannot intervene, except in particular circumstances where the law specifies that they may do so.</p>

  <p>However, in respect of waste management, the Executive expects authorities to take full account of the National Waste Strategy in their operations. The Executive will only provide grant support from the Strategic Waste Fund to authorities that intend to implement waste practices that accord with Area Waste Plans. Hence the Executive would not expect authorities to enter into contracts for landfill and incineration which are not in line with the relevant plans.</p>

  <p>In order to ensure that the amount of waste sent to landfill is reduced, the Executive intends to introduce a system of landfill allowances for Scottish local authorities and plans to issue a consultation paper on this shortly. The proposal is that authorities will only be permitted to landfill the amount of biodegradable municipal waste for which they have allowances.</p>

  <p>This is a matter for Scottish Water. I have asked the Chief Executive of Scottish Water to respond. The Chief Executive's response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Scottish Water does not maintain comparative information on staffing of the former authorities and Scottish Water in the form and to the level of detail asked. At 1 April 2002, when Scottish Water took over from the former authorities, 2,222 staff were transferred in from the West of Scotland Water Authority, 1,558 from the east, and 1,632 from the north. Since then Scottish Water has been gradually integrating its workforce into its own management structure. At 31 August the equivalent numbers serving in the areas covered by the former authorities were 2,090 in the west, 1,551 in the east, and 1,556 in the north.</p>

  <p>This is a matter for Scottish Water. I have asked the Chief Executive of Scottish Water to respond. The Chief Executive&#8217;s response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Agricultural College (SAC) report advised that 80 per cent of the estimated potential numbers of cryptosporidium oocysts entering the Katrine water supply system during high risk periods were associated with all wild and farm animals in the catchment area of Loch Katrine, Loch Arklet and Glen Finglas reservoir. This covers a land mass of some 27,000 acres.</p>

  <p>In addition, there is potential risk of contamination associated with the 11 farms that carry out agricultural activities along the 26-mile route of the aqueducts from Loch Katrine down to the Milngavie water treatment works.</p>

  <p>Scottish Water has held meetings with landowners to discuss possible changes in farming practice to try to reduce risk as far as possible. In addition, a number of the recommendations made by the Scottish Agricultural College (SAC) for improvements to farm and water management have been implemented. These include the removal of the sheep waste, installing fences to prevent grazing near the water and changes to the use of Loch Arklet and Glen Finglas reservoir.</p>

  <p>The SAC reviewed the actions taken and estimated that the potential movement of oocysts will be reduced by 95% or greater as a result of the actions taken.</p>

  <p>To build on the work from the SAC report we will look at any further viable risk minimisation measures to reduce the risk of cryptosporidium.</p>

  <p>Any further necessary works will be developed into an action plan. Scottish Water&#8217;s prime objective is to protect and provide clean, wholesome water to the 700,000 people of Greater Glasgow.</p>
