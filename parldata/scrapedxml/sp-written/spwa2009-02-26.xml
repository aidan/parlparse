  <p>The Scottish Government receives correspondence and calls from different sources from time to time on issues around the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2003 and the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003. We are not aware of any representations which cover both acts. A limited review of the Mental Health Act is in progress to consider its operation since implementation and advise on any changes, while recognising that its general powers and provisions continue to offer an appropriate framework for care and treatment. The findings will be reported in due course.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has worked with stakeholders since the introduction of the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000 to ensure as far as possible that the legislation works as intended to protect the interests of adults with incapacity. Codes of Practice and guidance were developed with stakeholders, including the Law Society of Scotland. Revised versions were published in April 2007 following changes made in the Adult Support and Protection (Scotland) Act 2007. The publications are available on the Scottish Government website at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Justice/law/awi/010408awiwebpubs" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Justice/law/awi/010408awiwebpubs</a>.</p>

  <p>There is no guidance specifically aimed at community health partnerships. NHS boards are supervisory bodies under part 4 of the act and the Code of Practice for Supervisory Bodies was published and distributed in July 2003. The Office of the Public Guardian is in regular contact with the Committee of Scottish Clearing Bankers.</p>

  <p>The Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000 is designed to protect all adults who lack the capacity to act or to make some or all decisions for themselves. Since its introduction, the provisions of the act have been kept under review to help ensure that the legislation works as intended. A two year project to monitor implementation of the act, funded by the Scottish Executive, resulted in a report in 2004, which clarified areas requiring legislative change to streamline and simplify procedures and improve access. A consultation exercise then took place on the proposed changes, and the Adult Support and Protection (Scotland) Act 2007 contained a number of changes to the 2000 act. Codes of practice and guidance on the provisions of the act were published in 2007 and are available from the Scottish Government, or online at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Justice/law/awi" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Justice/law/awi</a>.</p>

  <p>There are no plans to make further changes to the legislation at present.</p>

  <p>Sector Skills Councils (SSCs) are partly funded by UK Government and their primary role is to articulate employer skills needs through employer engagement and the production on Labour Market Intelligence.</p>

  <p>Our skills body, Skills Development Scotland, is working with SSCs (including People 1st who represent the hospitality and tourism sector), industry bodies and training providers to develop public skills interventions which better meet the needs of individuals and employers in Scotland.</p>

  <p>In response to the issues regarding qualifications highlighted in the Enterprise, Economy and Tourism Committee report, <em>Growing Pains &ndash; can we achieve a 50% growth in tourist revenue by 2015 </em>the Scottish Government set up a short life Education and Training Tourism task group to establish sector needs and recommend a way forward. Membership is drawn from industry, training providers, national agencies and the Scottish Government. The task group will examine the issue of proliferation of qualifications, the purpose of hotel schools and will explain the role of public sector bodies in the education and training system.</p>

  <p>Our new Energy Assistance Package, which we will put in place from April, has four stages which in practice may run concurrently. Stages 1 and 2 will provide energy efficiency advice to all comers and benefits entitlement checks to a wide range of clients at risk of fuel poverty. Stage 3 will ensure installation of standard insulation measures to eligible households under the Carbon Emission Reduction Target programmes run by energy companies. Stage 4 will offer a package of enhanced energy efficiency measures to the most vulnerable - those living in energy inefficient housing in the private sector who are either older pensioner households, low income pensioner households or low income households with a child under 5 or a disabled child under 16, and to all private sector pensioner households who have never had a central heating system.</p>

  <p>We plan to offer at stage 4 replacement LPG heating systems to those already using this fuel if that is their preference rather than electric storage or air source heat pumps.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The ratio is calculated by dividing the number (head count) of NHS salaried and non-salaried dentists by the number of registered NHS patients as at 31 March 1999-2008.</p>

  <p>2. Local authority area is defined using the postcode of the dental practice where the patient is registered, not the postcode of the patient.</p>

  <p>3. A dentist may enter into more than one arrangement with an NHS board if he/she has more than one practice in the area, or enter into an arrangement with more than one NHS board if he/she practises in more than one NHS board area. As a result, the sum of the number of dentists in each NHS board area, and therefore in each local authority area, exceeds the number of dentists practising in Scotland.</p>

  <p>We know from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) 2008 that the gender pay gap for Scotland is currently 13.5%, based on the average (or mean) hourly earnings for full-time staff (defined as working over 30 hours per week). The median figure is nearly 11%. This shows a slight decrease in the pay gap from 2007 when equivalent figures were almost 15% and 12%.</p>

  <p>If we compare the hourly earnings of women working part-time with those of men working full-time, the gap is just over 32% (based on the average or mean) and almost 35% based on the median. Again, this shows a decrease from 2007 when equivalent figures were 34.5% and 37.5%.</p>

  <p>Scottish public bodies with more than 150 employees, including Scottish Government, were required to publish an equal pay statement that sets out their policy on equal pay between men and women by September 2007, and report against the statement - and review the statement - at least every three years. (specific public sector duty under the Gender Equality Duty). The first reports are due in September 2010.</p>

  <p>One of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s gender equality objectives is to tackle the gender pay gap/ work towards equal pay, as detailed in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Gender Equality Scheme and Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 47696).</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises that a key issue for understanding and tackling the pay gap is occupational segregation. The cross-directorate working group on occupational segregation published its report on the Scottish Government website in August 2008 and the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 47697). <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/08/27101332/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/08/27101332/0</a>.</p>

  <p>There is no immediate threat to the operation of the fire and rescue services. The Scottish Government recognise the vital work of our Fire and Rescue Services across Scotland and especially the contribution of those firefighters on the Retained Duty System who provide a vital, flexible and cost effective community role in Scotland, particularly for those citizens living in our rural, remote and island communities. Therefore while this issue is a reserved matter, the Scottish Government are firmly committed to making the case for retention of the opt-out. My officials are working in partnership with colleagues in the UK Government to ensure that MEPs and EU member states are briefed appropriately.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Funding Council classify a full time course as &quot;courses with at least 720 planned hours within one academic year&quot; for further education (non-advanced) and &quot;at least 480 planned hours within one academic year&quot; for higher education (advanced) courses.</p>

  <p>With regards to council tax collection, an individual is generally classed as a full time student and therefore exempt from paying council tax if they are undertaking a course of study for at least 24 weeks of each academic year and requiring at least 21 hours of study, tuition or work experience in each of these weeks.</p>

  <p>The Caledonia television advertisement forms part of a comprehensive marketing programme that is promoting Homecoming Scotland 2009. &pound;112,061 has been spent purchasing television advertising to promote Homecoming in Scotland. Assessments show that 2.1 million people in Scotland saw the advertisement around St Andrew&rsquo;s Day 2008 and 1.9 million people saw it around Burns Night 2009.</p>

  <p>&pound;131,020 has been spent purchasing television advertising to promote Homecoming in the rest of the UK. 400,000 people in Northern Ireland saw the advertisement around Burns Night 2009. In March the advertisement will be seen by approximately six million people in England and one million in Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p>

  <p>The Caledonia television advertisement also forms one element of the Homecoming marketing activity across the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand which has seen investment of &pound;1.3 million over the past 18 months. The most significant media investment has been online which delivers far superior value in terms of reach, response and targeting than any other media platform. &pound;56,206 has been spent purchasing television advertising to promote Homecoming in the US. Between 21 and 30 January seven million people in North America saw the advertisement and a version will play again in the US on the US public &quot;free-to-air&quot; channel PBS during &quot;Highland Heartbeat&quot;, a popular Scottish music entertainment programme. There are 350 PBS channels across the US, with audiences in the tens of millions anticipated.</p>

  <p>Yes. The expenditure on advertising the Year of Homecoming on television outwith Scotland is ensuring the Homecoming message is reaching many millions of people in some of our key tourism markets. Television advertising forms part of a comprehensive marketing programme but the most effective media channel in terms of targeting genuine potential visitors has been shown to be online. This is where the vast majority of the investment is being made.</p>

  <p>No target has been set for the number of jobs created or secured from Homecoming events in 2009. However, based on the target to deliver an additional &pound;40 million in tourism revenue and using the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Input-Output Model for 2004, analysis indicates that this expenditure on tourism would normally equate to the development of approximately 1,000 jobs across all sectors.</p>

  <p>We have a specific timetabled target for NHS boards, linked to the GMS contract, to achieve improvements in the early diagnosis and management of patients with dementia by March 2011. The Mental Health Collaborative is supporting NHS boards in this work and has produced a toolkit designed to analyse their dementia services from the perspective of those using the service.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are also introducing standards for integrated care pathways (Bib. number 44374) for those with dementia to ensure the right care is available at the right time.</p>

  <p>NHS Education for Scotland has also recently commissioned the Dementia Services Development Centre to design and deliver training to support early interventions. By the summer, 40 nurses and Allied Health Professionals from across Scotland will have completed this training.</p>

  <p>We are also investing &pound;600,000 in our work with Alzheimer Scotland and the Dementia Services Development Centre to develop better structured intervention, support and information services immediately following first diagnosis. This work will further develop our understanding of how we can best offer these services in a way that meets the needs of patients and carers in an understanding and sensitive manner.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises the impact that caring for someone with dementia can have on the carer and family. Under the GMS contract, GPs are paid to maintain a register for those with dementia and undertake an annual review assessment. These reviews are expected to address the support needs of the individual with dementia as well as the information needs of those caring for that person and the impact of caring on the carer.</p>

  <p>Through the Scottish Enhanced Services programme, eight NHS boards have developed enhanced services for carers, including those families looking after patients with dementia. Participating GP practices in these areas provide an enhanced care package that includes better identification of carers, assessment of health and support needs and signposting or direct referral to carer support services.</p>

  <p>We are also investing &pound;9 million to support NHS boards in implementing their Carer Information Strategies. These strategies are supporting real improvements in carer identification, and the provision of carer information and training. This can include the provision of information and training on caring for someone with dementia. In continuing to recognise the importance respite can play for the carer and cared for, we are working closely with COSLA to deliver the concordat commitment to deliver an additional 10,000 respite weeks. And have provided an additional &pound;4 million to enable local authorities to deliver this commitment by 2011.</p>

  <p>NHS Health Scotland and Alzheimer Scotland have also made widely available their updated booklet &quot;<em>coping with dementia</em> A practical handbook for carers&quot; (Bib. number 47699) providing information and advice for people who care for someone with dementia.</p>

  <p>GPs as independent contractors are expected to identify and address their own education needs throughout their careers. GPs are also expected to follow national clinical guidelines on the management of patient with dementia, which includes diagnosis (Bib. number 47786).</p>

  <p>They are supported in this by NHS boards, for example through the Protected Learning Time initiatives which allows supported time for training. They also have access to a range of education and training materials in different formats and media. Directors of GP Post Graduate Education; NHS Education for Scotland; The Royal College of General Practitioners; NHS elibrary services; specialist colleagues; are amongst those available to help and advise GPs on resources for diagnosis support, and education and training to meet their development needs.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s &pound;60 million Town Centre Regeneration Fund will be available in 2009-10 to support our town centres and local high streets. We are currently working on the details of the Fund, and will shortly be entering into discussions with stakeholders. We anticipate full details of the scheme will be announced by the end of March 2009.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises the importance of tackling chlamydia and is committed to breaking the cycles of transmission and reducing its prevalence in those under the age of 25.</p>

  <p>The recent Quality Improvement Scotland Standard on sexual health and young people - available online at <a href="http://www.nhshealthquality.org/nhsqis/files/sexualhealth_july2007.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.nhshealthquality.org/nhsqis/files/sexualhealth_july2007.pdf</a> -</p>

  <p>sets out a target to increase chlamydia testing in under 25s. This includes a specific target to increase the number of young men being offered a test. Every young person who visits a sexual health service is asked if they have put themselves at risk and, if so, offered a test.</p>

  <p>In addition, health boards are responsible for putting in place a range of measures which will reach young people in their local area and many are taking innovative approaches to reach young men, such as postal testing kits which can be given directly to young men or to a young woman to pass on to their partner.</p>
