  <p>The key factor in the overall outcome of an emergency ambulance service intervention is the time taken for the crew to reach a patient and to begin providing treatment &ndash; the response time. The Ambulance Service reviews constantly the patterns of emergency demand in relation to the location of vehicles and crews and seeks to optimise location to reduce response times. Clearly, factors such as road congestion at particular times of day, road works etc can impact on response times. It is not possible to quantify this impact. In an emergency situation an ambulance which is caught up in congestion can use visual and audible warning systems to make progress. Predictable heavy congestion or known delays such as road works can be factored into route planning by ambulance crews, on the advice of ambulance control. In exceptional circumstances ambulance control may advise crews to divert to an alternative hospital or to the nearest one.</p>

  <p>Before the implementation of the Clinical Trials Directive, studies in healthy volunteers did not require regulatory approval. The Edinburgh Independent Ethics Committee was awarded type (i) recognition by UKECA. This recognition covers the committee to review Phase 1 trials in healthy volunteers.</p>

  <p>As with most committees recognised to review Phase 1 trials, this is not an NHS committee and therefore is not subject to NHS governance arrangements.</p>

  <p>For an interim period, non NHS committees reviewing trials in healthy volunteers are exempt from the detailed requirements laid down in the regulations. They have until 1 May 2005 to comply with these requirements.</p>

  <p>The 2004-05 marketing budget for the Museum of Flight is &pound;80,000.

The strategy aims to increase visits to the Museum of Flight from about 60,000 each year to 120,000 each year, over the next three years. In the three month period April to June 2004, visits to the museum increased by 62% (13,751 to 22,321).</p>

  <p>Information relating to funding for specific initiatives is not available centrally. NHS boards receive general allocations and it is for them to apportion these accordingly.</p>

  <p>In 2004-05, NHS Orkney received a general allocation of &pound;28.86 million from which funding for GP out-of-hours services, the new consultant contract, European Working Time Directive compliance and the implementation of Agenda for Change will be derived.</p>

  <p>I apologise if my earlier reply on this matter was not clear. Let me clarify. The Scottish Executive has provided &pound;695,192 to support and increase the engagement of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual people in the life of Scotland. This figure includes the grant of &pound;512,000 for the Equality Network which was announced in March 2004. The breakdown of funding to organisations is as follows:</p>

  <p>Section 20 (1) (a) of the Deer (Scotland) Act 1996 provides that any person who discharges any firearm or discharges or projects any missile from any moving vehicle at any deer shall be guilty of an offence. In addition to specific exceptions, Section 20 is subject to section 14 of the Act which provides exemption for Deer Commission for Scotland staff (and those with DCS authorisation) in relation to action in respect of a control agreement, control scheme or section 10 action. DCS has never made use of that exemption.</p>
