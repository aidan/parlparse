  <p>The Scottish Executive is aware of Argyll and Bute Council&rsquo;s expenditure on community care services. Grant Aided Expenditure is neither a budget nor a spending target but a needs based method for apportioning funding to local authorities. It is for Argyll and Bute Council to allocate funding according to their local priorities, taking account of their statutory obligations. However, I have met the council twice to stress the importance I attach to the effective delivery of community care services, and the role of the joint improvement team has been extended to help the council and health board partners secure improved delivery of these services.</p>

  <p>The joint improvement team has been working with Argyll and Bute Council and NHS Highland on developing their strategic governance and local management arrangements to help address the challenges of providing for the needs of elderly residents. In addition, the Social Work Inspection Agency is currently inspecting Argyll and Bute Council&rsquo;s social work services and the inspection report will provide an indication of service quality together with any recommendations the council will need to address.</p>

  <p>I am closely monitoring the position and will consider using powers in relation to joint working by local authorities and health boards or powers of direction in relation to the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 if required.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what information it has about the number of (a) foreign and (b) UK registered fishing vessels apprehended and escorted into Scottish ports by Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency vessels because of fishing offences in each of the last 10 years, and what range of penalties was imposed in the sheriff courts where the skippers of these vessels were convicted of illegal practices.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2007-02-20.S2W-31788.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80032" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-07/wa0220.htm#5">

  <p>The Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency does not keep a specific record of when fishing vessels are escorted to port. When an infringement is detected at sea it is sometimes necessary to escort a vessel to port to secure the necessary evidence for any subsequent court proceedings. In cases involving foreign nationals, escort to and detention in port, is necessary to ensure an accused person is available to answer in court to any charges that are brought as a result of the agency&rsquo;s investigations.</p>

  <p>The breakdown of foreign and UK registered vessels prosecuted for fisheries infringements, and the range of fines imposed by the courts in these cases, in each of the last 10 years is shown in the following table. It should be noted that the agency records on prosecutions statistics are kept by the financial year and reported as such in the agency&rsquo;s annual report.</p>

  <p>There are 17 exemptions to the disclosure of information provided for in the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002. The Executive has used all but one of these exemptions - Audit Functions - as and when appropriate to the particular request.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Total number of patients ready for discharge, in all specialties, reported as at October 2006 census.</p>

  <p>2. Number of patients ready for discharge with a duration of over six weeks (43 days or more), i.e. the common period for discharge planning agreement timescales across Scotland.</p>

  <p>3. The figures in the table exclude patients whose principal reason for delay at the census point was due to awaiting place/bed availability in a specialist residential facility where no facilities exist, or due to requirements of the Adults with Incapacity Act. Prior to the April 2003 census awaiting place or bed availability where no appropriate facilities exist were included under awaiting place or bed availability. Therefore cannot be taken out of the census totals prior to April 2003 census. Prior to the July 2004 census Adults with Incapacity Act were included under legal issues. Therefore cannot be taken out of the census totals prior to July 2004 census.</p>

  <p>4. It is not possible to supply target information for 2002-03 or 2003-04 as these were not percentage targets nor broken down by local authority areas.</p>

  <p>The Delayed Discharge Action Plan, published in March 2002, set a national target of a reduction of 1,000 in delayed discharges across Scotland, by April 2003. For April 2004, partnerships agreed targets with the department, based on local circumstances. For 2004-05 and 2005-06, partnerships were expected to achieve a 20% reduction across the board.</p>

  <p>All of these targets were agreed at health board area level and are not broken down by local authority area.</p>

  <p>Argyll and Bute did make significant reductions in delayed discharges in 2003-04 and again in 2004-05. However, their performance in 2005-06 has been poor and we have had significant engagement with the council over recent months to secure improved performance.</p>

  <p>The NHSScotland Resource Allocation Committee is working to a timetable whereby it will report its recommendations to ministers by the end of June 2007.</p>

  <p>Over the months of July, August and September 2006, the committee undertook a consultation based on the research it had commissioned in the previous year to determine how the Arbuthnott Formula could be improved and refined. This included research into population measurement and demography; the resource allocation adjustment for health care needs due to morbidity and life circumstances and other factors, and the excess costs of supplying healthcare services including the remoteness adjustment within the formula. As part of the consultation process the committee also ran three regional workshops in Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Clydebank for interested parties.</p>

  <p>The committee recently published on its website, <a href="http://www.nrac.scot.nhs.uk" target="_blank">http://www.nrac.scot.nhs.uk</a>, the consultation responses and the analysis of the responses along with a paper summarising the analytical work plan for the final post-consultation phase of its work.</p>

  <p>Administrative staff make an invaluable contribution to the operation of the health service, organising services in a way which provides equitable access to the highest possible levels of sustainable quality care and ensuring that the patient&rsquo;s journey through the system is made as smooth as possible, for example through effective management of patient records and efficient scheduling of appointments.</p>

  <p>Over the years, the way administrative staff figures have been collected has changed, so it is difficult to compare from year to year. Administration costs are available prior to 1994-95, however, while they identify staffing numbers, they do not include the costs associated with them, therefore they have not been included in the following table. The figures for 1994-95 to 1997-98 includes management and administration staff working in NHS trusts and board &quot;headquarter&quot; employees. From 1998-99 onwards, the figures are for &quot;administrative and clerical&quot; staff employed in trusts and boards.</p>

  <p>Staff classified as &quot;administrative and clerical&quot; include health promotion workers, medical secretaries and clinical governance officers. Despite their classification, staff in these areas would not normally be considered as administrators.</p>

  <p>In order to establish context, the following table also shows these costs as a percentage of the overall NHS staff costs.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-30229 by Mr Andy Kerr on 6 February 2007, why there was a delay in giving a substantive answer to this question; what the median length of time is for giving substantive answers to parliamentary questions, and what the 10 longest delays were for in giving such answers during Session 2 of the Parliament.</p>

  <p>Additional time was needed in this case as a significant amount of work was on-going to develop appropriate guidance for NHS boards and health care professionals to ensure a consistent approach in support of the confirmed legal position. A copy of the guidance can be found on the SHOW website at <a href="http://www.sehd.scot.nhs.uk/cmo/CMO(2007)03.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.sehd.scot.nhs.uk/cmo/CMO(2007)03.pdf</a> .</p>

  <p>Parliamentary questions should normally be answered within 10 counting days of the question being lodged, where questions are tabled while the Parliament is in recess for more than four days, questions lodged during the two weeks before the start of recess and during the period of recess are allowed 20 counting days for answer. The length of time involved to provide answers does, however, depend on a number of factors.</p>

  <p>The total amounts paid in each year are given in the following table and cover the core Executive plus those agencies which use its payment system. The figures show the amounts allocated against the periodicals and stationery codes respectively.</p>

</table></p>

  <p>Note: *Figures for 2006 to 2007 year to date.</p>

  <p>With regards to payment for landscape gardening and flora I would refer the member to the answer to question S2W-31249 on 1 February 2007, which provides the relevant information for 2006-07. The corresponding figure for 2005-06 is comparable at &pound;37,000. Figures for the financial year 2004-05 are not available.</p>

  <p>All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="../../../webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a>.</p>
