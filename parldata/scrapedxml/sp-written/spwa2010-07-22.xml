  <p>In December 2008, NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS) published its report on a Clinical Audit of Care in Rheumatoid Arthritis (CARA), which was undertaken to help implement key recommendations in Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN) Guideline 48, and to identify any significant variations in the provision of care between individual clinical care teams, hospitals or NHS Boards.</p>

  <p>The audit identified important challenges in the delivery of high quality health care of patients with newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis relating to delays in access to specialist medical and Allied Health Professional care and drug therapy and to developing patient-centred outcomes. It made recommendations for further audit, and these are being taken forward by the Scottish Society for Rheumatology&rsquo;s<br /> web-based audit programme, supported by NHS QIS.</p>

  <p>Both the audit and the revised Guideline on RA are intended to help address variations in provision of care across Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Route Map is a long term strategy spanning 20 years. Our current priority is to develop an action plan and identify key milestones to support delivery of the Route Map. A report of progress will be published in 2013.</p>

  <p>In the meantime we are making progress in a number of areas to increase energy expenditure. For example, in June 2010 we published the first ever Cycling Action Plan for Scotland (CAPS), which outlines an overarching vision for a 10% modal share for cycling by 2020. It also sets out the Government&rsquo;s commitments to deliver the 17 actions and outcomes in the document and to work in partnership with key delivery agencies in delivering the outcomes. We will continue working on projects that increase road safety for cyclists, identify opportunities to include active travel into planning guidance and develop a robust delivery mechanism for cycle training in primary schools across the country.</p>

  <p>We are currently also working on a refresh of the National Transport Strategy which will be consulted on shortly. That refresh recognises the need to develop and promote the links between more active forms of travel and health generally.</p>

  <p>We have also launched Active Nation which aims to encourage people of all ages and abilities to become more physically active in the run up to the Commonwealth Games in 2014 and beyond.</p>

  <p>The protocol to be used in association with serial prescriptions will be generic. Scottish Government Medical and Pharmaceutical Officers are currently considering the development of the generic protocol.

  <p>While the Scottish government has no current plans to ban trans fats in hospital food, we do recognise it is vitally important that when people are in hospital their nutritional needs are a priority and a balanced diet is tailored to assist each person&rsquo;s recovery. Over 95% of NHS hospital canteens now have the Healthyliving Award which helps food outlets prepare and promote the sale of healthier food options to staff, visitors and patients.</p>

  <p>We are committed to working jointly with industry and retailers to make healthy choices easier for everyone. The food industry has successfully taken voluntary steps to reformulate many products and as a result the average intake of trans fats has been significantly reduced. However, we will keep our position under close review, actively monitoring outputs of ongoing work and new research, in Scotland, the UK and internationally.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has consulted with the Food Standards Agency (FSA) Scotland. FSA Scotland advise that there is no scientific evidence to suggest that take-away food outlets serve food with a disproportionately high trans fat content.</p>

  <p>Significant progress in implementing this part of the Framework by 2015 is being supported by the Scottish Government&rsquo;s investment of &pound;6.5 million over the next 3 years to increase the number of psychologists working in specialist CAMHS; and is complemented by an additional &pound;2 million per year &ndash; matched by NHS Boards &ndash; to enhance intensive community mental health services for this age group.</p>

  <p>In addition, statutory and voluntary partners are working to provide resources, support and advice to enable all of those working with children and young people - in all settings - to promote good mental health and wellbeing and provide counselling support.

  <p>A draft report on Applied Psychology and Psychology in the NHS in Scotland was circulated to Boards in December and discussed with NHS Chief Executives in April. The report identified key challenges and opportunities in the provision of psychology services for older people.

  <p>The NHS in Scotland has invested significantly in new ways of working to support the reduction in hours for doctors in training which has come as part of the implementation of the New Deal Contract and Working Time Regulations. Hospital at Night (H@N) has become the main focus of this, with investment in a multidisciplinary team working in the out of hours period providing care to the majority of inpatients within the hospital.</p>

  <p>Safe and effective handover is key to ensuring the success of H@N and shift working, the safety of patients and the quality of care received. As such, NHS Boards have reviewed handover procedures to ensure they are as safe and effective as possible, and some have invested in new technologies such as a the Salisbury Handover Tool to aid this. The Scottish Government has made all NHS boards aware of this tool, and of any good practice across the country.</p>

  <p>There is a significant amount of evidence which supports H@N as a safe and sustainable clinical model, and it is shown to improve the overall patient experience, improve clinical outcomes and reduce overall length of stay. Such is the success of H@N within NHS Scotland (and across the UK), it is now being extended to cover the daytime periods in a large number of areas across the country. More information on H@N can be found at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.healthcareworkforce.nhs.uk/hospitalatnightand247/" target="_blank">http://www.healthcareworkforce.nhs.uk/hospitalatnightand247/</a></p>

  <p>Training grade doctors are also complimentary of the H@N environment, stating that they feel supported within the team, with the necessary clinical support available at all times. There is again documented and published evidence (by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde) to show that H@N helps doctors in training achieve curriculum competencies at foundation year level.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what steps it is taking to ensure that shift working, particularly shifts arising from the implementation of the European working time directive, and the implementation of hospital at night schemes are not deleterious to patient safety and junior doctors&rsquo; health.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-07-22.S3W-35309.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80379" speakername="Shona Robison" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa0722.htm#10">

  <p>Both patient safety and staff welfare are critical issues for health boards and they are constantly seeking to improve both. All rotas are designed to meet the minimum contractual and legal guidelines around hours of work, rest and breaks which ensure that doctors are not over tired or unsafe to work. Our WTR Adviser also works with NHS Boards to review working patterns, ensuring that any pattern implemented meets the minimum standards required.</p>

  <p>The implementation of H@N has helped reduce the amount of out of hours work done by doctors in training, particularly during the night, with some posts now being required to work night shift one week in every six months. Previous to implementation of H@N, all specialty areas provided individual cover, which meant that night working was significantly higher in a large number of specialties than it is now. This reduction in night work means more time can be spent working in daytime hours.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government and NHS Scotland have implemented where possible the BMA&rsquo;s recommendations around splitting night shift working from a &quot;week of nights&quot; to two individual periods of &quot;four nights on and three nights on&quot; with extended periods of rest after each.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is also pursuing a policy of reshaping the medical workforce by moving to a health service predominantly delivered by trained doctors and to reduce the reliance on doctors in training for front-line service delivery. A trained doctor delivered service will ensure better health and higher quality healthcare services for patients resulting in improved patient outcomes and clinical safety. It also supports the continued development of excellence in medicine by giving us the opportunity to enhance the capacity of NHSScotland as a trained doctor&rsquo;s capacity to deliver is far greater than a doctor in training.</p>

  <p>These developments ensure that the welfare of doctors and the safety of patients is always a priority for NHSScotland boards.</p>
