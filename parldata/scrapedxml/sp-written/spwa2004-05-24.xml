  <p>Local authorities already have the powers within their environmental health responsibilities to deal with the nuisance caused by seagulls. In addition, the Scottish Executive already issue general licences to all local authorities which enable them to take action against Great Black-backed gulls, Lesser Black-backed gulls and Herring gulls in specific circumstances and for other gull species, individual licences can be sought from the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has also committed &#163;20,000 to a research project - Review of Urban Gulls and their Management in Scotland - to look at the issues raised by increasing seagull populations in towns and cities. The research is expected to be completed by early 2005 and is intended to provide a basis for new guidance to local authorities on best practice.</p>

  <p>In <em>A Partnership for a Better Scotland</em> , published in 2003, the Executive made a commitment to legislate on charity law. To take forward that commitment, I will shortly be publishing a draft charity bill for consultation. The draft bill will set out proposals for a Scottish definition of charity and the establishment of the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator as an independent statutory body with a wider range of powers. It is also intended to improve regulation of charity fundraising and accountability of charities to the public.</p>

  <p>Subject to the responses to the consultation on the draft bill, I hope to introduce legislation to the Parliament as soon as legislative time is available.</p>

  <p>It is NHS boards&#8217; responsibility to plan and provide services to meet the needs of their resident populations. However, as I advised in my answer to question S2O-2030 on 22 April, the Scottish Executive has established a national Child and Adolescent Mental Health Workforce Group to consider strategic workforce planning issues, and this met for the first time on 24 March. The group&#8217;s work will include an evaluation of current workforce data, identification of current gaps and future need, and identification of actions to address gaps. A project plan will then be produced to ensure implementation of identified actions, with clear timescales.</p>

  <p>I also mentioned on 22 April that the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Development Group is developing a &quot;template&quot; to support local service planning, a draft of which is expected to be published in the autumn. This will include services for vulnerable children and young people, such as those who are looked after.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to provide this information.</p>

  <p>Costs of prescribing by GPs and other medical professionals will depend on fees and remunerations which vary from area to area. The same principle applies to pharmacy costs, which are also negotiated locally. Costs will also be affected by the doses of methadone supplied to individuals, the duration of treatment, and other factors such as social care and counselling which often accompany substitute prescribing.</p>

  <p>Methadone is used as a treatment in many countries, and its benefits are supported by a substantial body of national and international research. Both the National Treatment Outcome Research Study and the early results from the Drug Outcome Research in Scotland study confirm the benefits from drug treatment, including methadone, in terms of reduced use of illegal drugs, reduced levels of injecting, reduced criminal activity and significant health gains for individuals.</p>

  <p>We would not argue that methadone will suit every patient, but decisions on treatments, or combinations of treatments, are for individual patients and their medical professionals. The Executive does not administer a centrally-managed methadone programme.</p>

  <p>Drug treatment and rehabilitation programmes need to be tailored to the needs and circumstances of individual patients, in discussion with their medical and social care professionals. Different interventions, or combinations of interventions, work for different patients. As indicated in my reply to S2W-8149 on 24 May 2004, the benefits from methadone prescribing are supported by a robust body of research.</p>

  <p>A great deal of activity and funds are already being directed to help people who have recovered, or are recovering, from drug and alcohol problems into training and employment.</p>

  <p>For example, resources from the New Futures Fund, which is unique to Scotland, are being used to fund a range of local projects aimed at providing support and opportunities for training and employment. Social inclusion partnerships and the UK-wide Progress2Work initiative are also supporting those with drug and alcohol problems to improve their employability skills. Mainstream education, training and employment services, such as Job Centre Plus, further and higher education institutions and the careers service will also have contact with those experiencing substance misuse problems, and some have developed specific initiatives to address these needs.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s Effective Interventions Unit has published evidence-based guidance to local service planners and providers on effective ways to improve the employability of drug users. This guidance is influencing the design and delivery of employability and employment services for those with substance misuse problems.</p>

  <p>These figures are for illustration only, since waiting times can fluctuate over a relatively short period. Work is already under way with Drug and Alcohol Action Teams to obtain more frequent and consistent information.</p>

  <p>The remit of the majority of residential addiction services in Scotland covers drug and alcohol misuse. Areas listed where there are no local services, will refer patients to services in other areas.</p>

  <p>There are 77 candidate Scottish Special Areas of Conservation, designated under the EC Habitats Directive for the peatland habitat types blanket bog, active raised bog, and degraded raised bog. Together these sites provide international protection for over 220,000 hectares of habitat.</p>

  <p>In addition to this there are a significant number of Sites of Special Scientific Interest, notified under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, and Special Protection Areas classified under the EC Birds Directive, which provides protection for peatland habitats.</p>

  <p>Designation of peatland interests under the EC Habitats and Bird Directives prevents peat extraction, except in extremely restricted circumstances.</p>

  <p>Selection criteria for peatland Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The selection criteria for all sites proposed as candidate SACs throughout the UK follow the principles set out in Annex III (Stage 1) of the Habitats Directive. The guidance for selecting SAC habitats is available on the Habitats Directive website at:</p>

  <p>http://www.ecnc.nl/doc/europe/legislat/habidire.html.</p>

  <p>Selection criteria for peatland Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).</p>

  <p>The guidelines for the selection of biological SSSIs was published in 1989 by the Nature Conservancy Council and have been revised and maintained by the Joint Nature Conservation Committee since 1991. The guidelines provide a rationale for site selection, approach and criteria and detailed guidance for species and habitats. The guidance for selecting SSSIs for bog habitats is available on the JNCC website at www.jncc.gov.uk/Publications/sssi/sssi_content.htm.</p>

  <p>Health boards are currently developing their plans for out-of-hours service re-provision and are being assisted by a national out-of-hours working group. This group is comprised of key stakeholders from across the service and includes members from NHS24, the Scottish Ambulance Service and patient representatives. In addition, three key senior appointments have been made to the Pay Modernisation Team of NHS Scotland to focus on the new models of out-of-hours care across Scotland. New arrangements will need to meet mandatory accreditation standards to ensure a safe, quality service.</p>

  <p>The new General Medical Services contract allows most GP practices to transfer responsibility for care to their patients. Any GP who wishes to continue to provide cover, will be able to do so. However, in cases where GPs decide to transfer their responsibility, health board&#8217;s must have alternative arrangements for the provision of these services in place by the end of December 2004.</p>

  <p>Negotiations are taking place across Scotland between NHS boards and GPs on the provision and funding of enhanced services (including services for drug misusers) under the new General Medical Services contract. We are monitoring the position, but we do not believe that it would be appropriate to intervene in local negotiations at this point.</p>

  <p>Our understanding is that agreement has been reached between health authorities and GPs in Glasgow for a one year period, and that a review will be undertaken during that period of how services for drug misusers will operate beyond then. Transitional arrangements are being put in place in Lothian to cater for patients from GP practices which have decided to opt out of providing services for drug misusers.</p>

  <p>The new contract incorporates a Patient Service Guarantee, which will ensure that patients will receive at least the range of services they currently receive, although these may not necessarily be delivered in the same way. The new contract is being supported by an unprecedented 33% increase in investment in primary care services, which will see spending on general medical services rise to &#163;575 million in 2005-06. The Executive has also invested an additional &#163;34 million over the three years 2001-02 to 2003-04 in improving drug treatment and rehabilitation services.</p>

  <p>I have asked Ms Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 establishes statutory requirements in relation to the allocation of houses by Registered Social Landlords. Landlords are required to give reasonable preference in allocations to the statutory categories of priority need.</p>

  <p>There is a range of acceptable approaches that landlords can take in order to achieve this; a points based system for housing applications is one of these. A landlord is free to adopt its preferred system as long as it can demonstrate that it is complying with the requirements of the legislation and the performance standards published jointly by Communities Scotland, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations.</p>

  <p>The amount of planned investment by Communities Scotland in 2004-05 will be &#163;264 million, with &#163;182 million invested in urban housing, &#163;65 million in rural housing and the remainder not attributed to a single distinct geographical area.

  <p>Medical education can be considered in terms of a continuum from entry to medical school until the end of the medical career.

  <p>Under the mortgage-style student loan system introduced in 1990, loans are repaid over a fixed period of five or seven years and will be written off when the borrower reaches 60 years old (or 50 if they received their last loan before they were 40 and the loan has been outstanding for at least 25 years).</p>

  <p>Under the current Income Contingent Repayment scheme introduced in 1998-99, there is no set repayment term as monthly repayments will vary. Income Contingent student loans are repayable at a fixed rate on the marginal income above the threshold of &#163;10,000 and will be written off when the borrower is 65 years old.</p>

  <p>Following the success of the Executive&#8217;s &quot;Scotland in Sweden&quot; event in 2002, several new direct air routes between Scotland and Sweden have been established, and VisitScotland now regards Sweden as an important target market. In order to take advantage of the growing success of these new links, VisitScotland&#8217;s marketing of Scotland in Sweden has been significantly strengthened.</p>

  <p>VisitScotland designs all of its marketing activities to achieve the highest possible return on marketing investment in terms of trips to Scotland undertaken as a result of the marketing in question. The Royal Scottish National Orchestra (RSNO) tour of Sweden in October 2004 will be a significant opportunity to showcase Scottish culture, and establish further cultural and artistic links between the two countries. These important outcomes are however likely to be more significant than the generation of additional tourism business for Scotland, and so neither the Executive or VisitScotland plan any specific activities in association with the RSNO&#8217;s visit.</p>
