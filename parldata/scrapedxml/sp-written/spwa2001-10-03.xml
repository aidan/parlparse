  <p>We have announced a number of significant developments in relation to asylum and refugee issues.</p>

  <p>Scotland is to have its own minister with responsibility for all devolved aspects of asylum issues. These include health, education, social work and police matters as they relate to asylum seekers.</p>

  <p>We made an announcement on 19 September about social inclusion partnership involvement. The Glasgow Alliance will receive an extra &#163;700,000 to develop projects in areas such as Sighthill and Barmulloch that will tackle community integration and improve local services.</p>

  <p>These projects will benefit both the established and the new asylum seeker population in Sighthill.</p>

  <p>We also announced on 20 September extra money to improve access to further education for basic English language classes. We announced new funding of &#163;1.7 million in the current financial year, including &#163;0.5 million to boost college provision specifically for asylum seekers.</p>

  <p>An &quot;anti-bullying in Schools&quot; newsletter will be available in October.</p>

  <p>The research study into the effects of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 in Scotland is about to start.</p>

  <p>We are establishing the Scottish Refugee Integration Forum, which I will lead.</p>

  <p>We are establishing a unit within the Executive, whose sole task will be to deal with asylum seekers and with refugee integration issues: it will support ministers on the forum.</p>

  <p>This will provide a sound basis for the further consideration of asylum and refugee issues in Scotland.</p>

  <p>In appointing the membership of the sounding board and the academic panel, the Scottish Executive sought to achieve a mix of experience, organisational affiliations, geographical coverage and gender. Unfortunately not all the women who were asked to participate were able to join.</p>

  <p>However, membership of these groups is not closed and we are currently seeking additional members in order to cover specific issues that arise as the review develops.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive believes that it is absolutely essential to engage communities and the public generally in the design of health care services, including option appraisal exercises. The new NHS Boards are committed to that principle. Formal advice to the NHS on involving the public in developing health services was provided by the then Scottish Office in 1975.</p>

  <p>In the Scottish Health Plan <i>Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change</i>, published in December last year, we gave a commitment to review guidance on formal NHS consultation to ensure that it meets the needs of a modern health care system, and takes into account the changes which have been made following <i>Our National Health</i>. This work is under way and further guidance will be issued in the near future.</p>

  <p>The Treasury Taskforce Standardisation of PFI Contracts has been available since July 1999. A copy is available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 16339). It is broadly indicative of the type of provisions contained within PFI contracts although the Executive&#8217;s contracts predate it. Payments under a PFI contract are routinely adjusted to reflect performance against it.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive (and formerly the Scottish Office) has managed three Private Finance Initiative (PFI) projects in the last 10 years: Skye Bridge (signed 1991); M6 (signed 1997); Kilmarnock Prison (signed 1997). The Executive&#8217;s policy is that PFI should only be used where it represents best value for money. To test for value for money, bids received are compared to a Public Sector Comparator (PSC) which represents an estimate of the whole life cost of procuring of the specified services by conventional means.</p>

  <p>In the case of the Skye Bridge, a PSC was not calculated, as the project would not have gone ahead other than under private finance. Government guidance published in 1995 also accepted this as a reason for not producing a PSC.</p>

  <p>The following table shows the cost savings by comparing the PSC with the PFI bid for the M6 DBFO and Kilmarnock Prison projects.</p>

  <p>Every local authority has established multi-disciplinary teams involving the statutory and voluntary agencies concerned with juvenile justice. These teams are identifying areas of need and gaps in existing resources.

  <p>We estimate that the cost of the scheme will be up to around &#163;200,000 per annum. Since the scheme is being introduced later this year, the cost in the current financial year will be considerably less.</p>
