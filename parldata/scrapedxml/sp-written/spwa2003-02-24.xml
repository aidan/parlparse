  <p>In 2001, Scottish courts referred 562 offenders to the Drink Driving Rehabilitation Scheme as part of the sentencing procedure. In 2002, this number had increased to 1,487. The scheme itself is reserved under section 34A of the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988, and it is the Department for Transport which monitors the provision of courses nationally, including the amount of referrals by courts in England, Scotland and Wales, the number of courses run and the total number of offenders completing a course.</p>

A range of new measures was introduced by Scottish Enterprise under its New Approach to Entrepreneurship strategy, launched last year. At a strategic level this includes specific targets for the number of start-ups by women supported by the network, together with practical promotional activity, for example the Executive and Scottish Enterprise jointly funding a brochure promoting successful women entrepreneurs last year.</p>

  <p>Fraud has not yet been proven in relation to any learning provider, although investigations are on-going in a number of cases. It is not, therefore, possible to state the proportion of fraudulent activity in relation to accounts opened. It will ultimately be a matter for the Procurator Fiscal Service to decide whether proceedings should be raised, and for the courts to determine whether fraud has been committed.</p>

  <p>There are no plans at present for any compensation scheme for learning providers in respect of the individual learning account scheme.

  <p>Investigations into potentially fraudulent and irregular activity under the individual learning account (ILA) scheme have not yet been concluded. Until they are, the total cost of the investigations cannot be established. While a specific budget for the investigations has not been set, the cost-effectiveness of the process is being kept under review. Direct costs, thus far, have been met from the ILA budget administered by the enterprise networks on behalf of the Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning Department.</p>

  <p>While this is primarily a matter for local NHS systems, there is evidence that progress is being made locally in the provision of perinatal services. This includes the introduction of nurse consultants specialising in perinatal mental illness and the development of integrated care pathways (ICPs) for the early detection and management of perinatal mental health problems.</p>

  <p>However, I realise that there is further work to be taken forward in this area and, in December 2002, I asked NHS Scotland&#146;s regional planning groups to consider the benefits of providing joint admission in-patient services for post-natal depression on a shared, regional, basis. This issue will be an agenda item for the regional partnership networks, which bring together the Chief Executives of the five NHS boards in each Scottish region. Progress will be assessed in April.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive normally buys goods and services from contractors at market prices, following open and competitive procurement. It does not hold information on its contractors&#146; current levels of pay, nor does it monitor its contractors&#146; rates of pay, since such matters are generally for the contractor and its employees.</p>

  <p>It is generally not possible to draw meaningful comparisons between contractors on the basis of rates of pay, or between contractors and the Scottish Executive. Details of average pay rates may be examined during the bidding process where these are considered to have a bearing on the quality of service. Where there are doubts about whether wage levels contained within a contractor&#146;s proposal could have an adverse impact on the quality of service required, the bid would not be accepted.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Quarters 1, 2 and 3 of performance year 1 and performance quarters 1, 2 and 3 of performance year 4.</p>

  <p>The contract does not provide for the calculation of performance revenue deductions where no maximum limit applies; such a figure cannot therefore be calculated.</p>

  <p>Information about the survey was removed from the Scottish Executive website on 21 November 2002, pending an investigation into the information that had been provided by a member of the public. A statement explaining that there had been an error in the data used to draw the results for the survey, that we had been advised that the conclusions had not been materially affected by this error, and that we had decided to commission a new survey, was posted on the Scottish Executive website on 6 December 2002.</p>
