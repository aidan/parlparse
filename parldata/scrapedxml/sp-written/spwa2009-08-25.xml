  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what powers local authorities have to ensure that graffiti are removed swiftly from private property such as parking equipment, post boxes, bins, walls and houses where owners fail to do so.</p>

  <p>The Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004 provides powers for local authorities to serve a graffiti removal notice on any responsible person where a relevant surface in that local authority&rsquo;s area has been defaced. A relevant surface includes any building, structure, apparatus, plant or other object on a public road. These provisions are designed to encourage the owners to work in partnership with local authorities to ensure that graffiti is removed from their property.</p>

  <p>The act also provides that a person who sells spray paint to those under 16 in Scotland commits an offence. Anyone who contravenes this legislation is guilty of a criminal offence and liable to a fine of up to &pound;1,000. This is a useful step in preventing the misuse of spray paint by persons in acts of vandalism and is intended to work in concert with other approaches.</p>

  <p>The annual data collection of homicide information from police forces in Scotland provides information at local authority area level. It is therefore not possible to allocate Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) ranks on the basis of the homicide information provided in this return.</p>

  <p>Police forces have also provided homicide information specifically for the purposes of developing SIMD 2009. However, this information cannot be used for any further analyses. Although individual crime level geo-referenced homicide information was provided, the crimes of homicide are analysed as part of a larger group of crimes of violence, in the development of SIMD 2009. Therefore, although the data could be split into deprivation quintiles, any such analyses would require an additional approach being made to police forces.</p>

  <p><strong>Frank Mulholland: </strong>On 17 July 2009, Christine Grahame MSP issued a press release highlighting unfounded allegations she had made to Lothian and Borders Police. These allegations have subsequently been dismissed by the police as having no basis.</p>

  <p>To help with questions from the media about Ms Grahame&rsquo;s press release, the following note to editors was provided:</p>

  <p>We have been made aware of serious allegations made by Christine Grahame against the Crown Agent, Norman McFadyen, in relation to the Lockerbie trial.</p>

  <p>These are defamatory and entirely unfounded allegations of the most serious kind. Norman McFadyen is a man of the utmost integrity who is held in the highest regard by the Law Officers.</p>

  <p>Not only is the allegation false in itself, but Mrs Grahame appears to have misunderstood the process because the documents which she has referred to were not part of and had absolutely nothing to do with it.</p>

  <p>The whole process was fully considered by the trial court which thanked the then Lord Advocate for the Crown&rsquo;s efforts to bring as much information as possible before the court. By the end of the process, information made available to the Crown by the US authorities was made available to the defence, the trial court and also the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission in the form in which it was received from the US authorities.</p>

  <p>The commission extensively and fully investigated the process. The commission concluded that there was no basis to refer the issue to the appeal court.</p>

  <p><em>Scotland&rsquo;s Future: Join the Debate</em> leaflets are an important contribution to informing the public debate successfully generated by the National Conversation. Over 4,500 people have attended public events, there have been over 500,000 hits on the National Conversation web pages and the voluntary sector, businesses, universities, the media, faith groups, ethnic minorities, and Scotland&rsquo;s young people are all taking part.</p>

  <p>The cost for design, printing, translation and web publication was &pound;20,927. The cost of distribution to almost 600 libraries across Scotland was &pound;3,452. Copies of the leaflets will be available at National Conversation events and on request.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-23202 on 1 July 2009. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="../../../Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx</a> .</p>

  <p>Further to that answer, a further &pound;24,379 has been spent on the design, publication, print, distribution and translation of <em>Scotland&rsquo;s Future: Join the Debate</em> leaflets.</p>

  <p>Expenditure on the National Conversation includes the cost of supporting a successful programme of public engagement, which has resulted in over 4,500 people attending events across the country to debate Scotland&rsquo;s future. Expenditure also includes the cost of engaging with the UK Government, and others, on related initiatives such as the Governance of Britain programme, the All Wales Convention, the Independent Commission on Funding and Finance for Wales and the Commission on Scottish Devolution &ndash; which involved over 20 officials in the preparation of a Scottish Government response to requests for factual information.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive in which local authorities there are pilot single interface arrangements between community planning partnerships and the third sector.</p>

  <p>Since March 2008, across Scotland community planning partnerships (CPPs) and the third sector locally have been devising new arrangements, known as single interfaces, which cover four functions: support for voluntary organisations, volunteering, social enterprise and building connections between the CPP and the sector.</p>

  <p>Such interface arrangements already exist in Edinburgh, East Lothian, East Renfrewshire, Falkirk, Orkney, Perth and Kinross, Shetland, West Dunbartonshire, West Lothian and, shortly Moray.</p>

  <p>Evaluation of the interface is primarily for the partners themselves. To assist this process the Scottish Government is working with the early adopters group on evaluation and monitoring methods. We will also commission research in the autumn, with the engagement of the third sector and public sector partners, on the role of third sector organisations in community planning partnerships. This research is intended to establish the level and type of third sector involvement in community planning partnerships and make recommendations about effective models for engagement.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises the significant contribution made to the delivery of public services in Scotland and to the Scottish economy by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). We have introduced a number of measures to encourage SME participation in bidding for public contracts, including writing to chief executives and heads of procurement throughout the public sector, encouraging them to use &quot;The Six Simple Steps&quot; (which include the Public Contracts Scotland Portal and Supplier Charter) in their procurement activities.</p>

  <p>Information obtained from the Scottish Procurement Information Hub, which monitors spend by major Scottish public bodies indicates that in each of the last three financial years, over 48% of Scottish public sector spend has been with SMEs.</p>

  <p>The successful implementation of the Scottish smoke-free legislation has undoubtedly reduced exposure to second-hand smoke among children in Scotland, partly as a result of the greater awareness among their parents and those close to them about the risks of second-hand smoke. While there are currently no plans to extend the smoke-free laws to private cars, the Scottish Government is conscious that private cars are now one of the main places for exposure of children to second-hand smoke. In conjunction with our health improvement partners, therefore, we will continue to do all we can to highlight the risks posed by second-hand smoke.</p>

  <p>The SPCB does not have specific targets regarding small businesses access to contracts &ndash; this is because the number, type and value of SPCB contracts let each year varies considerably, so any targets set would not reflect genuine contracting opportunities. However it does have a clearly defined policy to actively remove barriers to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) participation in procurement. Steps taken to support this policy include:</p>

  <p>Publication of all current and forthcoming contracts (above &pound;5,000) on the Parliament website;</p>

  <p>Publication of tender list on the procurement website to increase sub-contracting opportunities;</p>

  <p>Annual &quot;Meet the Buyer&quot; events aimed specifically at SMEs;</p>

  <p>Simplified procurement documentation (e.g. conditions of contract written in plain English);</p>

  <p>Increase in formal tendering threshold from &pound;30,000 to &pound;60,000;</p>

  <p>Easily accessible tendering guidance produced and issued on procurement website;</p>

  <p>Individual strategy for each procurement project considers SME impacts;</p>

  <p>Links with organisations representing SMEs are maintained,</p>

  <p>Appointment of a champion for SMEs within procurement services.</p>

  <p>At present, procurement services operates a simple monitoring system that measures the number and value of contracts awarded to SMEs on an annual basis. Since 2003, the contracts awarded to SMEs (as % of total contracts awarded) is as follows:</p>

  <p>2003-04 - 39%.</p>

  <p>2004-05 - 48%.</p>

  <p>2005-06 - 45%.</p>

  <p>2006-07 - 62%.</p>

  <p>2007-08 - 67%.</p>

  <p>2008-09 - 53%.</p>

  <p>: Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are made aware of opportunities in a variety of ways including:</p>

  <p>Targeted &quot;Meet the Buyer&quot; events that provide practical assistance to SMEs to help them bid for public sector contracts (these events are aimed at SMEs in industry sectors for which we have forthcoming requirements);</p>

  <p>On the Scottish Parliament website (the website provides information on current and forthcoming contracts (over &pound;5,000) as well as contract adverts and sub-contracting opportunities);</p>

  <p>On the Public Contracts Scotland website;</p>

  <p>SMEs registered on the Parliament&rsquo;s supplier database are alerted to contract adverts being placed;</p>

  <p>The Parliament&rsquo;s supplier database is used to source suppliers for low-value requirements wherever it is inappropriate to advertise a contract. As 69% of suppliers on the database are SMEs, this increases their contracting opportunities,</p>

  <p>Procurement staff attending SME events organised by other public sector bodies or organisations aimed at supporting SMEs. All SMEs encountered are encouraged to register on the Parliament&rsquo;s supplier database and also on the Public Contracts Scotland website.</p>
