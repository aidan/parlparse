  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-2120 by Lord Hardie on 8 November 1999, when and by whom information regarding litigation by the Ministry of Defence against the manufacturers of the FADEC system was brought to the attention of the Crown Office.</p>

  <p>As I explained in my answer to question S1W-2912, questions about the FADEC software were first brought to the attention of the Crown Office by solicitors acting for the family of one of those killed in the accident. As I explained in my answer to question S1W-2585, that was on 30 December 1997. As I explained in my answer to question S1W-3010, the Crown Office immediately sought and obtained from the Ministry of Defence a full account of the issue and that account included information about the litigation. As I also explained in my answer to question S1W-2585, that information was received on 17 March 1998. As I explained in my answer to question S1W-2587 the details and basis of the settlement are a matter for the Ministry of Defence. So are the details of the litigation. As was also explained in my answer to questions S1W-2120 and S1W-3010, there is no evidence to suggest that information about that litigation would have made any difference to the outcome of the Fatal Accident Inquiry. And, as I explained in my answer to question S1W-2002, the allegations in relation to the FADEC software were considered fully by the House of Commons Defence Committee in March 1998. That Committee concluded that there was no evidence to support claims that design flaws in the aircraft or its components contributed to the crash.</p>

  <p>Yes, although in some cases the level of demand may exceed the amount of vaccine immediately available to general practitioners. My Department&#8217;s letter inviting first-time students to be immunised made it clear that any not immunised before starting their courses would be able to be immunised either through the Student Health Service or by a general practitioner where they are attending university or college. Supplies began to be made available to general practitioners from 20 September and continued to be issued as required. Vaccine was also issued to health boards for use at universities and colleges as supplies became available. There was sufficient vaccine to immunise all first-time students coming forward.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what factors have been identified to explain why the five year survival rate from lung cancer in Scotland is approximately 6%, the European average is approximately 10% and the USA average is 14% and what action is proposed to address this situation.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-01-19.S1W-2234.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80146" speakername="Susan Deacon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa0119.htm#843">

  <p>Variations in reported survival figures may be due in part to known differences in the way cancer registration data are collected in other countries. However, research tends to suggest that some of the difference must be due to late presentation by individuals to seek a medical opinion once symptoms suggestive of lung cancer appear.</p>

  <p>The association between smoking and lung cancer is well known. By encouraging people to stop smoking &#8211; or not to start smoking &#8211; we are aiming to stop people contracting lung cancer in the first place. For those people who do develop lung cancer it is imperative that they seek medical advice as soon as any symptoms suggestive of the disease appear.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to reducing deaths from all cancers by 20% by 2010 (against the 1995 baseline). To meet that target it is necessary to look at early presentation and promoting better health by raising awareness of the benefits of improved diet and otherwise healthier lifestyles on which major initiatives are currently underway. The emerging managed cancer clinical networks, comprising specialists and clinicians from all disciplines working together to ensure that everyone has access to the best quality of care possible, will provide the focus for continuous improvements in care underpinned by prospective clinical audit. Arrangements are in hand to establish these networks across the country, the first phase of which is concentrating on lung cancer (as well as breast, colorectal and gynaecological cancers).</p>

  <p>Yes.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive which public relations, information, marketing, market research or opinion research companies are employed by each of the Scottish Executive agencies, non-departmental public bodies, NHS trusts and local public spending bodies for which it is responsible, which projects they have worked on or are working on and how much they have been or will be paid.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-01-19.S1W-3223.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80147" speakername="Donald Dewar" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa0119.htm#1870">

  <p>Information about public relations, information and marketing companies that are employed by Scottish public bodies for which the Scottish Executive has direct responsibility is contained in a report which is being lodged in SPICe today. Information about market research or opinion research companies employed by Scottish public bodies is not held centrally. Information about companies employed by local authorities is not included as the Scottish Executive does not have responsibility for such contracts.</p>

  <p>The report has been prepared following my statement to Parliament on 30 September when I said that I had asked officials to investigate the use of public relations and professional lobbying organisations by all the Scottish public bodies for which we have responsibility.</p>

  <p>The report shows that the total expenditure reported by Scottish public bodies for contracts entered into since 1 July or entered into previously and extending beyond 1 July is around &pound;3.8 million. Of this total, &pound;1.1 million is accounted for by public information campaigns, such as fire safety in the home, mounted by the Scottish Executive through the Scottish Executive&#8217;s Information Directorate. No other part of the Scottish Executive has incurred any expenditure in this field.</p>

  <p>The remaining &pound;2.7 million represents a small proportion of the individual budgets of the bodies concerned. It is clear from the reports received from the bodies concerned that the various rules for entering into contracts such as open tendering for all major contracts have been followed. The exercise has been useful in that it has put detailed information on the contacts and contracts between public bodies and public relations organisations in the public domain. I am satisfied that the reports received have not identified any grounds for concern.</p>

  <p>The Executive will keep this matter under close review. I have asked all Cabinet Ministers to take a personal interest in the expenditure on public relations in the areas for which they have responsibility. I will consider whether it would be appropriate to conduct a similar exercise during the course of the year 2000.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive position on smoking in public places is set out in the White Paper, <i>Smoking Kills</i> , copies of which are available from the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe) <i>. </i> Officials of the Scottish Executive have had discussions with key players such as the Licensed Trade Association and hospitality trade interests with the intention of persuading them to sign up to a Public Places Charter on the lines set out in the White Paper.</p>
