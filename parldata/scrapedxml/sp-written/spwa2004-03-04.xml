  <p>In 2002, Scotland took part in an international study of asthma and allergies in Schoolchildren which suggested that, while the diagnosis of asthma had become more common since 1995, the prevalence of symptoms had declined. The Global Initiative for Asthma has suggested that Scotland has the highest incidence of the symptoms of asthma among 13 to 14 year olds of the countries involved in their survey.</p>

  <p>Both these studies have yet to be formally published but, when available, will inform policy development by the Executive and the clinical practices of NHSScotland.</p>

  <p>The disease registers and the reviews, including medication reviews, (established in the Quality Framework) in the new General Medical Services contract provide an opportunity to standardise the management of asthma in line with good practice and available evidence-based guidelines. The new contracts for other health professionals enable the use of the expertise of other health professionals in the wider primary care teams such as the community pharmacists in the review and management of people with asthma.</p>

  <p>The most effective contribution the Executive can make to Scottish football is ensuring that there is a greater pool of healthy, physically active young people available and willing to become involved in football. That is why we are investing significant sums in the Active Schools Programme.</p>

  <p>For the past 18 months, the Executive has also been fully involved in the independent review of youth football commissioned by the Scottish Football Association. Ministers are currently considering proposals from the SFA on how to take forward the review&#8217;s recommendations. An announcement is expected shortly.</p>

  <p>The proposal to establish an inspectorate for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) was the subject of consultation at the end of 2003. The outcome of this consultation was a broad welcome for these proposals. I have published a summary of the responses at www.crownoffice.gov.uk. Following this positive response, the Inspectorate of Prosecution in Scotland started work at the end of December 2003, under the leadership of an interim inspector.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive will this week advertise the post of Chief Inspector of Prosecution of Scotland. The creation of the inspectorate is an important step for the COPFS as it strives to build its reputation as an open and accountable public service and secure the public&#8217;s confidence in its ability to prosecute crime.</p>

  <p>The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service continues to be committed to the robust prosecution of racially aggravated crime in Scotland. In the financial year 2002-03, the police reported 1,819 cases involving racially aggravated harassment and behaviour or separate statutory racial aggravations to Procurators Fiscal. No proceedings were taken in only 5% of these cases.</p>

  <p>The department has also completed a review of all cases involving racial aggravation reported to Procurators Fiscal in the period October 2002 &#8211; March 2003. Following consideration of the results of this review, the Lord Advocate has decided to extend the range of disposals available to Procurators Fiscal to include the issuing of warning letters in exceptional circumstances only.</p>

  <p>The department&#8217;s Race Strategy Group, which I chair, will continue to monitor prosecution practice and ensure that the effective and robust prosecution of racially aggravated crime in Scotland remains a priority for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service.</p>

  <p>Following the implementation of the package of measures at the A90/A937 south junction, which I referred to in my answer to S2W-29, the junction was monitored to ascertain their effectiveness. It has been concluded that some alterations to the signing and lining would be beneficial in increasing driver awareness. These changes will be implemented during February 2004. The junction will continue to be monitored and a CCTV camera will be installed to assist in this process once a suitable electricity supply has been provided.</p>

  <p>Analysis of the accident figures for the A90/937 north junction confirms that no further investigation of the junction is necessary at this time. However, accident figures for the junction will continue to be monitored.</p>

  <p>Road safety at the A90/B9120 junction is currently being investigated by BEAR Scotland Ltd and a report is due to be submitted to the Scottish Executive by the end of January 2004. It is expected that any remedial measures identified will be progressed during 2004-05.</p>
