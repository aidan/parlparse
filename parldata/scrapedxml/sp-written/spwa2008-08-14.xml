  <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service has national infection control policies in place, including a well defined cleaning and disinfection policy. Processes require that vehicles should have both a daily and a weekly clean and that the interior of the vehicle is wiped down after each patient. These practices are subject to regular audit and review.</p>

  <p>As I have made clear on many occasions, standard of cleanliness in all environments across the healthcare system remains a key focus of this government.</p>

  <p>The objective of the Scottish Ambulance Service is to respond to emergency calls as promptly and safely as possible and within a response time that meets the clinical needs of the individual patient.</p>

  <p>The time taken to respond is affected by a number of factors such as the condition and location of the patient, the nature of the emergency and the prevailing weather and road conditions. The ambulance service use recent data to predict where they are most likely to receive serious and life-threatening calls and to ensure resources are allocated in the most effective way to deliver a safe and efficient service across all parts of Scotland.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-15197 on 14 August 2008. The Taskforce has agreed to establish a tripartite advisory group comprising representatives from the government, universities and the funding council to provide advice on the proposed new funding arrangements as set out in the interim report, <em>New Horizons</em> . All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at:</p>

  <p><a href="../../../webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a>.</p>

  <p>Staff and student representatives have a number of mechanisms and opportunities to provide advice to this government on higher education, such as the FE/HE Roundtable. We have also held two student summits to discuss a range of higher education issues.</p>

  <p>Over the summer, staff and student representatives and other stakeholders are being actively encouraged to contribute to the discussion of <em>New Horizons </em>before the taskforce meets again in September and considers how best to respond.</p>

  <p>Following publication of <em>New Horizons</em> , John McClelland, Chair of the Scottish Funding Council, agreed to lead a review of the funding council&rsquo;s processes and procedures in readiness for its future new role in relation to the governance of and funding policies for our universities.

  <p>The report, <em>Delivering for Remote and Rural Healthcare</em> , published by Scottish Government in 2008, recognised the important role of Community Hospitals as a resource hub providing a range of core services, including enhanced diagnostics and integrating and co-locating services provided by other related organisations. Further details can be found in the chapter &quot;Improving the Patient Experience of Remote Primary Care&quot;, pages 9 to 19. The full report is available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 45640).</p>

  <p>As far as funding is concerned, it is the responsibility of NHS boards to plan and provide health care services to meet the assessed needs of their resident populations.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how it will preserve the service provided by the NHS to rural communities that may lose out under the implementation of the new NHS Scotland Resource Allocation Committee funding formula.</p>

  <p>Under the implementation of the NHS Scotland Resource Allocation Committee (NRAC) funding formula all boards will receive a standard increase in funds each year with those boards currently below NRAC formula target given additional funds to move them towards their NRAC target share of resources. No board will lose any funding.</p>

  <p><em>Delivering for Remote and Rural Healthcare</em> establishes a framework for sustainable health care in remote and rural Scotland.</p>

  <p>The report proposes a focus on sharing skills and expertise across communities and on improving links between different types of health care. In particular, it recommends that Community and Rural General hospitals should work more closely with specialists in larger centres and that greater use should be made of new technologies that help practitioners to share their knowledge.</p>

  <p>The emerging model of care will be supported with educational packages specifically developed for remote and rural practitioners, improved support networks with larger centres and technology, transport and retrieval systems.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what records it maintains of public buildings, including schools, that were constructed with the use of asbestos and if this information (a) has been or (b) will be made available to the public.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not hold information on the incidence of asbestos in schools or other public buildings. The Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations 2006 place a duty on those with responsibilities for buildings to manage the risk from asbestos. In the case of schools that would be the local authority.</p>
