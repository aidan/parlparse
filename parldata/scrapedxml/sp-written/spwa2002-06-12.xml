<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-06-12.0.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80219" speakername="Dr Elaine Murray" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0612.htm#1">

  <p>Statutory responsibility for local libraries lies with local authorities. Each local authority is responsible for determining the level of resources allocated for the library service which they provide for the residents of their area. This includes the purchase of materials to address the needs of blind and partially sighted people.</p>

  <p>I understand that annual expenditure by local authorities on audio-visual material, such as talking books, has increased from &#163;1 million to &#163;1.6 million over the last 10 years.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Library and Information Council, which receives core funding from the Scottish Executive, issued guidance to local authorities on book selection policies two years ago and over 30% of local authorities now have a policy in place with all the other local authorities working to develop their policies. A book selection policy aims to deliver user-led services to meet the needs of communities. The policy should be based on a profile of the needs of the community, including the needs of blind and partially sighted people, and could allow for the provision of a wide range of book and non-book materials.</p>

  <p>Review of Supervision Requirements is an integral part of the Children&#146;s Hearing System.

The number of Review Hearings called specifically to &quot;re-consider&quot; an earlier supervision requirement is not separated from the overall figures.</p>

  <p>I have asked Graeme Munro, Chief Executive of Historic Scotland to reply. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>These grants from public funds are intended to help meet the additional repair costs normally associated with the use of traditional and appropriate materials, craft skills and the conservation of original features. It would not be appropriate, therefore, for funding to be extended to include alterations to historic buildings, such as the introduction of double glazing. Draught proofing, or secondary glazing, are considered to be a more cost-effective and energy-efficient means of improving the thermal performance of windows in traditional buildings.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-23646 by Allan Wilson on 15 March 2002, why the ministerial appointees to the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park Authority will only be announced once the results of the elections to the park have been declared.</p>

  <p>The appointments cannot be finalised before the results of the elections are known because a number of candidates for appointment have also put themselves forward for election.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-06-12.11.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80258" speakername="Allan Wilson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0612.htm#QuestionText">

  <p>As we said <i>in The Future of Scotland&#146;s Waters &#150; Proposals for Legislation</i> , it is difficult to predict the costs and benefits of our proposals because these will be determined by the outcome of the river basin management planning process that the Water Environment and Water Services Bill will establish. The figures in the consultation paper are therefore only indicative estimates. They represent total costs and benefits, estimated over a 40-year time horizon, discounted to current prices.</p>

  <p>The figure of &#163;1.5 billion of possible benefits was based on research into individuals&#146; willingness to pay for the water environment improvements that may flow from our proposals. It therefore represents the general benefits to society rather than the benefits that might accrue to particular groups or sectors. The researchers calculated that the annual benefits from these improvements could be valued at between &#163;141 million and &#163;324 million per year. The average of these adds up to some &#163;1.5 billion over 40 years.</p>

  <p>We provided a breakdown of the total &#163;840 million figure for the estimated costs of our proposals in the consultation paper. Our research indicates that the public sector may bear around half of these costs &#150; some &#163;400 million over 40 years. We estimate that the remainder of the costs may fall on a range of sectors including agricultural and other enterprises because of the need to tackle diffuse pollution and on other major water users such as distillers, textile and paper and pulp manufacturers and hydro-electricity generators.</p>
