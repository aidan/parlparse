  <p>Our programme for government, <i>Working together for</i> <i>Scotland</i> , committed the Scottish Executive to improve the system of nature conservation to work with local communities to achieve effective protection for nature.</p>

  <p>I am today publishing <i>The Nature of Scotland: A Policy Statement</i>, which sets out our proposals to achieve this. It proposes important reforms to the way in which we work with people to protect Scotland&#8217;s most special places for nature. It also proposes important changes to the way we protect nature, and deter wildlife crime, throughout Scotland.</p>

  <p>I am consulting widely on these proposals, and have set up a working group involving the key stakeholders to consider their further development.</p>

  <p>I have placed copies of <i>The Nature of Scotland</i> in the Scottish Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>The national guidelines on Local Economic Forums have been published today on the Scottish Executive website. The guidelines have been issued following consultation with a wide range of interests. The Local Economic Forums are the main response to the ELL Committee inquiry into local economic development and I expect them to create a simpler, more cohesive structure for local economic development in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Copies of the national guidelines have been lodged with the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the announcement by the Office of the e-Envoy on 16 January 2001 that more than 40% of UK government services are now available online, how many of its services are currently available over the internet.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2001-03-07.3.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80192" speakername="Angus MacKay" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-01/wa0307.htm#3">

  <p>Current evidence suggests that, on the basis of the progress measures defined by the Office of the e-Envoy for its Electronic Service Delivery Progress Report, more than 25% of services provided by the Scottish Executive and its agencies are available online, thus meeting the target of 25% to be online by 2002. However, we do not believe that &quot;services&quot; and &quot;online&quot; in this context have universally understood definitions within the public sector in Scotland. Since the announcement of the target of 100% of government services to be available electronically by 2005 in March 2000, we have been considering how to ensure that our 21st Century Government Agenda is about improving services to the public and about increasing choice in the way services are delivered. The option to access services electronically can and should include a variety of delivery channels, including digital tv, call centres and the internet. We are revising the collection of statistics to reflect this and will be able to provide fuller information in due course.</p>

  <p>An issue has been identified by the Scottish Legal Aid Board regarding its powers under the Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 1986 to aggregate expenditure on certain kinds of legal aid case. This is a very technical matter but between 1991 and 1999, the board deducted too much money from the awards of people who had been supported by civil legal aid. This money will now be refunded. The board will be placing adverts in the press for those people who may have been affected by this issue to contact their own solicitor. They will issue guidance to the legal profession on how to handle claims. The Law Society will also be writing to the profession giving guidance.</p>

  <p>Mental health is one of three clinical priorities for the NHS in Scotland and resources are being allocated to reflect this. The Scottish Executive Health Department works with the NHS, local authorities, inspection and support groups to ensure that appropriate standards of care and treatment are provided for people with mental illness. Where deficiencies are found, the first priority is to ensure that action is taken to meet the needs of patients without delay.</p>

  <p>Guidance on income generation published by the NHS Management Executive in 1989 states that in developing income generation opportunities NHS organisations should ensure they act in a commercial manner and charge on an appropriate commercial basis. Their expected costs are relevant only in assessing the minimum combination of price and volume which is profitable.</p>
