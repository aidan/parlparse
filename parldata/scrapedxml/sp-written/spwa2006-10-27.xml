  <p>To date, byelaws have been confirmed banning alcohol consumption in specific public places in over 480 towns and villages across Scotland. We will continue to work with local authorities to ensure that byelaws are workable and proportionate. It is important that proper consideration is given to the making of byelaws and that members of the public are given a chance to raise objections. Steps have been taken by the Executive to improve turnaround times. We will publish revised guidance for local authorities on the confirmation process and content of byelaws in the near future.</p>

  <p>The Executive is working with local government and partners on a wide range of actions to prevent and tackle homelessness, and is co-ordinating the work needed to carry out the 59 recommendations made by the Homelessness Task Force (HTF) in 2002. For example, the Executive has recently commissioned research into local authorities&rsquo; prevention activities and will use the results of this research to develop guidance. It is also strengthening support for prevention work through an Innovation Fund which is now funding eight new local projects in seven local authorities.</p>

  <p><em>The Annual Report on the HTF recommendations</em> summarises progress made against each of the recommendations and can be found at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Housing/homeless/H-M-G" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Housing/homeless/H-M-G</a></p>

  <p>The recent ministerial statement on the abolition of priority need also sets out what the Executive and its partners plan to do to ensure that by 2012 all unintentionally homeless people will have access to permanent accommodation. This can be found at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/12/21133010/30107" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/12/21133010/30107</a></p>

  <p>It is for individual local authorities to define the causes of homelessness in their areas and set out their actions for addressing these, in their homelessness strategies. The Executive issues guidance to all local authorities on how the latter should comply with their statutory duties under the homelessness legislation, and gives funding to all local authorities to carry out their homelessness activities. The Executive is also funding two secondees (from local authorities) to work closely with all local authorities to ensure that the latter are fully prepared for the abolition of priority need.Communities Scotland inspect local authorities&rsquo; homelessness and housing functions, and can monitor performance post-inspection via improvement plans developed by local authorities and agreed by Communities Scotland.The Executive monitors local authorities&rsquo; activities through five top level outcomes as defined in the ministerial statement on the abolition of priority need. The Executive also publishes six-monthly statistical bulletins on local authorities&rsquo; activities in carrying out their duties under the legislation.

  <p>The Executive supports a range of measures designed to achieve early resolution of disputes and the resolution of disputes outwith the formal court system. We provide funding for a range of mediation services including funding of around &pound;70,000 per annum for two new In-Court Mediation pilots introduced in Aberdeen and Glasgow this year. The Scottish Mediation Network (SMN) have been awarded &pound;110,820 this year, allowing them to undertake projects that raise public awareness and understanding of mediation and to develop a quality assurance scheme within the mediation sector. The Executive are also providing core funding of &pound;141,365 and a training grant of &pound;37,671 for Family Mediation Scotland allowing families to reach agreement through mediation. Further, ten Local Family Mediation Services have been awarded &pound;643,152 in funding this year. The new civil justice &quot;Advice Finder&quot; website launched in May reinforces the Executive&rsquo;s support and further promotes the use of mediation.</p>

  <p>The operational management of grid capacity is a matter for the regulator (Ofgem) and the owners and operators of the electricity grid. The grid networks in Scotland are currently owned and operated by Scottish and Southern Energy and Scottish Power in their respective areas, whereas the transmission network operator is National Grid. The Scottish Executive has discussions with these bodies on a regular basis.</p>

  <p>The Forum for Renewable Energy Development is Scotland (FREDS) examined grid capacity, constraints and upgrades in its 2005 report, <em>Scotland&rsquo;s Renewable Energy: Realising The 2020 Target</em>. The report found that the key upgrades for which Ofgem has approved funding could allow the connection of 6.3 gigawatts (GW) of generation applications. The report concluded that these upgrades could accommodate 4.8GW of installed renewable capacity, over and above what is already installed and consented.</p>
