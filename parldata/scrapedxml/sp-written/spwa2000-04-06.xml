  <p>My department has a requirement to make payments to farmers and crofters within mandatory targets and deadlines laid down in EU legislation. These are the targets and deadlines against which my department&#8217;s performance is measured and they are reflected in departmental reports.</p>

  <p>Under the 1999 Arable Area Payments Scheme the requirement is to pay 96.16% of claims for advance oilseeds, main scheme, non-food set-aside, and final oilseeds by 30 September, 31 December, 31 March and 13 May respectively. Currently, 97.95% of all AAPS claims received have been paid.</p>

  <p>Under the Livestock schemes the annual payment cycle runs from July to the following June and 96.16% of balance payments for the Beef Special and Suckler Cow schemes are due to be paid by 30 June, and all sheep scheme balance payments are to be paid by 15 October. Currently, 96.34% of advance payments under these schemes have been made.</p>

  <p>For the Hill Livestock Compensatory Allowance, 90% of the total payments are to be made by 30 April and currently 82.3% have been paid.</p>

  <p>The percentages quoted above are expressed against all claims. Some outstanding claims will be invalid while others require clarification on eligibility.</p>

  <p>My department continually strives to improve its performance and will do so in the future.</p>

  <p>The recent review identified the need for modernising the Commission&#8217;s constitutional arrangements, to meet new standards of public accountability, by converting the Commission into a modern NDPB or into an Agency. In the light of the balance of views expressed in the responses received, and following discussions with the Crofters Commission, I have concluded that the NDPB model is the appropriate one. When we have the opportunity we shall legislate to recast the Crofters Commission with a modernised board structure and its own staff and budget. There will be scope for existing staff to opt to keep their current civil service status and to remain in post on a secondment basis. These are technical changes that will not change the essential character of the Commission.</p>

  <p>The other issue was whether the Commission&#8217;s development functions should be integrated with other support from Highlands and Islands Enterprise. The consultation process has demonstrated a strong preference for maintaining separate specialist support for crofters, and accordingly I am content that these functions stay with the Commission. At the same time, however, I expect the Commission and HIE to work increasingly closely together.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive, together with the UK Government, is committed to dealing with the remaining liabilities at Dounreay safely and securely, in an environmentally acceptable manner, and in a way that represents value for money to the taxpayer. In order to achieve the long-term restoration of the site, a solution needs to be found to deal with the remaining fuels, including PFR fuels.</p>

  <p>As announced by Donald Dewar and John Battle in 1998, no new commercial reprocessing contracts have been sought by Dounreay since that date and this will continue to be the case.</p>

  <p>Following a comprehensive review of options for managing Dounreay PFR fuels, the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) has identified three options:</p>

  <p>the reprocessing or treatment of all PFR fuels at Dounreay;</p>

  <p>the transportation to Sellafield for reprocessing of the irradiated PFR fuels at the THORP plant and the treatment of unirradiated PFR fuels at Dounreay or elsewhere;</p>

  <p>the treatment of all PFR fuels for interim storage at Dounreay for an indefinite period or until a national waste repository is available.</p>

  <p>The UK Government has today launched a public consultation addressing the options for managing these fuels. The consultation will close on 2 June and the results will be made available to the public.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive will pursue key initiatives in the European and UK regulatory framework for e-commerce as proposed at the Lisbon summit. Through the National Grid for Learning programme, the Scottish Executive is already committed to connecting every school to the Internet, providing at least four modern computers for every class, and ensuring that teachers and pupils will have the ICT skills to make full use of them. Other direct actions for the Executive in implementing the conclusions of the summit include ensuring electronic access to those basic public services for which the Executive has responsibility. We will be reviewing this last initiative in light of the First Minister's announcement on Thursday 30 March that all devolved government services which can feasibly be delivered online should be available by 2005.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive will also have a role in promoting the development of high-speed telecommunications infrastructure, particularly in relation to higher and further education.</p>

  <p>Yes. I intend to bring forward a Bill to deal with various ECHR issues relating to bail, district courts and part-time sheriffs. The Bill will amend the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 by removing the present restrictions on the power of the sheriff to grant bail. It will therefore be a matter for the sheriff to determine whether to grant bail on the merits of the particular case. The Bill will also amend various aspects of the District Court (Scotland) Act 1975. In particular, it will prohibit the use of <i>ex officio</i> or other councillor justices in a judicial capacity, and introduce statutory security of tenure for Justices of the Peace in their judicial capacity. Finally, it will create a new judicial office of part-time sheriff with statutory terms and conditions to put their security of tenure beyond doubt.</p>

  <p>The projected cost for the refurbishment of St Andrew&#8217;s House is &pound;20 million, in line with the original estimate for this work.</p>

  <p>Most of the major systems in the building date from the 1930s. They no longer meet modern standards and major remedial work was required to allow continued use of the building for the long term.</p>

  <p>A survey of the building prepared by independent consultants in 1994 suggested that a full refurbishment undertaken then would have cost &pound;23 million. Consideration was given in 1998 to lesser and alternative refurbishment packages costing &pound;13.2 million and &pound;20 million. The less extensive of these covered essential repairs to the fabric of the building, removal of asbestos and a range of IT and electrical works. The additional work undertaken for the larger alternative, which has proceeded, includes a replacement of the windows, with consequential energy savings, and the range of construction works necessary to create a substantial amount of open plan space. This will lead to running cost savings once refurbishment is complete.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive considers the best way of improving the effectiveness of value for money from financial advisers is through a process of competitive selection and effective management of advisers. To that end it advocates the use of Treasury Taskforce Technical Note No. 3.</p>

  <p>There is no need to set guidelines on the amortisation of leases because there are already nationally agreed accounting conventions dealing with the amortisation of finance leases.</p>

The cross-party Renewing Local Democracy Working Group is also currently considering the most appropriate system for local government elections. This group is due to report in the spring. The timing of the next local government elections and the system by which councillors will be elected will be decided following our consideration of this consultation and the outcome of the Renewing Local Democracy Working Group.</p>

  <p>In our <i>Programme for Government</i> , we said that we would work across the Executive to promote modern government. The main themes will be customer-focused policy development and service delivery, making best use of information technology, and revaluing public service. We will encourage working in partnership with other bodies, the best modern management development, and use feedback from the public to improve all we do.</p>

  <p>A programme of this breadth and variety does not easily lend itself to assessment using individual performance indicators. But the First Minister announced on 30 March his decision that the Executive&#8217;s target for delivery of 100% of its services electronically by 2008 was being brought forward to 2005. We will be setting further targets and deadlines for achievements, and in general we will look for growing public satisfaction with public services as a measure of effectiveness and quality, and lower transaction costs as a measure of efficiency.</p>

  <p>There is no statutory definition of &quot;material consideration&quot; and it is ultimately for the courts to decide what is material. Government policy and guidance are, however, generally regarded as material in decisions on planning applications.</p>

  <p>There are at present no plans to introduce contraceptive measures to control the Scottish seal population but the Scottish Executive will continue to assess the potential of any such measures on an ongoing basis.</p>

  <p>In 1998, the Executive asked the Special Committee on Seals (SCOS) of the Natural Environment Research Council to assess whether contraceptive sterilisation of seals might be feasible to stabilise or reduce Scottish grey seal numbers. Canadian research had proved that a viable sterilisation method was available.</p>

  <p>On the basis of advice provided by SCOS it was concluded that there would be considerable practical and financial problems involved in attempting a successful sterilisation programme using this method in Scotland. Scottish seal populations are more scattered and more wary of humans than in Canada. In order to stabilise the grey seal population at its 1997 level of 95,000, it was estimated that a total of 14,000 adult females would need to be sterilised in the first year, with gradually reducing annual numbers thereafter reaching 3,000 after some seven years. In order to reduce the seal population below this level, much greater numbers of seals would need to be sterilised.

  <p>Five task forces were in operation prior to July 1999, two of which have since ceased. Five task forces have been established since July 1999.</p>

  <p>Task forces vary considerably, for example with respect to their life-span, membership and frequency of meetings. Administration costs are generally low and are in many cases subsumed in the administrative budgets of the relevant policy areas within the Executive.</p>
