  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-12071 by Rhona Brankin on 24 December 2004 and in light of the conference on autism held in Aviemore in November 2005, what the full range of medical interventions considered for people on the autistic spectrum was and how many of these medical interventions will now be recommended for people on the autistic spectrum as a result of the conference.</p>

  <p>This conference, organised by the Scottish Health Service Centre Management Centre on behalf of the Scottish Executive, is part of the implementation of the recommendations in the Public Health Institute of Scotland report on the needs of those with autism spectrum disorders. This report, commissioned by Scottish ministers, highlighted the need to disseminate research findings to health and social care professionals so that they could consider and apply these in their own localities where they thought it appropriate to do so.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive ASD Reference Group set up a conference planning group of experts in the field to plan the day. The programme included psycho-social interventions and the development of cognitive behaviour therapy; dietary interventions; pharmacological treatments; genetic counselling; improved assessment and diagnosis, and the individualised treatment of medical disorders often associated with autism.</p>

  <p>Invitations to the conference were distributed widely to health professionals; 97 of the delegates were from health professions. It is not possible to give a precise breakdown of the specialisms of those professionals who were invited to attend. Whilst a prominent immunologist was invited to speak, he had to withdraw at the last minute. However, a full conference report will be issued which will include sources of information on immunology to address this gap.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what additional burdens will be placed on local authorities by the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive and how these will be paid for.</p>

  <p>I have asked Dr. Paul Stollard, Chief Executive of the Scottish Building Standards Agency (SBSA), to answer. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>It is not possible to identify all the likely burdens imposed on local authorities as a consequence of the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, as each authority will deal with the challenges imposed by the Directive in a different way.</p>

  <p>However, the readily identifiable issues for the local authority building stock are:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>For housing there will be an obligation to provide energy performance certificates when dwellings are sold or rented out.</p>
<p>Large public buildings, over 1000m<sup>2</sup> floor area will need to display an energy performance certificate.</p>
<p>Air-conditioned buildings will need to have systems that are greater than 12kW inspected on a regular basis.</p>
<p>The local authorities will fund these obligations.</p>
</blockquote></p>

  <p>The issues for local authorities in their verification and enforcement role for directive matters that are addressed directly through the building standards system are likely to be:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>The methodology based system of compliance with the energy standards for new buildings.</p>
<p>The energy performance certification of existing housing through building standards assessments.</p>
<p>The recording of energy performance certificates on the building standards register.</p>
<p>Where non-compliance is identified regarding energy performance certification and air-conditioning inspection matters.</p>
</blockquote></p>

  <p>In all but the last of the above points, there will be a fee payable to the local authority. For the last point, enforcement duties are funded by Grant Aided Expenditure.</p>

  <p>I have asked Dr. Paul Stollard, Chief Executive of the Scottish Building Standards Agency (SBSA), to answer. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>COSLA were invited to a meeting in September 2005 about certification of local authority housing, but they were unable to attend. A meeting was held in early January 2006. Representatives from COSLA, the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations and Communities Scotland were present. The objective of this meeting was to make a start on developing a strategy that should ease the burden of domestic energy performance certification for both local authorities and registered social landlords. Further meetings will be held in due course.</p>

  <p>I have asked Dr. Paul Stollard, Chief Executive of the Scottish Building Standards Agency, to answer. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>It is considered unlikely that the directive will create many &quot;new inspectors&quot; per se. It is more likely that existing construction and property professionals will subsume the work created by the directive as a supplementary part of their existing business. The result of this could be that more persons embark on a career in property and construction. In view of this, reliable quantification of new property and construction professionals is near impossible as this will depend on how much directive work is subsumed by each business.</p>

  <p>As one of its core functions, the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland maintains the National Monuments Record of Scotland, our national archive of the built environment. The rapid growth of this archive, and the improvement of public access to it, have necessitated continuing investment over this period which will culminate in capital funding of &pound;2 million in 2006-07 and &pound;10 million in 2007-08 for new accommodation for the archive.</p>

We are prepared to consider the case for transitional financial assistance only once that planning task has been demonstrated to be complete and robust.&quot; ( <em>Official Report</em> c. 21623), whether these plans have to be submitted by a certain date or deadline and, if so, what that date is and whether the plans will be made public; how the additional funding of &pound;80 million to write off the accumulated deficit of NHS Argyll and Clyde was calculated, and whether the Minister for Health and Community Care will make a statement to the Parliament once the reports have been received, where MSPs will have the opportunity of asking questions.</p>

  <p>NHS Argyll and Clyde, in line with all NHS boards, is expected to agree a local delivery plan (LDP), including a five year strategic financial plan, with the Health Department by the end of March 2006. The plan will be allocated between the two successor boards, NHS Greater Glasgow and Highland, and both boards will be required to approve the plan with NHS Argyll and Clyde. Given that LDP&rsquo;s are approved by NHS boards, they will be made available publicly.</p>

  <p>With regard to the calculation of the &pound;80 million funding, I can confirm that this was based on NHS Argyll and Clyde&rsquo;s revised financial plan as submitted by the board in July 2005. The plan demonstrated a maximum accumulated deficit of &pound;80 million (for financial year 2006-07) with the board returning to in-year financial balance thereafter. The sum was therefore expected to cover all deficits incurred by the board and provide a clean slate to the successor boards.</p>

  <p>I do not propose making a statement to Parliament regarding local delivery plans.</p>

  <p>As outlined in the debate in Parliament regarding the future arrangements for health services in the Argyll and Clyde area, the area&rsquo;s financial resources will be allocated to the successor boards using the Arbuthnott formula. The formula ensures that funds are distributed fairly on the basis of relative health care needs of each board area and fully recognises the influence of remoteness and deprivation. This will ensure the successor boards are given their fair share of the resources available nationally.</p>

  <p>NHS Greater Glasgow and Highland intend to monitor both the financial and service impact of inheriting the former Argyll and Clyde area separately over the first few years in order to review progress. The Health Department will keep in regular contact with the successor boards regarding the impact of inheriting the former NHS Argyll and Clyde area, monitoring the situation closely.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will take separate legal advice with regard to the abolition of Rule 85 of the local government pension scheme, in light of conflicting legal advice reported by the UK Government, COSLA and UNISON.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive consulted on proposals for the amendment of the Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) in Scotland in September 2004. The proposals were intended to deal with the sustainability and affordability of the scheme as part of the on-going development of the LGPS and also to ensure that the scheme complied with EC Employment Directive 2000/78/EC, which establishes a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation.</p>

  <p>The Rule of 85 allows members of the LGPS to access full pension if they leave employment at age 60 or more but before the scheme&rsquo;s normal retirement age of 65, if their age and length of service (including any period since leaving local government employment) total at least 85.</p>

  <p>The Minister for Local Government in England and Wales announced, on 2 December 2005, that the UK Government had concluded that the Rule of 85 is to be removed from 1 October 2006 by amendments to the scheme regulations in England and Wales. The announcement stated that this was necessary in order to implement the terms of the EC Directive.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has given careful consideration to the legal opinion presented by COSLA on the question of the removal of the Rule of 85 from the Local Government Pension Scheme in Scotland and also that presented to the UK Government by UNISON. The Executive has concluded that retaining the rule would be incompatible with the Directive on age discrimination and that therefore it will require to be removed from the Local Government Pension Scheme with effect from October this year, in accordance with the UK Government&rsquo;s timetable for implementing the Directive.</p>

  <p>The Executive therefore intends that the Rule of 85 will be removed with effect from 1 October 2006 by amending the Local Government Pension Scheme (Scotland) Regulations 1998 in order to ensure compliance with the EC Directive and help maintain the sustainability and affordability of the Scottish scheme. Where it can be objectively justified consideration will be given to providing transitional protection to those existing scheme members who might have qualified to receive an unreduced early pension under the rule if it was not removed, and who may not have sufficient time to make alternative savings plans for their retirement. As was set out in the Executive&rsquo;s consultation paper in September 2004, it is proposed that protection be provided to those existing scheme members who would satisfy the current Rule of 85 and attain age 60 by 31 March 2013. However, during the period of consultation the Executive will wish to discuss such proposals further with representatives of the local employers and unions representing LGPS members.</p>

  <p>The Executive will prepare draft Regulations to implement the removal of the rule and publish these for consultation shortly.</p>

  <p>In respect of the online section between Mollinsburn and Haggs the majority of air quality impacts will be insignificant. The predicted impacts of the whole scheme are shown in Section 14 of the Environmental Statement (the Air Quality section) which is available on the scheme website at <a href="http://www.m80steppstohaggs.com" target="_blank">http://www.m80steppstohaggs.com</a> .</p>
