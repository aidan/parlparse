  <p>The Criminal Injuries Compensation Board will be wound up on 31 March 2000. The board was set up to administer the original criminal injuries compensation scheme established in 1964. That scheme ended in April 1996 and a new tariff-based scheme administered by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority and the Criminal Injuries Compensation Appeals Panel was introduced. Since then the board has been dealing with the residual claims lodged under the original scheme. This is now largely complete and the board will wind up on 31 March. Any remaining old scheme cases still outstanding at that time will be resolved by legally qualified members of the CICAP.</p>

  <p>I am sure that all Ministers, including those of previous administrations, would wish to join me in extending a sincere vote of thanks to all board members, past and present, for the care and dedication with which they have dealt with claims over the past 35 years.</p>

  <p>The recruitment of teachers to the supply pool is a matter for education authorities.</p>

  <p>Education authorities use a variety of approaches to manage supply cover and to attract qualified personnel to supply lists. The Scottish Executive is about to commission a small research project on the management of supply teachers in education authorities throughout Scotland. The survey should commence in March/April 2000. The project aims to review the systems in place to match the needs of schools with the available staff and to highlight best practice and the results will be shared with authorities.</p>

  <p>All patients receive an information leaflet with each dispensed prescription providing information on the safe and correct use of medicines including potential side-effects.

  <p>This is a matter for the clinical judgement of the GP who will determine the frequency of medication review for epileptic patients based on clinical need. Existing national clinical guidelines published by SIGN in 1997 on "the Diagnosis and Management of Epilepsy in Adults" are scheduled for review this year.</p>

  <p>The finance function within the Scottish Executive is currently the subject of an internal review which is aimed at ensuring that, following devolution, it continues to provide appropriate financial advice and control effectively. In pursuing this objective I will be interested also to see the outcome of the Finance Committee&#8217;s study of this issue. Ministerial responsibility for the finance function rests with me.</p>

  <p>It is for health boards, working with NHS Trusts to determine how best to use the additional resources in light of local needs and circumstances. The Chief Medical Officer has established a short-life group to examine how intensive care and high dependency services can be improved. The group will look at ways of improving the flexibility of these services and of matching provision with need. Health boards will be expected to take full account of the group&#8217;s recommendations when taking decisions about how the additional resources should be used.</p>

  <p>The detailed information requested is not available centrally. However, in general, managers employed by these employers on general and senior manager terms and conditions are on performance related pay. This would include, amongst others, the Chief Executive and Executive Directors of the Trusts and General Managers and Executive Directors of the health board. The Medical Director is unlikely to be employed on these terms.</p>

  <p>It is for each employer to determine specific targets attributable to each employee and to assess the individual&#8217;s performance in respect of completion of these targets. For senior management the Trust or Health Board Remuneration Committee is responsible for the performance management and appraisal system and for ensuring it is properly and robustly applied.</p>

  <p>The pay arrangements for Executive and Senior Managers in Trusts and health boards are currently being revised to bring managers under Ministerial direction and place them on Whitley terms and conditions of service. These arrangements will include guidance which stresses the need for employers to have robust performance management systems in place which identify managers individual contribution to improved patient care and to the aims and objectives of the employer.</p>

The figures shown below have been back-dated as far as possible for comparison purposes. Therefore, the Scottish Courts Administration and Parole Board staff (135 staff at Feb 2000) have been included within the core Office/Executive throughout the period, although the actual transfer of staff took place in July 1999.</p>

  <p>There are nine PFI waste-water schemes currently being developed on behalf of the Scottish water authorities. The value of these schemes is a matter for the PFI contractors but the equivalent capital cost by conventional procurement would be around &pound;600 million. Water authorities are currently conducting studies of their above- and below-ground assets comprising water and waste-water treatment works etc and the mains network of pipes supporting them.

  <p>For the period of the strategic review, 2000-01 and 2001-02, water authorities plan to invest around &pound;930 million in water and sewerage infrastructure. In addition to this, the water authorities will procure some major sewerage services through partnership schemes with the private sector. It is very difficult to make an assessment of the capital costs of PFI schemes &#8211; that is a matter for the PFI contractors themselves &#8211; but our best estimate would be around &pound;375 million, around 28% of the total investment required for the same period.</p>
