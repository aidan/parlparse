  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-21638 by Patricia Ferguson on 12 January 2006 and if, in the event of a successful bid by Glasgow for the 2014 Commonwealth Games it does become apparent &quot;that the UK will accrue similar benefits on a smaller scale&quot; to those that the Executive and Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government expect the 2012 London Olympics to accrue for the United Kingdom, whether the Executive will seek similar financial support for the Glasgow Commonwealth Games from Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to that which Scotland has committed, and will commit, to the London Olympics.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no plans at present to seek additional financial support from Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government although its help in areas such as security and visas will be most important. The only financial support that Scotland has committed to the London Olympics is &pound;25 million of sports lottery funding all of which is to be spent in Scotland, on Scottish athletes. The Scottish Executive is exploring the possibilities of lottery monies being available to help fund the 2014 Commonwealth Games.</p>

  <p>Drug rehabilitation services are provided in a variety of settings, including out-patient clinics, day hospitals, residential facilities and by voluntary organisations within the community. Services are often offered to people with problems with drugs or alcohol or both. It is not always possible to separate drug treatment places from alcohol treatment places. The number of places within Scotland is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The expanded Scottish Drug Misuse Database will, in time, provide information on the total number of people receiving treatment and the type of treatment they are receiving.</p>

  <p>Services are delivered locally and it is therefore the responsibility of individual local authorities and NHS boards to determine and provide appropriate service provision to meet local needs and priorities from within the substantial resources available to them. This includes provision in the current year for spending by local authorities of &pound;1.6 billion on community care and funding in the current year of &pound;8.8 billion to the NHS.</p>

  <p><i>Building a Health Service Fit for The Future</i> (Bib. number 36608) and the Executive&rsquo;s response<i> Delivering for Health</i> (Bib. number 37847) set a clear direction for the development of services in the future, including for older people. We expect NHS boards and Regional Planning Groups to use them to deliver services and to drive their service improvement.</p>

  <p>The Range and Capacity Review Group is also looking at future care services for older people and investigating how services can be used as an alternative to long-term residential care. They are considering a range of issues such as more flexible services, step-up and step-down, and preventative care of long-term conditions. The group&rsquo;s findings are due in the spring.</p>

  <p>I have asked Dr. Paul Stollard, Chief Executive of the Scottish Building Standards Agency (SBSA), to answer. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Building Standards Technical Handbooks include reference to <i>The Design Guidance on Flood Damage to Dwellings </i>and<i> Preparing for Floods. </i>Both documents describe the likely effects of flooding on materials and elements of the building and assess various forms of construction and measures to reduce the risk of flood damage in dwellings.</p>

  <p>The resilience of buildings at risk of flooding is addressed in Scottish Planning Policy 7 &ndash; Planning and Flooding, which says that water resistant materials and forms of construction should be used as appropriate and conditions may be attached to planning permissions.</p>

  <p><i>Planning Advice Note 69: Planning and Building Standards Advice on Flooding</i>, published by the Scottish Executive in 2004, includes advice on flood resistant and resilient materials, and construction techniques. It has been referenced in replacement pages for the technical handbooks, due to be issued in February 2006. Additionally, the SBSA has also contributed to research presently being carried out by the Construction Industry Research and Information Association (CIRIA) on <i>Improving the Flood Resistance of Buildings Through Improved Materials, Methods and Details.</i></p>

  <p>New guidance will be issued by the SBSA on 1 February on greywater recycling and rainwater harvesting to reduce dependence on mains water. Guidance on sustainable urban drainage systems has been included in building regulations for several years. The agency also is soon to go to consultation on proposals to revise the guidance to the building regulations to take account of increased incidence of driving rain and wind loading and changed snow loadings.</p>

  <p>Together with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the other devolved administrations, the Scottish Executive is consulting on a National Adaptation Policy Framework that will develop a strategic approach to climate change adaptation and assist in identifying key risks and opportunities from the impacts of climate change.</p>

  <p>Under the agreement reached between member states on the EU budget 2007-13 on 16 December 2005 Structural Funds will continue to be available throughout Scotland. It is not yet possible to quantify the economic impact of this agreement on regional development funding.</p>

  <p>It has yet to be clarified how this funding will be divided between the European Social Fund (ESF) and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). The Executive is currently proposing four future programmes for Scotland: one ERDF and one ESF programme each for Highlands and Islands and for lowland and upland Scotland.</p>

  <p>Final funding figures are subject to agreement between the UK Government and Devolved Administrations and the Scottish Executive is actively involved in arguing Scotland&rsquo;s case with partners in the UK Government and the devolved administrations.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is very aware of the importance of keeping partner organisations such as the voluntary sector informed about the reducing levels of funding available as the current ESF Objective 3 Programme nears its end, and about the lower amounts of money which will come to Scotland in future 2007-13 Structural Fund Programmes. Partners have been kept informed through a variety of methods ranging from articles in the Objective 3 Newsletter, updates on the Objective 3 website, stakeholder events on the future of the Structural Funds, and individual letters issued to all project contacts.</p>

  <p>Despite the reduction in funding post 2006 it is important to remember that the vast majority of funding for economic development in Scotland comes from domestic sources. The Executive is committed to economic development in Scotland but is not reliant on Structural Funds to continue this agenda.</p>

  <p>Terms Of Reference</p>

  <p>G8 Summit Economic Impact Assessment</p>

  <p>Gleneagles, Scotland</p>

  <p>6 to 8 July 2005</p>

  <p>Introduction</p>

  <p>The annual G8 summit is a forum for leaders from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United States and the United Kingdom to discuss and take action on major economic and political issues. The scale of the event is such that wherever it is held amongst the G8 nations, there are associated economic impacts as a result of expenditures to prepare for and host the event, as well as from associated media and support services.</p>

  <p>The UK took over the presidency of the G8 forum in 2005 with the summit venue being confirmed as Gleneagles, Scotland and scheduled for 6 to 8 July 2005. Whilst the summit itself will only involve G8 delegations, the Scottish Executive is keen to hold a programme of ancillary events in the preceding period.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive and Scottish Enterprise wish to commission a study to assess the economic impact of the summit and supporting events, as well as assessing the value of the media exposure and the broader promotional benefits to Scotland from staging the summit. A separate Commercial Opportunities study, also commissioned jointly by the Executive and Scottish Enterprise, was completed in 2004. The study recommends options that will maximise the procurement benefits available to Scottish based firms and assesses the opportunities to use the leverage of the event to deliver further benefits in line with the Executive&rsquo;s Enterprise Strategy. The report will be made available to the preferred tenderer and should be fully considered when undertaking this study. In summary, the opportunities identified fall into the following categories; procurement of direct and additional services; sponsorship, profiling and promotion of Scotland; G8 summit themes (Africa and climate control); adding value, and business as usual (ensuring displacement is minimised).</p>

  <p>Costed proposals are invited for the research and this specification outlines the minimum requirements for the work.</p>

  <p>Background</p>

  <p>General: The UK holds the Presidency of the G8 in 2005. The Prime Minister announced that the Summit meeting will be held in Gleneagles, Perthshire, Scotland on 6 to 8 July 2005. G8 countries will be represented at the level of Heads of State or Government. Other Heads of State or Government have been on occasion invited to the G8 summit, by the country holding the Presidency. Participants will arrive on the first day and leave on the third.</p>

  <p>Delegation size and accommodation: All leaders and their immediate delegations will be accommodated at Gleneagles and a normal commercial contract has been agreed with the venue. It is estimated that there will be some 200 people in total, each comprising key advisers, essential security staff, interpreters and a certain number of domestic staff. The exact number of people in each delegation is for the individual country to determine and pay for.</p>

  <p>Transport: While there may be some traffic restrictions on certain roads at certain times, there are no plans to cut Perth off from Edinburgh or Glasgow during the event. There will be increased traffic from time to time in the central belt during the week of the summit but any restrictions will be clearly signed and advance warning given. The exact detail of which airports are to be used is still to be finalised.</p>

  <p>Accommodation: Due to the scale of the event, it is anticipated that hotel accommodation across Scotland will be affected in some way by the huge range of organisations involved in the summit. It will not be necessary however for tourists to avoid Scotland in the week of the summit. Scotland has a stock of excellent facilities and infrastructure which is used to coping well with major international events.</p>

  <p>Media: Based on past experience, there is the possibility of up to 3,000 media representatives covering the summit. Whilst it is hoped that the media will be accommodated as near as possible to the venue, it is likely that media delegates will be accommodated in hotels across central Scotland.</p>

  <p>Sponsorship: There is the possibility of sponsorship for the summit. Contracts will be put out to tender under normal government rules.</p>

  <p>Delegate gifts: Gifts will be given to summit leaders, spouses and other delegates. Promotional packs will also be provided to media delegates.</p>

  <p>Security: The cost of the security operation will be met by the UK Government. Tayside police are liaising with other police forces and government agencies and are confident that there will be no impact on community policing. There is no reason to believe that police cover will be reduced below what is operationally appropriate across Scotland. It is not envisaged that military or policing costs be included in the study.</p>

  <p>Protestors: Legitimate lawful protests will be allowed. It is too early to speculate regarding the numbers of protestors and their intentions.</p>

  <p>Local impact &ndash; Auchterarder and area<i>: </i>Any disruption to the local community will be kept to a minimum. Residents will not be prevented from living in their own homes. However, given the significant security implications, it is likely that there will be some disruption to local community service delivery. Given Auchterarder&rsquo;s proximity to Gleneagles, there will be a need to implement a traffic management plan in the area. Those with a legitimate reason to enter or leave Auchterarder will be allowed access to their homes and businesses.</p>

  <p>To assist with the post-event impact assessment, the preferred tenderer will be provided with any factual information on visitation numbers and expenditures by category when it becomes available.</p>

  <p>G8 Ancillary Events: The Scottish Executive is intent on holding a number of events during the run up to the summit. The key objectives of the events plan are to:</p>

  <p>Showcase Scotland to worldwide audience;</p>

  <p>Maximise economic benefits to Scotland from summit;</p>

  <p>Engage public in debate on and raise awareness of G8 themes of Africa and climate change, and</p>

  <p>Generate a sense of pride across Scotland that we are hosting the leaders of the most powerful countries in the world.</p>

  <p>Some of the events which have been organised, such as the Chambers of Commerce Summit, the Glasgow University Academic Conference and the Commonwealth Local Government Conference, are likely to generate economic impacts in their own right.</p>

  <p>Research Objectives</p>

  <p>The objectives of the study are:</p>

  <p>(i) To measure the economic impact of the G8 summit and supporting events on Tayside and Scotland;</p>

  <p>(ii) To identify the economic value of the media coverage of the summit, and</p>

  <p>(iii) To provide sound analysis which identifies the impact of the summit on Scotland&rsquo;s image as a tourism destination; events venue; source of desirable products, and place to live, work and do business.</p>

  <p>Research Methods</p>

  <p>It is anticipated that the research will be split into three sections to reflect the objectives set out above. The precise choice of methodology is down to the individual contractor and will differ for each section of the report but it is expected that it will combine both qualitative and quantitative methods and in addition to working with the available secondary data the research will necessitate some primary data-collection. Where this is the case, it is recognised that a single interview or questionnaire of the media/visitor delegation may be sufficient to cover all three objectives of the study and would avoid duplication. We expect tenderers to develop their methodology and to state advantages, disadvantages and possible difficulties with the chosen methodology and how obstacles would be handled and resolved. Further detail on minimum requirements and methodology for each section is provided below.</p>

  <p>Economic Impact Assessment: It is expected that the economic impact assessment will identify and quantify the impact of the G8 summit and supporting events on Tayside and Scotland. The assessment should capture pre-G8 summit activity from delegations, site visits and where possible, events convened as a result of the summit. Full consideration should be given to the short-term impacts, longer term effects and the distributional impacts associated with holding the summit in Scotland. It should include a full analysis of all costs and benefits associated with staging the summit in Scotland, taking into account expenditures by key bodies, delegates and visitors. Tourism impacts should also be captured with full consideration given to hotel occupancy levels and comparisons made with the same period last year. It is anticipated that this will entail primary data gathering, conducted using a combination of interviewer administered and self-completion questionnaires during the course of the summit, the period prior covering the range of ancillary events and also immediately after the summit. It is expected that each of the research groups will be questioned on common areas including visitor expenditure, length and location of stay, type of trip, accommodation used etc. However, given the likelihood that there will be difficulties in communicating directly with all groups, an innovative and original approach will be required and tenderers should outline their proposed methodology in this context.</p>

  <p>The assessment should be carried out in line with Treasury Green Book Guidance<sup>1</sup> and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&rsquo;s 3 Rs Guidance<sup>2</sup> on appraisal and evaluation. The study on business opportunities, which will be made available to the preferred tenderer should feed in to this work and contribute to the projected impacts associated with the summit.</p>

  <p>Valuation of Media Exposure: It is expected that the media assessment will separately identify the value of international television and written press exposure of Scotland in terms of advertising equivalent expenditure. Tenderers should outline their proposed methodology for collating and valuing international press and television coverage. It is likely that some UK press cuttings on the G8 summit will be collated by the Scottish Executive during the course of the summit and made available to the preferred bidder for valuation according to their proposed methodology.</p>

  <p>Impact on Scotland&rsquo;s Image: In addition to valuing the media exposure, a broader assessment is required to identify the impact of the Summit on Scotland&rsquo;s image, for example as a tourism destination; events venue; source of desirable products, and place to live, work and do business. This will, first of all, require a qualitative element to the media assessment outlined above. Second, we are keen to appoint a research team with experience in measuring perceptual and attitudinal change. While this section will require further primary research of visitors/delegates, it is possible that questions aimed at establishing this impact could also be incorporated into other interviews or questionnaires of visitors to Scotland for the summit. Tenderers should outline their proposed methodology for this part of the research.</p>

  <p>The report by SQW points to damage to property only occurring in a small number of cases. For private property, the likely impact on insurance premiums was also assessed and is likely to be negligible. In terms of civic property, &pound;6,720 will be paid to Edinburgh City Council for the clean up of the Jack Kane Centre, Calton Hill, Meadows and Princes Street Gardens; this has been included in the costs.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many of the 74 devolution issues dealt with by the Advocate-General ( <i>Official Report</i> , House of Commons, 15 November 2005; Vol. 439, c 808) were referred to her by the Executive or have involved discussions with the Executive and to what these issues related.</p>

  <p>None were referred to the Advocate General by the Scottish Executive. Devolution issues are essentially questions which arise in court proceedings - predominantly in criminal cases - about whether legislation is within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament or whether an act is within the legal competence of a member of the Executive - the precise definition is set out in Schedule 6 to the Scotland Act 1998. That schedule also prescribes the procedures to be followed in relation to such issues, the effect of paragraph five being that any devolution issue intimated to the Advocate General will also be intimated to the Lord Advocate. Thus, the Executive will be aware of the same devolution issues as the Advocate General. If appropriate, there may be discussion between the Executive and the Advocate General but, given the generally ad hoc and run-of-the-mill nature of those discussions, there is no central record of their number and nature.</p>

  <p>There is currently little information available on these issues in addition to that contained in the consultation paper <i>Planning Gain Supplement: a consultation</i> , issued by HM Treasury in December. These are issues on which views can be expressed on the consultation and we will discuss them further with HM Treasury. I can however confirm that, since HM Treasury has no direct funding relationship with Scottish local authorities, the money returned to Scotland, however, it may be assessed, will be distributed through the Executive.</p>

  <p>It is unhelpful to speculate as to information which would constitute a credible allegation. This will vary depending upon the circumstances of the alleged offence.

  <p>The information requested is not available.</p>

  <p>Data about injury road accidents are collected by the police and reported to the Scottish Executive using the Stats 19 statistical report form. Prior to 2005, these returns did not record any information about the causes of the accidents. However, limited information for 2005 and later years will become available in due course, as a new set of questions about the factors which may have contributed to the occurrence of accidents has been added to the Stats 19 returns.</p>

  <p>Integral demand management measures will be introduced to address specific traffic problems should they occur. Broadly speaking they could take the form of ramp metering or restrictions to the types of vehicles to control entry flows, or mainline metering to control flows on the motorway itself. Priority could be given to high occupancy and heavy goods vehicles. This issue was addressed at the Public Local Inquiry (PLI) held in October 2005. The Reporter is expected to make his recommendations to ministers in the spring of 2006. After considering the PLI Report Ministers will make a decision on the progression of the scheme.</p>

  <p>The A80 upgrading was originally split into three parts. Draft line orders for Phase 1 were published on 19 December 2003 and the draft compulsory purchase order (CPO) on 13 April 2004. Draft orders for phases 2 &amp; 3 were published on 26 November 2004 and the CPOs on 10 December 2004. Publication acknowledges that, subject to the receipt and consideration of objections, Scottish ministers would be content to proceed to construct the works described. Objections to the draft Orders for the M80 have been considered at Public Local Inquiry before a Reporter in October 2005 and I await his recommendations before deciding whether the scheme should proceed to construction and, if so, whether to the published details.</p>

  <p>These file deletions followed the normal practices of the Executive whereby files are recommended for destruction in accordance with retention and disposal schedules agreed with the National Archives of Scotland (NAS) and only after reviewing officers are satisfied that they contain no papers that are likely to be of continuing or historic interest. No files are destroyed without the agreement of NAS, whose staff work alongside Executive staff to ensure that the proper procedures are followed.</p>

  <p>There has been exceptional interest from young people in Project Scotland. As of 13 January 2006, and since its launch in May 2005, Project Scotland has had over 6,500 enquiries leading to 1,100 applications and 324 volunteers in placements. 298 individuals have had a Project Scotland subsistence allowance approved. Post-placement assistance for Project Scotland Volunteers takes the form of the personal development fund, which was allocated up to &pound;337,000 within the 2005-06 business plan. Of the 75 volunteers eligible to apply for the personal development fund, having completed their placement and volunteered for a minimum of six months, nine have applied and so far five personal development funds have been awarded. The remainder will be considered at the end of January. The initial focus for Project Scotland is to provide opportunities within Scotland, therefore no placements are currently located outside of Scotland.</p>
