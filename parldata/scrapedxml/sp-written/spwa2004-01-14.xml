  <p>The Scottish Executive has undertaken a wide-ranging consultation exercise to encourage debate on CAP reform. The Executive launched the three-month consultation with a conference in Edinburgh on 6 October. The consultation paper was sent to a wide range of stakeholders, including representatives of civic society. The consultation paper, along with background information and supporting analysis, is publicly available on the Scottish Executive website:</p>

  <p>http://www.scotland.gov.uk/about/ERADA/AgriPol/00017653/Economic.aspx</p>

  <p>Twelve public meetings have been held throughout Scotland to provide information on the CAP reform agreement and the consultation process. These were advertised nationally and locally, and were open to the general public.</p>

  <p>A series of regional stakeholder discussion groups have also taken place, with numbers kept at around 20 people representing a cross-section of regional interests. These meetings were organised on behalf of the Scottish Executive by rural partnerships and community planning partnerships, and participants included representatives from voluntary organisations.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether, under the provisions of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001, there is any reason why an employee of a registered social landlord (RSL) would have to leave their employment because a relative or partner owned, or was a director of, a company which is a preferred contractor of that RSL.</p>

  <p><a name="FinalCheck"></a> <strong> </strong> I have asked Angiolina Foster, Acting Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to reply. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Schedule 7 to the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 prohibits any registered social landlord (RSL) from granting benefits. Specifically, a benefit cannot be granted to a business trading for profit where either the principal proprietor of that business or a person directly concerned in the management of that business (a) is, or has been during the preceding 12 months, an officer or employee of the RSL or (b) is a close relative of any such person.</p>

  <p>For these purposes, the award of a contract would be treated as the grant of a benefit.</p>

  <p>The Scottish ministers have in effect approved certain exceptions to those restrictions. These include, for example, where the choice of contractors is severely limited in a very remote rural community.</p>

  <p>RSLs may, in very exceptional circumstances, make a payment or grant a benefit to a relevant business in which a close relative of an employee is a principal proprietor or is directly concerned in the management of a business with which the RSL has a commercial relationship. This would only apply where no alternative, reasonable option exists for procuring the product or service.</p>

  <p>Even in those cases the RSLs governing body must approve any exception used and be able to demonstrate that the employee concerned is not involved in any aspect of the contract procurement or management of the contract. This does not mean that an employee would have to leave their employment; however the RSL may have to bring their relationship with the contractor to an end.</p>

  <p>The prudential regime will be introduced for all local authorities from April 2004 and will replace the existing section 94 consent from ministers that permits local authorities to incur capital expenditure.</p>

  <p>From April 2004, it will be for individual authorities to decide for themselves what is an affordable and prudent level of borrowing in their circumstances. Ministers will, however, retain step in powers if there is an unsustainable increase in borrowing either across the UK as a whole, across Scotland or at an individual council level.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, with reference to its news release SEc356/2003 on 8 December 2003 and its financial inclusion strategy, what level of interest is considered to be &quot;extortionate&quot; in relation to the Department of Trade and Industry scheme to crack down on money lenders and what level is considered to be acceptable for the purpose of loans.</p>

  <p>The pilot project which is starting in Glasgow in April will be aimed at tackling illegal, unlicensed money lenders whose rates are likely to be "extortionate&quot; and accompanied with threats of violence and intimidation. In this respect no loans made by unlicensed loan sharks can be considered acceptable. In cases uncovered by investigations during this pilot, recourse will be by way of criminal proceedings rather than extortionate credit provisions.</p>

  <p>In respect of legal lending, there is no single interest rate level that can be considered acceptable or unacceptable in all circumstances. The Consumer Credit Act 1974 does not specify an acceptable rate of interest. It is for the courts to decide whether an interest rate is extortionate having had regard to all of the relevant circumstances of the particular case.</p>

  <p>The interim Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation 2003 was based on ward geography and therefore the relative ranking is not available by postcode. The ward geography was chosen as some key data sources were only readily available at this level and also because wards are &#8211; on average &#8211; smaller than the four-digit postcode.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is currently developing data sources that will enable the measurement of relative deprivation at small area level. Feedback from users indicator a need for measures of deprivation that are more applicable to small sub-ward and sub-postcode sector areas. The Scottish Executive is working to meet this need.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is not developing a strict definition of neighbourhood for use in the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SMID). Rather as part of the Scottish Neighbourhood Statistics (SNS) project work has been progressed to develop a small area &quot;statistical&quot; geography. This new geography will be used in the next SMID and will allow pockets of deprivation to be identified that may be overlooked by ward or postcode sector analyses.</p>

  <p>Through the SNS it will be possible for users to compare information at a common geography and also combine these small areas to form larger geographic aggregates that meet their specific needs, without causing disclosure of information on individuals through differencing.</p>

  <p>Promotion of British Sign Language (BSL) is being progressed in a number of different ways.</p>

  <p>The First Minister made the following commitment on 27 March 2003 (S1F-2624):</p>

  <p>&quot;The First Minister (Mr Jack McConnell): As a start, I believe that we should double the number of British Sign Language interpreters in Scotland and I have asked officials to prepare plans for how we might achieve that, which will be presented to whatever set of ministers occupies the Executive offices after the election.&quot; (<em>Official Report</em>, col. 20117).</p>

  <p>Scottish Executive officials are in active dialogue with deaf organisations and the Scottish Association of Sign Language Interpreters to produce these plans.</p>

  <p>The Equality Unit has sponsored a research project to investigate the experience of BSL users in accessing public services. This is being taken forward by the University of Bristol and the Deaf Studies Trust. In addition the Equality Unit is also sponsoring research on Translation, Interpreting and Communications Services, including British Sign Language. This is being taken forward by Heriot-Watt University. The value of these contracts is around &#163;80,000 in total.</p>

  <p>In the three-year period 2003-04, 2004-05 and 2005-06, the Scottish Executive is providing funding to the Scottish Association of Sign Language Interpreters (SASLI) under section 9 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968, of &#163;21,129, &#163;19,730, and &#163;19,016 respectively and, under section 10(1) of the act, &#163;23,712, in each of these years. In addition, &#163;13,230 is committed to SASLI under section 16B funding for financial year 2003-04.</p>

  <p>SASLI promotes and develops sign language interpreting services in Scotland by maintaining a register of interpreters. The organisation encourages and assists the training of people who wish to develop interpreting skills, thereby improving communication between deaf and hearing people as equal and participating members of the community.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is also funding several projects under the SEN Innovation Grants Programme supporting work relating to BSL. Further details are as follows.</p>

  <p>1. Scottish Sensory Centre (SSC)</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive core funds the Scottish Sensory Centre to act as a national source of information, advice and training for parents, teachers and other professionals working with children with sensory impairment. This includes a range of work relating to BSL.</p>

  <p>Scottish Borders Council provided the Chief Inspector of Social Work with comments on his report at the end of December 2003. The report is being finalised by the inspectorate in the light of this process and the Chief Inspector will send it to ministers shortly. This inspection had a broad remit and there was inevitably a great deal of material to examine. No formal timescale for publication has been set, but ministers expect to publish the report as soon as possible after its receipt.</p>
