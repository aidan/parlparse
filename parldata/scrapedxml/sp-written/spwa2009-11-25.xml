  <p>Support to local carers&rsquo; services is a matter for local authorities and health boards to determine on the basis of their local priorities.</p>

  <p>Local authorities&rsquo; net revenue expenditure on support for carers, including respite care, in 2007-08 (latest figures available) was &pound;117.034 million, compared with &pound;100 million in 2006-07.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has provided area health boards and the Scottish Ambulance Service with &pound;9 million between 2008-11 to develop and implement Carer Information Strategies. We have provided local authorities with over &pound;4 million as part of the local government settlement to provide an extra 10,000 respite weeks. We have provided over &pound;400,000 to fund three Young Carer Festivals, which provide young carers from all over Scotland with a break from caring. We are funding three young carer initiatives this year through a &pound;200,000 grant to a national carer organisation. We have funded other initiatives including three carer training pilots. The Scottish Government supports national carers organisations through grants made under section 10 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968. Over the next three years we are committed to awards totalling nearly &pound;100,000 to five organisations.</p>

  <p>The &pound;25 million from the UK Government budget funding for community district heating included approximately &pound;2.1 million in consequentials for the Scottish Government.</p>

  <p>It is for Scottish ministers to decide on the eventual allocation of consequential funding (general or the product of subsequent new funding) in light of Scottish needs and priorities. It does not follow that this funding would be allocated in similar areas to that allocated by Whitehall Departments.</p>

  <p>There is funding available to support biomass fired CHP/district heating in Scotland (up to &pound;100,000 per project) through the Communities and Renewable Energy Scheme. Our Energy Efficiency Action Plan Consultation paper: <em>Conserve and Save,</em> which we are currently consulting on, considers what Scottish Government support is needed for low carbon district heating.</p>

  <p>As the act is still relatively new, we are not planning a full review of the Act at this time, although we continue to monitor its impact.</p>

  <p>Work has been carried out by other bodies in relation to aspects of the 2006 act. The Scottish Law Commission&rsquo;s recent report (number 215) on succession recommended the repeal of section 29 of the 2006 act and its replacement by a new statutory regime providing succession rights for cohabitants.

  <p>In addition, the Nuffield Foundation have provided funding to Edinburgh University to carry out a study on legal practitioners&rsquo; perspectives on the cohabitation provisions of the 2006 act.

  <p>The Scottish Government is aware of the issues impacting on the supply of prescription medicines and is in contact with NHS National Services Scotland and Community Pharmacy Scotland to monitor any supply difficulties and, where possible, will take all appropriate steps to ensure continuity of supply.</p>

  <p>Article 81 of EC Directive 2001/83/EC requires that marketing authorisation holders and distributors of their medicines ensure, within the limits of their responsibilities, appropriate and continuous supplies of the medicines so that the needs of patients are met. This requirement was transposed into UK medicines legislation in 2005. Further information can be found on the MHRA website:<a href="http://www.mhra.gov.uk" target="_blank"> www.mhra.gov.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>On 13 November 2009, guidance was issued by the MHRA and other key organisations to help pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors to meet their obligations under article 81. This guidance has been drawn to the attention of NHSScotland under cover of a letter from the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Pharmaceutical Officer.

  <p>All bidders deemed capable, following the prequalification stage, of delivering a project of this size and importance are headquartered outwith Scotland. Brookfield Construction is a UK company, and while this project marks its first major construction project in Scotland, it has an excellent track record of healthcare delivery worldwide and has been actively looking to expand its presence north of the border.</p>

  <p>Brookfield Construction as a business is not a volume builder and does not carry and have to support significant numbers of current employees throughout the UK. It will therefore have to employ the people to deliver the project. As a construction business, their focus is on delivering to their skills which are primarily healthcare and high rise. The new Southern General Hospital fits these skills perfectly. Brookfield will establish a business in Scotland on the back of this project and rather than resourcing it through existing staff, will send only its core team of 20 to 30 people who have all worked on the submission, and seek the rest of the resource locally.</p>

The costs are (a) &pound;20 million capital and (b) &pound;24 million revenue over the 10 year contract.</p>

  <p>The procurement process was carried out and was fully compliant with EU regulations. The patient management system procurement was managed using the competitive dialogue procedure, under which following an OJEU Notice and an initial selection process, the purchaser then enters into dialogue with potential bidders, to develop one or more suitable solutions for its requirements and on which the chosen bidders will be invited to tender. The programme is part of the gateway review process with one review already undertaken and a further review planned prior to completion of the contract.</p>

  <p>The procurement process for the patient management system was comprehensive and involved 200 staff from five NHS health boards, NHS National Services Scotland and the Scottish Government. The NHS staff included doctors, nurses, health records officers, IT staff and operational managers. These staff were involved in functional, technical, legal and commercial meetings with the bidders.</p>

  <p>The patient management system advert placed on the 11 April 2009, attracted 73 notes of interest. Each of these potential contractors (bidders) was sent a pre-qualification questionnaire (PQQ), 23 responded to the questionnaire, of which nine were short-listed. All potential contractors ruled out were offered debriefing, of which five took up the offer of a meeting. Seven of the nine bidders responded to the specification document offering 10 potential solutions. After scoring the responses and having initial presentations in each area: functional, technical and commercial, four solutions from three bidders were short-listed to be taken forward in 2009.</p>

  <p>The bidding process adopted a weighting system in scoring potential bids. The highest weighting was given to the bidders capacity to deliver the clinical and business requirements, as outlined in the tender. Cost was the second highest weighted scoring factor. The selected preferred bidder was not the lowest cost tender but represented good value for money and was affordable for all five health boards. Intersystem, the preferred supplier, were in procurement terms the most economically advantageous tender</p>

  <p>In June 2008, we published <em>Healthy Eating Active Living: An action plan to improve diet, increase physical activity and tackle obesity. </em> This included a commitment to broaden out the pledge to provide free fruit to pregnant women and pre-school children using the model of market-led pregnancy cards from the major supermarkets, to encompass maternal and infant nutrition generally and not limited to specific models.</p>

  <p>In September 2008, I announced support of &pound;19 million of new money available to NHS health boards over the period 2008-11 to improve the nutrition of women of childbearing age, pregnant women and children under five in disadvantaged areas. The broad criteria within which NHS boards have been asked to work include increasing uptake of the healthy start scheme, to ensure that everyone who is eligible to claim vouchers to exchange for fresh fruit, vegetables, milk and infant formula does so; supporting work on increasing breastfeeding rates and investing in training for health professionals. Years one and two of that funding have already been allocated to NHS boards. Details of the allocation were outlined in CEL 36 (2008) Nutrition of women of childbearing age, pregnant women and children under five in disadvantaged areas, which can be found at: <a href="http://www.sehd.scot.nhs.uk/mels/CEL2008_36.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.sehd.scot.nhs.uk/mels/CEL2008_36.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-28892 on 25 November 2009, which refers to the broadening out of our commitment to support pregnant women. The aim of the broader commitment is to allow health boards to put in place strategic measures to reach a much wider audience of women, and then deliver those through for example: interventions by health professionals related to nutrition, including breastfeeding and weaning; maternity units achieving Baby Friendly Initiative status, ensuring that everyone who is entitled to claim for Healthy Start vouchers which can be exchanged for fruit, vegetables, fresh milk or infant formula at registered retailers do so, and ensuring that all sectors with a contribution to make in this area, e.g. community groups, pre school and voluntary sector are fully involved.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government receives, and will continue to receive for 2009-10 and 2010-11, the data by local authority on the number of respite weeks provided for all age groups and by each category of overnight and daytime respite weeks. This is in relation to the concordat commitment of providing an additional 10,000 respite weeks. Both the Scottish Government and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA) are monitoring the respite weeks provision.</p>

  <p>Scottish Government guidance on managing consultations makes clear that consultees should normally receive feedback on a consultation within a similar length of time to the period within which consultees were themselves asked to respond.</p>
