  <p>The numbers of charges reported to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service in each of the last five years relating to the consumption of alcohol in public places and which resulted in court proceedings being commenced are shown as follows.</p>

  <p>These charges amount to 25% of the charges reported to procurators fiscal during the relevant periods. In addition, procurators fiscal took direct measures such as issuing fiscal fines in another 67% of the reported charges and took no proceedings in 8% of the reported charges.</p>

  <p>Charges: Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, Sections 201, 202, 203</p>

  <p>There are three routes by which bluetongue could potentially enter Scotland: importation of infected animals, windborne spread of infected midges and movement of infected animals from affected parts of Great Britain.</p>

  <p>Currently only imports from the non-infected areas of the EU are permitted and these imported ruminants are routinely tested for bluetongue virus. In addition, the Met Office and the bluetongue reference laboratory have combined forces to monitor potential midge incursion. Movement of animals from an area (the Bluetongue Temporary Area) in eastern England, within which positive laboratory results have been obtained, are currently prohibited.</p>

  <p>We have also sent information on bluetongue symptoms and biosecurity advice to veterinary practices and farmers in Scotland; this information is also available on the Scottish Government website. Press releases and briefings with industry have highlighted the important role of those on the ground in being vigilant for signs of the disease and reporting any suspicions promptly.</p>

  <p>The Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 (the act) came into force in November 2005 with the aim of creating a stronger, better system for supporting children&rsquo;s learning. The act aims to ensure that all children and young people, including those with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), are provided with the necessary support to help them meet their individual needs and to help them make the most of their education.</p>

  <p>In light of both the National Autistic Society (NAS) Scotland&rsquo;s <em>make school make</em> <em>sense</em> report and the Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) report Education for pupils with autism spectrum disorders report an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) Education Working Group has been established to take forward the recommendations in both reports. The membership of this working group includes representation from NAS, the Scottish Society for Autism (SSA), the HMIE autism advisory group and Initial Teacher Education providers. The intended outcome of this group is the production of a resource pack/tool kit for education authorities (EAs) which will include: strategic planning for future service provision; guidance on the information EAs should be publishing for parents, and guidance to schools.</p>

  <p>Through initial teacher education and continuous professional development we expect all teachers to be able to fully support children and young people with autism in our classrooms.</p>

  <p>The Forth Estuary Transport Authority (FETA) and the City of Edinburgh Council (CEC) are the road authorities with responsibility for the toll plaza and the A90 route south of the Bridge. Decisions on bus priority measures in this area are a matter for these authorities.</p>

  <p>We are aware that a bus priority project for the northbound approach to the bridge is currently under consideration. Both FETA and CEC are working together to discuss options and plan for redesigning the approach to the Forth Road Bridge following the removal of tolls, and Scottish Government officials are assisting with these discussions where appropriate.</p>

  <p>The outcomes to be secured through the Additional Support Fund are expected to be the subject of forthcoming discussions with COSLA.</p>

  <p>It is the responsibility of each education authority to identify local training needs to ensure they have a range of suitably qualified staff in place to fully support all pupils. The Requirements for Teachers (Scotland) Regulations 2005 require education authorities to employ adequate numbers of teachers with the appropriate professional skills and knowledge for the teaching duties allocated to them.</p>

  <p>With regard to the review of mainstreaming, the Scottish Executive commissioned the Scottish Centre for Research in Education to evaluate the impact of the legislation. Their report, which was published in 2006, found no evidence that mainstreaming has a negative effect on pupil attainment and that, with proper preparation and support, inclusion is beneficial for all.</p>

  <p>We are committed to ensuring that all children receive the support they need in our schools and we will take what steps are necessary to ensure we achieve this. These steps include consideration, at some future date, of a review into the operation and implementation of mainstreaming policy.</p>

  <p>There are a range of ways we might define schools as being in areas of multiple deprivation, such as free school meal entitlement and the numbers of pupils living in the 10%, 15%, etc most deprived areas using the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation. It is not therefore possible at present to provide this information in the form requested.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has engaged consultants to carry out a study of Road Equivalent Tariff (RET). One of the consultants&rsquo; first tasks will be to develop proposals on the implementation of a pilot RET project in the Western Isles, as promised in our manifesto. As indicated in the reply to question S3W-3672 answered on 13 September 2007, the consultants have been asked to liaise with a range of stakeholders, including local authorities and regional transport partnerships, as they carry out their work. When appropriate, the Scottish Government will be involved in these discussions. It is anticipated that the consultants will be contacting these stakeholders shortly with the intention of a first meeting during October.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally. However, sportscotland prepares an annual monitoring report listing all planning applications on which they have been consulted. This identifies the site, what has been lost due to the development and what facility if any has been put in place either on site or elsewhere as compensation. It does not identify what form of development has prompted the planning application or the hectarage, and it only covers applications on which sportscotland have been consulted. The figures do not include any new pitches that may have been created without a formal planning consultation or any that might have been lost due to neglect or lack of use.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government and its public sector partners has an obligation to provide value for money in public service delivery.

  <p>The Scottish Government and its public sector partners has an obligation to provide value for money in pubic service delivery. The overall public spend on Public Notices advertising and recruitment was &pound;47 million in 2005-06.</p>

  <p>In the changing communication landscape the Scottish Government has set itself key challenges to deliver efficient modern services that are responsive to the needs of citizens. Both central and local government have made significant investments in the e-government agenda and believe this needs to be supplemented by a reduction in compulsory paper based administrative requirements so that more flexible and effective methods can be used to deliver information.</p>

  <p>In the short-term we will continue to use local newspapers where legislation requires this, but will review advertising procedures and content to allow us to develop best practice to ensure value for money is secured across the public sector. Any proposed changes to the legislation will provide Parliament with an opportunity to consider how the public sector can save money and improve communication both now and in the future.</p>

  <p>Separate statistics on health outcomes in those living close to landfill sites are not routinely gathered.</p>

  <p>There has, however, been research. In May 2004, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs published its report Review of Environmental and Health Effects of Waste Management: Municipal Solid and Similar Wastes. This suggested that there was a possible link between living close to a landfill site and some birth defects, and unusually low birth weight. The correlation was weak, however, and the study was not able to say that proximity of the landfill was a causal factor. The research may be found at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/research/health/index.htm" target="_blank">http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/research/health/index.htm</a>.</p>

  <p>The research was based on work carried out before the current enhanced regulatory regime for landfills came into full effect, and reflects historical practices.</p>
