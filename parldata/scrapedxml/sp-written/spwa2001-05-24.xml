  <p>The table below gives the number of homeless applications from households with children which were made during the years 1996-97 to 1998-99 under section 31 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 and which resulted in the household being secured permanent accommodation.</p>

  <p>Information about those applications which were made in 1999-2000 and 2000-01 is not yet available.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Figures are estimates based on around 92% of case returns received from local authorities. Estimates are made by grossing to the reported total number of applications and rounding to the nearest 100. See the Scottish Executive publication HSG/2000/5 for more details.</p>

  <p>2. The figures in any one year may include more than one application from the same household, since repeat applications cannot be identified.</p>

  <p>Section 22 of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 provides for the promotion of the welfare of children in need and the powers in section 25 relate to the provision of accommodation for young adults. Permanently accommodating homeless families with children under these sections in the years in question would be an unusual use of these powers by local authorities and we are not aware of them being so used.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is making more money available for health in Scotland this year than ever before &#8211; a total of &#163;5.9 billion, up 7.5% on last year. I have already announced substantial further growth in this budget over the next three years: by 2003-04, the annual health budget will be &#163;6.7 billion.</p>

  <p>It is for Health Boards and NHS Trusts to decide how to apply these increased resources to ensure the provision of modern, safe and effective health services for the population of their areas. This will include spending on infection control in line with guidelines provided by the Scottish Executive and to meet standards which are being developed by the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many houses (a) have been provided with disablement adaptations in each of the last three years and (b) will receive disablement adaptations in each of the next three years, broken down by local authority area.</p>

  <p>The number of houses provided with aids and adaptations, including disabled, by local authority housing departments is shown in the table. The number of houses provided with aids and adaptations, including disabled, provided by local authority social work departments is not collected centrally.</p>

  <p>In 1999 we introduced changes to the Building Standards (Scotland) Regulations 1990 requiring all new housing to be built to standards suitable for a disabled person to visit. Scottish Homes has introduced new housing design standards that contain barrier-free requirements. In addition, the <i>Programme for Government</i> sets a target of 20,000 new homes and improved homes for affordable renting or low cost owner occupation. These will be built to barrier free standards suitable to all.</p>

  <p>The 1996 Scottish House Condition Survey found that there were 254,000 dwellings with adaptations.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to forecast the number of houses that will be adapted in the future. This will depend on demand and priorities set by local authorities in the light of resources at their disposal and competing demands.</p>

  <p>Local authority housing expenditure for the last three years on aids and adaptations, including disabled, is shown in table 1. In addition, Scottish Homes spent &#163;1.885 million in 1998-99, &#163;2.727 million in 1999-2000 and &#163;2.352 million in 2000-01 on aids and adaptations to their own and housing association stock. Local authority social work revenue spending on aids and adaptations is shown in table 2.</p>

  <p>There has also been health board spending on aids and adaptations, including disabled, but this information is not collected centrally.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to forecast expenditure on housing adaptations for disabled people as this will depend on demand and the amounts earmarked by local authorities in the light of competing demand for resources.</p>

  <p>Table 1</p>

  <p>Local Authority Housing Capital Expenditure on Aids and Adaptations (including Disabled)</p>

In addition, the <i>Framework for Maternity Services</i> suggests that screening for foetal abnormality by ultrasound scan should be offered to pregnant women.</p>

  <p>Screening is offered to women in accordance with policies in each NHS Trust area and according to the clinical needs of the women and her choice in the uptake of the services offered.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mr George MacKenzie, Keeper of the Records of Scotland, to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The National Archives of Scotland (NAS) has received all the documents specified in section 4 of the Public Records (Scotland) Act 1937. These are Scottish records dating from 1189 to 1284.</p>

  <p>Under section 5(1) of the Public Records (Scotland) Act 1937 and section 3(8) of the Public Records Act 1958, NAS has in the last 10 years received more than 1,000 shelf metres of records relating to Scotland from UK Government bodies, including the Cabinet Office, Customs and Excise, Inland Revenue, Property Services Agency and the Board of Trade.</p>

  <p>The main operational records of the Scottish regiments consist of official war diaries, sent to the War Office and now available for consultation in the Public Record Office in London. Records up to 1,920 of individual soldiers&#8217; service and pensions are also available in the Public Record Office. Later service records are still in the custody of the Ministry of Defence. The NAS sees no reason to interfere with these arrangements.</p>

  <p>Operational issues such as service cancellations are a matter for ScotRail to address within a stringent performance regime operated by the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA). The Scottish Executive has no direct locus or powers to intervene. The SRA deposits a copy of its annual report in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre. That includes information on train cancellations by each train operating company. The most recent report is for the year 1999-2000.</p>

  <p>Scotland House is an inclusive body that involves a range of interests. Its principal components are the Scottish Executive EU Office (SEEUO) and Scotland Europa, which in turn houses a number of its subscribers. As indicated in the answers to questions S1W-960 and S1W-1437, the SEEUO is entirely funded by the Scottish Executive. As stated in the answer to question S1W-1208, the funding sources for the other residents of Scotland House, are a matter for them, and not for the Scottish Executive - except where these residents are Scottish public bodies.

  <p>Scotland House is an inclusive body that involves a range of interests. Its principal components are the Scottish Executive EU Office (SEEUO) and Scotland Europa, which in turn houses a number of its subscribers.</p>

  <p>As I mentioned in my response to question S1W-4409, Scotland House already has a high profile, as its Scottish residents raise Scotland&#8217;s profile in the EU in the course of their daily work. It has done this, for example, through discussions with representatives of the EU institutions, through seminars, through attending meetings of the institutions, and through meetings with the Brussels offices of other EU regions. Scotland Week, in October 1999, which was organised jointly with Scotland Europa, was the initial profile-raising event which had a very large impact. Over 1,000 delegates attended events in Scotland House during the week. Since its opening, at least 10,000 business visitors and seminar delegates have passed through the doors of Scotland House.</p>

  <p>The location itself, at the heart of the Brussels EU district, means that Scotland House is not only prominent but also close to the EU institutions. Examples of the level of Scotland House&#8217;s profile amongst these institutions include the fact that the Commission has hired Scotland House&#8217;s conference facilities to train its own staff, and that it chose Scotland House as the venue for a major seminar in March on the recent Cohesion Report, to which all Brussels-based regional representations were invited. Several of these regional representations have said that they look upon Scotland House &#8211; with its mix of public and private sector residents &#8211; as a model for their own offices. Additionally, on 11 December 2000, the then Minister for Environment, Sport and Culture, Sam Galbraith, opened a year-long &quot;Art for Europe&quot; exhibition in Scotland House, which raises the profile of the Scottish creative industries as well as of Scotland House to a much wider Brussels-based audience.</p>

  <p>The residents of Scotland House &#8211; the SEEUO included &#8211; intend to build on these successes to further promote Scotland&#8217;s interests in the EU.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. The Executive awards a large number of contracts of varying values over the course of each financial year.

  <p>Since announcing the Scottish Executive&#8217;s policy on relocation in September 1999, two bodies have been set up outwith Edinburgh or Glasgow. The Public Guardian&#8217;s Office has been set up in Falkirk and the Food Standards Agency in Aberdeen.</p>

  <p>The relocation policy includes a presumption against an Edinburgh location for new bodies such as the Public Guardian&#8217;s Office and the Food Standards Agency. Detailed analysis therefore concentrated on potential locations outwith Edinburgh.</p>

  <p>For new bodies the main cost difference is likely to relate to property. We estimate that compared with the range of costs for comparable accommodation in Edinburgh, there would have been potential cost savings on property of between &#163;50,000 and &#163;130,000 per annum for the Food Standards Agency and &#163;60,000 to &#163;140,000 per annum for the Public Guardian&#8217;s Office.</p>

  <p>Where an existing body is relocated any accommodation savings would need to be set against the staff costs of a move. In these circumstances any net savings related to the particular relocation would take a number of years to accrue.</p>

The Scottish Executive will, however, continue to work through the sub-groups originally established by the forum, as well as new bodies such as the disabled persons&#8217; transport advisory group for Scotland in developing and delivering integrated transport policies for Scotland.</p>

  <p>The main means of co-ordination is the preparation of Children&#8217;s Services Plans, which is a requirement of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995. The Executive is currently taking forward a review of planning requirements for children&#8217;s services in conjunction with representatives from ADES, ADSW, COSLA and the voluntary sector. The Executive has also established an Action Team on Joint Working in Children&#8217;s Services. The team is to prepare an Action Plan which will detail how organisations could work together to provide integrated services for children and young people. The Action Plan will be produced in the autumn. In addition, the Changing Children&#8217;s Services Fund, launched by the First Minister last November, will further promote better integration of services.</p>

  <p>In Social Inclusion Partnerships (SIPs) local agencies combine to focus resources on the problems faced by young people and other excluded groups in areas of deprivation and exclusion.</p>
