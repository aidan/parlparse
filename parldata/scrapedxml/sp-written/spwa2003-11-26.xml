  <p>NHS24 has been operational in the Ayrshire and Arran NHS Board area since May 2003, dealing with calls from the public as well as handling out of hours calls on behalf of GPs. In the period immediately after its introduction, there was a significant increase in the number of out of hours calls assessed by NHS24 as requiring an emergency response by the Scottish Ambulance Service, compared to the number requested by the out-of-hours GP service over the same period in 2002. However, this number is steadily decreasing as NHS24 call handlers become more familiar with the systems that inform the decisions about the appropriate response for the patient.</p>

  <p>NHS24 is working closely with the Scottish Ambulance Service to maximise the effectiveness of the services provided by both organisations. If the member has any specific concerns about the operational activities of NHS24 or the ambulance service he should contact the relevant Chief Executive.</p>

  <p>Decisions on the future of existing stations are for the plant owners. The overall pattern of electricity production and consumption in 2010 including the proportion of non-renewable energy used will depend on a number of factors, including variations in fuel prices, energy efficiency, and the level of commitment by generators to refurbish or to build thermal plant.</p>

  <p>In NHS Argyll and Clyde and NHS Dumfries and Galloway there were no hospitals closed to acute admissions in the week beginning 10 November 2003.</p>

  <p>While neither of the two district general hospitals in Ayrshire and Arran were closed to emergency acute admissions, there were four short periods (two hours or less) of closure to GP referrals over the period. Both hospitals work flexibly over peak pressure periods to maintain acute admissions: when one hospital is closed to admissions, the other will receive.</p>

  <p>Lanarkshire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust received all arranged emergency admissions during the period. The three acute hospitals in Lanarkshire received all self presenters and patients arriving by ambulance at each hospital during the period. Wishaw General Hospital was closed to GP referred emergency admissions (general surgery) on 9 November into 10 November (19 hours) with those patients being received at Monklands Hospital. Hairmyres Hospital was closed to GP referred emergency admissions (general surgery only) on 12 November into 13 November (27 hours) with those patients being received at Monklands Hospital.</p>

  <p>In Greater Glasgow, the Victoria Infirmary closed to GP referrals (male admissions) once overnight (12 hours) and to all GP referrals twice (12 and 9 hours, respectively) during the period. The Southern General Hospital closed to GP referrals overnight once (four hours) during the period. Both Glasgow Royal Infirmary and Stobhill Hospital remained open to all acute admissions for the entire period. The Western Infirmary diverted GP emergencies on two occasions: once at night for a period of four hours (11 November) and once during the day for a period of two hours (17 November). All other patients (self-referrals, for example) continued to be treated at the Western Infirmary during this time. A total of six GP emergencies were diverted from the Western Infirmary to either Glasgow Royal Infirmary or Stobhill Hospital during the period.</p>

  <p>In the answer given to question S1W-24583 on 23 March 2002, I undertook to continue to report quarterly on the numbers of letters received by ministers and our performance in answering them. This is the second quarter in which I am reporting performance on letters only and not invitations.</p>

  <p>In the quarter July to September 2003, 2,619 letters were received for ministerial reply of which 66% received a reply within 17 working days, and 84% received a reply within 25 working days. In the same period ministers received 783 invitations.</p>

  <p>It is very important to make sure that the additional pressures that winter brings to health and social care services do not disrupt care for patients and clients. The NHS and its planning partners are now preparing for this winter with plans developed upon the experience of previous winters. Health boards are only too well aware of the pressures that winter can bring and there is no complacency in their approach to preparations.</p>

  <p>Plans will include extra staff, more beds, increased critical care capacity, additional nursing home places, and continued co-ordinated action on delayed discharge. This is supported by significant extra investment with health spending set to increase on average by more than &pound;630 million each year from 2003-04 to 2005-06 and &pound;30 million allocated specifically to address delayed discharges from hospitals.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not maintain records on the emissions from the terrestrial trunked radio network in Scotland. The Radiocommunications Agency undertake measurements from TETRA and cellular base stations on a United Kingdom basis and publish these results on their website at <a href="http://www.radio.gov.uk/" target="_blank">www.radio.gov.uk</a> .</p>
