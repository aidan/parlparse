  <p>These sectors receive over &pound;300 million annually in direct payments, confirming the importance I place on their role in the rural economy. Acknowledging the current income position, the Scottish Executive is working with the industry to find new and innovative ways to help each sector increase its income from the market.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will make representations to Her Majesty&#8217;s Government as to why information regarding litigation by the Ministry of Defence against manufacturers of the Chinook FADEC system was apparently not made available to the fatal accident inquiry in 1996 into the crash of ZD576 RAF Chinook on the Mull of Kintyre, and whether it can confirm that it has now received all documentation relating thereto.</p>

  <p>When allegations about the FADEC system were first made the Crown Office immediately sought and thereafter obtained a very full account of the issue from the Ministry of Defence. The litigation, which was settled out of court, related to the test of a pre-production version of the software in conditions of simulated battle damage. There is no evidence to suggest that information about that matter would have made a difference to the outcome of the Fatal Accident Inquiry and, accordingly, no further documentation is required.</p>

  <p>The views of the Scottish Executive were reflected in the Government&#8217;s response to the Select Committee&#8217;s report. That response did not endorse any particular management policy.

  <p>This question covers two types of bodies; those that receive funds direct from the Scottish Ministers and those who are funded indirectly through other bodies. Information on the latter category is not readily available. To obtain this information would involve disproportionate cost.</p>

  <p>Of those bodies that receive grants from the Scottish Ministers, the bodies listed below receive less than 50% of their income from public funds as defined under section 21(5) of the Public Finance and Accountability Bill.</p>

  <p>In addition to the bodies listed below, the Scottish Ministers pay grants from the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund. The grants are paid to a variety of organisations including companies, local authorities and educational institutions. The application process for these grants does not require applicants to inform the Executive of their annual income and it is therefore not possible to ascertain, without disproportionate costs, which bodies receive less than 50% of their funding from the Scottish Ministers. There are some other recipients of public funds for which establishing whether they received less than 50% of their income from public funds would involve disproportionate cost. These include payments made under the Regional Selective Assistance Scheme and those made to voluntary organisations for projects involving social issues, housing, supporting the rural economy and architectural heritage.</p>

There have also been a range of technical accounting changes and transfer to and from other votes. The baseline provision for administration &#8211; net of end-year flexibility &#8211; has been reduced from the original plans.

  <p>As I made clear in the debate on Structural Funds on 28 October, I have decided that a Review should be conducted of the operation of the Programme Management Executives (PMEs) and their relationship with the Scottish Executive. The aim of this Review is to clarify and define roles in order to ensure the efficient and effective delivery of the new round of Structural Funds in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Review will be conducted by a team of Scottish Executive staff and staff from the PMEs. To provide strategic guidance to the Review I have appointed a Steering Committee. I am pleased that Lex Gold, Director of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, has agreed to chair the Steering Committee. The other members will be:</p>

  <p>Sandy Brady, Director of Strategy, Highlands &amp; Islands Enterprise.</p>

  <p>Campbell Christie, Member, Economic and Social Committee and Chair of Scotland Europa.</p>

  <p>Alistair Grimes, Chief Executive, Community Enterprise Strathclyde.</p>

  <p>Councillor Christine May, European and International Spokesperson, COSLA and Leader of Fife Council.</p>

  <p>Sally Watson, Lecturer, Lews Castle College, Stornoway.</p>

  <p>Steering Committee meetings will be advised by Scottish Executive officials and a Programme Management Executive Director.</p>

  <p>I look forward to receiving the results of the Review early next year so that they can be fed in to the preparations for implementing the new round of Structural Funds.</p>

  <p>When health professionals were advised in July of the introduction of the immunisation programme, it was believed that polysaccharide meningococcal vaccine for students would become available during September. In the event less vaccine was available at the start of September than had been hoped, but adequate supplies for all appropriate students were received in the following weeks.</p>

  <p>Communications from the Scottish Executive Health Department to students and general practitioners made it clear that vaccine would become available gradually during September and that relevant students should discuss vaccine availability with their general practice. It was also made clear that vaccine availability, and varying dates of commencement of term, would mean that a number of students would have to be immunised after arrival at their place of study, rather than by their own GP.</p>

  <p>As part of the implementation of the Acute Services Review, the Chief Medical Officer invited the Scottish Medical and Scientific Advisory Committee (SMASAC) to set up a multidisciplinary Working Group to develop a framework for the procurement of clinical radiology equipment, with particular reference to the management of cancer as one of the clinical priorities of the NHS in Scotland. The remit covers the replacement of outdated equipment as well as the assessment and planned implementation of new service developments related to cancer imaging.

  <p>Planning for the millennium celebrations throughout Glasgow has been co-ordinated by Greater Glasgow Health Board and Glasgow Royal Infirmary is only one of the many service providers involved.</p>

  <p>I understand that a major Casualty Clearance Station will be created and located in Ingram Street car park. All casualties from George Square and the Merchant City venues, other than those with life threatening injuries, will initially be taken to this facility for triage before receiving treatment if practical and subsequent transportation to any of the City&#8217;s hospitals if necessary. Should hospital treatment be required, transfer will be co-ordinated by the Scottish Ambulance Service to an appropriate designated hospital thereby distributing the pressures on the City&#8217;s A&amp;E Departments.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to predict how much money will be recovered or how many individuals will be subject to proceedings until the new regulations have been in force for a reasonable period. A sample of NHS prescription forms, dental claim forms or claims for other benefits such as free sight tests or optical vouchers will be subject to post payment checking. Where such checks confirm that a patient has evaded NHS charges or wrongfully claimed entitlement to NHS benefits or payments, that patient will be served with a penalty notice. There are no plans currently to write off charges wrongfully evaded.</p>

  <p>Action to combat patient evasion of NHS charges stems from a scrutiny of NHS prescription fraud commissioned by the Department of Health in 1997 which estimated that between &pound;70 million and &pound;100 million is lost to the NHS in England annually by patients wrongfully claiming entitlement to free prescriptions. This suggests that, pro rata, between &pound;7 million and &pound;10 million may be lost to the NHS in Scotland each year from prescription charge evasion.</p>

  <p>We already have some evidence of wrongful claims by patients in Scotland. Point of dispensing checks by community pharmacists of patient entitlement to free NHS prescriptions were introduced in Scotland last October. Since then, there has been an increase in the number of prescriptions on which charges have been collected by pharmacists, and in the number of pre-payment certificates (&quot;season tickets&quot;) purchased by patients.</p>

  <p>We have today issued a consultation letter to interested parties regarding casino opening hours. At present casinos must close at 4am. We propose an extension from 4am to 6am (except Sundays) for casinos in Scotland. Comments are requested by 31 January 2000.</p>

  <p>The Gaming Act 1968 imposes restrictions on the gaming hours that gaming establishments may open. Under Section 18 of the Act, casinos must close between 4am and 2pm on Sundays. The hours on other days are prescribed by regulations made by the Scottish Ministers in respect of Scotland and the Secretary of State in respect of England and Wales. Under the Gaming Clubs (Hours and Charges)(Scotland) Regulations 1984, the opening hours of casinos are currently from 2pm until 4am.</p>

  <p>The British Casino Association, which represents all casinos in Great Britain, has asked for a change in the law to allow casinos to open until 6am on Monday to Saturday mornings.</p>

  <p>Following consultation with the Gaming Board for Great Britain, we have agreed in principle to the proposed change. Casinos are places for late night entertainment and we see no objection to a later closing time.</p>

  <p>Gambling is a reserved matter but some powers to make secondary legislation have been executively devolved to the Scottish Ministers, including gaming hours. The Home Office is embarking on a similar exercise in respect of casinos in England and Wales.</p>

  <p>I can give no such undertaking. Having taken decisions on the distribution of the funds available to the Justice programme, it is now for the Board of the Scottish Prison Service to decide on the adjustments to be made by the Agency which they plan to do within the next few weeks.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Prison Service have in place systems to record all telephone calls made by prisoners. This includes the capacity to trace the number called. In order to further control the use of telephones, consideration is being given to procuring a PIN Number System to restrict calls only to approved recipients.</p>

  <p>We understand that there are no examinations of potential monopoly practices in the dairy industry currently being investigated by the Department of Trade and Industry, the Office of Fair Trading or the Competition Commission. However, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry has invited comments from interested organisations on the proposals from Milk Marque to split into three successor bodies.</p>

  <p>Under normal procedures for competition enquiries whether Scotland should be considered a distinct market for goods or services will depend on the nature of any investigation being undertaken by the Office of Fair Trading or the Competition Commission. They will consider each case individually and take all factors into consideration before reaching a decision on the market structure.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is constantly in touch with Her Majesty&#8217;s Government on a range of matters. Responsibility for safety and security at the Faslane base, however, rests primarily with the Ministry of Defence. Strathclyde Police are responsible for dealing with safety and security matters requiring police involvement which arise outside Faslane&#8217;s perimeter. There is close liaison between both on these matters.</p>

  <p>A number of companies&#8217; market similar devices to the Fuelmaster. The UK Government's Energy Technology Support Unit (ETSU) evaluates these products on an ongoing basis, and the makers of Fuelmaster should contact the Unit to have their product evaluated, if they have not already done so. As ETSU provides a UK wide service, there is no need for the Scottish Executive to undertake a separate evaluation.</p>

  <p>The use of lead solder in domestic drinking water systems has been prohibited by the Water Supply Bylaws since 1987. A contravention of the Bylaws is a criminal offence liable to fines at level 4 on summary conviction and &pound;50 per day for a continuing offence.</p>

  <p>The recent discovery of lead solders in new buildings has resulted in the West of Scotland Water Authority issuing letters to the offending contractors requiring them to rectify the faults. The water authority has powers to rectify the faults and to recover the cost if the contractors concerned do not comply. In addition the water authorities have written to all plumbers and related trade organisations to remind them of the Bylaw requirements.<br /></p>
