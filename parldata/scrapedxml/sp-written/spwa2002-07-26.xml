  <p>The Motorola Taskforce (MTF) was able to make contact with 2,631 redundant employees of the Motorola plant at Easter Inch. Of these there are 2,099 in employment (this figure excludes self-employed and details as to part-/full-time are not available).

  <p>On 25 April 2001, Wendy Alexander announced in Parliament that the Scottish Executive was setting aside up to &#163;10 million to help fund the Motorola Taskforce's action plan. On 19 December 2001, Wendy Alexander further announced that the Scottish Executive would provide &#163;6 million (from the up to &#163;10 million which had been set aside) to the West Lothian Strategic Action Plan. The aim of the plan is to provide a three-year programme of specific actions to help get the West Lothian economy back on the growth track, and will commence imminently.</p>

  <p>Expenditure reports from Scottish Enterprise Edinburgh and Lothians (SEEL) for the financial year 2001-02 show costs of &#163;3.3 million. SEEL's projected costs for the financial year 2002-03 are &#163;150,000. The total costs from both the financial years amount to &#163;3.45 million.</p>

  <p>The MTF action plan set targets at the outset to evaluate the effectiveness of the response and to identify learning points and best practice. The objectives of the evaluation include:</p>

  <p>Mapping the process (including influencing factors; organisations involved; actions taken; and identification and analysis of outputs);</p>

  <p>Impact assessment (impact of intervention and other measure of effectiveness), and</p>

  <p>Recommendations (identification of learning points/good practice; recommendations for future redundancy responses).</p>

  <p>There are no central records of state aid payments to individual companies. However we have been able to establish that in July 1997 Fullarton Computer Industries Limited's operation in Kilwinning was offered Regional Selective Assistance amounting to &#163;600,000. The company did not meet the conditions necessary for full payment of grant but was paid &#163;350,000 based on what was achieved.</p>

  <p>Support was also granted by Scottish Enterprise Ayrshire of &#163;30,000 in July 1999, &#163;3,361 in November 2001 and &#163;22,110 in June 2002.</p>

  <p>No aid has been repaid, nor is there any remaining contractual obligations requiring repayment.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, with regard to the article by Douglas Friedli in Business AM on 26 June 2002, whether its strategy on the creation of a knowledge economy will be changed following research by Strathclyde University suggesting a divergence between the industries on which the strategy focuses and those that use skilled staff and technology most.</p>

  <p>The Executive's economic policies focus on quality, high-value added activity and high skilled jobs, wherever these are found in the economy. They are not wedded to any particular industry-based definition of knowledge economy activity. The Executive encourages enterprises to move up the value chain in any industry.</p>

  <p>Internationally accepted definitions such as the OECD definition of the "knowledge economy" are helpful and relevant in that they give a broad picture of Scotland's performance in those industries producing knowledge-based products. However, as with any industry-based definition of knowledge economy activity, there are limitations to the OECD definition. Such limitations are considered in the interpretation and use of such statistical sources.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether North Ayrshire Council should reconsider the outline planning permission granted to Border Biofuels Limited in relation to the building of an experimental biomass power plant close to the village of Whiting Bay on the Isle of Arran given that, since permission was granted to Border Biofuels Limited, the company has declared all existing staff redundant and recorded the resignation of all existing directors.</p>

  <p>National Planning Policy Guidelines (NPPGs) provide statements of Scottish Executive policy on nationally important land use and other planning matters. It is for the decision-maker (normally the planning authority) to assess the weight to be afforded to NPPGs and other relevant issues when reaching a decision.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how it allocated the &#163;16.75 million in Regional Selective Assistance recovered from Motorola at the time of the closure of the Easter Inch plant and how much of that money has been spent in generating new centres of employment in West Lothian or in supporting and improving the transport and communications infrastructure of the area.</p>

  <p>On 25 April 2001, Wendy Alexander announced in the Parliament that the Scottish Executive was setting aside up to &#163;10 million to help fund the Motorola Taskforce's action plan. Expenditure reports from Scottish Enterprise Edinburgh and Lothian (SEEL) for the financial year 2001-02 show costs to date of &#163;3.3 million for the activity of the Motorola Taskforce (MTF). SEEL's projected costs for the financial year 2002-03 are &#163;150,000. The total costs from both financial years amount to &#163;3.45 million.</p>

  <p>On 19 December 2001 Wendy Alexander further announced in the Parliament that the Scottish Executive will provide &#163;6 million (of the up to &#163;10 million which had been set aside) to the West Lothian Strategic Action Plan for economic development for the area. The aim of the Plan is to provide a three-year programme of specific actions to help get the West Lothian economy back on the growth track, and this work is currently under way.</p>

  <p>All recoveries of Regional Selective Assistance are returned to the Executive's budget, in line with normal procedure.</p>
