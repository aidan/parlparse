  <p>The Scottish Arts Council is the lead agency charged with maintaining a national overview of young people's involvement with the arts. The council continues, in partnership with arts organisations, local authorities and others, to develop a wide range of initiatives that engage with young people. Prominent among such initiatives are the links officer scheme, the cultural co-ordinator's scheme, the youth music initiative and the Dewar awards for talented young artists. The council's draft education strategy is currently out for consultation and will inform future support for this sector.</p>

  <p>Local authorities, health boards and other key agencies have a joint responsibility to plan and commission a full range of health and social care services, including respite. Part of that responsibility is to establish needs and priorities at a local level. The Executive's wide range of health and social care policies acknowledges the importance of respite to a range of vulnerable people and their carers. The answer to question S2W-3451 in 12 November 2003 provides information on the resources being made available to local authorities specifically to develop and expand respite provision across Scotland.</p>

  <p>Guidance issued by the Scottish Office in March 1996 (Circular SWSG 10-96) defines respite as &quot;any service of limited duration which benefits a dependent person. The distinctive feature of respite care is that the break should be a positive experience for the cared for person and the carer (where there is one) in order to enhance the quality of their lives and to support their relationship. Respite care can be provided within or outwith an individual's home and may extend from a few hours to a few weeks&quot;. We are working with local authorities, carers' organisations and key stakeholders to improve the data currently available on respite provision across Scotland. Part of that work involves revisiting the definition of respite care. It is important that any revised definition continues to reflect the importance of respite as a vital support to carers, as well as to the people they care for.</p>

  <p>The Executive makes resources available to enable local authorities to provide a full spectrum of social care services, including respite care for young carers and families affected by disability. Our partnership agreement reflects our firm commitment to develop and expand respite provision across Scotland and over the last three years &pound;22 million has been provided to authorities specifically to develop short break services. It is a matter for individual authorities to determine how their overall resources are used and how much is allocated towards providing respite care. Short break services are not available to families living on low incomes, unless they are affected by disability. A separate range of initiatives exist to assist such families.</p>

  <p>The Executive published guidance on how to run safer routes to school in 1999. A &quot;walking bus&quot; scheme led by a council education department was included in the guidance as an illustration of the type of project that might be undertaken. Advice on how to set up and run a &quot;walking bus&quot; is available through a number of websites set up by individual local authorities. In addition, Sustrans, the sustainable transport charity provides much guidance through its website on safe routes to school schemes including walking buses.</p>

  <p>It is for each local authority to decide how best to implement safer routes to school initiatives within its area. The Executive does not monitor individual local schemes centrally.</p>

  <p>One of the stated objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy is to provide sustainable environmental conditions; one of its guiding principles is consistence with other Community policies, including environmental policies.</p>

  <p>To that end, Article 1 of the Framework Regulation (EC/2371/2002) requires fisheries management decisions taken by European Council under the Common Fisheries Policy to provide coherent measures for limiting the environmental impacts of fishing.</p>

  <p>Commission proposals to regulate fishing activity are prepared by DG Fish and routinely circulated for inter-service consultation within the Commission itself, including to DG Environment. The proposals must take full account of existing Community regulations, including environmental, species or habitat protection requirements. Further, the Council is empowered to take emergency measures to restrict fishing activity where there is an immediate or unforeseen threat to the environment, as are individual member states.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether, under schedule 7 of the Housing (Scotland) 2001 Act, a person is prevented from serving on the board of a registered social landlord if a relative (a) owns or (b) is a director of a company that is on the approved list of contractors for that registered social landlord.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, acting Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Schedule 7 to the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 prohibits any registered social landlord (RSL) from granting benefits. Specifically, a benefit cannot be granted to a business trading for profit where either the principal proprietor of that business or a person directly concerned in the management of that business:</p>

  <p>(a) is, or has been during the preceding 12 months, an officer or employee of the RSL; or</p>

  <p>(b) is a close relative of any such person.</p>

  <p>For these purposes, the award of a contract would be treated as the grant of a benefit.</p>

  <p>The Scottish ministers have in effect approved certain exceptions to those restrictions. These include, for example, where the choice of contractors is severely limited in a very remote rural community. Even in those cases the RSL's governing body must approve the payment and be able to demonstrate that the business concerned was able to offer better value for money than any alternative.</p>

  <p>Validated waiting times figures for 31 December 2003 will be published by ISD Scotland on its &quot;NHSScotland Acute Activity, Waiting Times and Waiting Lists&quot; website on Thursday 26 February 2004.</p>

  <p>The latest available statistics &#8211; for 30 September 2003 &#8211; show that NHSScotland was making very good progress towards meeting our commitment that, from 31 December 2003, no patient with a guarantee will wait more than nine months for in-patient or day case treatment. On that date, 897 patients had waited more than nine months &#8211; a reduction of 2,940 (76%) on the position on 30 September 2002.</p>

  <p>As part of the local health plan process, the National Waiting Times Unit is currently meeting with NHS boards to agree local targets for 2004-05, which demonstrate good progress towards attainment of the national maximum waiting time of six months for in-patient and day case treatment, by 31 December 2005.</p>
