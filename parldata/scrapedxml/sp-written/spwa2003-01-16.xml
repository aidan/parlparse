  <p>The Executive has taken note of the concluding observations of the UN Committee. In the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill it is already seeking to clarify and tighten the law on physical punishment. Alongside this legislative approach, we also wish Scottish parents to have information on the possible effects of physical punishment, and to have access to positive parenting approaches to discipline. An information strategy is currently being developed, which will be co-ordinated with the implementation of the bill, to provide information on positive parenting approaches both to parents and to the professionals and agencies who support and advise them.</p>

  <p>No. Since managed clinical networks are an integral part of local health service delivery, responsibility for commissioning services will remain with NHS boards. Managed clinical networks will, however, provide boards with authoritative advice on the allocation of resources.</p>

  <p>Practical experience of an instant appointments system, under which people know the time of their hospital appointment before leaving their local surgery, has been achieved in four NHS board areas.</p>

  <p>This experience has led to a reassessment of the processes needed to meet the needs of both patients and health professionals. Appointments made before the patient leaves the GP surgery may be appropriate for some urgent clinical conditions, but for the bulk of conditions the key is to involve the patient appropriately in making the appointment and, thereafter, to keep the patient informed of progress.</p>

  <p>In common with the NHS in England, which has reached similar conclusions, we are now developing flexible processes to ensure that that involvement takes place throughout Scotland. These processes need not be electronic, but must be proactive, transparent and appropriate to the clinical and personal circumstances of the patient.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not centrally collected. I understand from the Glasgow Homoeopathic Hospital that while it is difficult to assess with accuracy of the number of statutory registerable health professionals who currently practice homeopathy in Scotland, as a useful indicator, however, it is known that over the last 10 years the following numbers of professionals have received training in homeopathy at the national centre of the Glasgow Homoeopathic Hospital:</p>

  <p>There has been a steady increase in the incidence of methycillin-resistant staphillococus aureus (MRSA) infections across the UK in recent years. As part of the Executive's drive to address health care-associated infection (HAI), the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health (SCIEH) monitors the incidence of MRSA bacteraemia infections (blood poisoning) in Scottish hospitals. Results have been published for each six-month period since April 2001. The latest three sets of results show no significant change in the rate of these MRSA infections.</p>

  <p>The incidence of MRSA reflects the complex interaction of a number of factors. MRSA exists in the community as well as in hospitals. Tackling health care associated infection, including MRSA, is an important priority for the NHS. I expect the service to continue to tackle HAI through a mix of prudent antibiotic prescribing, good hygiene and effective infection control procedures.</p>

  <p>The Executive believes that a growing population, with a highly skilled and motivated workforce, will help grow the economy. We want Scotland to be an attractive place to live and work for both individuals and businesses. Measures that will affect the size of Scotland&#146;s population range from those that ease the financial and practical difficulties of parenting to our collaboration with the enterprise networks and Scottish Development International on a number of initiatives to link Scottish businesses with successful Scots now living overseas and to attract those with appropriate skills to live and work in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Executive has made clear that it will not make use of these powers in the lifetime of this parliament. Separate estimates have not, therefore, been made of the likely effect on the economy, employment and poverty levels. Such forecasting would involve detailed modelling and would carry significant cost. It would also rapidly become out of date. The revenue effect has however been estimated. The most recent estimate is that for 2002-03, varying the basic rate by 1p would generate/cost &#163;230 million.</p>

  <p>Water fluoridation is one of the options on which views are sought in our current consultation paper <i>Towards Better Oral Health in Children</i> , and, as stated previously, the Executive is neutral on this particular issue.</p>

  <p>But this consultation is not simply a debate on fluoride. By any measure, oral health in Scotland compares poorly with other countries, and we need to build a consensus about how best to tackle this problem. Negative responses, simply rejecting one option or another, do not help build that consensus. As such, I would encourage individuals and organisations wishing to contribute substantively to the consultation to identify also the actions they favour.</p>

  <p>I have asked Dr Jon Hargreaves, Chief Executive of Scottish Water to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Preliminary investigations suggest the capital cost of upgrading Lerwick Wastewater Treatment Plant is in the region of &#163;4 million, with additional operating costs of &#163;75,000 per year.</p>

  <p>In terms of charges to business customers, in general wastewater charges are set each year based on overall cost estimates and it is not possible to assess the implication of a specific investment. However, trade effluent customers will be affected by an upgrade to the plant due to the introduction of secondary treatment. Scottish Water is speaking directly to those businesses affected to discuss possible options for minimising the impact of the increase.</p>

  <p>Significant progress continues to be made. We have launched national standards for the youth justice system; announced a planned increase of 25% in secure places; amended the Criminal Justice Bill to allow more information and support to victims; provided an additional &#163;6 million to local authorities for youth justice work and to improve IT capabilities; launched two major new funds &#150; the Intensive Support and Youth Crime Prevention Funds to support a wide range of local programmes to broaden the range of effective disposals available to hearings from the statutory and voluntary sectors, and helped enhance community safety through the recent Safer Scotland Police campaign.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer whether a condition of the contract between the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body in relation to the construction of the new Parliament building at Holyrood and EMBT/RMJM Ltd is that the architects have collateral warranties from EMBT Arquitectes and RMJM Scotland Ltd.</p>

  <p>The provision of collateral warranties was not a condition of the contract with EMBT/RMJM and, therefore, such warranties have never been sought or provided.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer, <a name="QuestionText"> further to his answer to question S1W-32000 on 10 December 2002, what the names were of those present at the meeting on 4 September 2001 with Bovis Lend Lease (Scotland) Ltd and representatives of Flour City International Inc. and Flour City Architectural Metals (UK) Ltd, whether there were any other meetings with these bodies other than that which took place on 4 September 2001 and, if so, on what date or dates such meetings took place and who attended.</a></p>

  <p>Those attending the meeting on 4 September 2001 were present in their capacity as representatives of their respective organisations, not as individuals in their own right. Any agreed actions or decisions are made on behalf of the organisations they represent and it would be inappropriate to identify individuals. I understand from the Convener of the Holyrood Progress Group that no other meetings took place involving members from the Holyrood Project Team.</p>
