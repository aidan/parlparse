  <p>I wrote to the three institutions on 21 June, conveying my agreement to the merger, and a news release announcing my decision was issued on 22 June. The next step will be to put the necessary Scottish Statutory Instrument in place to implement the merger. I would not expect implementation to take place before October.</p>

  <p>This is a reserved matter and the responsibility of the Department of Trade and Industry. As Vice-Chair of the Pilot joint oil industry/Government working group, I take a close interest in ensuring that research and development is kept at the top of the industry&#146;s agenda as research and development is essential if the Pilot objective of maintaining a strong and vibrant industry is to be achieved. Additionally, Scottish Enterprise is currently developing outline proposals to stimulate further oil and gas research and development activity.</p>

  <p>The trunk road maintenance contractors are not responsible for maintaining areas of land owned by the Scottish Executive which are outwith the trunk road boundary. These areas are the responsibility of the Scottish Executive.</p>
