  <p>Antisocial behaviour is a very real issue for local communities. We believe local authorities and other partners are best placed to decide how to allocate resources to tackle the issue. That is why antisocial behaviour and community safety funding is no longer ring-fenced and now forms part of the overall local government settlement. This gives local partners the increased freedom they have been looking for.</p>

  <p>Last week the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service launched its yearly Christmas campaign to highlight to the public that blood stocks are low and that new donors are needed urgently.</p>

  <p>The Blood Transfusion Service strives, through public relations work and publicity campaigns, to reach a wide number of people across Scotland who are potential donors.</p>

  <p>Key initiatives include Blood Donor 24, aimed at targeting key blood group shortages rapidly, with the help of committed existing donors. Other initiatives are World Blood Donor Day and Blood Donor Week each summer, the Blood Donor Award Ceremonies and the Three Times Promise.</p>

  <p>I have asked James Hynd, Acting Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>There is no maximum waiting time for the programme, which is demand-led. Waiting times are dependent on the number of householders applying, available resources, including capacity of the installer to respond and the circumstances relating to each installation. These circumstances can include technical issues such as the suitability of the fuel supply and the need for building warrants in an individual&rsquo;s home. They can also include individual issues such as whether the proposed installation date is convenient for the homeowner.</p>

  <p>The vouchers can be used at any time during the financial year and the scheme is funded by Transport Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises the role peatlands, including blanket bogs play in storing carbon. Maintaining and enhancing carbon stores will play an important role in our overall approach to tackling climate change. The preservation and enhancement of soil carbon will also be a key consideration of the Scottish Soil Strategy to be published in 2008. As part of the Scottish Rural Development Programme, Rural Development Contracts provide financial incentives for land managers to maintain and enhance blanket bogs, and thus the carbon stored within. In addition, rough grazings and other semi-natural areas such as blanket bogs are protected by the requirements of Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAEC) which applies to all land covered by the Single Farm Payment, other direct aid schemes and Less Favoured Areas Support Scheme 2007. GAEC will also apply to payments under the Scotland Rural Development Programme once it has been approved by the European Commission.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government encourages teleworking in several ways. This includes the provision of laptops, Blackberry mobile devices and Personal Digital Assistants (PDA) connected to the Scottish Government network. In addition, flexible working has formed a key part of the Diversity Strategy, <em>Positive About You</em> , since its launch in November 2000 and its aim is to ensure that staff are able to enjoy a satisfactory work-life balance. Teleworking can also play an important role in mitigating the impacts of transport.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is working with a number of organisations to promote, develop and implement travel plans to deliver measures, including teleworking where appropriate, which help to reduce the environmental, social and economic impacts associated with travel, both the commute to work as well as business trips. We are funding the Regional Transport Partnerships and Energy Saving Trust to work with public and private organisations to promote and deliver travel plans.</p>

  <p>The estimation of flood flows at any location is a matter for the local authorities and their professional advisors. However it is professional good practice to follow the methodologies set out in the Flood Estimation Handbook published by the Institute of Hydrology which take account of the catchment characteristics including development, affecting the catchment response to rainfall. This is consistent with the duty under the Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) Act 2003 to promote sustainable flood management when carrying out flood prevention functions.</p>

  <p>The value of the current fund is &pound;13 million. To date &pound;9 million has been allocated from the fund, therefore, at this time &pound;4 million is unallocated.</p>

  <p>However, six additional projects to the value of &pound;1.3 million are currently under consideration through the Strategic Timber Transport Scheme and another four, to the value of &pound;700,000, are under revision by the applicants. If all are accepted this will leave &pound;2 million unallocated, pending a final round of submissions in January 2008.</p>

  <p>Pre-submissions indicate that potential applications for the final round on 31 January 2008 already total &pound;1.9 million. If this came to fruition, then only &pound;100,000 of the original fund would be unallocated by the end completion date of 31 March 2008.</p>

  <p>Due to the long lead-in times associated with many of the approved partnership projects, there has been a delay in actual uptake of the grant monies. Projected total cash expenditure in the life of the Fund, by the end of March 2008, is approximately &pound;4 million. Therefore the carry over into the next tranche of the fund could be as much as &pound;9 million, dependant on performance of the projects up to 31 March 2008.</p>

  <p>The <em>Fife Structure Plan</em> was submitted to ministers in June 2006. Their consideration of the plan has been delayed whilst Fife Council re-appraise the housing allocations. It is expected that the council will submit proposed housing amendments to the plan at the end of this year, at which point, ministers will recommence their consideration of the whole plan. When deciding whether to approve a structure plan, ministers take account of all relevant factors including objections and representations, as well as national policy guidance such as <em>Scottish Planning Policy 3: Planning for Housing</em> . This requires structure plans to provide sufficient housing land to meet the assessed requirement for new dwellings.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Budget on 14 November 2007 confirmed that the International Development Fund is set at &pound;4.5 million for 2007-08, an increase in the inherited baseline budget of &pound;3 million. The full amount of the fund will be spent on development as administration costs are met from a separate budget.</p>

  <p>The majority of this year&rsquo;s allocation is committed to on-going projects but as a result of the election and the review of the international development policy that is underway, there is a small degree of flexibility in this year&rsquo;s International Development Fund. Scottish Government officials have been actively considering how best to utilise this by identifying priorities that are in line with existing policy commitments, with a primary focus on Malawi.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will be providing local government in Scotland with record levels of funding over the spending review period, as set out in the concordat. While it is for each local authority to allocate its resources on the basis of local needs and priorities, the concordat includes a commitment to make progress towards delivering an extra 10,000 respite weeks per annum. This will include respite for young carers.</p>

  <p>Under the concordat, the Scottish Government and local government, through COSLA, will also work together to develop policy and agree implementation and resources in areas where local government has a key interest. This includes respite and other support for an additional 1,000 young carers.</p>

  <p>As part of the new concordat, each local authority will reach agreement with the Scottish Government on all of the relevant deliverables.

  <p>No. The bureaucracy and central monitoring associated with the grants that are to be rolled up into the local government finance settlement with effect from 2008-09 will be removed. In its place, progress and achievements towards the national outcomes and commitments will be monitored in accordance with the reporting and oversight arrangements as set out in the concordat.

  <p>I am currently considering the NHSScotland Resource Allocation Committee&rsquo;s report and the views submitted to me by the Health and Sport Committee and by health boards. I expect to make a decision based on the report, and all the comments I have received, early in the New Year.</p>

  <p>The earliest that any change could be introduced would be in relation to allocations for 2009-10. As I have already indicated, if I decide to make any adjustments to health boards&rsquo; relative funding, no board would receive less funding than it does at present. Any resultant changes would be phased in over a number of years as has been the practice under both the previous SHARE and Arbuthnott formulae.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for dealing with planning applications for wind farms of less than 50MW and local planning matters rest with the planning authority. Once a valid planning application is received the authority has two months (or four months if the application is accompanied by an environmental statement) to give their decision unless an extension period is agreed with the applicant. Failure to meet this deadline allows the applicant the right of appeal to Scottish ministers on the grounds of non-determination.</p>

  <p>Wind farms over 50MW generating capacity are determined by Scottish ministers. Our aim is to make decisions quicker by improving the quality of applications, introducing more certainty about turnaround times and more robust procedures. I believe we can now work to an objective of having all applications determined within nine months, where there is no Public Local Inquiry.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers have appointed reporters from the Scottish Government Directorate of Planning and Environmental Appeals to conduct a public local inquiry into the proposed Beauly to Denny transmission line. Their role is to hear and consider all the evidence presented to the inquiry, including both oral and written evidence, and to report back to ministers who will ultimately be responsible for determining the application. Historic Scotland&rsquo;s written evidence to the inquiry will be considered as part of that process. It would be inappropriate for the Scottish Government to offer comment on any evidence which is subject to this inquiry process.</p>

  <p>The consultation draft of <em>SPP 11</em> , published in August 2006, proposed national minimum quantitative standards for open space for several categories of new development. Many respondents commented in some detail on this proposal. Whilst there was much support for minimum standards, significant concerns were raised about the inflexibility of imposing the same standards on developments throughout the country regardless of local circumstances. Concerns also centred on the potential impact on brownfield development, regeneration proposals and affordable housing.</p>

  <p>The planning system is operated largely by local authorities, and decisions about protection of and investment in local open space are generally best left to local authorities and local communities. The Scottish Government believes that locally determined open space strategies, rather than nationally imposed standards, are the best way of ensuring the provision of open space across Scotland is sensitive to local priorities and circumstances.</p>

  <p>The consultation draft of SPP 11 was published in August 2006. Although there was support in principle for statutory consultation on development affecting non-sporting greenspace, there was little support for consultation with Greenspace Scotland or Scottish Natural Heritage as was proposed. Neither of these two organisations supported the proposal. Scottish ministers do not consider that there is at present a suitable body with the responsibilities and resources to act as a statutory consultee for the wide range of non-sporting greenspace.</p>

  <p>SPP 11 encourages consultation with appropriate local and national interests, both on development proposals and, crucially, in the development of the local open space strategy. Any proposals involving the loss of protected open space will ultimately require to be notified to Scottish ministers before planning permission may be issued.</p>

  <p>It is the responsibility of individual public sector procuring bodies to monitor and evaluate their own PPP contracts and this is carried out through the payment mechanism which is contained within the contract documentation. The payment mechanism consists of performance and availability indicators and are tailored for each individual contract. Standardised PPP contract documentation is available for the main sectors such as schools and health on the Scottish Government Financial Partnerships Unit&rsquo;s website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/ppp" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/ppp</a> under the publications menu.</p>

  <p>In addition, there is a pre-financial close Key Stage Review which focuses on project management and monitoring during the construction and operational phases, and new operational guidance in the form of 2 Briefing Notes. These are also available on the website.</p>

  <p>The overarching objective of the Scottish Government is to promote economic growth across the whole of Scotland and for the benefit of all. There are no plans to introduce a specific funding stream for seaside towns. We have committed to a range of actions that will benefit all towns across Scotland and support their regeneration.</p>

  <p>As part of the Spending Review, we published proposals to remove or reduce the burden of business rates for a significant number of small businesses across Scotland. Reducing direct costs will give businesses a competitive advantage and a greater opportunity to grow and to invest in their future, which in turn will help kick-start the revival of our town and city centres.</p>

  <p>In addition, Scottish planning policy reinforces the role of town centres as locations for retailing and a wide mix of community and social activities, indicating that town centres should be the first choice for shopping and related developments.</p>

There is no specific funding available for the regeneration of seaside towns as tourism destinations. However, the government is working closely with the tourism industry in implementing the Tourism Framework for Change strategy and its ambition to increase tourism revenues by 50% in the decade to 2015.</p>

  <p>We estimate that around &pound;50 million over three years will be spent on waste delivery bodies. These resources will be spent on household and commercial waste prevention; developing markets for recycled materials; public education and awareness on waste and litter, including support for Keep Scotland Beautiful; the community recycling sector; advice to local authorities, and waste infrastructure. We are considering carefully with local authorities and others how best to spend the remaining waste resources (around &pound;100 million over the three years) in the zero waste budget, but our aim is to support the further development of infrastructure that will be required to meet future waste targets.</p>

  <p>National Indicator 39 in the concordat between the Scottish Government and local government relates to reducing the amount of waste sent to landfill in 2010, in line with the first EU Landfill Directive target. In addition, the Landfill Allowance Scheme places limits on the amounts of biodegradable municipal waste which can be sent to landfill. Authorities which exceed these limits can be subject to penalties. We will, of course, support work by local authorities to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfill through our zero waste budget. In addition, the rising cost of landfill provides a further incentive to find other ways of dealing with waste.</p>

  <p>Each case is considered on its merits and penalties are not automatic. Regulation 19 of the Landfill Allowances Scheme (Scotland) Regulations 2005 lay down the penalties that can be levied if an authority exceeds its allowance. These penalties are &pound;10 a tonne in 2005-06; &pound;25 a tonne in 2006-07; &pound;50 a tonne in 2007-08, and &pound;150 a tonne in subsequent years. In addition, if the United Kingdom should fail to meet Landfill Directive targets in 2010, 2013 and 2020, the regulations make provision for supplementary penalties for those authorities exceeding their allowances.</p>

  <p>Zero waste requires high-levels of recycling and composting and a greater emphasis on waste prevention. Figures from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency show that recycling and composting is increasing and the amount of waste going to landfill is falling. A number of steps are in place to tackle waste growth such as the Scottish Waste Awareness Group&rsquo;s Love Food Hate Waste campaign, on food waste; work by the Waste and Resources Action Programme with retailers on packaging and other waste; a home composting programme, and work by the community recycling sector to provide advice to householders on how to avoid waste. We recognise we need to do more on waste prevention and part of the zero waste budget will be allocated to work in this area. We are also committed to further improvements to the environmental performance of the public sector as a whole.</p>

  <p>It is possible to have a range of approaches, across local authorities, to making provision for learning support.

  <p>HM Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) is undertaking a specific evaluation of dyslexia and dyslexia-type difficulties over the period 2007-08.

  <p>There has been one enforcement notice served by local authorities to date under Section 26 of the Water Services etc. (Scotland) Act 2005.</p>

  <p>The primary purpose of the Code of Practice on Sewerage Nuisance &ndash;<em>Assessment and Control of Odour from Waste Water Treatment Works-</em> issued under terms of the Act in April 2006, is to minimise odour by providing management and operational control mechanisms for operators to implement to best practicable means and for local authorities to monitor compliance.</p>

  <p>An enforcement notice is issued if the code is not complied with or not likely to be complied with in a material regard, and as the vast majority of works are complying with the code by producing odour management plans and odour improvement plans if required, local authorities have not needed to pursue the enforcement notice route to expedite odour abatement action.</p>
