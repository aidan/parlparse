  <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service does not collect this information by health board area, but by operating division within its service. Health board area boundaries are not relevant to the ambulance service as they provide a national service.</p>

  <p>Ambulances also can be moved from one division to another to ensure that they are utilised effectively and to even out the mileage over the fleet.</p>

  <p>The figures by operating division are laid out in the following table:</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what action it is taking to encourage performing companies to stage public performances across Scotland, particularly in the north east.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-09-20.3.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80030" speakername="Patricia Ferguson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa0920.htm#2">

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not directly fund performing companies. It makes resources available both to local authorities and to the Scottish Arts Council to enable them to facilitate access to cultural activities, including the performing arts.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Arts Council provides core funding to 25 arts companies which have a touring remit. These companies tour across Scotland and beyond, and are broken down by art form in the following table.</p>

  <p><table cellspacing="0" border="1" cellpadding="2" width="50%">

</table></p>

  <p>For non core-funded companies the Scottish Arts Council has a number of funding streams which are specifically targeted to help with touring expenses. These funds are provided either by the Scottish Executive (voted funds) or the National Lottery, and are outlined in the following table.</p>

  <p><table cellspacing="0" border="1" cellpadding="2" width="75%">

</table></p>

  <p>Note: *The Cross-border subsidy is a joint arrangement between the respective UK Arts Councils and the amount stated is the Scottish Arts Council contribution.</p>

  <p>Additional support for touring is also provided through the Scottish Arts Council&rsquo;s more general budgets. The Scottish Arts Council has invested &pound;2 million in the recent refurbishment of His Majesty&rsquo;s Theatre in Aberdeen. It also provides core funding to the Lemon Tree Theatre (some &pound;178,000 in 2005-06). In addition, the Scottish Arts Council funds North East Arts Touring (NEAT) to promote performing arts work in venues throughout the North East of Scotland and to support other local promoters.</p>

  <p>The incidence of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in adults in Scotland is unknown. However, a national database is presently being piloted in four areas by eCare and the eSAY project in the Scottish Consortium for Learning Disability. This will include information on the number of adults diagnosed with ASD and will form the basis for data collection and service planning for the future.</p>

  <p>No data is collected at a national level relating to the incidence of autism spectrum disorder among people sleeping rough.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive funds Glasgow Homelessness Network to collect data from organisations providing services to rough sleepers across Scotland. Whilst this provides information about the physical and mental health of rough sleepers, and whether they are registered disabled, it does not include specific information on autism spectrum disorder.</p>

  <p>Regarding the collection of data on the incidence of autism spectrum disorder more generally, I refer to Lewis Macdonald&rsquo;s response to the answer to question S2W-19055 on 20 September 2005. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="../../../webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a>.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive liaises regularly with officials in the Department for Work and Pensions regarding council tax benefit take-up which is a reserved matter.</p>

  <p>The training of doctors is a continuous process from medical school graduation through the training grades to consultant or general practitioner level. To make the most appropriate use of the training capacity in NHSScotland the number of opportunities across the medical training grades must be broadly in balance with each other and ultimately aligned to meet the service needs for consultants and general practitioners.</p>

  <p>Workforce planning determines the number of training places in Scotland required both for the longer term and for the immediate transition to new training arrangements under the initiative Modernising Medical Careers (MMC.) The aim is to ensure that those doctors currently in the system in Scotland have every opportunity to remain here. In determining the detailed transitional arrangements for MMC, we are therefore considering Scotland&rsquo;s current pool of junior doctors to ensure that these arrangements make best use of the range of selection options which may be available, both for the training posts we have/need and the junior doctors who currently occupy them. Transitional arrangements are critical to avoid gaps in the medical workforce, future medical shortages and also over supply of trainee doctors in relation to available posts.</p>

  <p>The fundamental reform of postgraduate medical training, Modernising Medical Careers<i>,</i> has now commenced on a UK-wide basis. New two-year Foundation Programme appointments for graduates have been introduced and will be followed by specialty training programmes to train doctors to a level where they are eligible for appointment as a consultant or general practitioner.</p>

  <p>Modernising Medical Careers (MMC) is a UK initiative which the Scottish Executive fully supports. The Executive is working with NHS boards and NHS Education for Scotland in planning the implementation of MMC in Scotland, which includes arrangements for smooth transition from the current system. The number of places and detailed selection arrangements for the new MMC specialty training programmes have yet to be determined. The Executive&rsquo;s plans will include consideration of the range of potential selection and entry arrangements to ensure that they are appropriate to junior doctors competing for entry to these programmes from both MMC and pre-MMC training positions, and will incorporate transitional arrangements. The new competency-based approach of MMC will give due recognition to clinical experience acquired during training.</p>

  <p>In schools, teachers are aware of the need to be alert to any possible drug misuse. The Guidelines for the Management of Incidents of Drug Misuse, issued in June 2000, provides head teachers and other school staff with guidance on responding to information, allegation or evidence that children are misusing drugs within the school premises or grounds. It sets out action that should be taken in schools if a young person is found in possession of drugs, is suspected of intending to supply drugs, or suspected of being under the influence of drugs. This includes involving the police, social work and parents.</p>

  <p>Directors of Education, the independent sector and health and further education colleges have also been advised of the range of materials used in the Executive&rsquo;s &quot;Know the Score&quot; drugs communication campaign. These materials include a booklet on cannabis, as well as other resources which give information about the drug. Schools and colleges will require to consider the suitability of these materials when planning their drug education programmes for young people.</p>

One formal race equality impact assessment has been undertaken on the Smart Successful Scotland Strategy and processes have recently been put in place which will ensure Executive policies are screened in a more systematic way for their impact or likely impact on the promotion of race equality.</p>

  <p>The Executive&rsquo;s new Race Equality Scheme will be published at the end of November 2005 and will set out progress in departments on race equality, and the arrangements in place around consultation, impact assessment, monitoring and publishing.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the reasons are for the subsidy to NorthLink Ferries for providing ferry services to Orkney and Shetland increasing from the planned &pound;29.7 million to the actual &pound;63.3 million between 2002 and 2005.</p>

  <p>There are several reasons. The grant agreement of December 2000 between the Scottish ministers and NorthLink provided that NorthLink would receive a Base Annual Grant for each year of the contract towards the provision of the approved services. Those Base Annual Grant figures were expressed in April 2000 prices and the grant agreement provided that they would be re-valued annually to reflect inflation, using the Retail Price Index. The figure of &pound;29.7 million quoted in the question is simply an addition of the first three Base Annual Grant figures at April 2000 prices and so takes no account of inflation since then.</p>

  <p>The grant agreement also provided that NorthLink would be entitled to claim additional grant reflecting material changes in certain costs such as harbour dues, staff costs and fuel prices which could not be accurately calculated at the time the contract was signed. The &pound;29.7 million figure, again, makes no provision for these factors.</p>

  <p>NorthLink also advised the Scottish Executive that its business plans had been affected by a variety of other factors for which there was no recourse through the material change provisions in the grant agreement. These included: the commencement of a new, competing ferry service across the Pentland Firth in the period between the signing of the grant agreement and the start of the NorthLink service; the loss of Shetland freight business to a competing operator during 2002-03; delays to the completion of Scrabster Harbour which meant that the MV Hamnavoe had to be laid up for six months, and a number of additional cost factors which became apparent when the service came into operation.</p>

  <p>In order to keep the essential lifeline services operating, the Executive agreed to pay additional subsidy to NorthLink, over and above the contracted sums, but this was on the basis of an early re-tendering of the contract and the provision of the minimum support necessary to secure the continuity of the services.</p>

  <p>The basic grant line provides the basic grant figures uprated for inflation (but for only a 10 month period for 2004-05).</p>

  <p>The capital expenditure line reflects the provision in the grant agreement to pay NorthLink up to &pound;400,000 per annum in additional grant depending on the extent to which the aggregate capital expenditure related to the new vessels exceeded the grant agreement benchmark of &pound;88 million. The actual capital expenditure incurred triggered this allowance in full.</p>

  <p>The material change &ndash; staff costs line records the payments made to NorthLink as a result of actual staff costs being higher than projected in the company&rsquo;s bid. This provision stemmed from the fact that the previous operator would not release details of their staff costs to other bidders in the subsidy competition. From April 2004 the figures are notional as the support to NorthLink was provided through a single monthly payment without a specific sum hypothecated for material change.</p>

  <p>The material change &ndash; harbour dues line records the payments made to NorthLink as a result of actual harbour dues being higher than projected in the company&rsquo;s bid. This provision was necessary as the scale of harbour dues payable was unknown at the time of the subsidy competition, not least because some new facilities were still to be constructed. From April 2004 the figures are notional as the support to NorthLink was provided through a single monthly payment without a specific sum hypothecated for material change.</p>

  <p>The payments related to Scrabster Harbour delays were intended to meet some of the costs faced by NorthLink as a result of the delay in the completion of the new pier at Scrabster, including the costs of laying up the new vessel for that route and chartering a replacement for a period of approximately six months.</p>

  <p>The lease/loan payments were made in September 2004 and were aimed at paying off, in one instalment, a loan which NorthLink had entered into and leases related to some of the assets used by NorthLink. As a result, the Scottish Executive secured control of these assets for use in the follow-on contract. These payments also served to reduce the total level of support which NorthLink required as they involved interest payment savings.</p>

  <p>The additional funding line aims to present the additional funding that has been provided to NorthLink, over and above the other categories, to maintain its delivery of the lifeline services. However, this category has also been the source of funding to cover other items that could have been the subject of a material change claim under the terms of the grant agreement. For example, the grant agreement provided for NorthLink to bear the first 10% of any increase in fuel prices over the benchmark April 2000 figure. No material change claim for additional grant under this heading was made by the company before the funding system was changed in 2004. However, the company estimates that, up to 31 July 2005, it would have been entitled to approximately &pound;2.2 million to cover the increase in fuel prices over the 10% margin stipulated in the grant agreement. Allowing for this figure would reduce the additional funding awarded to NorthLink over the period October 2002 to July 2005 to &pound;14,372,732. There are also, for example, legal costs associated with the consideration of the applicability of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981 (TUPE) to the transfer of staff to NorthLink and costs arising from the outcome of the TUPE Employment Tribunal decision that fall into the same category.</p>

  <p>The grant agreement of December 2000 between the Scottish Executive and NorthLink Orkney and Shetland Ferries Ltd provided for basic grant payments, expressed in April 2000 prices, as follows:</p>

  <p>October 2002 to September 2003 - &pound;10.773 million</p>

  <p>October 2003 to September 2004 - &pound;9.662 million</p>

  <p>However, the agreement provided for these figures to be uprated in line with inflation and also made provision for extra payments to be made to the company principally to cover cost factors which were unknown at the time of the contract award and to cover cost increases (egg in fuel prices) that were beyond the control of the operator.</p>

  <p>The core work on the previous Northern Isles ferry tendering process (which culminated in an award of contract to NorthLink Orkney and Shetland Ferries Limited in December 2000) was carried out by a team based in the Transport Group of what is now the Scottish Executive Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning Department. However, inputs to the work were made by senior officials in Transport Group and by staff in a range of policy and professional divisions across the Scottish Office/Scottish Executive. It is not possible to quantify the staff costs incurred on this work by such officials as work on the tendering exercise represented only one element of their duties. On similar grounds, it is not possible to cost the ministerial involvement in the process. However, on the basis of the staff costs of the core team (without any allowance for general Scottish Office/Scottish Executive overheads relating, for example, to accommodation costs), it is estimated that a total of &pound;100,000 (in outturn prices) was spent on the exercise broken down as follows:</p>

  <p>Staffing - &pound;86,000</p>

  <p>Travel and Subsistence Expenses for Officials - &pound; 1,000</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive receives a range of correspondence from local authorities and other interested parties about flood prevention schemes which may be promoted by local authorities. During the statutory process for confirmation under the Flood Prevention (Scotland) Act 1961, representations may be received from local authorities in support of their application and/or from interested parties who, usually, are objecting to the application.</p>

  <p>Currently, the Executive is in receipt of representations from Moray Council, City of Glasgow Council and East Ayrshire Council in support of applications for confirmation of flood prevention schemes at; respectively, Forres, White Cart and Galston. A number of objections to the confirmation of these schemes have been received from interested parties. On 8 September, I announced in my answer to question S2W-19067 that we are inviting representations from interested parties on the terms of proposed modifications to the City of Edinburgh Council&rsquo;s Water of Leith Flood Prevention Scheme in light of the findings of a public local inquiry.

  <p>The costs above cover staff costs, and other related non-staff costs including stationery, training and legal costs. They do not include any overheads, for example accommodation, IT support, and personnel which are provided by NHS Quality Improvement Scotland.</p>

  <p>The increases in costs reflect the development of the organisation and growing workload over time. This includes greater emphasis on looking forward at possible future developments and supporting implementation of SMC recommendations across the NHS.</p>

  <p>There are regular meetings between colleagues working on eHealth systems for Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland. An important objective of these meetings is to ensure that information can be shared between these countries effectively. We intend to establish links between the evolving single record systems for the countries of the UK and this will be facilitated by the shared use of common information and technical standards, clinical dictionaries and coding standards and patient identifiers.</p>

  <p>NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS) has not published specific guidance on delivering an integrated falls and osteoporosis service. The issues were referred to in the National Overview <i>Older People in Acute Care,</i> published in February 2004 (Bib. number 31248). NHS QIS also issued in Scotland the NICE technology appraisal, on <i>Drugs for the secondary prevention of osteoporotic fragility fractures in postmenopausal women</i> , in January 2005.</p>

  <p>In addition, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) is working on two other relevant appraisals which NHS QIS will assess and provide advice on to NHSScotland when they are published. These are:</p>

  <p>The primary prevention of osteoporotic fragility fractures in postmenopausal women and,</p>

  <p>Section 5 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 requires that an RSL must comply, within a reasonable period, a local authority&rsquo;s request to provide accommodation for a homeless household, which is unintentionally homeless with a priority need, unless it has good reason not to. Section 5 also requires that the accommodation must be a Scottish secure tenancy (or in cases of anti-social behaviour a short Scottish secure tenancy) unless an express request for other accommodation has been made by the local authority.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers have issued guidance on what constitutes &quot;good reason&quot; for refusal of a request. This states where RSLs are unable to make appropriate accommodation available within six weeks then it has good reason for non-compliance. A RSL also has a good reason for non-compliance if the only accommodation it has available is of a specialist nature and this is not appropriate for the applicant.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service completed an upgrade of its electronic case management system in April 2002. Only case records created after that date contain complete data which is capable of electronic analysis. If a Procurator Fiscal amends a charge submitted by a reporting agency the database will record details only of the amended charge.</p>

  <p>2. The information in this table has been extracted from the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service&rsquo;s Case Management Database. The database is a live, operational database used to manage the processing of reports submitted to procurators fiscal by the police and other reporting agencies.</p>

  <p>3. The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service&rsquo;s Case Management Database is charge-based. The figures in the table therefore relate to the number of charges rather than the number of incidents that gave rise to such charges.</p>

  <p>4. There are 124 separate charge codes containing the word &quot;assault&quot;. The results in this table are restricted to the following charges: Assault includes - assault; assault injury. Assault to Severe Injury includes - assault to danger of life; assault disfigurement; assault severe injury; assault severe injury and danger of life; assault to severe injury, disfigurement; assault to severe injury, disfigurement, danger of life; assault to severe injury, disfigurement, impairment; assault to severe injury, impairment; assault to severe injury, impairment, danger of life.</p>

  <p>5. The results in the table are restricted to offences under the following sections of the Criminal Law Consolidation (Scotland) Act 1995 &ndash; Section 49 (possession of a knife), Section 49A (possession of a knife in school premises), and Section 47 (possession of an offensive weapon). Charges under section 47 have only been included where the weapon in question was a knife, an axe, scissors or an open blade razor.</p>

  <p>Facilities for evidence to be relayed by live TV link, in support of the provisions of the Vulnerable Witnesses (Scotland) Act 2004, including a link remote from the courthouse in which the case is being heard, are installed in 22 court sites across Scotland. The respective sites are detailed on the Scottish Court Service website at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/resources/courtroomtech/courtroomtech.asp?dir=home" target="_blank">http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/resources/courtroomtech/courtroomtech.asp?dir=home</a>.</p>

  <p>This provision is supplemented by portable equipment capable of being applied in other court locations.</p>

  <p>The 2004 act also allows for links to be made to non-court buildings and a permanent site for this purpose has been set up in Falkirk. Working with the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s Victims and Witnesses Unit, the Scottish Court Service is now looking to secure similar sites in each sheriffdom situated near the centres of population.</p>

  <p>The specific needs of those in rural and remote locations is also being addressed. The Scottish Court Service is negotiating with appropriate local authorities and academic institutions to use their existing video-conferencing facilities to set up live TV links on an ad-hoc basis in order to minimise the distances to be travelled by witnesses.</p>

  <p>Rail services between Aberdeen and Edinburgh are provided by both First ScotRail and GNER. Punctuality and reliability of First ScotRail services is measured on performance in seven Service Groups. In the Express Group, which includes the Aberdeen to Edinburgh service, punctuality has increased to 91.9% within 10 minutes of the scheduled arrival time compared with 82.4% in the same period in 2004-5. The average over the last 12 months has been 89.6%.</p>

  <p>In terms of reliability, 99.4% of trains ran on time in the most recent period reported on (24 July to 20 August) compared with 98% in the same period last year.</p>

  <p>The Executive intends shortly to extend the Service Quality Incentive Regime, which has been successful in raising service standards elsewhere, to the services between Aberdeen and Edinburgh. As well as checking levels of cleanliness, the regime looks to ensure that up-to-date travel information is displayed as appropriate on trains.

  <p>The franchise agreement contains a commitment by First ScotRail to a programme of improvements at stations worth over &pound;10 million. This will benefit all of the stations listed over the course of the franchise.</p>

  <p>There is a particular commitment to investment at Aberdeen station as this is one of the four major stations requiring significant station improvements. Over &pound;1.124 million has been set aside by First ScotRail for work at Aberdeen Station.</p>

  <p>The programme of works is subject to change over time, but information on the improvements planned is set out in the following table. The major works at Aberdeen must be completed by the fifth anniversary of the franchise though the works may be brought forward to take account of a development scheme in the city centre. The investments planned for other stations are over 2005 and 2006.</p>

  <p>Ticket barriers have been installed at Edinburgh Waverley and Haymarket. There are also peak hours checks of tickets at Aberdeen and Dundee stations. First ScotRail are also required by the franchise agreement to ensure that there is a member of staff on every train whose duties include the checking and sale of tickets.</p>

  <p>Revenue protection is monitored through a specific franchise management meeting. While First ScotRail are confident that ticketless travel has been reduced further actions have to be taken and there will be a need to evaluate the impact of the revenue protection plan. Progress will be monitored throughout the franchise but revenue information is commercially confidential and changes in revenue can occur for a number of reasons.</p>

  <p>It is a requirement of the franchise agreement that the franchisee have in place plans to minimise the level of ticketless travel and fare evasion across the Scottish rail network, at stations and on trains.</p>

  <p>First ScotRail are currently developing revised on-train ticket checking and selling instructions to create a consistent level of ticket checking in the routes serving the stations listed. At Aberdeen and Dundee stations First ScotRail are already required to have sufficient fare collecting staff to check each passengers ticket at the station during peak hours. Ticketing barriers will be installed at these stations within the next year and three new revenue management positions have recently been introduced on the Aberdeen to Edinburgh route.</p>

  <p>Data about injury road accidents are collected by the police and reported to the Scottish Executive using the STATS 19 statistical report form. These returns cover only road accidents in which one or more people were injured: they do not cover damage only accidents.</p>

  <p>The following table gives the numbers of such accidents which were identified in the STATS 19 returns as occurring on the A70 in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004, and those that had at least one fatality.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that the statistics given below are based upon the data which are held in the central statistical database and which were collected by the police at the time of the accident and subsequently reported to the Executive. They may differ from any figures which the local authorities would provide now, because they do not take account of any subsequent changes or corrections that local authorities may have made to the statistical information, for use at local level, about the location of each accident, based upon their knowledge of the roads and areas concerned.</p>

  <p>The answer given to S2W-18357 was that the findings of the A6091/A7 Route Action Plan (RAP) Study would be published following the outcome of the review of all outstanding RAP schemes. The review was completed in November 2002 however, as only one of the 13 schemes recommended in the RAP emerged from the review, the RAP study was not published. The successful schemes which emerged from the review were announced in a press release in March 2003.</p>

  <p>In the current financial year, &pound;8.1 million was included in the local government settlement in recognition of the responsibilities of local authorities under the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003. This provision is included in the total for the &quot;Remaining Leisure and Recreation&quot; line of Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE). In 2005-06 the total for this line was &pound;66.6 million and this was allocated between authorities in accordance with the distribution formula for that line.

  <p>Approaches to the teaching of Scottish culture and history fall within the environmental studies and expressive arts areas of the curriculum. The National Guidelines on Environmental Studies 5-14 advise that an understanding of the past should be developed through studies that include attention to Scottish, British, European and global contexts. The guidelines on Expressive Arts 5-14 include the aim of promoting an awareness of cultural heritage, values and diversity by encouraging recognition and understanding of cultural inheritance, traditions and values, and making comparisons with other groups and cultures. The 5-14 guidelines for English language and Personal and Social Development also stress the importance of maintaining a focus on the Scottish context. The guidelines are not specific about the precise aspects of Scottish culture and history to be studied.</p>

  <p>As students move onto upper secondary school education, there are opportunities within a range of National Qualifications courses to study topics related to Scottish culture and history. For example, the Highland clearances may be studied within the 1830s to 1930s option at Standard Grade and &quot;Nation and King&quot; within the Higher History course covers the Scottish Wars of Independence.</p>

  <p>Ambitious Excellent Schools sets out our agenda for the modernisation of education in Scotland. The purposes for education in <i>A Curriculum for Excellence</i> set out clearly the need for young people to develop knowledge and understanding of the world and Scotland&rsquo;s place in it. Learning about Scottish culture and history makes a major contribution to achieving our aims for young people and will be reflected in the developing curricular framework.</p>

  <p>There is no statutory national curriculum in Scotland. Approaches to the teaching of Scottish literature fall within the English Language Guidelines 5-14. The guidance stresses the importance of Scottish writing and writing about Scotland taking its place beside English literature in permeating the curriculum from an early stage. This provides the opportunity to examine critically the ideas, beliefs and emotions of Scottish writers, and to set them against the different insights and perspectives of writers from other places and other times. The guidelines are not specific about which works or Scottish writers are to be studied.</p>

  <p>As students move onto upper secondary school education, teachers are urged to take advantage of as many opportunities of studying and using the Scottish tongue in most of the component units in the levels from Access 3 to Higher. In the Higher English course, for example, the work of Robert Burns could be chosen by candidates to write a critical essay in which they must demonstrate the ability to understand, analyse and evaluate a writer they have studied.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive provides Learning and Teaching Scotland (LTS) with core funding part of which is directed towards supporting Scots language and literacy in Scottish schools. This funding has for example enabled LTS to develop resources such as a Tam O&rsquo;Shanter CD-ROM and an electronic resource on Edwin Morgan&rsquo;s poetry.</p>

  <p>Funding is also available from the Scottish Arts Council who support such projects as: Itchy Coo, a Scottish story book publishing company; BRAW (Books, Reading and Writing), a Scottish Book Trust initiative with an aim of getting books, particularly Scottish into schools and Live Literature Scotland (LLS), a unique funding scheme which takes Scottish writers, playwrights, poets, storytellers and their work to every corner of Scottish society.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive defines efficiency savings as either &quot;cash releasing&quot; or &quot;time releasing&quot;. A cash release saving is where an efficiency measure generates an actual resource saving because the organisation or function delivers the same service with less money. Time release savings are defined as efficiencies which do not release cash but allow frontline services to deliver more or better services with the same money.</p>

  <p>The revised <i>Efficiency Technical Notes</i> published on 6 September show that we have identified cash savings of &pound;407 million and time savings of &pound;88 million in 2005-06, cash savings of &pound;647 million and time savings of &pound;198 million in 2006-07 and cash savings of &pound;912 million and time savings of &pound;337 million in 2007-08.

  <p>The regulation of international trade is a reserved matter. However, the Scottish Executive continues to be in regular contact with DTI and other Government Departments on trade issues, including the EU Services Directive negotiations, to ensure that Scottish interests are fully taken account of.</p>

  <p>The Services Directive aims to break down barriers to cross border trade in services between EU member states by making it easier for providers to establish themselves and offer services in other member states by removing unnecessary regulation and bureaucracy. It also seeks to enable operators to provide services temporarily and/ or at a distance into other member states based on the rules in their country of origin.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive supports the UK position that while publicly-funded health and social care services should not be covered by the Directive it can (with appropriate derogations from the Country of Origin principle), besafely and constructively applied to health and social care services from the independent sector.

  <p>The value of bookings made through visitscotland.com for tourist providers in the Dumfries and Galloway area in the first eighteen months of its operation was &pound;88,000. This business represented 2% of all bookings made through visitscotland.com. during this period. The value of bookings made during the period January and June 2005 was &pound;130,000, which represented 3% of all Scottish bookings made through vistscotland.com. The latter figure is broadly in line with the proportion of Scottish tourism value accounted for by the area.</p>

  <p>Scottish Water has changed the way it disinfects drinking water supplies in the following areas:</p>

  <p>Edinburgh and Midlothian, Aberdeen, Inverness, Borders, Perthshire, Highlands, Western Isles, Grampian and Fife.</p>

  <p>The change has seen a switch from chlorination to chloramination as the principal method of disinfecting the public drinking water supply in those areas. Scottish Water does not currently intend to utilise chloramination at all of its treatment works and it does not have a programme for switching to chloramination across Scotland. Chloramination is just one of several disinfection methods approved for use on public water supplies. The final choice on the disinfection method to be used at a particular site is dependent on a number of factors, the principal one being the protection of public health.</p>

  <p>Scottish Water has not carried out any formal Environmental Impact Assessments prior to changing some disinfection processes from chlorination to chloramination. Chloramination is an industry approved disinfection process that has been utilised in the UK for nearly a century.</p>

  <p>Scottish Water has procedures in place to ensure that any large volume discharges of treated drinking water into the environment (chlorinated or chloraminated) are dealt with appropriately to minimise any environmental effects. Such discharges are made in accordance with Section 33 of the Water (Scotland) Act 1980.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency&rsquo;s assessment of the environmental risk from the use of chloramination showed that the risk was comparable to that from chlorine so its consenting and monitoring procedures for discharges have not changed for chloraminated waters.</p>

  <p>Ministers set objectives for the water industry after extensive consultation. Based on the objectives specified in the statement that ministers made to Parliament in February this year, Scottish Water submitted an integrated investment programme to the Water Industry Commission (WIC) as part of the Strategic Review of Charges (SRC) process. As required under the system of independent economic regulation set up, the WIC has assessed the lowest, overall, reasonable cost of delivering ministers&rsquo; objectives and the draft determination sets out its conclusions. The consultation period ends on the 23 September with an expectation that the final determination will be published at the end of November.</p>

  <p>Ministers have not set Scottish Water specific objectives for the reduction of leakage. Instead, they have set objectives based upon the performance of Scottish Water&rsquo;s assets according to a set of industry standard measures. They have also set further objectives. Taken as a whole, this effect is likely to bring about a reduction in the quantity of treated water lost by leakage.</p>
