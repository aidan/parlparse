  <p>The European Union has not designated any part of the south of Scotland as a mountainous region. On 14 July 2004, the Commission of the European Communities published a proposal for the European Union&rsquo;s rural development policy which will cover the period 2007-13. Included in the proposal is a commitment to review the definition of Less Favoured Areas. Stakeholder views will be sought before decisions are taken and the draft regulation will be subject to detailed negotiation before it is finally agreed.</p>

  <p>The Mental Health Division, which includes the work of the National Programme for Improving Mental Health and Well-Being, has identified sensory and communication loss as an area which requires attention within mental health promotion, prevention and mental health services. To help identify current needs and map current support services, resources and future requirements, a Sensory Loss Development Group, bringing together stakeholders from various relevant bodies, has been established and has now met on two occasions. The group is planning to commission work on an up to date identification and analysis of needs and on mapping of services and supports and likely future requirements.</p>

  <p>The work on needs analysis and mapping will take into account a broad spectrum of needs. The group will be asked to consider the inclusion of receptive and/or expressive aphasia, dyspraxia, dysarthria, semantic-pragmatic disorder and dysfluency. Work is expected to commence on the needs assessment and mapping exercise later this year, and is expected to continue to March 2006.</p>

  <p><em>The same as you?</em> recommended that Scottish Consortium for Learning Disability should set up a national network of support to local providers offering advice and training on the extra needs of people with profound and multiple disabilities. PAMIS, (Promoting A More Inclusive Society), a voluntary organisation that works in partnership with people with profound learning disabilities and their family carers, is developing this network, providing advice on issues such as non-verbal communication.</p>

  <p>NHS Quality Improvement Scotland&rsquo;s Learning Disability Quality Indicators include a focus on meeting general healthcare needs. Through these, NHS boards are asked to demonstrate how they identify and meet the communication needs of people with learning disabilities in assessment and care planning processes, and in providing primary care and community services.</p>

  <p>Data about injury road accidents are collected by the police and reported to the Scottish Executive using the Stats 19 statistical report form. These returns cover only road accidents in which one or more people were injured; they do not cover damage only accidents.</p>

  <p>The Stats 19 returns do not record the causes of the accidents. Under a pilot scheme, 14 police forces across Great Britain have been voluntarily submitting information on contributory factors to accidents along with their Stats 19 returns. However, it is not possible to use the pilot contributory factor data to provide figures which are representative of accidents in Scotland because only two police forces in Scotland took part in the scheme. I understand that the UK Government is analysing the pilot data and will publish an article later this year.</p>

  <p>Starting in January 2005, the pilot scheme will be replaced by a new set of questions on contributory factors, which will form an integral part of the Stats 19 injury road accident reporting system. Information about contributory factors should thereafter be supplied by all police forces for personal injury accidents which are reported either (a) following attendance at the scene by a police officer or (b) by a member of the public to police staff at a police station. There will be a code to identify drivers who were &quot;impaired by drugs (illicit or medicinal)&quot;.</p>

  <p>UK Government research, published in 2000, into the incidence of drugs in fatal road accident victims, including drivers, riders, passengers and pedestrians, found traces of illegal drugs in 18% of the sample group and traces of medicinal drugs in a further 6%. The research also found traces of alcohol in 32% of the samples (22% of the samples being over the drink drive limit). The research report TRL495 is available on the TRL website at <a href="http://www.trl.co.uk/1024/mainpage.asp?page=141" target="_blank">http://www.trl.co.uk/1024/mainpage.asp?page=141</a>.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of its commitment to stimulating creativity in young people, what provision it makes available to schools and colleges to develop seeing and drawing skills and to ensure that adequate craft skills are in place to allow a high standard of artistic impression to be delivered and whether it will consider setting up a working party to develop such provision.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive supported the production of a publication <em>Creativity in Education, </em> published by Learning and Teaching Scotland which was further enhanced through a practical toolkit for teachers, <em>Creativity Counts</em> . These publications support the relevance of developing creativity in the wider curriculum, extending it beyond the expressive arts and provide practical illustrations of how schools are developing creativity across the curriculum.</p>

  <p>National Qualifications are available at most levels in craft and design and at all levels in art and design, and Higher National qualifications are available in a variety of art and craft courses. These courses provide the framework for schools and further education colleges to cultivate a wide range of artistic and craft skills in their students. The actual structure and level of provision is a matter for local authorities and individual further education colleges to decide.</p>

  <p>The first stage of a review of the curriculum from age three to 18 got underway in November 2003 and the steering group is due to publish a paper by autumn 2004, outlining the draft principles and framework for a reviewed curriculum. It would not therefore be appropriate for the Executive to consider setting up a working party to further develop provision of artistic and craft skills for students at this stage.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not hold information related to the number of employment tribunal cases, or the level of any awards, on a central database and it could only be obtained at disproportionate cost. However, the Central Office of the Employment Tribunals in Scotland, The Eagle Building, 215 Bothwell Street, Glasgow, holds a public record of all Employment Tribunal cases brought in Scotland. Nor is it not possible to advise how much has been spent contesting claims to employment tribunals, as these costs are not accounted for separately.</p>

  <p>The proposals for tendering, published for consultation in June 2002, explained that we intended to restructure Caledonian MacBrayne into a publicly owned vessel owning and leasing company (VesCo) and an operating company (OpsCo).

  <p>Contingency plans covering a range of possible scenarios, including industrial action in the fire service, are continually kept under review.

  <p>Industrial relations within the fire service are primarily a matter for the local authority employers and the relevant trade unions and staff associations, under the auspices of the National Joint Council for Local Authorities Fire Brigades (NJC). On 26 August 2004, the NJC announced that it had reached formal agreement on the immediate full implementation of stages 2 and 3 of the pay award set out in the Fire Service Pay and Conditions Agreement of June 2003 between the employers and the Fire Brigades Union (FBU). The threat of industrial action, on which the FBU had been balloting its members, has therefore been lifted.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive welcomes the settlement of the dispute. This will enable both the employers and the Fire Brigades Union to deliver the commitment to the reform and modernisation of the fire service which underpins the pay deal.</p>

  <p>The new General Medical Services (GMS) contract came into force on 1 April 2004 and is one strand of the pay modernisation agenda which also covers the consultant contract and agenda for change. We have allocated &pound;3.5 million to NHS boards in Scotland for the period 2003-05 to support the establishment of pay modernisation teams in each local NHS system which will oversee the introduction and on-going implementation of the three strands of pay modernisation. Allocations by NHS board are shown in the following table.</p>

  <p>The precise cost to boards of implementing the new contract will not be known until later in the year once final details of out-of-hours re-provision and practices achievement levels under the terms of the new quality and outcomes framework are known. Such costs will, however, be covered by the record uplift in allocations to health boards from the Scottish Executive of &pound;370 million (7.8%) in 2003-04 and &pound;365 million (7.25%) in 2004-05. Details of the specific 2004-05 allocations to health boards for the new GMS contract element of pay modernisation are also shown in the following table.</p>

  <p>These record uplifts in allocation have been supplemented by further allocations to NHSScotland of &pound;30 million in 2003-04 and &pound;70 million in 2004-05 as a contribution to the costs of pay and service modernisation.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2004-09-01.25.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80123" speakername="Mr Jim Wallace" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-04/wa0901.htm#16">

  <p>Information on individual courses provided by higher education institutions (HEIs) is not held centrally. It is a matter for each institution to decide on which courses to offer.</p>

  <p>HEIs in Scotland receive support for taught post-graduate provision through the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council (SHEFC). SHEFC&rsquo;s funding contributes towards the costs of providing teaching and learning for students in Scottish HEIs; it does not provide support for students. Currently SHEFC funds approximately 7,500 places for taught post-graduate study at Scottish HEIs. This amounts to approximately &pound;28 million per annum. Support for post-graduate study is also available to students in Scotland through the Postgraduate Students&rsquo; Allowances Scheme (PSAS). Courses supported under PSAS are generally nine-month taught post-graduate diploma courses, on largely vocational subjects. Approximately 2,700 students are supported under PSAS each year, at a cost of approximately &pound;17 million per annum.</p>

  <p>In the UK as a whole, support for courses at masters and doctorate level is also provided by the Arts and Humanities Research Board (AHRB) and six UK Research Councils.</p>

  <p>However, it has never been the policy of this or any previous Government that every student accepted for a post-graduate course of study or research at HEIs should automatically receive support from public funds. Current funding arrangements are geared towards maintaining the excellence of UK research and contributing to the supply of highly trained manpower. Many students at this level obtain loans from banks, seek sponsorship, receive help from educational trusts or pursue their studies on a part-time basis.</p>

  <p>There are no plans to review conveyancing law in Scotland. The Executive has no evidence that the incidence of parties withdrawing from property deals prior to the conclusion of missives is widespread, nor are there grounds to believe that &quot;gazumping&quot; is a particular problem, even in areas where the housing market is particularly buoyant.</p>

  <p>The Housing Improvement Task Force considered the house buying and selling process in its final report, <em>Stewardship and Responsibility: A Policy Framework for Private Housing in Scotland</em>, published in March 2003. While the report contained a number of recommendations aimed at improving the operation of the housing market, it concluded that legislation to introduce a mandatory alternative to the customary buying and selling system would be out of proportion to the problems identified (including aspects such as blind bidding that can cause purchasers to overbid) and would reduce the flexibility for sellers to choose the method of selling their property, for example, by private negotiation, blind bidding or open auction.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the concerns ascribed in the <em>Press and Journal</em> of 31 July 2004 to Mr Brian Pack, that qualifying calves must be at least 75% beef genetic, are correct in relation to the condition of the beef envelope scheme announced by the Minister for Environment and Rural Development on 29 July 2004; in particular, by what means producers would be able to prove that the animals met this criterion, who would carry out the checking of such claims, whether this would be done by an existing body or a new one and, if it is proposed that the British Cattle Movement Service (BCMS) carry out this checking or otherwise be involved in the administration of this new rule, whether the Executive considers that the BCMS has the resources to do so, and whether the Executive consulted the BCMS on this or any other role that the BCMS is to play in the national beef envelope regime and, if so, on what date the BCMS was first consulted about the Executive&rsquo;s proposals and whether it will publish any correspondence of any kind between it and BCMS on this matter.</p>

  <p>The requirement is that qualifying calves must be at least 75% beef bred. The target population is progeny from suckler cows crossed with pure bred beef bulls, which is the backbone of Scottish beef production. Most suckler producers will therefore know whether their calves qualify. The department will check information linked to the calf&rsquo;s ear-tag, including its breed and its mother&rsquo;s breed using information held on the cattle tracing system which is maintained by BCMS.</p>

  <p>The target population is progeny from suckler cows crossed with pure bred beef bulls. Most suckler producers will therefore know whether their calves qualify.

  <p>The future number of consultant neurologists nationally will be shaped both by the workforce planning infrastructure, as outlined within the <em>Scottish Health Workforce Plan 2004 Baseline </em> document and the implications of <em>Modernising Medical Careers</em> and the recently published <em>Securing Future Practice</em> .</p>

  <p>The route to a consultant neurologist post is through specialist registrar training. At March 2004, the establishment was 21.2 Whole-Time Equivalent (WTE), a 50% increase from 14 WTE in March 2001. It is forecast that three trainees will achieve their Certificate of Completion of Specialist Training in 2004. The number of trainees in each specialty is reviewed by NHS Education for Scotland on an annual basis and adjusted accordingly, in light of service need.</p>

  <p>The number of epilepsy nurse specialists that are required in the future is a matter for individual NHS boards and relates to how epilepsy services are provided within the geographical area of their responsibility.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for providing details of the audit process rests with the NHS Scottish Consortia. I can confirm, however, that each member of the consortium has a schedule of annual visits in place, the purpose of these visits being to ensure that transport or disposal contractors are disposing of all waste in a secure, safe and appropriate manner.</p>

  <p>It is important to recognise that licensed operators must operate in accordance with all applicable legislation and the enforcement of the terms of the licence and prosecution for failing to comply with legislation are matters for the Scottish Environment Protection Agency.

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not retain figures relating to the ENABLE Thistle Travel Card Scheme.</p>

  <p>However, we have been informed by ENABLE that they receive approximately 20 to 30 enquiries per month from a range of potential transport users, transport centres and places like adult day centres, citizen advice bureaus and libraries. Some of these enquiries are requesting more Thistle Cards, others are to ask more about the scheme.</p>

  <p>We do not have a record of the number of enquiries which are directed to transport operators or others about the scheme.</p>

  <p>200,000 cards have been distributed to potential bus and train users since the launch in 2002. Staff guidelines and posters were distributed to transport operators throughout Scotland in September 2002.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, with reference to the article in <em>Scotland on Sunday</em> on 1 August 2004 by Murdo Macleod in which a Scottish Water spokeswoman said that, in order to ensure that Scottish Water delivered the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s requirements, Scottish Water had deliberately delayed the start of some of its projects to allow Scottish Water Solutions to take over the projects and to undertake a review, which specific projects were delayed and, in each case, what the intended and the delayed start date was, and whether it approved these delays.</p>

  <p>The capital procurement practices of Scottish Water&rsquo;s predecessor companies had been the subject of some criticism by the Water Industry Commissioner because they offered poor value for money. It is my understanding that the new board of Scottish Water withheld its approval for certain capital projects until it was satisfied that these criticisms could be properly addressed. While disappointed at any delays, I nevertheless regarded this as prudent action by the new board. The details of the projects involved are an operational matter for Scottish Water. I have asked the Chief Executive to write to you about this matter.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive <a name="QuestionText">whether it will take steps to ensure that work is allocated more quickly to improve the water and sewerage infrastructure; whether it is satisfied that its efforts to achieve this end have been satisfactory and, if so, whether it considers that the efforts of Scottish Water in this regard have also been adequate; whether it will take any further steps to improve the infrastructure and, if so, what steps; whether it is concerned that, if there are more delays, this will lead to the possibility of higher costs for the work through pressure on capacity if a number of contracts are rolled out at the same time rather than spread over the lifetime of the agreed Scottish Solutions schedule of work, and whether it will make a statement about the position, given the concerns raised and expressed in <em>Scotland on Sunday</em> on 1 August 2004.</a></p>

  <p>It is my understanding that, after initial delays, Scottish Water and its joint venture company, Scottish Water Solutions Ltd, are making satisfactory progress in the delivery of the capital programme. The details of allocations for work are, in the first instance an operational matter for Scottish Water and Scottish Water Solutions Ltd. I would not interfere in operational matters of this nature. I would, however, point out that delays in commissioning work of this nature can be caused by a number of factors beyond the control of Scottish Water. These factors were also discussed at my recent meeting with the Civil Engineering Contractors Association (Scotland) (CECA).</p>

  <p>I welcome the excellent working relationships between Scottish Water and CECA and I believe that such close co-operation is the best way to ensure the current investment programme will be delivered to time and budget.</p>
