  <p>Implementation of supervision requirements made by children&#8217;s hearings, whether for supervision at home or in residential accommodation, is a matter for individual local authorities. The information requested is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The Time Intervals Working Group (TIWG) Blueprint for the processing of children&#8217;s hearings cases is an inter-agency code of practice. It set national standards with effect from 1 April 1999 aimed at streamlining the handling of cases through the system. One of these standards requires local authorities to give effect to supervision requirements with no condition of residence within 15 working days of the date of issue by the children&#8217;s hearing. The objective is to give effect to supervision requirements without delay. Monitoring is the responsibility of review groups established by each local authority. Reports on performance against the TIWG standards are currently being received.</p>

The Scottish Executive has no plans at the present time to change the boundaries of local enterprise companies, tourist boards or local authorities.

  <p>In our efforts to ensure that the removal of oilseed rape crops contaminated with GM material is monitored carefully, we have sought detailed information on the precise locations where the crop has been planted. During this exercise we have established that the &quot;control&quot; plot of conventional oilseed rape on the farm in Aberdeenshire which is participating in the GM farm scale evaluation programme has been sown with the seed in question.</p>

  <p>I have considered carefully the implications for the future of this site within the trial programme. We have taken into account the views of the independent Scientific Steering Committee which oversees the trial programme and of ACRE, as well as consulting other regulatory bodies and the SCIMAC company involved with the Daviot site. As a result of these extensive consultations, I am satisfied that the validity of the trial has not been compromised and our scientific advisers have confirmed there are no implications for the safety of the surrounding environment.</p>

  <p>It is important to recognise that there is a very pertinent difference between a crop which is grown for commercial purposes and the one which is being grown as part of this trial. In the latter case, both the GM trial crop and the control crop will be destroyed upon completion of the research and will not be marketed. I have been given reassurances which allow me to state categorically that neither of these crops will enter either the human or animal food chain.</p>

  <p>The strict conditions under which these trials are taking place mean that this site will be carefully and rigorously monitored. The separation distances already in place are intended to prevent either crop cross-pollinating with adjacent crops: and any volunteers which appear will be removed and destroyed.</p>

  <p>The contamination of the control crop with a GM variety does not affect the scientific merit of the trial. I must stress that the GM crop itself is not being assessed in these trials - it has been subjected to and passed numerous safety checks before it could be grown as part of the trial. The purpose of the farm trials is to assess the possible impact on the environment of growing a GM crop in commercial conditions and, in particular, using the herbicides necessary to give the GM plant its &quot;advantage&quot;. The herbicide to which the GM variety is tolerant is being used on that GM crop. The conventional crop which is growing alongside is being treated with an entirely different set of herbicides. As the GM contaminant in the conventional crop will not be treated with the herbicide to which it is tolerant, its presence will make no difference to the outcome of the trial. Furthermore, as the GM varieties growing in the two halves of the field are different, it remains possible to identify and measure gene flow from the trial crop.</p>

  <p>The unintentional contamination of rape crops growing throughout the UK is a most unfortunate and highly regrettable incident. We are already working at a UK level to introduce measures which will minimise the possibility of a recurrence. In the case of the contaminated crop which is being grown at the Daviot site, however, the strict controls which are an integral part of the evaluation programme and our regulatory regime ensure that neither it nor the wholly GM crop pose a safety threat to either the public or the environment.</p>

  <p>The Executive remains committed to the UK farm scale evaluation programme as a sensible and precautionary approach which will provide us with the necessary scientific information which is vital to enable a soundly-based view to be reached on the future of GM crops in this country.</p>

  <p>Section 58 of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 provides that development to which a planning permission relates must be begun within five years of the date on which the permission was granted unless the permission stipulates a different period.</p>

  <p>Section 61 of the Act provides that, if after the expiry of the five year (or other) period a planning authority is of the opinion that the development will not be completed within a reasonable period it may serve a completion notice stating that the planning permission will cease to have effect at the expiration of a period (not less than 12 months) specified in the notice. Such a notice has no effect unless it is confirmed by the Scottish Ministers.</p>

  <p>Planning authorities also have powers under section 65 of the Act to revoke or modify planning permission. Where the permission relates to the carrying out of building or other operations these powers may be exercised at any time before those operations have been completed; and where the permission relates to the change of use of any land, at any time before the change has taken place. In exercising these powers authorities may be liable to claims for compensation in terms of section 76 of the Act.</p>

  <p>Should a building or site become unsafe, there are powers under the Building (Scotland) Act 1959 to require a developer to make them safe.</p>

  <p>The Executive has no plans to amend the planning provisions and, although the building control system is under review, there are no plans at present to extend the relevant powers.</p>

  <p>The last year where information is available is 1998-99 and the trend data over a fixed sample of trunk roads, which are surveyed every four years, showed a slight improvement from the previous year.</p>

  <p>Condition trend data for the trunk road network is shown in table 5.5 of Scottish Transport Statistics No.18 1999 Edition. A copy of this document is held in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre.</p>

  <p>Similar data for the non-trunk road network is not held centrally.</p>
