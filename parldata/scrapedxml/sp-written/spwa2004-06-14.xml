  <p>Copies of the report of the Expert Advisory Group on Infertility Services in Scotland, which provides a robust evidence base for the management and delivery of infertility services, was distributed to all health boards upon its publication in 2000. The distribution of the report within the boards was the responsibility of the boards. However, I would expect that all primary care trusts, now operating divisions, would have received copies at that time.</p>

  <p>In considering the introduction of population screening programmes, the Executive is advised by the National Screening Committee (NSC), an independent UK-wide expert body. The NSC&#8217;s Child Health Sub-Group has advised that, in the light of current evidence, pre-participation screening for Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) in young people intending to engage in competitive sport should not be introduced outwith carefully-designed research projects. The committee will, however, keep this advice under review, and has offered to meet Scottish HART to explain the reasons for its recommendation. This does not prevent Scottish HART from providing its own screening programme.</p>

  <p>The Executive would encourage young people with a strong family history of HCM and who would wish to be tested to consult their GP, who can then refer them to a cardiologist for specialist advice.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s National Advisory Committee on Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) is also keeping in touch with current work on sudden cardiac death and screening which is being taken forward in England as part of the National Service Framework for CHD.</p>

  <p>Given the wide range of treatments available through both conventional prescribed drugs and alternative and complementary therapies, it would be very difficult to draw any meaningful conclusions about their relative costs as a whole.</p>

  <p>The National Research Register records details of all on-going and recent medical research funded by and of relevance to the NHS, including research into the efficacy of complementary medicine. This is available on a regularly updated CD-ROM in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 17404) and online at http://www.update-software.com/nrr/CLIBINET.EXE?A=1&amp;U=1001&amp;P=10001.</p>

  <p>The Chief Scientist Office (CSO) within the Scottish Executive Health Department has responsibility for encouraging and supporting research into health services and patient care within the NHS in Scotland. The CSO is largely a response mode funder and this role is well advertised throughout the health care and academic community. The CSO would be pleased to receive quality research applications on the efficacy of complementary medicine which would be subject to the usual peer and committee review. Details about applying to the CSO for a research grant are available on the internet at www.show.scot.nhs.uk/cso.</p>

  <p>The Executive recognises the value of homeopathic treatment. We do not hold full information on NHS provision centrally, but Greater Glasgow, Highland and Lothian all provide homeopathic treatment through hospitals and clinics. Approximately 25% of GPs hold qualifications in homeopathy or have undergone some homeopathic training, and so have other medical professionals. Napier University has recently established a new BSc course in homeopathy for nurses, which will lead to further integration of homeopathic treatment within the NHS in Scotland. Referral for homeopathic treatment in any given case is, however, a matter for clinical judgement, in consultation with the patient.</p>

  <p>NHS boards do, from time to time, need to consider transferring a patient should there be an unexpected demand on a particular service. Boards rely on clinical judgement in such cases and decisions are taken in the best interests of patients.</p>

  <p>The Information and Statistics Division of NHS Scotland records all reported instances of antenatal transfers.</p>

  <p>As part of the work of the National Maternity Services Workforce Planning Group, each maternity unit in Scotland will need to provide details of each antenatal transfer in 2003. This information will be used to inform, in line with the recommendations of the Expert Group on Acute Maternity Services, the development of a strategic approach to integrated workforce planning and service development and delivery for maternity services in NHS Scotland.</p>

  <p>No. The next water investment programme, Quality and Standards III, will be based upon an eight-year timeframe, 2006 to 2014. This is being done to facilitate better business planning, secure compliance with longer term legislative requirements, and assist Scottish Water to plan and deliver the investment programme more efficiently. Local authority development plans, on the other hand, are based upon different timeframes which are driven by the broader requirements of the planning process and the particular circumstances of local areas. However, the investment requirements for Quality and Standards III are being informed by the development requirements identified by planning authorities.</p>
