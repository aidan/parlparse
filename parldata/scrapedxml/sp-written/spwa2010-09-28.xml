  <p>I received a letter from Councillor Gordon Matheson, the Leader of Glasgow City Council, on 15 August proposing that the council tax freeze should be scrapped. In reply, I made it clear that the Scottish Government would prefer to continue with the council tax freeze, but I explained that following the Independent Budget Review report we were discussing this issue with our local authority partners and other stakeholders.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is clear it wishes to remove the burden it places on schools and teachers for statistics unless there is clear Scottish Government need. Financial and time savings resulting from this rationalisation will ultimately depend on the decisions taken by local authorities and schools to manage their data collections. Clearly, any removal of central demand by the Scottish Government will enable local authorities and schools to make appropriate decisions about streamlining the evidence they gather.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is clear it wishes to remove the burden it places on schools and teachers for statistics unless there is clear Scottish Government need.

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>*&pound;3.198 million was allocated by Scottish Government to local authorities for suicide prevention action, with associated guidance on priorities for the use of funds.</p>

  <p>**Under the concordat between the Scottish Government and COSLA, funding for local<em> </em>suicide prevention action in 2008-11 is wrapped up in general allocations to local authorities. It is for local authorities to determine, on the basis of local circumstances and needs, how to prioritise this funding.</p>

  <p>Funding provided for the Choose Life programme in 2010-11 is less than that provided in 2009-10, due to Choose Life now being situated within NHS Health Scotland and having access to their internal resources to help support Choose Life programme objectives. Choose Life now have the practical and professional support of the larger organisation, as well as drawing on their knowledge, expertise and development skills at no extra cost. Effectively the programme objectives are being supported at the same level at a reduced cost to the Scottish Government.</p>

  <p>Other Scottish Government funding is also provided to support a range of actions on improving mental health and wellbeing, such as the development of a Confidential Suicide Register for Scotland aimed at improving future knowledge on suicide prevention, and other programmes of work designed to tackle depression and anxiety.</p>

  <p><span lang="en" xml:lang="en"><strong>John Swinney: </strong>The Scottish Government is responsible for data handling across central government in Scotland. As a result of the 2008 Data Handling Review we have put in place a number of measures across core Scottish Government, agencies and non-departmental public bodies which set robust standards for the storage, processing and transmission of data. We monitor progress and compliance across these organisations annually by the completion of Security Policy Framework (SPF) returns.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="en" xml:lang="en">Across the wider public sector, however, it remains the responsibility of individual police forces, local authorities and health boards to ensure that personal or sensitive information is stored securely and handled appropriately. We have worked with them to disseminate guidance material and provide information and advice about good practice.</span></p>
