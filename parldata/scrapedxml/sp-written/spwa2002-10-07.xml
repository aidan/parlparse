  <p>No specific target figure or date has been set. Currently, the best tool we have to measure the fear of crime is the <em>Scottish Crime Survey</em> . The 2000 <em>Scottish Crime Survey</em> shows that the proportion identifying crime as a serious or extremely serious problem; the proportion feeling unsafe walking alone after dark and the proportion worried about specific types of crimes have fallen steadily in the period between the 1993 and 2000 surveys. The next <em>Scottish Crime Survey </em> will take place in 2004 and all three indicators are expected to move in the same direction. However, a reduction of two out of the three will be taken as an overall reduction. Full Technical Notes setting out in more detail the definition for each target and how it will be measured will appear on the Scottish Executive website only at the end of this month.</p>

  <p>The additional investment we are making to tackle serious crime such as violence and drugs and the measures we have introduced and the targets we have set to reduce these and other crimes will undoubtedly have a positive impact on how safe our communities feel.</p>

  <p>Providing better support to victims of crime is the first objective of the Scottish Strategy for Victims. The Executive is therefore working closely with Victim Support Scotland and the criminal justice agencies to improve referral arrangements and to raise awareness of the support available through initiatives such as the publication of the victims&#8217; leaflet and the introduction of the victims&#8217; website. This is intended to ensure that victims who want to, know where to turn for support.</p>

  <p>No. The new target differs from the former targets in that there is now a target to conclude investigations in complex, rather than just in routine cases, as previously. Although we are not retaining a formal published target for routine cases, we expect procurators fiscal to conclude these investigations within six weeks and we will continue to monitor that.

  <p>The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service records the nature of case costs, but does not attribute this to individual cases. Staff time spent on individual cases is not recorded but costing calculations are based on standard weightings derived from past analysis of staff time spent on the full range of different cases handled by the department.</p>

  <p>This produces a broad indication of relative costs rather than precise measures, and non-court costs are calculated to be as follows (&#163;000)</p>

  <p>The target is a national target for a 25% increase in seizures of Class A drugs by the Scottish Police Service. It does not, therefore, include seizures by HM Customs and Excise and no sub-targets have been set either for seizures of different types of Class A drug or for individual police forces.</p>

  <p>Treatment and rehabilitation are key components of the Executive&#8217;s Drugs Strategy. We are investing around &#163;34 million, over three years, to support new and improved services provided locally by NHS boards and local authorities. These services address the needs of all age groups, including the over 25s.</p>

  <p>Treatment and rehabilitation should be based on the needs of individual patients. Substitute prescribing of methadone is one of the main treatments for heroin misusers of all ages. International and national research supports the use of methadone to divert misusers from using illegal opiates, stabilising their lifestyles and reducing drug-related crime.</p>

  <p>We also accord high priority to encouraging recovering drug misusers to enter training and employment. We have already given wide distribution to our &quot;Moving On&quot; guidance which is intended to assist drugs services, education, training and employment providers with this important work.</p>

  <p>The full wording of the relevant target is to &quot;Reduce the proportion of people under 25 reporting use of illegal drugs in the last month and previous year substantially, and heroin use by 25%, by 2005&quot;.</p>

  <p>The achievement of the target is dependent on a number of influences and initiatives, including some which are non-drugs specific, and which are aimed at improving the lives and aspirations of young people, particularly those who are the most excluded in our society. Initiatives and services in support of this target will therefore be resourced through a number of different funding streams, including the Changing Children&#8217;s Services Fund, NHS allocations, local authority grant aided expenditure, Scotland Against Drugs, social inclusion partnership funding and national and local drug prevention initiatives.</p>

  <p>There is an annual accountability framework in which Drug Action Teams (DATs) report to the Executive annually on work under way and planned in support of national targets, and the identification of resources for drugs-specific work. Issues of concern are taken up with the relevant DATs. There is evidence from the plans of a broad range of work with young people throughout Scotland covering prevention and diversion activities, treatment provision and services for young substance misusing offenders.</p>

  <p>No information is held centrally about the number of places available for the treatment of drug addiction for these age groups.

  <p>Information is not routinely collected nationally on the numbers of young people being treated for drug addiction. However, the recently published research on young people's treatment services included a survey of 42 services. The survey was conducted between September 2001 and January 2002. It provides the basis for an estimate of the numbers accessing services: 17 services reported a total of 405 under 16s accessing treatment for drugs misuse in the preceding 12 months, and 25 services reported 831 16- to 18-year-olds. The research highlights that this is a rapidly developing area of provision and these estimates are unlikely to accurately reflect the up-to-date picture.</p>

  <p>In addition, the following table provides information on the number of under 16s and 16- to 20-year-olds drug users presenting at a broad range of drug services across Scotland which report to the Scottish Drug Misuse Database:</p>

  <p>Our Drugs Strategy is built around four key themes: young people, communities, availability and treatment. All of these themes are relevant to our objectives of reducing drug-related deaths and illness.</p>

  <p>For example, we support a wide range of projects intended to guide young people away from drug misuse towards healthy and positive lifestyles. Our Know the Score drugs communications work, including an information line, website and information materials, provides factual information about the risks to health from drugs, and where local help and advice can be obtained. Harm reduction information is targeted on drug misusers, and it provides advice on avoiding overdoses and explains risks from injecting and from blood-borne viruses.</p>

  <p>Treatment and rehabilitation programmes help those already involved in drug misuse, and these are intended to reduce dependence on illegal drugs and to restore patients to health, stabilise their lifestyles and to encourage them into training and employment. Because those being released from prison are particularly vulnerable to overdose, additional resources allocated to the Scottish Prison Service are being utilised to ensure effective links between prison and community treatment and care provision. This includes pre-release needs assessment and action planning and the provision of a simple facilitating service for prisoners in the period immediately around release. Evaluation of the service will track issues such as re-offending and the incidence of drug-related deaths.</p>

  <p>Our enforcement bodies are achieving considerable success in reducing the availability of illegal drugs, and protecting communities from drug-related crime. Seizures of Class A drugs, which pose the greatest risks to health, are at record levels.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has been in contact with the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland both in the lead up to, and following, the Home Secretary&#8217;s announcement on 10 July that cannabis is to be reclassified.</p>

  <p>The policing of drug offences is an operational matter for individual chief constables. Cannabis will remain a controlled drug subject to criminal regulation, and the Scottish police service will continue to report alleged offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 to the Procurator Fiscal. Procurators fiscal are, however, not obliged to prosecute such cases and a range of alternatives is available.</p>

  <p>SIGN (Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network) Guidelines on the management of obesity are due to be published in winter 2002. "Obesity - children and young people" will focus on weight management and risk factor reduction as well as the role of the patient and family.</p>

  <p>Two of the key risk factors in obesity are poor diet and lack of physical activity. The implementation of the Scottish Diet Action Plan, which prioritises children's diet, is being pursued in a renewed and focused effort to meet the dietary targets set for 2005.</p>

  <p>The Expert Panel on School Meals published draft National Guidelines for School Meals in July 2002. The report, <em>Hungry for Success</em>, sets nutritional standards for school meals as well as measures to improve the appeal and uptake of school meals. As part of our wider approach to health improvement<em>, Building a Better Scotland</em> has committed additional investment to improving the nutritional content and uptake of school meals.</p>

  <p>Increasing the level of physical activity is fundamental to achieving a healthy lifestyle for children and we are determined that every step should be taken to increase participation. The Physical Activity Task Force, which was set up in June 2001, has brought together key agencies in sport and leisure, education, health, fitness, exercise and play in a joint action to help people of all ages enjoy the benefits of physical activity. As part of our wider approach to health improvement,<em> Building a Better Scotland</em> has committed additional investment to expand the Active Primary School programme.</p>

  <p>The target refers to the capacity for community disposals because it remains a matter for the discretion of the courts to decide whether to impose a community sentence on conviction. Funding from the Executive, therefore, provides capacity for a target number of probation, community service, supervised attendance orders, drug treatment and testing orders and restriction of liberty orders over a 12-month period. The capacity is not defined on a user basis but rather by type of order although the national priorities agreed for criminal justice social work put an emphasis on provision for these groups.</p>

  <p>The actual number of community sentences imposed by the courts in past years is then set out in the series of Statistical Bulletins: Criminal Justice Social Work Statistics. The bulletins for 1999-2000 and 2000-01 provide a breakdown of the use by courts of community disposals by gender and age in those years. They also provide information on the number of probation orders made where the court has imposed an additional specific condition of drug treatment or education. It is anticipated that the bulletin for 2001-02 will be published in December this year.</p>

  <p>The Getting Best Results Steering Group which has developed the proposals for the accreditation is a partnership between the Executive, local authorities and academics. The agreed aim of this work is to improve the quality of programmes which work with offenders in order to increase the confidence of the courts in the use of community sentences. The main incentive is that professionals in the local authorities want to ensure that criminal justice social work services are based on the principles of &quot;What Works&quot; and are effective. In addition, extra funding, made available as a result of the spending review, will assist local authorities in preparing programmes for accreditation.</p>

  <p>Audit visits to police forces are made by members of the Scottish Executive crime statistics team to monitor police recording practice and confirm that the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland (ACPOS) guidance set out in the Criminal Statistics Handbook is being followed. It is also a regular feature of Her Majesty&#8217;s Inspectorate of Constabulary Primary Inspections to audit processes and procedures used within forces to record crime.</p>

  <p>The ACPOS recognise that greater consistency in recording practices could be achieved throughout the country and to progress this the ACPOS Crime Standing Committee established a working group to consider, amongst other matters, the National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS), recently introduced in England and Wales and assess its potential for adoption in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The working group subsequently recommended the development of a similar national standard of recording for Scotland, with some additional elements built in around victimless crime, auditing procedures and circumstances where police officers happen upon a crime or offence.</p>

  <p>The group also recommended that a project team be established to determine a new set of principles for crime recording, to meet the needs of the Scottish Police Service in the 21st century and that dialogue be initiated with the Scottish Executive to have these agreed as new Scottish Recording Rules.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, it proposed that forces give consideration to the creation of the post of Crime Registrar, such a postholder being responsible for ensuring each force&#8217;s compliance with the agreed crime recording principles. Forces are currently in the process of establishing the post of Force Crime Registrar. These individuals will thereafter form the membership of the aforementioned Project Team, which will be tasked with developing the new Scottish Recording Principles.</p>

  <p>The timescale for ending slopping out depends on a number of developments, not all of which have firm timescales.

The Deputy First Minister indicated in his statement on 5 September that he hoped that, on current plans and population projections, slopping out would end about a year after completion of the second new prison.</p>

  <p>As part of on-going strategic planning, NHSScotland bodies have been requested to produce individual outline changeover plans for any possible changeover, similar to that produced by the Scottish Executive during 1999. This was a limited management pre-planning exercise carried out from within agreed running costs. Resources have not been diverted from patient care.</p>

  <p>As part of the pre-planning exercise, NHSScotland bodies were required to produce resource profiles that might be required for different activities during various phases in the event of a possible changeover to the euro.</p>

  <p>This exercise did not constitute an estimate of the costs of a possible future changeover. It is not possible at this stage to produce estimates of the cost of a changeover to the NHSScotland. The cost of a changeover would be dependent on the timing, the approach taken and individual management decisions.</p>

  <p>The new student support arrangements, including eligibility for the Young Students&#8217; Bursary and liability for the Graduate Endowment, apply to Scottish domiciled students who started full-time higher education courses at a Scottish institution from 2001-02.</p>

  <p>Students who started a continuous programme of study (i.e. successive courses of study at Higher National Certificate level and above without a break of one year or more) before 2001-02 remain on the system of support which was in place when they commenced their studies.</p>

  <p>Students who started a course prior to 2001-02, and who voluntarily interrupted their studies for one year or more, are considered to have commenced a new continuous programme of study when they resume. Such students are, therefore, treated in the same way as new students and will be supported under the new arrangements which include eligibility for the Young Students&#8217; Bursary and liability for the Graduate Endowment.</p>

  <p>We have always recognised that it is important that, when students start a course of study, they know in advance what support will be available to them for the duration of their course. Whenever we have made changes to the student support system in the past we have, therefore, endeavoured to ensure that this is the case by specifying that students should always continue on the system of support which was in effect when they began their course until they complete or abandon it.</p>

  <p>The Graduate Endowment is an integral part of the new student support arrangements introduced for Scottish domiciled students studying full-time higher education courses in Scotland from 2001-02 including bursaries for young students from low income families.</p>

  <p>Liable graduates pay the graduate endowment in recognition of the higher education benefits they have received, including the financial support provided to the publicly funded institution at which the graduate studied. Because Scottish ministers do not provide financial support to institutions in other parts of the UK in respect of Scottish domiciled students who study there, such students are not liable to pay the graduate endowment. It would not have been fair to young Scottish domiciled students studying in Scotland if we extended the bursary part of the new support arrangements to Scottish domiciled students elsewhere in the UK without also extending liability for the graduate endowment.</p>

  <p>Under Standing Orders rule 13.5, any member of the Scottish Executive may answer a written question, other than those for the First Minister, Lord Advocate or the Solicitor General for Scotland.</p>

  <p>Mature Students&#8217; Bursaries are awards made on a discretionary basis by higher education institutions. The Scottish Executive provides general guidance on the eligibility criteria for the bursaries to the institutions. The bursaries are primarily intended to help mature students with the cost of registered or formal child care, housing and excess travel costs.</p>

  <p>To be eligible to apply for a bursary, students must be classified as mature for the purposes of student support i.e. they must be aged over 25 on the first day of the first academic year of the course, or have been married by the first day of the first academic year of the course or have been self supporting (from earnings or benefits) for any three years before the first day of the first academic year of the course. They must have entered a course of full-time higher education in or after session 2001-02 and be eligible for tuition fee support. They must also have applied for the full amount of student loan to which they are entitled.</p>

  <p>The support available under the new student support arrangements to students who started courses in 2001-02 is such that no student will have more debt than they would have had with the same personal circumstances under the arrangements in place for students in 2000-01.</p>

  <p>Scottish domiciled higher education students will have their application for student support, including the student loan, assessed by the Student Awards Agency for Scotland (SAAS). Information on individual students&#8217; loan eligibility is then passed to the Student Loans Company (SLC) which provides the appropriate level of loan and manages the individual students&#8217; accounts. Other aspects of the student support package are provided by SAAS and are not repayable unless an overpayment has occurred.</p>

  <p>Prior to 1999 eligibility for student loans was assessed by individual colleges and universities. Information on the loans taken out by students who started courses before that date will, therefore, be identified by SLC on the basis of their place of study and not their place of residence.</p>

  <p>The average level of debt will also be dependent upon a number of variable factors such as the fact that students do not always borrow the maximum amount available to them, sub-degree courses at HNC/HND level will attract student loan funding and that degree courses will be completed at different times of the year. Any average would be subject to frequent change dependent upon each individual student&#8217;s behaviour and length of study at higher education level. To provide the information requested would, therefore, be time consuming and incur a disproportionate cost.</p>

  <p>(a) the police refer all victims who want to be referred to Victim Support Scotland. Support from specially trained police officers is also available. Procedures are in place to ensure that, where a report is submitted to the procurator fiscal&#8217;s office, the victim is informed.</p>

  <p>(b) the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) is rolling out a Victim Information and Advice service across Scotland. At present, the service covers six of the 11 procurator fiscal areas. It provides information about the progress of the case, as well as providing information on the criminal justice system in general, offering support where required and making referrals to other agencies who can provide support to victims.</p>

  <p>(c) the Scottish Court Service has published standards to ensure that all victims and witnesses present are kept informed on a regular basis, on the day of the trial, of any developments, changes and delays in the management of the case, including the reason for delays, changes in venue and similar administrative issues. Victims are also supported by the Witness Service, which has been set up in all 48 sheriff courts and will be rolled out to all High Courts in 2003. Operated by Victim Support Scotland, the Witness Service offers victims and witnesses attending court non case-specific information, advice and support, including information about the workings of a court, and the opportunity to visit the court building beforehand.</p>

  <p>(d) Criminal justice social work departments may provide information and support to victims and witnesses on occasion, particularly when there is no witness service available.</p>

  <p>(e) The Scottish Prison Service currently operates a victim notification scheme, for victims of violent or sexual crimes whose assailant is sentenced to a custodial sentence of four years or more. The scheme ensures that, when the offender is about to be released from custody, the Scottish Prison Service will so inform victims who have asked to be informed.</p>

  <p>(f) In relation to the Parole Board, arrangements exist for victims of more serious crimes to make representations to the Parole Board on their concerns with regard to the release of the offender. Proposals to strengthen these arrangements are included in the current Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill.</p>

  <p>The number of young offenders going through the hearings system is monitored by the Scottish Children&#8217;s Reporter Administration. In their annual report, SCRA publish data on the number of young people with one to three, over three and over 10 offences in one year. In addition to the focus on the last category, SCRA is developing further measures which will provide more information to the Executive and youth justice teams on the frequency of offending.</p>

  <p>In <em>Building a Better Scotland - Spending Proposals 2003-06: What the money buys</em> the Executive set out our target that by 2006, the number of persistent young offenders will be 10% less than in 2000-01. This target is not broken down by year.</p>
