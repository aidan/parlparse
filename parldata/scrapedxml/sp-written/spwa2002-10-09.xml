  <p>Estimates of the effect of indirect support measures depend heavily upon assumptions about world market conditions and will vary as commodity markets fluctuate and as domestic support measures evolve. Nevertheless the value of indirect market support to agricultural producers may be calculated as a component of a measure known as a Producer Support Estimate (PSE). The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) produce PSE figures at the EU level annually. By following the methodology used by the OECD it is estimated that the value of indirect market support to Scottish agricultural producers for the calendar years 1990-2000 was as follows (figures for later years are not yet available):</p>

  <p>Figures on farm income, subsidy and receipts are reported on an annual rather than a weekly basis. On average, the estimated percentage contribution of direct agricultural production subsidies to annual Net Farm Income was 520% in 1998-99, 670% in 1999-2000 and 450% in 2000-01. Data are not yet available for 2001-02, but forecasts suggest a figure of 270%.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive publishes figures on the net worth of Scottish agriculture each year in the <i>Economic Report on Scottish Agriculture</i> (ERSA). The 2002 edition contains annual data back to 1993 (the 1992 figures can be found in the 2001 edition of ERSA). The same document also provides information on net worth by type and size of farm.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally. BSE is a notifiable disease and cases are required to be notified to the Divisional Veterinary Manager at the local Animal Health Divisional Office of the State Veterinary Service, which operates throughout Great Britain. Since November 1988, 8,256 clinical cases of BSE have been notified in Scotland as at 20 September 2002. Compensation is paid at 100% of market value under the Transmittable Spongiform Encephalopathy (TSE) (Scotland) Regulations 2002. Compensation was increased from 50% to 100% in February 1990 and is paid by the Department of the Environment, Fisheries and Rural Affairs on behalf of all the GB Agriculture Departments. A further 75 cases of BSE in its pre-clinical phase have been detected in Scotland under the surveillance of fallen stock for bovines over 24 months. Compensation is not payable in these cases.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive why all local authority houses outside Glasgow will have central heating by April 2004 but not all such houses in Glasgow will, as referred to in its <i>Scottish Fuel Poverty Statement</i> , and when it expects that all such houses in Glasgow will have central heating.</p>

  <p>The number of council houses in Glasgow which lack central heating is greater than the total number of council houses elsewhere in Scotland without central heating. It will take time to install central heating in all the houses concerned in Glasgow. Nevertheless, resources will be made available to the council, and later the Glasgow Housing Association, to ensure that all houses have central heating within only four years. This reflects our commitment, set out in the <i>Scottish Fuel Poverty Statement</i> , that by 2006 all pensioner households and tenants will have a centrally heated and well insulated home.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive understands the term community empowerment as meaning the extent to which people within communities (of place and interest) have power to influence change. Scottish Executive policy initiatives in this area aim to enhance the skills, resources, networks, opportunities, confidence and motivation of people, individually and collectively. An empowered community is one in which there are high levels of skills, resources etc, which can be mobilised to influence change.</p>

  <p>The Executive is not making new arrangements in relation to existing safeguards for third party articles in actions for recovery of commercial debt. In this respect, the procedure proposed in the Debt Arrangement and Attachment (Scotland) Bill is essentially the same as that set out in the Debtors (Scotland) Act 1987. The procedure for recovery of domestic debt, however, is radically different from that in the 1987 act.</p>

  <p>The Debtors (Scotland) Act 1987 does not prescribe what will be acceptable as proof that articles belong to third parties. All that is required is that the sheriff officer is satisfied with the corroboration. If the proof of ownership is not available at the time, the 1987 act provides for the articles to be released on the sheriff officer being later satisfied. If the proof of ownership does not satisfy the sheriff officer, either at the time or later, then there is provision for an application to the sheriff.</p>

  <p>In terms of the Human Tissue Act 1961, two different sets of circumstances need to be considered.</p>

  <p>Section 1(1) of the act provides: &quot;If any person, either in writing at any time or orally in the presence of two or more witnesses during his last illness, has expressed a request that his body or any specified part be used after his death for therapeutic purposes or for purposes of medical education or research, the person lawfully in possession of his body after his death may, unless he has reason to believe that the request was subsequently withdrawn, authorise the removal from the body of any part or, as the case may be, the specified part, for use in accordance with the request.&quot; In the case of an individual dying in hospital without any next of kin, there would be nothing to prevent the person lawfully in charge of the body consulting the executor as to whether the original request had been withdrawn.</p>

  <p>Section 1(2)(a) of the 1961 act provides that the person lawfully in possession of the body can authorise the removal of any part of the body for the purposes of medical education or research if, after reasonable inquiry, he has no reason to believe that the deceased had expressed an objection to the body being so dealt with after death, and had not withdrawn that objection. In the case of a person dying in hospital with no next of kin, one option would clearly be to inquire of the executors whether the deceased had expressed any objections to a post-mortem examination.</p>

  <p>The 1961 act is generally regarded as unsatisfactory, and the Executive has accepted the recommendation from the Review Group on Retention of Organs at Post-Mortem that it should be replaced when legislative time becomes available.</p>

  <p>The Clinical Standards Board for Scotland is currently working on the development of standards for hospital post-mortem examinations. These have a standard statement relating to authorisation and information, which is that "authorisation is given for all hospital post-mortems, taking into account the wishes of the deceased and, where appropriate, the wishes of the relatives." These standards will be mandatory across NHSScotland.</p>

  <p>The Schools (Scotland) Code 1956 has been a feature of Scottish Education for over 40 years. Little of the original code remains and over the years its provisions have been amended, repealed and replaced. In more recent years the code has not kept up with changes and improvements in Scottish education. The Scottish Executive has consulted on the future of the school provisions of the code and has concluded that they should be phased out.</p>

  <p>We remain totally committed to professional standards and to continuous improvement in the education our children receive. We are also committed to ensuring that the necessary safeguards are in place to ensure the quality of that education. That commitment will be underpinned by statutory provisions where necessary.</p>

  <p>At the start of the consultation exercise on the Schools (Scotland) Code we gave a commitment that registration with the General Teaching Council would remain a requirement to work as a teacher in education authority schools. We will bring forward separate regulations that will maintain the position.</p>

  <p>We have also concluded that there is a continuing need for those teachers who work wholly or mainly with children with special educational needs to have specialist qualifications. Separate modernised regulations will be introduced.</p>

  <p>In other areas, the safeguards provided by the code have been replaced by the introduction of improved standards using different approaches. For example, in the case of class sizes the code provisions have been replaced by improved standards negotiated through changes to teachers&#8217; conditions of service.</p>

  <p>Other developments such as the School Improvement Framework should give sufficient assurance that education will continue to be provided in an appropriate manner by suitable teachers in all of Scotland&#8217;s schools.</p>

  <p>It has already been announced in <i>Regulation of Early Education and Childcare: The Way Ahead</i> in May 2000 that the pre-school provisions of the code will be repealed. Separate regulations repealing these provisions will now be laid.</p>

  <p>We will, of course, keep these developments under regular review. The code, however, is no longer up to the challenges and needs of a 21st century education service. We therefore intend to phase it out in two stages. The first stage will begin immediately and the second stage will take place in 2004, when the School Improvement Framework is fully bedded in.</p>

  <p>The National Programme for Improving the Mental Health and Well-being of the Scottish Population, established in October 2001 and overseen by a National Advisory Group, (NAG) which I chair, is developing a range of initiatives to address mental health as part of our health improvement agenda. The programme&#8217;s main objectives include raising awareness of mental health issues, promoting positive mental health, and the effective prevention of mental health problems. The programme links into initiatives both within and outwith the Executive, for example in the social justice, education and employment fields, to maximise the potential for mental health gain.</p>

  <p>As one element of this programme, the Scottish Executive is preparing a Framework for the Reduction of Suicide and Self-harm to be published later this year, and has consulted widely on the draft version. The framework will include an action plan, which will identify the actions which can be taken at both local and national levels to address the increase in suicide in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Other initiatives include a National Anti-Stigma Campaign to be launched in October; the Breathing Space Helpline for people with low mood and depression, especially among young men, and a public attitude survey on mental health. A magazine <i>Well?</i> describing the aims of the overall programme has been issued widely, and a copy has been placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 24027).</p>

  <p>In addition to services provided by the NHS and local authorities, the Executive provides financial support to a range of voluntary organisations, many of which provide support to those with mental health problems, including those at risk of suicide, and their families.</p>

  <p>Overall, &#163;1.2 million will be provided for 2002-03 under section 10 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 and section 16B of the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978 to voluntary bodies in the mental health field. A further &#163;19 million will be disbursed through Mental Illness Specific Grant which goes via local authorities to 400 small-scale projects at local level throughout Scotland. These projects provide a range of support including drop-in centres, day services, counselling services, information and advice, education and employment schemes, advocacy and befriending services.</p>
