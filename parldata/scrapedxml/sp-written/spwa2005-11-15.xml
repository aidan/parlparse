  <p>Responsibility for recruiting dentists lies with the health boards and independent practitioners. The Scottish Executive is aware that health boards have in the past made efforts to recruit from outside Scotland, such as Northern Ireland, Eire, Sweden and Finland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has encouraged recruitment through a range of recruitment and retention incentives. The contract for dentists from Poland was an innovative development-led by the Scottish Executive Health Department. The Executive will review how better collaboration between health boards and the Scottish Executive Health Department could facilitate similar recruitment initiatives.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to securing the status of the Gaelic language and has taken steps to ensure that the use and understanding of Gaelic is promoted across Scotland. The Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act 2005 creates a statutory body, B&ograve;rd na G&agrave;idhlig, with the functions of promoting the use and understanding of the Gaelic language, Gaelic culture and Gaelic education. B&ograve;rd na G&agrave;idhlig will prepare and submit to ministers for approval a National Gaelic Language Plan setting out strategies for promoting and enabling the use of the Gaelic language. The B&ograve;rd will also work with appropriate public bodies in Scotland to promote the use and understanding of the Gaelic language at a local level.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive supports the development of Gaelic-medium education through the Specific Grant scheme. This scheme provides additional support totalling &pound;3.8 million in 2005-06 to local authorities to enable the opening of new Gaelic-medium classes and to enable existing Gaelic medium-education provision to expand. Two expert groups have been established to make recommendations to ministers on key areas which need to be addressed to ensure the continued growth in provision of Gaelic-medium education. A Teachers&rsquo; Action Group under the chairmanship of Matthew MacIver has made recommendations to ministers on the recruitment and retention of Gaelic-medium teachers. An ICT delivery group under the chairmanship of Bruce Robertson is addressing the expansion of the Gaelic-medium secondary curriculum.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive also provides &pound;8.5 million to support Gaelic broadcasting and is actively engaged in discussions with key interests in an effort to identify a funding solution that will result in the establishment of a Gaelic digital TV service.</p>

  <p>The following table sets out the number of schools with Gaelic-medium classes in the last ten years. This information is not held for each education authority area. We are not aware of any classes that are expected to close but we are aware that Highland Council, Perth and Kinross and North Ayrshire are giving consideration to opening new Gaelic classes.</p>

  <p>When a medicine receives a UK marketing authorisation, either from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency or the European Medicines Agency, it can be prescribed on the NHS unless it is subject to a direction by Scottish ministers under section 17N(6) of the NHS (Scotland) Act 1978.</p>

  <p>However, NHS Scotland is expected to await the advice of the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) before making a new medicine routinely available. SMC conducts rapid and careful appraisals of medicines using pre-launch data and provides its advice to NHS Scotland as soon as possible after the launch. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), who advise the NHS in England and Wales conducts a longer assessment of medicines based on evidence of use. In practice, this means that NICE advice on medicines will issue approximately 12 to 18 months after the SMC advice.</p>

  <p>Details of all medicines submitted to the SMC can be found at <a href="http://www.scottishmedicines.org" target="_blank">www.scottishmedicines.org</a> including whether they were accepted for use, accepted for restricted use or not recommended for use.</p>

  <p>Implementation of Agenda for Change is a large and complex exercise involving a range of processes, including matching over 140,000 NHS non-medical staff to new job profiles, carrying out local evaluations for staff that do not match to these profiles, and assimilating all staff onto their new Agenda for Change pay rates and allowances with backdating to October 2004. Following on from the matching and assimilation processes outlined above the new Agenda for Change Knowledge and Skills Framework will also be introduced.</p>

  <p>Well over 50% of matchable staff across NHSScotland have already been matched to job profiles and based on project plans prepared and submitted by health boards. I expect all nursing, midwifery, ancillary and allied health professional staff groups who match national job profiles to be job matched, consistency checked and the details passed to boards&rsquo; payroll departments for assimilation by the end of December.</p>

  <p>I expect all boards to complete assimilation of these staff onto the new pay scales as soon as possible after 31 December 2005, following which they will proceed without delay to carrying out the local evaluations of those staff who are not matchable to national profiles.</p>

In the case of illegal use or petrol or diesel in a motor vehicle, the relevant offence is usually the offence of evasion of duty under section 170(2)(a) of the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979. That offence also covers other offences relating to the evasion of duty (e.g. evasion of duty on cigarettes or alcohol) and it is not possible to determine from the information held on the database the nature of the goods involved in each case. The following table provides details of all charges since April 2002 which led to prosecutions for offences under section 170(2)(a) of the 1979 Act.</p>

  <p>Administration</p>

  <p>The boards&rsquo; spending on administration costs are taken from note 6 of the published annual accounts for each respective financial year.</p>

  <p>The guidance issued on administration costs is based on the Code of Practice for Best Value Accounting for Local Authorities, which focuses on costs of the boards&rsquo; strategic functions that are not included in the cost of service provision. Expenditure will include the costs associated with the board&rsquo;s responsibilities for the planning and commissioning of health care for its resident population (such as statutory reporting, strategic planning, commissioning of health care and financial projections), but not those costs associated with the provision of health care and other non-clinical services provided by the board.</p>

  <p>Budgets</p>

  <p>The total budget of each board is their Revenue Resource Limit (RRL) which is reported in their annual accounts.</p>

  <p>In 2000-01, before resource budgeting was introduced to the Scottish Executive, boards did not have a RRL therefore for 2000-01 their budget has been assumed to be their Total Revenue Allocation which was also reported in their Annual Accounts.</p>

  <p>Population</p>

  <p>The figures for the population of each board area is taken from Report 086 of the Cost Book, no figures are yet available for 2004-05.</p>

  <p>Management</p>

  <p>(b) The amount spent by each NHS board in each of the last five years on management, expressed both as (i) a percentage of total budget, and (ii) per head of population was:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive Health Department has received a draft financial plan from NHS Western Isles in relation to 2005-06 and the following four financial years, which the department has reviewed and provided feedback on.</p>

  <p>The final version of the plan is expected on 18 November and colleagues from the department have been engaging with NHS Western Isles to ensure that the plan is as robust as possible; departmental approval will be dependent upon the submission satisfactorily demonstrating a return to financial balance within the lifetime of the plan.</p>

  <p>I conducted the annual review of NHS Western Isles on 12 September in Stornoway from which it was clear that the board has delivered in 2004-05 a high-standard of patient care, and has substantially improved its standards of staff and clinical governance. I expressed disappointment about the qualification of its accounts for the previous year and was personally assured by the chair of the board that the board&rsquo;s financial management had already been radically improved. The Health Department is in close and regular touch with the board to ensure that the good progress, which has been made, is maintained.</p>

  <p>Every NHS board in Scotland has arrangements in place to collect information on critical incidents and these are analysed locally to promote learning and reduce the risk of recurrence. This information is not collected centrally but can be obtained by contacting NHS boards directly. NHS Quality Improvement Scotland are currently reviewing these arrangements and will report later this year.</p>

  <p>Prior to the development of NHS Quality Improvement Scotland both the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland generic standards and the Clinical Negligence and Other Risks Indemnity Scheme risk management standards set criteria for each health board and trust organisation which required them to have an incident reporting scheme.</p>

  <p>Reason for Increase</p>

  <p>A range of factors impact upon staff costs. These include increases in staff numbers (which have been significant in recent years), annual uplifts to staff pay, movement of staff up pay scales, temporary supplements to staff pay such a New Deal banding supplements for junior doctors, introduction of pay modernisation and the change in employers&rsquo; superannuation contributions from 5.5% of total pensionable salaries to 14% in April 2004.</p>

  <p>Staff Costs</p>

  <p>The boards&rsquo; expenditure on staff costs are taken from the staff costs note of the published annual accounts of the relevant NHS boards and trusts for each respective financial year.</p>

  <p>Budgets</p>

  <p>The total budget of each board is their Revenue Resource Limit (RRL) which is reported in their annual accounts.</p>

  <p>In 2000-01, before resource budgeting was introduced to the Scottish Executive, boards did not have a RRL. Their budget for 2000-01 has therefore been assumed to be their Total Revenue Cash Allocation which was also reported in their annual accounts.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-11-15.32.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80064" speakername="Lewis Macdonald" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa1115.htm#12">

  <p>Allergy was recognised for the first time by the Specialist Training Authority as constituting a related but distinct specialty in 1999. The effects of specialist training in this discipline will take time to be fully reflected in NHS provision.</p>

  <p>Most mild or moderate allergy symptoms are managed successfully in primary care.</p>

  <p>The majority of secondary care referrals are made to organ-based specialists such as ENT surgeons, chest physicians, dermatologists and gastroenterologists.</p>

  <p>Patients with severe, drug-resistant or life-threatening disease require expert allergy assessment at tertiary care level. These patients are seen by consultant immunologists who conduct a number of sessions in allergy per week.</p>

  <p>Latest statistics as at 30 September 2004 suggest that NHSScotland does not employ specific allergy nurse specialists. However, it is important to note that nurses work across a number of fields and as such clinical nurse specialists may work with patients presenting with allergy symptoms, the most likely group being dermatology nurse specialists.</p>

  <p>Information on staff in post - including clinical nurse specialists - in NHS Scotland is published on the Scottish Health Statistics website under Workforce Statistics, at <a href="http://www.isdscotland.org/workforce" target="_blank">www.isdscotland.org/workforce</a>.</p>
