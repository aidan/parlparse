  <p>With regard to (ii) the CAP accompanying measures, this information could not be made available in the given timescale. It will also not be possible to aggregate the information to provide the summary information at (iv), without significant manual effort. I will however write separately to the Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale when the CAP Accompanying Measures information is available and also place this information in SPICe at that time.</p>

  <p>There is no central register of such services maintained by the Scottish Executive but the information is contained in the publication <i>Alcohol Services in Scotland 1998-99&#8217; </i> published by the Scottish Council on Alcohol, who we core-fund. A copy of the document is available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 6729). The Scottish Advisory Council on Alcohol Misuse has commissioned local Alcohol Misuse Co-ordinating Committees to conduct an inventory of alcohol misuse services in their areas. This will inform the Committee&#8217;s work on the development of guidance on the effective planning and provision of services.</p>

  <p>For the first part of the question, I refer to the answer to question S1W-7800. Health and social work professionals make referrals, preferably following joint assessment. Information about the sums currently made available by health boards and local authorities specifically for residential alcohol treatment is not available.</p>

  <p>There are no regulations currently in place under which the Scottish Executive has the power to pay funds directly to individual schools which are under the management of local authorities, and we have no plans to make such regulations. As is clear from the arrangements established for the recent distribution of the additional resources for schools announced in the Budget in March, it is already possible to take steps to ensure that schools can receive additional resources through local authority channels.</p>

  <p>The annual allocation to local authorities of consent to incur capital expenditure is a general consent for expenditure on their non-housing capital programmes, including education. The consent is distributed amongst authorities on the basis of a formula agreed with CoSLA, and is neither programme nor project specific. The local authorities are themselves responsible for prioritising work on particular school building projects from the overall resources available to them.</p>

  <p>Under a 1998 agreement, teachers could delay implementing the new &quot;Higher Still&quot; Higher courses, for one year only, if they met criteria laid down by the national Higher Still Liaison Group. In fact around 80% of the new Higher courses went ahead in 1999-2000.</p>

  <p>Henry McLeish and I have considered carefully whether it would be in the best interests of students to change the 1998 agreement by delaying full implementation of any new Highers for a further year. We have concluded that most of the new Highers should go ahead as agreed.</p>

  <p>However, a working group of practitioners set up by the Scottish Qualifications Authority has just recommended changes to improve the assessment of english and communication and reduce teachers&#8217; workload. We welcome this, since we are determined to meet teachers&#8217; valid concerns, but note that SQA needs to consult before making the larger recommended changes, which it aims to have implemented this autumn.</p>

  <p>We have therefore responded to teachers&#8217; requests by allowing teachers the option of a further year&#8217;s delay to 2001-02 while consultations continue.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether provisions under the Education and Training (Scotland) Bill and any proposed subordinate legislation which may be made under the Bill will allow for a pilot scheme on the operation of individual learning accounts in rural locations and, if so, whether such a pilot will be conducted in each local enterprise area in both the Highlands and Islands and the Borders and whether provisions will allow for remuneration in respect of attendance at learning centres.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-06-23.11.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80205" speakername="Henry McLeish" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa0623.htm#7807">

  <p>In two pilot areas - the Lochaber and Scottish Borders local enterprise company (LEC) areas - holders of individual learning accounts (ILAs) will be able to seek financial assistance through the ILA scheme towards travel, subsistence and childcare costs. This is being done under the existing powers of the enterprise network. It is intended that regulations to be made under the powers being sought in the Education and Training (Scotland) Bill would enable such pilots to continue.</p>

  <p>Reimbursement is likely to relate to the costs of attending local learning centres or other approved learning providers.</p>

  <p>The problem associated with emissions from Seed Crushers (Scotland) Ltd&#8217;s plant is principally one of odour. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency, which regulates operations at the plant, is addressing this issue by requiring the company to upgrade facilities and improve the processes involved. The plant has not operated since last year.</p>

  <p>As the regulations have been laid and approved by the Scottish Parliament, the &pound;100 licence fee will become statutory - as of 2 October 2000.</p>

  <p>Licensing has been introduced to improve food safety. The licensing scheme will ensure that certain stringent food hygiene controls are being met by butchers as recommended in the Pennington Group report into the Lanarkshire E.coli<i> </i>O.157 outbreak in 1996.</p>

  <p>The regulations will come into effect six months after being laid in the Scottish Parliament; the stipulated Scottish time frame throughout consultation. The regulations will dictate that the fee &#8211; in line with that in England &#8211; will subsequently be collected on an annual basis.</p>

  <p>Work is underway on legislative proposals to prevent an accused person charged with a sex offence from cross-examining a victim in person and to strengthen provisions restricting cross-examination on sexual history. Three main options have been identified to prevent an accused cross-examining in person: to require the accused to be legally represented throughout the whole case; to require the accused to be represented only for the cross-examination of the victim; and to give the court discretion to require the accused to be legally represented in certain circumstances. Various options have also been identified to restrict further cross-examination on sexual history. We will be discussing these and other possible options with interested parties over the summer with a view to producing legislative proposals that are practical and consistent with the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

  <p>Proposals for land reform legislation which will have a direct impact on the interests of tenant farmers are contained in the White Paper <i>Agricultural Holdings Proposals For Legislation</i> (SE/2000/51) which I announced in the Scottish Parliament and published on 17 May. All the proposals in that White Paper deal with the relationships between tenant farmers and their landlords. Other land reform proposals, for example on access, may affect some tenant farmers but none of these are specifically intended to do so. There was an action plan for the land reform programme published in August 1999 and the latest report on progress with that action plan has just been published. All these documents are available in SPICe.</p>

  <p>A recent review of initiatives involving service redesign projects between acute and primary care NHS trusts showed there are around 100 such ventures underway in Scotland; just under a quarter of these are JIF projects. Some of the areas covered include:</p>

  <p>Coronary heart disease services in Dumfries and Galloway</p>

  <p>Stroke services in the Borders</p>

  <p>Services for diabetics in Lanarkshire.</p>

  <p>JIF is simply the mechanism for redesigning services to meet patient need and to ensure that resources move with any service change; this may involve resource transfer between Trusts. JIF projects are determined locally and reflected in the Health Improvement Programme for the health board area and in the Trusts&#8217; own Implementation Plans.</p>

  <p>A key aim of the modernisation of our services is to bring services closer to home where that is clinically appropriate. As part of the modernisation agenda, I am reviewing our performance management systems to ensure that targets and incentives are in place to achieve this aim.</p>

  <p>Yes, the Renewables (Scotland) Obligation will in future be the main vehicle for increasing the amount of new renewable electricity generation in Scotland. It will take the form of an obligation on all electricity suppliers to provide to their customers a specified proportion of electricity from qualifying renewable sources by 2010, subject to the cost to the consumer being acceptable. In addition to these arrangements, we expect that domestic scale wind turbines will also make a small but useful contribution.</p>

  <p>A fundamental review of the means test used to assess support for higher education students is underway. It will encompass issues such as whether partners should be treated on the same footing as spouses in terms of their eligibility for the Dependants&#8217; Grant and their liability to be assessed for a contribution towards the student&#8217;s support.</p>

  <p>Currently, part of a dependant&#8217;s income is disregarded for the purpose of calculating entitlement to supplementary grants. For academic session 2000-01, &pound;930 for each dependant will be disregarded in the calculation of dependants&#8217; grant. The fundamental review of the means test used to assess support for higher education students will examine all aspects of the current arrangements, including the disregards.</p>

  <p>The Water Industry Commissioner is consulting on his proposals for new guaranteed minimum standards for water customers. The Commissioner has discussed his proposals with the water authorities, and he now seeks views from all those with an interest before finalising the standards. Members of the Parliament with views should submit them to the Commissioner as part of this process by 1 July.</p>
