  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>It is the managing agent&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure its contractors are paid in a reasonable time. However, it is a contractual requirement placed on the managing agent that contractors are paid within 30 days of satisfactory completion of the work and on submission of a valid invoice.</p>

  <p>Regular contract compliance meetings are held between the managing agent and Communities Scotland. At those meetings the issue of payments to installers is discussed and the managing agent has indicated it makes every effort to pay contractors as quickly as possible on receipt of a valid invoice.</p>

  <p>Scottish Executive funding to tackle antisocial behaviour is supporting community wardens in every local authority area in Scotland. It is for each local authority to decide how best to allocate funding across all their antisocial behaviour services, including community wardens, based on local needs and priorities.</p>

  <p>Funding granted to each local authority for the period 2004-08 to tackle antisocial behaviour is detailed in the following table:</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether its policy to negotiate with the UK Government for the devolution to the Parliament of responsibility for oil and gas fields in the waters around Scotland includes a proposal to devolve a share of the tax revenue from each oil or gas field to the nearest coastal local authority and, if so, what share these authorities would receive.</p>

  <p>Cowal Ferries Ltd commended trading on 1 April this year as part of the restructuring of the former Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd, and has since that date operated the Gourock to Dunoon ferry service. I can confirm that the company will publish its own annual accounts, separate from other subsidiaries of David MacBrayne Ltd, from 2007-08 in full compliance with company law requirements.

  <p>I understand that the figures quoted are from the <em>VisitScotland Partnership Agreement </em> report, which was released in August this year, and are for the numbers of visitors using tourist information centres (TICs) in the Perth and Kinross area. I am pleased to report that the number of visitors to the area has actually increased, with a 5% rise in visitor numbers from 2005 to 2006, and a 2% increase in revenue in the same period.</p>

  <p>It appears that with new advances in technology, visitor requirements for information are changing, and many visitors now seek information and make bookings online, rather than at TICs. The decrease in numbers of visitors to TICs is therefore in line with the trend elsewhere. VisitScotland are responding to this trend by making changes in the ways they provide information and booking services to visitors during their stay in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The information in these tables has been extracted from the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service&rsquo;s Case Management Database. The database is a live, operational database used to manage the processing of reports submitted to procurators fiscal by the police and other reporting agencies. If a Procurator Fiscal amends a charge submitted by a reporting agency the database will record details only of the amended charge.</p>

  <p>2. The database is charge-based. The figures quoted therefore relate to the number of charges rather than the number of individuals charged or the number of incidents that gave rise to such charges.</p>

  <p>3. The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service completed an upgrade of its electronic case management system in April 2002. Only case records created after that date contain complete data which is capable of electronic analysis.</p>

  <p>4. The table reflects the position at 14 September 2007. At that date, some charges were still the subject of court proceedings and had no verdict recorded.</p>

  <p>All procurators fiscal are provided with the necessary training, development opportunities and guidance material to enable them to carry out their wide range of duties, including appropriate guidance on dealing with environmental and wildlife crime. In addition, environmental and wildlife prosecutors participate in specialist programmes of training, arranged jointly with SEPA lawyers or with police wildlife crime officers. It has not proved possible to disaggregate training expenditure to identify the amount allocated specifically to training on environmental or wildlife law.</p>

  <p>Environmental and wildlife specialists are expected, whenever possible, to receive, prepare and prosecute cases in court. In circumstances when it is not possible for the specialist to deal personally with a case, he or she would be available as a source of advice and guidance for colleagues preparing and prosecuting the case.</p>

  <p>In considering any allegation of criminal conduct reported by the police or other reporting agency, the Procurator Fiscal must first be satisfied that the circumstances disclose a crime known to the law of Scotland and that there is sufficient admissible, credible and reliable evidence to support the charge. In considering the available evidence, the prosecutor must assess whether, having regard to the laws of evidence, a court will allow that evidence to be admitted in the case. A court may refuse to take account of evidence that has been obtained improperly, irregularly or unlawfully.</p>

  <p>If the evidence appears to be insufficient the Procurator Fiscal can instruct the police or another reporting agency to carry out further enquiries or may conduct his or her own investigation. If the Procurator Fiscal is satisfied after full enquiry that the admissible evidence is insufficient in law he or she will take no proceedings.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what steps it has taken to ensure that its network of environmental specialists within the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service is well co-ordinated, well resourced, and well trained; what evidence it has obtained that these steps have resulted in more effective prosecution of wildlife crime, and whether it will publish the results of such analysis.</p>

  <p>The network of environmental and wildlife prosecutors consists of at least one specialist in each of the local areas in the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service. They regularly attend targeted training events, which enhance expertise and provide the opportunity for mutual support from the other specialist prosecutors. The specialists also act as a focal point for regular formal and informal contact with relevant specialist reporting agencies at a local level.</p>

  <p>Building closer working relationships in this way and developing a better understanding of the context and impact of wildlife crime in our specialist prosecutors increases our ability to prosecute these offences effectively.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what steps it is taking to ensure that those who benefit financially from the impacts of wildlife crime are (a) investigated and (b) prosecuted and, where the offence is carried out on their behalf by someone else, what steps it is taking to ensure that the beneficiary is held liable.</p>

  <p>Procurators fiscal work closely with investigating authorities to identify incriminating evidence against anyone involved, either directly or indirectly, in the commission of wildlife crime. However, the prosecutor must always be satisfied that there is sufficient admissible, credible and reliable evidence before taking action against an offender.</p>

  <p>The information sharing which takes place at Wildlife and Habitats Crime Prosecution Forum meetings helps in identifying and understanding emerging patterns of criminal activity in Scotland. Since its launch in October 2006, the National Wildlife Crime Unit is also a source of analytical and investigative support for police and customs officers across the UK. Prosecution action cannot be taken, however, where there is insufficient evidence of criminal activity.</p>

  <p>Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland&rsquo;s (ACPOS) Scottish Strategic Assessment identifies wildlife crime as a national policing priority. The importance of this has recently been reinforced through the ACPOS approved National Harm Reduction Strategy for Wildlife Crime. All eight Scottish forces are prioritising investigations into the abuse of pesticides and are working closely with the police-led National Wildlife Crime Unit, which has a UK-wide remit. police forces across the UK have agreed to prioritise both preventive and enforcement work in relation to certain rare UK species that are at risk because of, or partly due to, crime being committed against them.</p>
