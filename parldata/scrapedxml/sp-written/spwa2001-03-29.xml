  <p>The Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 will not be fully commenced until the closely related and complementary Title Conditions (Scotland) Bill has been enacted. It is intended that both pieces of legislation will be commenced at the same time and the Executive will fully publicise their meaning and effect before they come into force. The commencement order for the 2000 Act will be made six months before coming into effect and that would appear to be the appropriate time to advertise the provisions on the final extinction of feu duties.</p>

  <p>Continuing Professional Development (CPD) is the personal responsibility of the dental practitioner as a professional. The Scottish Executive already makes a significant contribution to postgraduate dental education via the Scottish Council for Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education (SCPMDE) by means of the provision of courses. Because of this, recent Scottish survey figures estimate that 72% of General Dental Practitioners (GDPs) and 85% of Community Dental Service (CDS) dentists have already achieved the General Dental Council&#8217;s (GDC) recommended level of verifiable CPD. Discussions are continuing with the dental profession regarding the future levels of remuneration and expenses for CPD.</p>

  <p>In my guidance letter of 23 November to SHEFC, I emphasised the need for the sector to improve human resource policies and management, recognising that staff are our key resource, and I also expect that the sector will take account of the need to recruit, motivate and retain staff, as well as affordability, in reaching decisions on pay.</p>

  <p>The contraction of the Barmac fabrication yards at Nigg and Ardersier has resulted in significant job losses over the last 18 months. Such job losses have been addressed through a specialist job placement programme with only very limited numbers registering as unemployed.</p>

  <p>Highlands and Islands Enterprise is very active in seeking to attract businesses to its area and works closely with Locate in Scotland in the overseas aspects of these efforts.</p>

  <p>The Enterprise Networks are subject to regular and full Policy and Financial Management Review by my department. Management Statements provide the financial, managerial and operational framework for the networks and annual Operating Plans provide the main focus for operational scrutiny. Both are published and are publicly available. The annual accounts of both Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise are published, laid before Parliament and are publicly available. The networks have also been subject to scrutiny by the Scottish Affairs Committee, the Committee on Standards in Public Life, the National Audit Office and now by Audit Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Strategy for Enterprise, <i>A Smart Successful Scotland,</i> published on 30 January 2001 will result in a more strategic relationship between the Executive and the networks. The Executive will set the broad direction, work with the networks on policy development, monitoring and evaluation and the networks themselves will take responsibility for implementation. A new Joint Performance Team (comprising of the Executive and the Enterprise Networks with other external support) will review performance and set challenging targets<strong> </strong>for the networks. This will enable performance to be judged against the key challenges identified by the Executive of raising productivity, encouraging entrepreneurship, raising skill levels and connecting Scotland globally.</p>

  <p>As was indicated when the project was announced, an appropriate package of financial assistance was offered to Motorola with regard to implementing its proposed project at Dunfermline.</p>

  <p>As the assistance is drawn down, in line with the implementation of the project, the amounts paid will be reported in accordance with the usual procedures of Scottish Enterprise and the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>As with all such packages of assistance, actual drawdown of grant is dependent on the company meeting milestones based on investment expenditure and number of jobs created or safeguarded. In addition, all grant payments are subject to appropriate clawback conditions.</p>

  <p>Under the terms of the financial assistance being offered for the project, Motorola is required to inform Scottish Enterprise of progress with, and any major changes to, the proposed project.</p>

  <p>No. The Commission has clarified, in its recent reply to European parliamentary question Number 73 H-0151/01, that tendering in relation to the ferry services off the west coast of Scotland, which are currently operated by Caledonian MacBrayne, must be seen in the light of Council Regulation 3577/92. There are currently no plans to alter Article 4 of Council Regulation 3577/92. Whatever form the revision of the state aid guidelines may finally take, the principle of non-discrimination will remain and will need to be fulfilled by member states wishing to establish public service obligations.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive continues to make representations to the European Commission on a range of issues in relation to lifeline ferry services in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive welcomes the European Commission&#8217;s Green Paper on the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy as a good basis for taking the review forward.

  <p>I announced on 8 March a &#163;27 million package of support for the industry including up to &#163;25 million for decommissioning during the coming financial year, to bring whitefish capacity more closely into line with available fishing opportunities and help put the remainder of the fleet on a sounder financial footing for the future.</p>

  <p>We believe that decommissioning, coupled with a robust conservation approach, is the right approach in the interests of long-term sustainability and viability of the industry. The Executive remains opposed to a compensated tie-up scheme on the basis that it is of limited effectiveness in relation to discards and that it represents poor value for money.</p>

  <p>I agreed at the meeting I held with the fishing industry on 18 March to explore the scope for a modest re-balancing of the package to allocate some additional resources to the partnership between scientists and fishermen.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&#8217;s priority is to protect human health and the environment.</p>

  <p>The environmental implications of field trials of genetically modified crops are fully considered by our expert advisory bodies before consent is granted. These bodies are satisfied that there are no safety or scientific reasons why this programme should have an adverse effect on organic farming. Additionally, the separation distance which is imposed around trial sites should ensure that any cross-pollination with organic crops which does take place will be negligible and should not affect the organic status of these crops. The question of de-certification is a matter for the organic certification authorities.</p>

  <p>There are currently no provisions in Scots or UK law covering liability for damage caused specifically by genetically modified organisms. However, under the Environmental Protection Act 1990, there are powers to prosecute a consent holder where the limitations and conditions attached to the consent are breached. Compensation would be a matter for the civil courts in determining an ordinary action brought by the affected farmer for negligent harm done to him or his business or for nuisance.</p>

  <p>No. Although there is no statutory public consultation as part of the approval process for the deliberate release of GM crops, the importance of making factual information available in the vicinity of the trials is fully recognised and it was my intention to visit the area this month. However, in light of the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak, other methods of reaching a much wider audience than could be accommodated in public meetings have been considered. To this end I participated in a radio phone-in on Friday 16 March which enabled many local people to obtain information about what is involved and let me hear at first hand areas of concern.</p>

  <p>None. The GM crop will be destroyed after harvest and will not enter the human or animal food chain. The farm-scale evaluations are designed to test whether the agricultural practices associated with <u>growing</u> a GM crop have an impact upon farmland biodiversity. Safety for human or animal consumption is considered separately.</p>

  <p>GM products intended for human or animal consumption must be approved at European level. The GM oilseed rape currently being grown in the farm-scale evaluation programme has not been granted this approval at present but has approval for release in the UK for research purposes.</p>

  <p>In almost every case the problem stems from the late reporting of the case to the Procurator Fiscal. The overwhelming majority of them are reported by agencies other than the police and the Executive has very limited powers in relation to those agencies. However, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service has been pointing out the problems of late reporting to those agencies for several years and encouraging them to aim at meeting the same targets as the police &#8211; that is, to report the offence within four to eight weeks of its commission. That advice is about to be reiterated in the latest edition of written guidance to be issued to all. The relevant time limit is, in most cases, six months. Where there is a genuine problem in meeting the time bar, reporting agencies are encouraged to consult the Procurator Fiscal before expiry of the time bar &#8211; in some circumstances the time bar has an element of flexibility if action is taken before it passes. In the last analysis, however, if the case is not reported to the Procurator Fiscal within the statutory time limit it cannot be prosecuted.</p>

  <p>The Food Standards Agency has advised that there is no need to ban importation of meat from other countries. All beef produced in the EU must be produced in accordance with EU law. Imports of any meat from outside the EU are only allowed if the European Commission has approved the meat plant as producing to standards at least equivalent to those required by European law.</p>

  <p>The agency does not consider that it is necessary to ban imports on risk grounds. The best available scientific advice indicates that the risks from eating imported beef and British beef are comparable, and are very small indeed. There have been recent studies carried out by Dr Christl Donnelly, of Imperial College, London. An article on French beef was published in <i>Nature</i> on 14 December and also a more recent study, (published 21 March) looked into risks of beef from Republic of Ireland.</p>

  <p>The Food Standards Agency advises that the Meat Hygiene Service (MHS) routinely carries out random checks on all consignments of imported meat arriving at licensed cutting premises. These random checks have recently been stepped up in light of specified risk material (SRM) failures in consignments of beef from several member states.</p>

  <p>The agency has instructed the MHS to step up checks on imported meat and specifically to inspect every single consignment of carcass beef imported from Germany through licensed cutting plants, following the cases of beef with SRM attached.

  <p>Provisional figures for the year to 30 September 2000 show that the median waiting time for in-patient/day case treatment at Glasgow Western Infirmary was 28 days. This is a better performance than the corresponding all-Scotland median waiting time of 32 days. Over the same period, the median waiting time at Glasgow Western Infirmary for a first out-patient appointment with a consultant following referral was 47 days. The corresponding all-Scotland figure was 46 days.</p>

  <p>I have taken the opportunity to review the targets which I set for the Scottish Prison Service(SPS). The service&#8217;s performance in previous years has shown a continuing improvement against a series of progressively more difficult targets. However, the targets do not fully reflect the range of SPS&#8217;s work on behalf of the public. I have therefore extended their scope. The new targets are set out in the following table. They continue to ensure that there is full and proper focus on the maintenance of secure custody and good order. These are essential to ensure protection of the public, SPS staff and prisoners.</p>

  <p>I have enhanced and increased the targets which are set for the opportunities made available to prisoners. The target on prisoner programmes moves the focus away from simple numbers of programmes delivered and directs SPS&#8217;s efforts towards a continuing improvement in quality. I have introduced a target for education which is a key element in the correctional agenda and SPS will be required to show progress on a year-to-year basis in this important area. I have also introduced a measure of the performance in combating drugs in prisons, thus reinforcing our commitment to addressing the issue of drug abuse in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The slightly increased cost per prisoner place reflects the additional investment, including sums to address the drug issue, which the Executive is making in Scottish prisons. I expect SPS to make efficiency savings in revenue costs over the coming year will allow some &#163;12.5 million to be redirected to the capital building programme.</p>

  <p>These new targets will measure success and ensure effective and efficient management of the SPS. They are more demanding than those set in previous years and, in order to ensure that comparison with previous years is possible, the table gives figures for previous performance in the same format as the 2001-02 targets. The outturn figures for 2000-01 are provisional and subject to confirmation.</p>

  <p>Scottish Executive guidance, issued under section 5(1) of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968, indicates that, while it is for local authorities to determine the number of inspections per establishment, two inspections per year is the normal minimum requirement. Authorities are required to provide at least one annual comprehensive overview of the performance of each establishment.</p>

  <p>There are no plans to issue guidance to those authorities that carry out less than two inspections a year on residential homes. The Regulation of Care Bill proposes to set up the Commission for the Regulation of Care to replace existing registration and inspection by local authorities and health boards. This national body should become operational in April 2002 and its function will be to register and inspect all care services.</p>

  <p>A three-year national evaluation of the New Community Schools pilot programme started in April 2000. Following a tendering and assessment process, it is being undertaken by a team from the Institute of Education in the University of London. They have research staff and specialists involved, based in Scotland. Interim evaluation reports will be provided annually. In addition, projects and authorities are carrying out their own local evaluations, and HM Inspectors of Schools will include new community schools in their inspection programme later this year.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive spent approximately &#163;13,000 in 1999 and &#163;20,000 in 2000 on issues of a Social Inclusion Research Bulletin, GOSSIP (the quarterly newsletter for Social Inclusion Partnerships) and a New Community Schools newsletter.</p>

  <p>Information on materials produced by the range of publicly funded bodies with an interest in social inclusion and social justice is not held centrally. There are a number of publicly funded organisations which produce newsletters etc. which touch on social inclusion issues without covering them in particular.</p>

  <p>Scottish Homes started producing a quarterly news publication <i>Action for Social</i> <i>Justice in Scotland</i> in June 2000. Three issues were produced in 2000 at a total cost of &#163;15,435.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Voluntary Charter on Smoking in Public Places was launched on 23 May 2000. It is too early to measure effectively the impact that the Charter is having. However, Charter Implementation Guides have been distributed to 20,000 businesses. A survey of the on-licensed trade businesses involved is to be undertaken in April 2001 to establish the awareness and uptake of the Charter. In addition, the Executive will be repeating its original survey (carried out by MVA), later this year.</p>

  <p>I understand from the Convener of the Holyrood Progress Group that specifications for Holyrood building works packages which include timber state that, &quot;all timber and timber-based materials used in the project must either be demonstrably from well managed, regulated, sustainable sources, or be suitable re-used timber re-finished to meet the quality requirements of BS EN942.&quot; The Project Team would be happy to provide relevant extracts from specific tender documents although full tender specifications are not made publicly available.</p>

  <p>I understand that the procurement of timber for the Holyrood building was considered jointly by representatives of Bovis Lend Lease, the Project Team, the Design Team and the Holyrood Progress Group, taking into account advice from the Forestry Commission. The Convener of the Progress Group has informed me that all of the parties involved are satisfied that the wording agreed for the tender specifications will ensure that the timber procured will be from responsible and sustainable sources.</p>

  <p>The Convener of the Holyrood Progress Group <strong> </strong> has confirmed to me that the Holyrood building remains on schedule for completion of construction in December 2002 and should be ready for normal parliamentary business in early 2003. <strong> </strong> A statement issued last week by the architects, EMBT-RMJM Ltd, stated that the comments attributed to Ms Tagliabue were inaccurate and she herself confirmed this in a letter to the Secretary of the Holyrood Progress Group on 27 March.</p>
