  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in the light of the major developments in the canal system in Scotland, in particular the Millennium Link, what steps it is taking to ensure that the relevant authorities have given adequate attention to the potential increased risks to the public in the area of water and leisure activity.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2001-09-06.S1W-17553.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80134" speakername="Sarah Boyack" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-01/wa0906.htm#2">

  <p>British Waterways Scotland who manage Scotland&#8217;s canals, including the Millennium Link project, have undertaken and are continuing to undertake a number of different initiatives which promote safe and responsible use of inland waterways including the offer of safety presentations to all schools within walking distance of the Forth &amp; Clyde and Union canals.</p>

  <p>The Millennium Link project should not increase the potential risk to the public in the area of water and leisure activity as the project will only increase the length of the lowland canal system by 5 km to 110 km and most of this increase has been built away from significant centres of population. The major exception is the 1.7 km of new canal cut through Wester Hailes in Edinburgh. Here the design of the channel has taken particular account of the need to minimise risk and has been constructed to operate at the minimum possible depth of 1.1 m and side steps have been introduced where possible to create a shallow edge of 0.3 m. The expected increased usage of these canals including towpath activities such as walking, angling and cycling will also reduce the possibility of an accident going unnoticed.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the outcome was of the consultation last year on the physical punishment of children in Scotland.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2001-09-06.S1W-17969.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80252" speakername="Mr Jim Wallace" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-01/wa0906.htm#4">

  <p>We published our consultation paper in February 2000 and received 220 responses. Many incorporated the views of numbers of parents and children. We are grateful for all the careful thought and analysis that went into the responses. I have placed a full analysis in the Scottish Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre and on the Scottish Executive website.</p>

  <p>In our paper we did not propose a complete ban on physical punishment of children. We intend to retain the right of parents to reasonably chastise their children. But we propose a clearer definition of what is &quot;reasonable&quot; and further express restrictions on what is allowed. The responses we have received generally support this approach.</p>

  <p>Of the responses</p>

  <p>43 per cent supported our proposals in general</p>

  <p>34 per cent called for a complete ban on physical punishment</p>

  <p>17 per cent did not support any change in the law, and argued for the right of parents to discipline their children as they see fit</p>

  <p>6 per cent did not state clear views.</p>

  <p>Taking the responses as a whole, 77 per cent of those who replied clearly supported further legal restrictions.</p>

  <p>A clear signal must be sent to parents and other adults caring for children that physical punishment must be kept within strict limits and only used as a last resort.</p>

  <p>Based on the views of those who commented, we will set out in statute the factors the courts must take into account when determining whether punishment was &quot;reasonable&quot;. They will include:</p>

  <p>the nature, context of the punishment;</p>

  <p>its duration and frequency;</p>

  <p>its physical and mental effects, and</p>

  <p>the sex, age and state of health of the child.</p>

  <p>This will be a non-exhaustive list so that other factors could be taken into account depending on the circumstances of the case.</p>

  <p>We propose to prohibit absolutely blows to the head, shaking, and the use of implements. We also propose to ban physical punishment of children up to and including a certain age, and we propose this be the age of two. Up to this age, it is very doubtful that a child would understand why he or she was being punished, and if the child was in any imminent danger it should be possible for an adult to restrain or remove the child physically from the danger rather than punish him or her.</p>

  <p>Finally, in accordance with the overwhelming response by those involved in these services, we will prohibit corporal punishment in childcare centres, by childminders and in non-publicly funded pre-school centres. This is consistent with existing policy for schools and publicly funded pre-school centres and will provide welcome clarity for employees in these settings. The change in the law will not cover baby-sitters or nannies in the home. We believe that parents should have the right to set the ground rules for discipline in the home and that these should be observed consistently by all those who care for children in their own home.</p>

  <p>We will seek an early opportunity for legislation.</p>

  <p>The primary consideration in decisions about children is the welfare of the child, and we recognise the fundamental role of parents in this. We hope that our proposals will protect children and encourage all parents to reflect carefully on their right to administer punishment to their children.</p>

  <p>Physical violence is the antithesis of the behaviour we want to promote in children. If we want children to behave well, we should set them a good example. A child should have explanations, a clear disciplinary framework and sanctions other than physical punishment wherever possible. Our proposed changes should discourage casual or excessive use of physical punishment or its use for inappropriate purposes. If children receive a good example from thoughtful parents, this should help lessen levels of violence in society at large.</p>

  <p>In January 2001 the Scottish Executive commissioned research designed to help maximise employment opportunities from housing stock transfer. The research will establish where construction skills gaps exist and what might be done to address them. A report is expected in September 2001 after which the Executive will consider the findings. The Executive maintains dialogue with the construction industry on skills and other issues through regular meetings with the Scottish Construction Industry Group.

  <p>Our strategic objectives for rehabilitation are to provide integrated care, treatment and rehabilitation pathways for individuals, and to expand and create key services such as day and residential services and home care.</p>

  <p>We have increased resources to local authorities for drug rehabilitation substantially. With effect from 1 April this year we increased provision by &#163;6.8 million a year for this purpose.</p>

  <p>Decisions at local level on spending the additional money are being taken with the involvement and agreement of the relevant drug action teams, taking into account other local spending decisions. This is to ensure an integrated approach to the provision of all drug services across the drug action team area, and to provide best value.</p>

  <p>The terms of the Bellwin scheme are detailed in finance circular 9/2000, a copy of which is held in the Scottish Parliament information centre (Bib. no. 14385). Under the scheme, the amount payable to a council facing an emergency is 85 per cent of the eligible costs, after a deduction of a threshold which is unique to each council. 90 per cent of this amount payable is paid to a council following approval of a claim by the Scottish Executive. The remaining 10 per cent is paid following receipt by the Executive of an audited claim.</p>

  <p>East Ayrshire Council claimed costs of &#163;561,537, of which 85 per cent above the relevant threshold of &#163;237,438 was eligible for payment. The sum of &#163;243,352 (90 per cent of amount payable) has been paid to date. An additional deduction of around &#163;6,000 was made to the amount claimed, as the council had claimed for insurance excesses of greater than the &#163;100 for damage to school buildings which is allowable under the scheme.</p>

  <p>South Lanarkshire Council claimed costs of &#163;873,901 of which 85 per cent above the relevant threshold of &#163;567,166 was eligible for payment. The sum of &#163;234,652 (90 per cent of amount payable) has been paid to date.</p>
