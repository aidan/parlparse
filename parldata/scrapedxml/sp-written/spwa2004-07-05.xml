  <p>The Department of Health leaflet for parents on the prevention and treatment of head lice suggests a whole school approach, and it would be for individual schools to decide whether they wanted to promote a whole school approach.</p>

  <p>The <em>National Guidance on Managing Head Lice Infection in Children</em> states that schools, working with their school nurse, should provide parents and carers with information about the detection and treatment of head lice infection in a proactive and systematic way. Both the National Guidance and <em>Head Lice Information for Parents</em> leaflet advise that all family members should be checked if live lice are found in one member of the family.</p>

  <p>We have no plans to encourage NHS boards and local authorities to distribute &quot;bug buster&quot; kits at present.

  <p>We do not hold this information, but the <em>National Guidance on Managing Head Lice Infection in Children</em> recommends that schools, working with their school nurse, should provide parents with information about the detection and treatment of head lice infection in a proactive and systematic way, for example, at the start of every new term as well as at any point in the school year when a general problem has been identified. Monthly reminders or &quot;flyers&quot; can be sent home from school, informing families about detection through &quot;wet combing&quot; and reminding parents of their responsibility to check their children&#8217;s hair for head lice at least once a week.</p>

  <p>Some schools organise workshops for parents and hold awareness weeks to educate both children and parents to check for head lice at home on a weekly basis using the wet combing/bug busting method.</p>

  <p>I have asked Graeme Munro, Chief Executive of Historic Scotland to reply. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Existing reports and studies obtained by the owners of Castle Tioram into the monument&#8217;s structure, history and culture were considered by the Inquiry Reporter at the Public Local Inquiry held in 2001 into the owners' application for scheduled monument consent (SMC) to restore the Castle. In his report to scottish ministers recommending that SMC be refused, the reporter identified gaps in understanding in the Statement of Cultural Significance obtained by the owners. Historic Scotland is commissioning the preparation of a full Statement of the Cultural Significance of Castle which will address those gaps. This will inform consideration of any future applications for SMC.</p>

  <p>I have received no direct approach from the BMA regarding the motion.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Health Workforce Plan 2004 Baseline makes clear that responsibilities lie with NHS boards and regional structures to produce integrated workforce plans in March each year with key stakeholders in local authorities, education providers and others. The plan also refers to the need to address staffing consequences of the New Deal for Junior Doctors and the Working Time Directive by forging new roles for multi-disciplinary teams, in a climate where the Modernising Medical Careers reforms will introduce more structured training pathways for the medical workforce. Numbers of NHS staff increased by over 5,000 in the year to September 2003 and they will continue to do so as we work to build capacity and tackle pressures on the workforce.</p>

  <p><em>Securing Future Practice</em>, the Temple Report on the medical workforce published this month, also makes a number of recommendations about the need to secure the future medical workforce as service redesign work is taken forward. The Executive has accepted the report&#8217;s recommendations in full and is currently seeking comments from interested parties on both the report and its response.</p>

  <p>The National Workforce Committee is providing leadership on the workforce development agenda and has made it possible for the first time to take a comprehensive overview of the health workforce. The committee will be assisted by the new Workforce Numbers Group (WoNuG), which will advise on workforce numbers and modelling across all staff groups and make recommendations on the future size and shape of the workforce in a sensible and pragmatic way.</p>

  <p>The Water Industry Commissioner (WIC) re-appointment falls within the remit of the Commissioner for Public Appointments. The Commissioner&#8217;s Code of Practice allows for first reappointments (i.e. a second term of office in the same role) to be made without open competition, provided a formal assessment has been carried out which confirms satisfactory performance during the first term of office.</p>

  <p>A formal appraisal of the WIC was carried out by the Executive. This report allowed ministers to consider Mr Sutherland for reappointment.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed in the long term to delivering improved services over the lifetime of the new franchise. In addition to Airdrie to Bathgate, the redevelopment of Waverley Station will provide additional capacity, for example, to accommodate new Fife services following the opening of the Stirling to Alloa to Kincardine line. It will also improve the reliability of the existing timetabled services.</p>

  <p>Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) is responsible for planning and implementing the relocation of its Edinburgh headquarters to Inverness. SNH submitted a project plan covering all aspects of the relocation which ministers accepted as a basis for SNH to develop their tender specification for the new HQ building. SNH issued invitations to tender on 11 June and the budget for procurement of the accommodation will be set after the tenders have been received and evaluated. The costs of the relocation will be funded by additional grant-in-aid from the Scottish Executive.</p>
