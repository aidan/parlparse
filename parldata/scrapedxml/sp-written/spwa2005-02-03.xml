  <p>The Executive welcomes the Royal Commission&rsquo;s report as a useful contribution to debate. COSLA is currently undertaking a review of the quality of fish farm Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs). The review of EIAs is a priority for action in the Strategic Framework for Scottish Aquaculture. COSLA hopes to publish a report for wider consultation in the spring of this year, and thereafter issue guidance to developers and regulators on the minimum standards expected from fish farm EIAs.</p>

  <p>We are currently considering the contents of the Royal Commission&rsquo;s report and will submit a formal response to the RCEP later this year. My officials will lodge our response with the Environment and Rural Development Committee as well as the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>The department has, however, established a national network of prosecutors who will develop a specialism in handling environmental cases. They will specialise in environmental cases and provide advice to colleagues in their area as appropriate. Each of the 11 areas into which the department is divided has at least one environmental specialist, who will work closely with environment protection professionals from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and other specialist agencies and participate in a programme of joint training with SEPA lawyers. There are currently 15 environmental specialists, representing 4% of all legal staff across the 11 areas.</p>

  <p>The department also has a number of specialists in wildlife crime and fisheries offences.</p>

  <p>Putting in place the new arrangements for providing primary care out-of-hours services across Scotland has been a major and challenging task for the NHS and its staff. However, I am satisfied that NHS boards and their partners across Scotland have undertaken a thorough and robust process in developing these arrangements.</p>

  <p>All of the major stakeholders, including GPs, NHS 24 and the ambulance service, have been closely involved to develop the new arrangements and public consultation has played a key role in shaping the plans.</p>

  <p>All providers of out-of-hours primary medical services, including NHS boards, were required from 1 January 2005 to meet the quality standards set out in guidance issued to NHS boards by NHS Quality Improvement Scotland. NHS Quality Improvement Scotland will undertake a programme of visits to NHS boards to review local arrangements for ensuring the safe and effective provision of out-of-hours services.</p>

  <p>No. The Breast and Cervical Screening National Advisory Group agreed at its first meeting in October 2004 to look at a number of issues that would impact on the future development of the breast screening service. This includes the need to address health inequalities, the potential of digital mammography, the screening age range, and the screening of high-risk women as well as the impact and effectiveness of introducing two-view mammography. The Breast and Cervical Screening National Advisory Group expect to consider a report on all these potential developments and will in turn make recommendations to ministers towards the end of 2005.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to maintaining strong, prosperous and growing communities in rural Scotland. Examples of the wide range of measures we are taking to achieve this are set out in our Annual Rural Report, <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library5/rural/anrr04-00.asp" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library5/rural/anrr04-00.asp</a> .</p>

  <p>On housing, we have increased our investment in rural areas this year to nearly &pound;80 million which will fund more than 1,400 affordable homes. This includes both quality housing for rent and low-cost home ownership units. The percentage share of the housing investment programme allocated to rural areas now stands at a record high of 28% in 2004-05, compared with 20% in 1999-2000.</p>

  <p>Housing Association Grant (HAG) &ndash; HAG is a flexible way of providing funding which enables housing associations to provide, with the minimum public subsidy necessary, housing for share ownership and social rent.</p>

  <p>GRO Grants for Owner Occupation &ndash; The purpose of GRO Grants is to widen the choice of housing for people seeking to become home owners. The grants are targeted at areas of wholly public sector housing and also at pressurised housing markets, helping to facilitate the regeneration and sustainability of communities.</p>

  <p>Rural Home Ownership Grants (RHOGs) &ndash; RHOGs are aimed to sustain rural communities by making it easier for local people on low or modest incomes to own their own home and meet their housing needs or aspirations within their own community.</p>

  <p>Scottish Executive expenditure across the last seven years on these grants for owner occupation is shown in the table.</p>

  <p>Aids and adaptations and handyman services for tenants in the social rented sector are funded from rents and specific grants from Communities Scotland. This funding would not be eligible to be used to support Care and Repair services, which work to improve housing conditions in the private sector.</p>

  <p>Additional information on Care and Repair funding is available in the report &quot;Care and Repair National Indicators 2003-04&quot; published by Communities Scotland: <a href="http://www.communitiesscotland.gov.uk/web/FILES/carerepair2004.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.communitiesscotland.gov.uk/web/FILES/carerepair2004.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p>We are committed to meeting the housing needs of people in all tenures across Scotland including owner occupiers. Care and Repair projects help older owner-occupiers and private sector tenants to arrange repairs and adaptations to their homes, and may also provide handyman services for small household jobs. Clients may apply for grants from the local authority, funded by Private Sector Housing Grant, to help with the capital costs of major works.</p>

  <p>In the social rented sector, repairs and adaptations will be arranged by the landlord, and are funded from rents and specific grants available from Communities Scotland. Registered Social Landlords can provide handyman services for their older tenants if they wish, to help with jobs that would normally be the tenant&rsquo;s responsibility. In some areas agreement may be reached for one agency to provide handyman services to people in all tenures. This should be arranged with appropriate financial contributions from all partners.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally. In the current investment period some &pound;200 million will secure positive benefits in addressing current constraints and an additional &pound;41 million will address development constraints and first time connections in rural areas.</p>

  <p>I recently decided that the following services should be designated as national services with effect from 1 April 2005:</p>

  <p>the Paediatric Spinal Surgical Service, provided at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh, but in close consultation with Yorkhill Hospital, Glasgow to ensure the best pre- and post-operative management of the children requiring such surgery;</p>

  <p>Paediatric Bone Marrow Transplantation, provided at Yorkhill Hospital, Glasgow;</p>

  <p>a National Managed Clinical Network for pancreatic/hepatobiliary cancer, and</p>

  <p>a National Managed Clinical Network for Paediatric Renal Medicine.</p>

  <p>These services provide highly specialised treatment for small numbers of patients, and therefore meet the criteria established by the National Services Advisory Group (NSAG) for designation either as a national service or as a national Managed Clinical Network. The NSAG recommendations were endorsed by NHS Board Chief Executives, who have agreed that the funding for these services can be taken from their general allocations. In the case of national Managed Clinical Networks, the funding relates to the administrative and IT support required by the network, not to the full cost of providing the service.</p>

  <p>The sixth report of the Planning Audit Unit provides an analysis and assessment of trends across Scotland as a whole and highlights those authorities which have met targets. Overall the report shows a general increase in the performance by planning authorities against the two month statutory target in the face of increasing numbers of applications.

  <p>The following table identifies those planning authorities the performance of which matched or exceeded the performance targets set out in Scottish Planning Policy 1: The Planning System and is based on the data provided in answer to parliamentary question S2W-12561, answered on 13 December 2004, (Bib. number 34606).</p>

  <p>The reasons why the targets are not met will vary from authority to authority. The Scottish Executive currently carries out audits of planning authorities in respect of their development control functions. These audits seek to identify areas of good practice or concern.</p>

  <p>In view of this the Scottish Executive have also commissioned two pieces of research, resources for planning and business development and the planning system to help inform our understanding of differing performance by planning authority. The aim of these research projects is to identify and examine how efficiently staff resources are managed within local authority planning departments, to address issues of organisation, direction, motivation and morale and to consider the wider implications these may have on business development.</p>
