  <p>The Scottish Government will be providing local government in Scotland with record levels of funding over the period covered by the spending review 2008-11. The vast majority of the funding, including the funding for carers <em>,</em> will be provided by means of a block grant. It is the responsibility of each local authority to allocate the total financial resources available to it on the basis of local needs and priorities having first fulfilled its statutory obligations and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities including the Scottish Government&rsquo;s key strategic objectives and manifesto commitments.</p>

  <p>The joint Scottish Government and COSLA concordat includes a commitment for the Scottish Government and local government to work together to develop policy in areas where local government has a key interest, including additional resources for local carer centres.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Government has identified resources rising to &pound;5 million per year for the NHS to implement local Carer Information Strategies in the recent budget, subject to parliamentary approval. The new resources will enable NHS boards to identify carers and give them the information and training they need, working with local carer centres and extending their services.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government collects annual information on all pupils, including those with identified additional support needs. Data from the pupil census and other information from local authorities are matched with Scottish Qualifications Authority data. Where the base number of pupils is considered large enough, this information is published by reason for additional support. An example of this is in the attendance information <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publictions/2006/12/07132341/24" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publictions/2006/12/07132341/24</a> .</p>

  <p>However, in the case of attainment, where only those in exam cohorts are included, numbers have generally been considered too small to publish. We are currently reviewing this approach.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government believes that all children should reach their full potential. The Additional Support for Learning Act provides a framework for this, as authorities have a duty to identify and meet the needs of all pupils with additional support needs, including those with a hearing impairment.</p>

  <p>At the British Irish Council in July 2007 agreement was reached to re-examine the case for the Campbeltown to Ballycastle ferry service. In taking this forward, I have agreed with my counterpart in the Northern Ireland Executive to commission jointly a STAG appraisal.</p>

  <p>It is important at this stage that we take the time necessary to consider all of the options available for delivering a ferry service on this route. A fresh appraisal will also allow us to examine the economic viability of the route, and consider the costs and benefits associated with the proposed ferry service.</p>

  <p>Getting it Right for Every Child in Kinship and Foster Care - the National Fostering and Kinship Care Strategy will be launched on 5 December 2007.

  <p>The strategy is the first publication to be published jointly with COSLA following the concordat agreed last month, heralding a new relationship between national and local government in Scotland. This strategy will provide the framework for joint working between national and local government to deliver a child-centred approach to kinship and foster care, and to provide equitable support to all kinship and foster carers of looked after children to provide high-quality and nurturing care.</p>

  <p>In tandem with the publication of Getting it Right for Every Child in Kinship and Foster Care, a draft set of regulations which revise and update the existing relevant regulations will be published for consultation. The consultation period will run from 5 December to 14 March 2008.</p>

  <p>No. A GP should, however, liaise with their NHS board about the appropriateness of such a referral.</p>

  <p>The general rule covering the diagnosis and treatment of patients under the NHS in the UK is that services are either provided by, or commissioned by, a NHS body in whose area the patient lives.

  <p>I do not foresee any detrimental effect. We will continue to work in partnership with local government and NHS board partners to drive forward all our mental health priorities including reducing the defined daily dose of antidepressants.</p>

  <p>That element of funding now to be included within the overall local government finance settlement will ensure continuity of approach and investment. It will continue to be the responsibility of each agency to work in partnership and to allocate funds from the total financial resources available to them on the basis of local needs, priorities and agreed targets including the Scottish Government&rsquo;s key strategic objectives and commitments.</p>

  <p>Further details on the new arrangements can be found in the Scottish Budget Report and related Concordat with local government, copies are available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. numbers 44076 and 44077 respectively).</p>

  <p>The key driver in any health service redesign is to improve the care and treatment available to patients. Before any decisions can be reached on any health service redesign and centralisation of services a number of important issues will be considered including the availability and skill mix of staff, benefits to patients, service issues etc. Input and consultation will also be undertaken with a number of key stakeholders including service managers, the General Medical Council, NHS Education for Scotland and union representatives.</p>

  <p>Once the options for redesign have been considered or a decision has been made, further work will be undertaken with the regulatory and standard setting bodies to ensure that the doctors providing NHS services are trained in the competencies needed to undertake their role in the service. The General Medical Council are responsible for setting the standards for undergraduate medical students and the Postgraduate Medical Education and Training Board are responsible for postgraduate training and education.</p>

  <p>In <em>Firm Foundations: the future of housing in Scotland </em> the Scottish Government outlined its proposals for getting better value for its expenditure on social housing by reforming the current methods of funding registered social landlords.</p>

  <p>On the basis of the proposed reforms, the Scottish Government expects that the increased budget for affordable housing of &pound;1.5 billion in 2008-11 will deliver more new affordable homes &ndash; including social rented houses and houses for low cost home ownership &ndash; than planned for 2005-08. Were it to persist with the unreformed methods of the previous administration, and to allocate the budget on the same basis, it estimates that the increased budget would deliver of the order of 18,500 such homes in 2008-11.</p>

  <p>All NHS boards receive an annual allocation of funds. Each board&rsquo;s allocation will be increased in each year of the spending review period. It is for each NHS board to decide how best to utilise these funds to meet the health care needs of its resident population taking account of national and local priorities, including any need to increase the number of physiotherapists.</p>

  <p>Board workforce plans published in April 2007 have predicted that the overall number of qualified physiotherapists is projected to increase by almost 7% over the next three years from 2,138WTE to 2,286WTE.</p>
