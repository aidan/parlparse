  <p>The primary responsibility for taking action to prepare for the millennium bug rests with the business community. However, the Government have taken action to help businesses respond quickly and effectively. &pound;2.6 million of Government money was made available to provide companies in Scotland with suitable training to tackle the millennium bug. We are on course to train 3,000 people before the end of the year.</p>

  <p>The availability of free courses was always limited, and the demand has been such that the allocation has now been used up in some areas. However, assistance and advice are still available from a number of sources, including Action 2000, Local Enterprise Companies and Local Support Centres.</p>

  <p>Although many Scottish companies are on course in their preparations, others have done little or nothing to prepare yet. They should urgently make use of the available resources to ensure their operations are Year 2000 compliant.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what its policy is on the location and relocation of public service jobs in Scotland.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/1999-09-15.S1W-1558.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80147" speakername="Donald Dewar" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-99/wa0915.htm#1558">

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to ensuring that government in Scotland is efficient and decentralised, as part of a wider vision of more accessible, open and responsive government.</p>

  <p>We believe that two objectives should govern location and relocation decisions. First, the location of the Departments and agencies of the Scottish Executive and the bodies it funds should promote efficiency and effectiveness. Second, and subject to the first objective, the people of Scotland expect that the work of the Scottish Executive and related bodies should be close to the communities they serve.</p>

  <p>Most of the headquarters functions of Scottish Executive Departments are located in Edinburgh (or, in the case of the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Department, in Glasgow). We expect that to remain the case, since they typically involve frequent meetings with Ministers and the Scottish Parliament.</p>

  <p>Executive functions can, however, be discharged effectively in other locations. Already, more than half of the staff of the Scottish Executive and its agencies are located away from Edinburgh. We have now decided that when the Scottish Executive establishes a new unit or agency, or where an existing unit is merged or otherwise reorganised, there should be a presumption against location in Edinburgh. We have also decided that where a significant property break point is reached &#8211; for example, the termination of an existing lease &#8211; relocation options outside Edinburgh will be considered. In each case, Ministers will look at alternative locations. Costs will be taken into account in deciding on location, along with operational effectiveness and the position of staff concerned.</p>

  <p>The policy will apply to the Departments of the Scottish Executive, to its executive agencies, to the Departments of the non-Ministerial office holders and to the Crown Office, and to all non-departmental public bodies funded by the Scottish Executive. We will keep the organisational scope of the policy under review with a view to expanding it if possible.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-622 by Sarah Boyack on 10 August, what account it takes of the effects which the designation of areas as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) has had or may have on the economy of the Highlands and Islands in considering an area&#8217;s current or future status as an SSSI.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/1999-09-15.S1W-1274.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80134" speakername="Sarah Boyack" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-99/wa0915.htm#1274">

  <p>The designation of SSSIs is the responsibility of Scottish Natural Heritage, which has a statutory duty under section 28 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 to notify land which, in its opinion, is of special scientific interest.</p>

  <p>While the relevant considerations in relation to SSSI notification are primarily scientific, SNH, in discharging its balancing duty to have regard to the need for social and economic development in Scotland, considers comments from a wide range of consultees at the time of notification, including local authorities, local communities and owners and occupiers, where the designation of SSSIs might potentially have economic consequences at local level.</p>

  <p>We are currently developing proposals for a new system for nature conservation consistent with our commitments in the Programme for Government and the <i>Partnership for Scotland</i> agreement. The question of consultation on SSSI designation will be covered by these proposals, which will be subject to further consultation and pre-legislative scrutiny as appropriate.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), as controlled waste regulator, has responsibility for reviewing such operations.</p>

  <p>I understand that in February 1999 SEPA became aware that waste soils were being spread for restoration purposes on the former Milton refuse tip by a contractor acting on behalf of East Ayrshire Council. SEPA pointed out that this activity required a Waste Management Licence and the deposit of the soils was stopped forthwith.</p>

  <p>The material already placed is suitable for the purpose of restoration and the Council has applied to SEPA for a licence to continue. I understand that SEPA intend to issue a licence to allow the Council to complete restoration work and do not intend to require removal of the soil already placed. There will, therefore, be no cost involved for clearance works.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive believes that palliative care should be available to all who need it, whether they are suffering from cancer or some other degenerative disease.</p>

  <p>Health Boards are responsible for meeting the health care needs of their total populations and have therefore developed palliative care strategies as part of their Health Improvement Programmes. A key element of those strategies is the agreement Health Boards have with their local adult voluntary hospices for the provision of specialist palliative care.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to supporting the many dedicated carers in our communities. We recognise that being able to have a break from caring responsibilities can be invaluable in reducing the psychological and emotional stress of caring and in helping carers to continue in their caring role. We are aware of the concerns that carers and carers&#8217; organisations have over funding of respite services by local authorities. We have been considering this in the context of the National Carers Strategy and will be announcing shortly details of how the Carers&#8217; Strategy will be taken forward in Scotland.</p>

  <p>A system of investigating complaints against the police has been in place for many years involving internal investigations within forces and, where appropriate, external investigation by another force. Allegations of criminal complaints are independently investigated by the procurator fiscal. Police authorities and Her Majesty&#8217;s Chief Inspector of Constabulary also have important roles to play in the process of scrutinising how complaints have been handled by forces. In addition, the Scottish Executive has accepted the recommendation of the Macpherson Report to consider what steps can and should be taken to ensure that serious complaints against police officers are independently investigated.</p>
