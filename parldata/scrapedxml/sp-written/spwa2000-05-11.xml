  <p>On 27 April I announced the steps which the Scottish Executive will be taking to ensure that CalMac&#8217;s services comply with EC law. This will involve the routes being put out to competitive tender. However, we will continue to subsidise the network and ensure fares and service levels are protected.</p>

  <p>I have published a consultation paper <i>Delivering Lifeline Ferry Services &#8211; Meeting European Union Requirements</i> which seeks views on a number of issues by the end of June. The document explains that, for the Gourock-Dunoon route, the Executive intends to make representations to the Commission for a passenger-only service. If we are successful, the CalMac route will be tendered. The Executive values highly CalMac&#8217;s services and the company will be allowed to bid.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s policy does not envisage any presumption against Glasgow or other central belt locations &#8211; except that there is a presumption against an Edinburgh location for new or re-organised units. Where a significant property break occurs for existing units, options outwith Edinburgh will be considered. Locations across Scotland will be considered on a case-by-case basis consistent with our objectives of efficiency and effectiveness.</p>

  <p>The weir on the River Almond at Cramond is not a scheduled ancient monument and there are no plans to afford it such statutory protection. Historic Scotland can make ancient monument grants to help with the repair of unscheduled monuments, but there is heavy demand on the grants programme and the budget for the next three years is already committed. There are, however, other potential sources of financial support towards such repairs, such as the Heritage Lottery Fund.</p>

  <p>Spending on drug treatment by health boards is being boosted by &pound;6 million over a three-year period, bringing annual spend to over &pound;11 million. This does not include HIV/AIDS expenditure, some of which is drug related. Health boards are also free to use resources from other Hospital and Community Health Services budgets for drug misuse work, if required.</p>

  <p>Provision to local authorities for services to drug misusers is provided as part of Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE), but is not separately identified. GAE increased by &pound;43.4 million (4%) for 2000-01 for social work services.

  <p>No. Pupils study a broad curriculum based on national guidelines which sets out the aims of study, the ground to be covered and the way pupil&#8217;s learning should be assessed and reported. The way this is delivered and the use of ICT to assist with this in the various subjects is therefore for local authorities, schools and teachers to decide.</p>

  <p>There is currently one formal application for a Regulating Order with the Scottish Executive. This was submitted by the Orkney Fisheries Association in June 1999. The Scottish Executive is currently discussing with the association stock management and administrative aspects of their Management Plan. The decision on whether the application proceeds to public advertisement will be taken by ministers following these discussions. In addition to the Orkney application, the Scottish Executive has received draft proposals prior to formal application from interests in the Highland Council area, the Solway Firth and the Western Isles.</p>

  <p>The Executive was notified of six escape incidents in 1998 involving up to 95,000 salmon; 15 incidents in 1999 involving up to 255,000 salmon; and so far this year 10 incidents involving up to 395,000 salmon. The majority of incidents, particularly this year, have been attributed to storm damage, but there have been a handful of escapes resulting from equipment failures as well as two which have been directly linked to predator damage. The Scottish Executive takes this matter very seriously, we are determined to ensure that containment is enhanced and that escapes are minimised. I look forward to receiving views on the report on this subject, which the Scottish Executive issued on 7 April.</p>

  <p>Our understanding is that local authorities have already licensed about 300 houses in multiple occupation under the existing arrangements for discretionary licensing schemes. On the assumption that the Parliament approves the Order which has been laid by the Scottish Executive to introduce mandatory licensing, it will be possible for local authorities to grant licenses under this Order from 1 October 2000. The number of houses in multiple occupation licensed by the end of October will depend on how quickly local authorities receive and process applications for licences.</p>

  <p>The deployment of police officers is entirely an operational matter for chief constables. However, the Scottish Executive is committed to having policies in place which ensure that the maximum number of police officers are available for policing duties. This includes the financial commitment we are making for a range of technology developments to assist the police such as PSRCS (a new radio communication system); SPIS (an information strategy to integrate Forces&#8217; IT systems); and ISCJIS (a streamlined electronic reporting system). In addition, the number of civilian staff is presently at an all time high thus releasing police officers from administration to concentrate on policing duties. We have also set up the Scottish Drug Enforcement Agency with a budget of &pound;10 million over the next two years which will further increase the number of front-line police officers.</p>

  <p>As it is still in its planning stages there are no budgets set against this initiative at present. But the pilot project, which will look at developing alternative viable markets for local Dumfries and Galloway produce will be given whatever support is necessary to ensure the Scottish Executive and the local interest groups it will be working with can make meaningful progress.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what national guidelines are in place for local authorities in determining the criteria for rural schools closures.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not issue national guidelines on matters of school provision. In March 1998, the previous administration invited authorities to apply a test of proportionate advantage to any proposed closure of a rural school, to ensure that all factors are taken into account and that the educational and financial gains are weighed properly against any negative effects on the community. There are statutory consultation requirements which authorities must undertake where they propose to close a school. This ensures that there is a full opportunity for all relevant issues surrounding the proposed closure of a school to be aired and considered.</p>

  <p>The setting of dates for school holidays is a matter for individual local authorities. Following representations received about different dates set in local authorities, my officials wrote to authorities in February to ask how holidays were currently co-ordinated between authorities and what could be done to improve liaison in the future. In response, most authorities indicated that they held discussions with their neighbours with a view to securing a consistent approach although consistency could not always be achieved because of local circumstances and local holidays. I am considering the detailed responses further.</p>

  <p>In considering the location of the headquarters of the Scottish UfI, the Scottish UfI Advisory Group took the view that the decision should be taken on the basis of criteria which support the efficiency and effectiveness of the organisation. In view of the number of key partners the Scottish UfI would have in the central belt, it considered a central belt location advisable, assessed against criteria including:</p>

  <p>the recruitment and retention of staff of high calibre;</p>

  <p>convenient links with key partners on a daily basis and good rail, road and air links;</p>

  <p>modern, flexible accommodation with IT infrastructure and disabled access; and</p>

  <p>a location and building which conveys the right image for an all-Scotland organisation aspiring to change the learning culture in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Glasgow proved to be the most viable proposition, meeting all of the above criteria.</p>

  <p>No. Decisions about the provision of information are for Area Tourist Boards to take. They are in the best position to determine whether this should be through Tourist Information Centres or by some other method.</p>

  <p>The current arrangements linking water and sewerage charges to council tax bands already provide substantial assistance to many less well-off households. 27% of all households in Scotland occupy Band A properties. These households pay only one third of the charge paid by those in Band H.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, we recognise that affordability of water charges is an issue. That is why we are looking again at current arrangements. We shall consult widely on this before implementing any changes.</p>

  <p>The cost of the Holyrood Project Team whose members are staff of the Parliament, is met from Parliament&#8217;s annual &quot;running cost&quot; budget which in 2000-01 amounts to around &pound;38.7 million. The Holyrood Project Team budget for 2000-01 is just under &pound;480,000. Future years&#8217; budgets will be determined in accordance with identified needs and resources available to the Parliament.</p>
