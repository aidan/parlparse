  <p>Respect and Responsibility contains a recommendation that each NHS board must ensure women have access to appropriate termination of pregnancy services which are in line with the guidelines produced by the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.</p>

  <p>In addition, NHS Quality Improvement Scotland is developing national Sexual Health Standards. The draft standards, which are currently available, contain a specific recommendation for each NHS board to ensure that women receive safe termination of pregnancy with minimal delay, followed by a contraceptive review and counselling. The introduction of the draft standard, which is also in line with the guidelines produced by the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, will allow NHS boards to test themselves against what is proposed and to work towards it.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>Scotland operates a social practice strategy for literacy and numeracy. The strategy is based on a lifelong learning, learner centred approach to programmes where adults&rsquo; learning needs and abilities are assessed and individual goals set out in a learner&rsquo;s individual learning plan. Progress is measured in terms of changes in learners&rsquo; ability to use literacy and numeracy i.e. the distance the learner has travelled and without compulsory testing (to encourage participation). This makes measurement of progress difficult, however, we are currently refreshing the ALNIS Strategy and expect that this will make recommendations about how better to achieve this.</p>

  <p>The activity funded through the Adult Literacy and Numeracy in Scotland strategy operates under a social practice model. This is based on a lifelong learning, learner centred approach to programmes where adults&rsquo; learning needs and abilities are assessed and individual goals set out in a learner&rsquo;s individual learning plan. This is the focus of the learning, rather than a preset course. Progress is measured in terms of changes in learner&rsquo;s ability to use literacy and numeracy and not compulsory testing (thus encouraging participation).

  <p>The civil standard of proof is used to decide whether or not Cross Compliance requirements have been breached. If an inspector can provide evidence to show that on the balance of probability a breach has been committed then this is enough to allow a Cross Compliance penalty to be applied. Farmers or crofters who dispute the findings can lodge an appeal under the existing EU Appeals procedure.</p>

  <p>As indicated by the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing in response to the answer to question S3W-2159 on 31 July 2007 and during the parliamentary debate on waiting times, on 24 October 2007, the Scottish Government&rsquo;s position is that NHS boards can continue to use existing private sector capacity if that helps them at the margins to cut waiting times for patients. However, this is a matter for NHS Lothian to consider as it establishes its action plan to meet the 18-week patient journey target by 2011.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government announced on 26 October 2007 that, in addition to our commitment to routinely offer HPV vaccination to girls aged around 12 to 13, we would offer vaccination to girls who are under the age of 18 at the start of the immunisation campaign in September 2008.</p>

  <p>This commitment to implement a catch-up campaign follows advice received from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) and will potentially protect an additional 120,000 young Scottish girls.</p>

  <p>The routine HPV immunisation programme for girls aged around 12 to 13 will begin in September 2008.</p>

  <p>The catch-up campaign for older girls will be carried out over the two to three year period from September 2008. The exact timing and phasing of the campaign will be considered further.</p>

  <p>There are no figures available for total losses of intertidal areas in Scotland since 2000. I understand that Scottish Natural Heritage&rsquo;s (SNH) view is that rocky intertidal areas are not considered likely to have changed significantly in this period. Intertidal areas of soft material can be highly dynamic and may be subject to both deposition and erosion.</p>

  <p>Scottish Natural Heritage has a range of current projects that address the general issue of historic and recent coastal change and SNH advice is that the best approach to protection of coastal nature conservation interests is to support the natural dynamic processes, with intervention only in exceptional circumstances.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will be consulting later in 2007 on proposals to designate new areas, including in Moray, where crofts may be created.

  <p>If the consultation demonstrates support for these new crofting areas the power to extend crofting tenure beyond the crofting counties rests in section 3 of the Crofters (Scotland) Act 1993, as amended by the Crofting Reform etc. (Scotland) Act 2007.</p>

  <p>Land in Moray belonging to the Scottish ministers will be parts of the National Forest estate currently managed by Forestry Commission, Scotland who are actively working to facilitate the creation of woodland crofts on National Forest land, whether in Moray or in other areas where crofting tenure applies. Other public land use bodies will be encouraged to consider whether land they manage is suitable for crofting.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government cannot force anyone to change land to crofting tenure. Land owners will be able to apply to the Crofters Commission for the creation of new crofts within any areas designated by Ministers. In addition, tenants under the Small Landholders Acts 1886-1931 may also apply for the conversion of their smallholding to crofting tenure.</p>

  <p>There are no financial incentives currently available for the establishment of new crofts in Moray.</p>

  <p>As announced previously, the proposed designation of Moray will not affect the arrangements for offering grant assistance to crofters within the crofting counties, as defined in the Crofters (Scotland) Act 1993. Future arrangements for financial support for crofting will be determined in the light of the report of the Committee of Inquiry on Crofting.</p>

  <p>Land Managers in Moray &ndash; whether or not they are crofters - will be eligible to apply for financial support under a number of measures in the new Scotland Rural Development Programme 2007-13.</p>

  <p>On 9 October 2007 I announced that, subject to no deterioration in the disease situation, the foot-and-mouth disease restrictions in Scotland would be lifted on 17 October. This timing is linked to the ending of the Protection Zone established in Surrey and the confidence that this step gives us that live virus is no longer circulating within Great Britain.</p>

  <p>CD cylinders can be adjusted to provide oxygen at various different flow rates. When portable oxygen was made available on GP prescription it was agreed that GPs would prescribe cylinders only for patients who require standard flow rates of 2 or 4 litres per minute. Patients requiring an adjustable flow rate would be referred by their GP to a hospital based specialist physician. Hospital based prescribing is not restricted to items included in the Tariff and so there is no need for CD cylinders to be listed.</p>

  <p>BOC&rsquo;s adjustable flow rate CD cylinders are not listed on the Scottish Drug Tariff because GP prescribing is limited, by agreement, to standard oxygen flow rates of two or four litres per minute. Because CD cylinders are not on the tariff pharmacists cannot be reimbursed for dispensing them. Exceptionally, a temporary arrangement to reimburse pharmacists for CD cylinders was put in place in December 2005 due to a shortage of the tariff-listed DD cylinders. This was a short term measure and has now been withdrawn.</p>

  <p>The Housing Supply Task Force includes representatives from local authorities in its membership and local authorities have been invited to be represented at task force meetings; most recently at the task force meeting on 23 October 2007. Further meetings and events are planned, to which local authorities and other organisations with an interest in housing supply issues will be invited. The task force is keen to engage with a wide range of interests to explore how the supply of housing of all types can be increased in all areas of Scotland.</p>

  <p>I am aware of the initiative by Scottish Borders Council to establish a local Housing Task Force and I am aware that officials from Communities Scotland are involved in task force meetings. I recognise the severe affordable housing pressures that exist in the Borders, as in many other parts of Scotland and I would be interested in seeing whether any outputs emerge from the council&rsquo;s initiative that could have wider applicability.</p>

These powers can be used to introduce changes, for example, through regulation to further improve protection for park home owners by revision of the implied terms and written statement which sets out the agreement between resident and site owner.</p>

  <p>The expenditure recorded in table A shows the total expenses incurred by special advisers since their appointment in May. It includes accommodation and meals, travel expenses and personal incidental expenses. The expenditure was either incurred by the adviser and claimed back through the Scottish Government Travel &amp; Subsistence system, booked through the official travel agency or paid directly to suppliers via the travel &amp; subsistence charge card.</p>

  <p>Special Adviser expenses are incurred in the course of carrying out official business on behalf of the Scottish Government.</p>

  <p>The Environmental Noise (Scotland) Regulations 2006 are part of the implementation of the EC Environmental Noise Directive. This applies to ambient noise to which humans are exposed from transport and industrial sources. Noise maps have already been produced under the regulations with action plans now being prepared with a view to managing noise in specific areas identified in the noise maps.</p>

  <p>For new or altered roads where noise exceeds a certain trigger level, the Land Compensation (Scotland) Act 1973 provide for insulation work or a grant to be made in respect of that insulation work.</p>

  <p>In addition the Road Vehicles (Construction &amp; Use) Regulations 1986 and the Road Traffic Act 1988 where the police can take action against a person who has modified their exhaust system illegally or is driving dangerously.</p>

  <p>An analysis of the victim notification scheme was published in September of this year. On the basis of that analysis I am minded to extend the terms of the scheme to include more victims. A final decision on the extension of eligibility will depend upon the availability of resources and is therefore subject to the outcome of the Spending Review.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-4525 by Michael Russell on 26 September 2007, whether there are any legal obligations under existing regulations for central or local government to provide a water supply or reinstate one that has run out.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for the provision, adequacy and wholesomeness of a private water supply rests with the owners and users of that supply and not central or local government.</p>

  <p>However, where the insufficiency or unwholesomeness of a supply for domestic purposes poses a danger to life or health, local authorities have powers under the Water (Scotland) Act 1980 to require Scottish Water to provide an emergency supply of water until the owners and users secure an alternative or additional private supply of water. The 1980 act enables local authorities to recover the costs of the emergency provision of water from the owners and users of the failed supply.</p>
