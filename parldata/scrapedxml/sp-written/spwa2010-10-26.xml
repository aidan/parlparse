  <p>Community wardens across Scotland play a key role in making our communities safer, stronger places to live. Following the concordat between COSLA and the Scottish Government, the operation of each community warden scheme is the responsibility of its local authority and most local authorities have reviewed their warden services to best meet local needs.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government supports community wardens and the Scottish Community Wardens&rsquo; Network in a number of ways, based on activities identified in the antisocial behaviour framework <em>Promoting Positive Outcomes</em>.</p>

  <p>We assist and promote the sharing of good practice through regular attendance at official level at Scottish Community Wardens&rsquo; Network meetings and, more broadly, through the Scottish Community Safety Network. We also provide financial support through the funding of the national conference.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not provide funding to local authorities for the specific purpose of controlling urban gulls.

  <p>There have been ongoing discussions with COSLA about the Independent Living Fund&rsquo;s decision to stop new applications since July 2010.

  <p>Approximately 98% of in scope public sector demand in Scotland &ndash; some 24,000 buildings &ndash; is now signed up to our national electricity contracts. Given that public bodies migrated to these contracts on an incremental basis from 1 October 2009 until 1 April 2010, the first full year where the majority of participating bodies received power via the national contracts is April 2010 to March 2011. For that year, we estimate that the contracts will deliver total benefits of around &pound;10 million, with similar benefits achieved until contract expiry on 31 March 2013 - equating to around 5% of total contract value.</p>

  <p>Given that both the cost of electricity on the wholesale market and distribution charges have increased significantly over the past year and wholesale costs are likely to continue to rise, benefits take the form of cost avoidance.</p>

  <p>While it is for individual public bodies to calculate the benefits they have derived and will continue to derive from the new contracts, we estimate that the &pound;10 million annual benefits will accrue to the participating sectors as follows:</p>

  <p>Central Government: 5.98%</p>

  <p>Local Authority, Fire and Police: 58.48%</p>

  <p>NHS Scotland: 21.04%</p>

  <p>Higher &amp; Further Education: 13.78%</p>

  <p>Third Sector: 0.72%.</p>

  <p>Importantly, the contracts also allow increased budgetary certainty for public bodies, as the flexible procurement model adopted involves multiple purchases on the wholesale market, which &quot;smooths out&quot; the volatility inherent in large, one-off transactions in commodity markets. Significant process savings have also been achieved for public bodies through going to market once for a large part of the public sector.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises the important role that carers play in Scotland and has put a number of measures in place to support carers. To that end, we have published, with COSLA, a carers strategy on 26 July 2010. This strategy takes into account the views of a wide range of interests and is based on a review of progress against the Care 21 report, <em>The Future of Unpaid Care in Scotland</em> , and on the input from stakeholders. It will focus on improving outcomes for carers through better recognition and support.</p>

  <p>The Energy Assistance Package is open to anyone in Scotland. It offers energy efficiency advice, benefits and tax credit checks, tariff checks and physical measures to eligible households to improve the energy efficiency of their homes. Because it is broader than previous schemes, such as the Central Heating Programme, it can help a much wider group of people, including carers. If anyone is having difficulty heating their home I would urge that they contact the freephone number for assistance 0800 512012.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidance Network has produced two guidance documents which refer to the recognition and management of pneumococcal infection (Community Management of Lower Respiratory Tract Infection in Adults (June 2002) and Diagnosis and Management of Childhood Otitis Media in Primary Care (February 2003)). Both of these documents highlight the importance of pneumococcal immunisation in preventing pneumococcal disease. These documents can be accessed at:</p>

  <p>A wide range of public and professional information is already available in respect of pneumococcal disease and prevention through vaccination. For the public, NHS Health Scotland, who produce information materials to support the childhood vaccination programmes, have a series of publications which aim to ensure awareness of pneumococcal disease and prevention through vaccination. These include <em>Ready Steady Baby, A Guide to Childhood Immunisations for Babies up to 13 Months of Age</em> and <em>A Guide to Immunisations at 12 and 13 Months</em> . Information leaflets produced by the Scottish Government to support the adult pneumococcal vaccination programme are also widely available. All of this information is available on the new immunisation Scotland website, <a href="http://www.immunisationscotland.org.uk" target="_blank">www.immunisationscotland.org.uk</a> , which was launched earlier this year.</p>

  <p>Immunisation is the most effective way of preventing pneumococcal disease. Routine immunisation rates in babies with pneumococcal vaccine is high in Scotland, with the most recent vaccine uptake rates being 97.1%.</p>

  <p>In addition to the above, the Scottish Meningitis Awareness Group, which is chaired by Health Protection Scotland and which involves Health Scotland, NHS24 and leading meningitis charities, exists to promote awareness of meningitis and septicaemia (conditions caused by invasive pneumococcal disease) amongst the general public and health professionals. The group has been responsible for a three year awareness raising campaign for both the public and health professionals. This campaign targeted specific population groups and produced a range of materials and leaflets which are available at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.healthscotland.com/topics/immunisation/meningitis.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.healthscotland.com/topics/immunisation/meningitis.aspx</a>.</p>

  <p>In the past, work has been done around promoting awareness (and immunisation) in particular at-risk groups such as asplenics and those with cochlear implants</p>

  <p>For health professionals, pneumococcal disease is also covered in the NHS Education Scotland elearning package &quot;Promoting Effective Immunisation Practice&quot;. Each year the Chief Medical Officer writes to health professionals reminding them of the importance of pneumococcal disease and of the need to promote and deliver vaccination to those at risk.</p>

  <p>Interpreters are expected to hold, where possible, the Diploma in Public Service Interpreting (DPSI) (Scottish Legal Option) or have recent experience of consecutive and simultaneous interpreting in the criminal court context.</p>

  <p>DPSI is not available in all languages and in some cases where a spoken interpreter does not have the required qualification; it is recommended that a full written report be provided detailing the basis of the assessment and recommendation.</p>

  <p>The quality of services provided under the contracts is monitored by court officials and this is communicated to the Scottish Courts Service and Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service contract managers who formally monitor the collaborative contract through a process of quarterly contract management meetings with the service provider.</p>

  <p>In 2009-10, 2.6% of people receiving a direct payment had dementia.Information on clients with dementia was collected for the first time in the 2010 <br /> self-directed support (direct payments) survey. In previous surveys, these clients were included in the &quot;Other client group&quot; category.The Scottish Government provided Alzheimer Scotland with funding to carry out a study into the use of direct payments for people with dementia and their carers. The findings, published in their report, <em>Let&rsquo;s get personal</em> , illustrates that self-directed support along with natural supports in the lives of people with dementia can delay the need for institutional care. The dementia and the self-directed support strategies will make it clear that people with dementia and their families should have choice and control in the support provided to them. Alzheimer Scotland is represented on the Self-directed Support Bill Steering Group.</p>

  <p>The 2008 regulations came into force on to 3 August 2010 and prior to that date neighbour notification requirements were specified in the Town and Country Planning (General Development Procedure) (Scotland) Order 1992, now revoked, and the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997, which has been amended.Previously, applicants were responsible for neighbour notification, which applied to land next to or within four metres of the boundary of the land for which development was proposed; although there were slightly different requirements in particular circumstances. Applicants had to use the valuation roll to identify the names and addresses of those with an interest in such land and, where such information was not available, they had to send notification to premises on the neighbouring land. In the absence of premises the planning authority would place a notice in a newspaper and charge the applicant. Applicants had to certify the extent to which they had carried out neighbour notification and it was an offence, punishable by a fine, to knowingly or recklessly issue a notification or certificate which was false or misleading.</p>

  <p>No, we intend to continue to have an outcome-focussed approach by delivering CO <sub>2</sub> emissions reductions through building regulations. This allows the procurer of the new building the opportunity to use energy efficiency measures to good effect as well as consideration for using on-site renewable energy technologies. We have just introduced a 30% reduction in CO <sub>2</sub> emissions for new buildings through these regulations and they are set at such a level that compliance will generally involve the use of such technologies. Paragraph 44 of Scottish Planning Policy complements this approach, stating that &quot;It is recommended that development plan policies for development involving low and zero carbon generating technologies should accord with the standards, guidance and methodologies provided in building regulations&quot;.</p>

  <p>The Reshaping Care for Older People programme in Scotland is being taken forward jointly by the Scottish Government, COSLA and NHS Scotland through the Ministerial Strategic Group on Health and Community Care (MSG). The MSG is working with key partners, the public, stakeholders and their representatives and staff from the statutory and voluntary sectors, to evolve options for the future planning, provision and funding of services for older people.The wider issue of how long-term care is funded, specifically in terms of the balance between state and individual contribution, is a reserved matter, and is the focus of the UK Independent Commission on the Funding of Care and Support. We are however working in partnership with the commission to ensure that we achieve an affordable and sustainable funding system for care and support that reflects the interests of Scottish people.</p>

  <p>The Reshaping Care for Older People programme is being informed by a wide range of views. An extensive public engagement exercise took place between May and October 2010. During this time we have sought views from frontline local authority and NHS staff, voluntary sector partners, private sector interests and members of the public. All organisations involved in the planning and delivery of care for older people in Scotland were invited to make representations. We will take account of all representations and views received when we publish the outcome of the engagement phase.</p>

  <p>The UK Independent Commission on Funding Care and Support has not yet published its approach to consultation. It is anticipated this will be made public in the next month, when it can be viewed at http://carecommission.dh.gov.uk/. We will ensure that the views of Scotland are taken into account.</p>

  <p>The responsibility for winter maintenance rests with individual roads authorities, in the case of trunk roads the Scottish Ministers, and on local roads the relevant local authority. The Scottish Salt Group chaired by Transport Scotland and including representatives from Society of Chief Officers of Transportation in Scotland, Society of Local Authority Chief Executives and COSLA have been collaborating on the resilience of Scotland and have jointly published a report which is available at: <a href="http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk/strategy-and-research/publications-and-consultations/j13001-00.htm" target="_blank">http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk/strategy-and-research/publications-and-consultations/j13001-00.htm</a> .As recommended in the report, monitoring of restocking has shown that Scottish roads authorities are on target to have sufficient salt before the worst weather starts.

  <p>I have asked Barry White, Chief Executive of the Scottish Futures Trust, to respond. His response is as follows:The &pound;111 million of net savings and benefits delivered by the Scottish Futures Trust (SFT) in 2009-10 has been externally validated by London School of Economics and Grant Thornton and a full transparent breakdown of the calculations and validation findings are available on the SFT website. There are no plans for further validation or audit as the figures do not form part of SFT&rsquo;s statutory accounts.</p>

  <p>The Local Government - Council Tax Abolition team, which was part of the Local Government Division within the Scottish Government, has changed staff composition over time.

  <p>The Scottish Investment Bank project team is comprised of a combination of Scottish Enterprise, Highlands and Islands Enterprise and Scottish Government staff. At present, there are 3.5 full-time equivalent members of Scottish Government staff who work on the project and they are the following grades: 1 x Deputy Director, 1.4 x C1, 0.6 x B2 and 0.5 x A3. The majority of the project team is populated with a range of Scottish Enterprise, Highlands and Islands Enterprise and Scottish Government staff on a demand-led basis. Many of these team members are specialists in areas such as procurement or investment and join the team to undertake specific areas of work as required. This number and breakdown of staff has been consistent since the Scottish Investment Bank project team was formally established in January 2010.</p>

  <p>Although the Scottish Government does not fund the Forum for Environmental Volunteering Activity (FEVA), we have funded a number of initiatives for the benefit of member organisations across the FEVA network as summarised in the following table.</p>

  <p>The Volunteer Managers Development Programme includes training and networking, some of which is carried out and promoted through FEVA, and the project co-ordinator&rsquo;s work contributes to FEVA activities. We also fund external bodies to provide secretariat to FEVA meetings, including a group which gives stakeholder input to steering the Volunteer Managers Development Programme and Investing in Volunteering project.</p>
