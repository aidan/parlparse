  <p>Following the Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2007 coming into force, the UK Government commissioned an independent review into their impact on faith-based adoption agencies. This assessment took place during the transitional period given to faith-based adoption agencies. The assessment reports to an Inter-Ministerial Reference Group which considers the report; Scottish ministers are represented on this group.</p>

  <p>The assessment considers the impact that the provisions of the Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2007 have on faith-based adoption agencies. During the discussions at these meetings Scottish ministers have made clear the feelings expressed by the Scottish Parliament during the passage of the Adoption and Children (Scotland) Act 2007, that it is right and proper that same sex couples are entitled to be considered for adoption, but equally, faith-based adoption agencies should be able to continue their valuable work.</p>

  <p>From the 1 October the Scottish Land Court will take over the responsibility for administering a new streamlined EU agricultural subsidy appeals procedure. Under this new arrangement the government and the appellant will now be on an equal footing in all appeal cases and the process will be independent and quicker. I announced this change, which addressed the main recommendations contained in the Report <em>A Review of the European Union Agricultural Subsidy Appeals Procedure in Scotland</em> , in my speech to the National Farmers&rsquo; Union (NFU) Scotland&rsquo;s AGM in February. This fundamental change to the appeals procedure has been the main focus of our efforts.</p>

  <p>Work is on-going on how we take forward the other recommendations contained in the report which covered areas like creating greater dialogue between government and farmers and improving our application forms and guidance.</p>

  <p>On the latter, a great deal is already done along the lines suggested in the report and we will continue to build on current practises. A recommendation was also made that we encourage greater use of electronic submission of claims. This has been an action for us for some years. In 2008, 28% of all single application forms were submitted electronically which has risen to just under 32% in 2009. We will continue to develop and promote this means of delivery.</p>

  <p>I will make a further announcement on the details of the new arrangements in advance of the handover of responsibility to the Scottish Land Court.</p>

  <p>On 13 May, I announced a total of &pound;36 million across Scotland in 2009-10 for NHS boards to tackle alcohol misuse and alcohol-related harm. This is a further 45% increase on our record increase of 150% in 2008-09.</p>

  <p>This will enable boards to invest in achieving the NHS target on delivering alcohol brief interventions and enable Alcohol and Drug Action Teams (to be replaced by Alcohol and Drug Partnerships) to expand and develop prevention, support and treatment services for alcohol misuse.</p>

  <p>Decisions on how to spend these investments are made by local partnerships. Scottish Government guidance is that such decisions should be based on assessment of local need, taking into account health inequalities and the direction we have set out in our national Alcohol Framework and the new joint Framework for Local Partnerships on Alcohol and Drugs issued by the Scottish Government and COSLA. Both frameworks highlight the need to address the needs of Children Affected by Parental Substance Misuse and support families and communities.</p>

  <p>Information on the total number of people in Scotland aged under 18 diagnosed with an eating disorder (for example, anorexia, bulimia, or other psychological eating disorders) has been presented in S3W-24165, answered on 3 June 2009.</p>

  <p>Several sources of information can be used to identify patients who have been diagnosed with an eating disorder. Practice team information (PTI) is obtained from a sample of Scottish GP practices. However, the number of participating practices is too small to allow estimates to be made for individual NHS board areas.</p>

  <p>The numbers of patients aged under 18 years resident in NHS Lothian, whose eating disorder resulted in admission to acute (non-obstetric, non-psychiatric) or psychiatric hospitals, are shown in the following tables. Note: Patients who are exclusively treated in an outpatient setting are not included in these figures.</p>

  <p>Section 18 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 (&lsquo;the 1995 Act&rsquo;) gives the police powers to take DNA if a person is arrested or detained for an imprisonable offence, and to retain the DNA sample and profile indefinitely if the person is convicted in court. Section 18A of the 1995 Act gives a power to retain DNA from people prosecuted for, but not convicted of, a relevant sexual or violent offence for a period of three years, following which a chief constable can apply to a sheriff for extensions of up to two years. This legislation currently applies to children who are prosecuted in court, but not those who are dealt with in the children&rsquo;s hearings system.</p>

  <p>DNA identifies individuals with a high degree of confidence and can be used to link individuals to, or eliminate them from, a criminal enquiry. The checking of profiles against crime scene samples can provide leads for unsolved crimes. The retention of DNA on conviction can also provide a means of identifying reoffending at a later date. Ultimately, these powers help to keep the public safe by providing an effective and efficient way of identifying individuals who commit crime.</p>

  <p>Tables 1 and 2 provide details of children whose DNA profiles are held on the Scottish DNA Database and the powers under which the profiles are retained. Table 3 provides details of children whose DNA profiles are held on the National DNA Database after being arrested in England and Wales.</p>

  <p>A number of initiatives are in place to support this work.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government and NHS Health Scotland, in consultation with the Royal College of Psychiatry and National Schizophrenia Fellowship, will review current evidence-based approaches on smoking cessation, weight management and physical activity for those experiencing mental health problems. Based on findings, a suite of user and carer-led health information, tailored for people with mental health problems, will be provided.</p>

  <p>Integrated Care Pathways (ICPs) for Mental Health have a focus on Physical Health Assessment and Management. This requires a general physical health assessment and management of the findings to be recorded. Services should then be provided that address diet, nutrition, exercise, alcohol consumption, drug misuse and sexual health in ways that are responsive to the needs of service users. Boards are currently undergoing a system of accreditation to ensure they are developing and implementing ICP&rsquo;s.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Recovery Indicator Tool, designed to assess practice against expected values in a range of mental health services, has just been launched. This includes a measure for health improvement.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to increasing awareness and early diagnosis for dementia.</p>

  <p>The Government is testing out an awareness raising campaign in Tayside which is aimed at raising the awareness of the symptoms of dementia and signposting those worried about significant changes to their memory to seek help and advice. Findings from this campaign will inform future work.</p>

  <p>In addition, NHS Health Scotland has recently produced several publications to raise awareness about dementia. <em>Worried about your Memory?</em> (Bib. number 47925) is aimed at helping people who are concerned about their memory to decide whether they should see a doctor and <em>Facing Dementia: how to live well with your diagnosis</em> (Bib. number 47926) provides practical information for people who have recently been diagnosed.</p>

  <p>Scotland&rsquo;s first dementia strategy announced at the end of May 2009 will give further consideration to creating awareness of the symptoms of dementia.</p>

  <p>At local level the Mental Health Collaborative supports colleagues to ensure there are good systems and processes in place to increase the number of people identified with an early diagnosis of dementia in GP practices.</p>

  <p>The National Care Standards for care homes were published in November 2001 and set out what residents in care homes can expect from the provider. The standards cover such things as personal plans and what should be recorded in them, indoor and outdoor activities, the physical environment, and the administration of medication.</p>

  <p>Remember, I&rsquo;m still me highlighted a number of areas in which the care of older people with dementia in care homes needs to be improved. The report&rsquo;s findings demonstrated that the requirements in the standards are not always being met and that guidance, such as that relating to Adults with Incapacity, is not always being followed.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government accepted the recommendations made in the report and is fully committed to taking action to improve the quality and safety of care for those with dementia living in care homes.</p>

  <p>I announced on 28 May 2009 that we would be developing a national dementia strategy for Scotland to ensure that we deliver the dementia care that people need. The strategy will be developed in consultation with the Scottish Dementia Forum and other partners. The quality of care, treatment and support for people with dementia is one of the areas which will be considered as part of the strategy.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what assessment NHSScotland has made of the European Court of Justice ruling in relation to cases C-350/06 and C-520/06 on the carrying over of holiday entitlement during long-term sick leave and what additional cost is anticipated as a result of this decision.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-06-12.S3W-24532.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80396" speakername="Nicola Sturgeon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa0612.htm#11">

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises the need to ensure that NHSScotland is complying with these rulings and issued a letter to all NHS boards in Scotland &ndash; CEL (2009)17 &ndash; on 30 April 2009. This letter clarifies the implications of the ruling for NHS employers and sets out the leave carry over entitlement from one leave year to the next which staff are entitled to under the European working time directive.</p>

  <p>As this ruling only affects staff who are on long-term sick leave for a period which spans the end of one leave year and the beginning of the next, and who have taken less than their European working time directive leave entitlement at that point, the numbers involved each year are likely to be relatively small.</p>

  <p>No national assessment of costs associated with the ruling has been undertaken as it is for boards locally to manage ongoing fluctuations in costs in the light of any changes to the law.</p>

  <p>Policies for employment issues, such as how staff are managed when on long-term sick leave, are guided by the Partnership Information Network (PIN) policy guideline on <em>Managing Health at Work</em>. This policy is currently under review and the implications of this ruling will be reflected in the revised policy.</p>

  <p>The National Implementation Group for the Delivery Framework for Adult Rehabilitation is overseeing a national implementation plan which includes high impact changes, key actions and deliverables in the way rehabilitation services are delivered throughout NHS board areas. The role of the rehabilitation co-ordinators will be measured against the implementation of the high impact changes.</p>

  <p>In addition to their remit of re-designing rehabilitation services, rehabilitation co-ordinators will carry out a specific impact evaluation project in their NHS board area. Not all evaluation projects have yet been determined. However, agreed evaluations include the NHS 24 physiotherapy advice and referral management project in Lothian, the falls management programme in NHS Ayrshire and Arran and the musculoskeletal pathway in NHS Lanarkshire. All of these evaluations will be carried out within a two year time frame.</p>

  <p>The results of any evaluation will be published on the rehabilitation website and, if appropriate, in relevant peer reviewed journals <a href="http://www.rehabilitationframework.scot.nhs.uk" target="_blank">www.rehabilitationframework.scot.nhs.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>At present, there is no waiting time data collected nationally for the allied health professions including physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy. Waiting times are variable across Scotland and it is for individual NHS boards to provide the level of service required based on priority and local need. However, the Scottish Government is currently working with Information Services Division to review the current data collected on allied health professions services.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Government is committed to ensuring that patients have swift and safe access to the full range of services they need from NHS Scotland and allied health professionals are already included in delivering patient care and treatment which has cut waiting times for patients across Scotland. Treatment can include triage, assessment and therapeutic interventions by physiotherapists and other allied health professionals in both hospital and community settings sometimes avoiding the need for consultant referral. Allied health professionals have an important role to play in delivering better, faster care in a variety of roles and settings.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government believes that all children in Scotland, including those with diabetes, should be able to enjoy a full school life because their school gives them the necessary support.</p>

  <p>Legislation, policy and guidance are in place to support this commitment. For example, the Additional Support for Learning Act 2004 requires education authorities to identify, meet and keep under review the additional support needs of all pupils for whose education they are responsible, including those who have additional support needs arising from type 1 diabetes. The act emphasises the importance of effective multi-agency working. Meeting the needs of each individual pupil lies at the heart of this legislation.</p>

  <p>In addition to the legislation to support schools and local authorities, the Scottish Government has produced <em>Safe and Well </em>guidance which provides a range of advice on issues which may affect children and young people while they are attending school. The guidance contains specific advice on the development of health care plans to meet the needs of individual pupils, including administration of medicines.</p>

  <p>NHS boards have statutory responsibility for the medical inspection, supervision and treatment of pupils in schools, including the administration of medicines, and education authorities help them to discharge this responsibility. They have a duty to ensure that they have suitably trained staff in place and to make appropriate arrangements and provision for children with diabetes. No child should go through school without their needs being identified and addressed.</p>

  <p>Guidance on the Administration of Medicines in Schools emphasises that school staff who have volunteered to administer regular or emergency medication to a pupil, should receive detailed training from a health professional. Although the content of training courses is the responsibility of NHS boards, the guidance states that for diabetes, this should, as a minimum, cover an understanding of the condition, the importance of diet and the symptoms of hypoglycaemia. Staff should also be aware of the emergency treatment for low blood sugar and how to measure blood sugar levels.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has asked NHS Health Scotland to establish a National Suicide Register. This will bring together relevant agencies from a range of sectors and will provide significant detail around individuals who have completed suicide; it will examine causal factors regarding suicide and will inform development of future policy and practice on suicide prevention. It is intended that a specification for the register will be available by the end of 2009. The development of the register itself is likely to take around two years beyond that.</p>

  <p>The national care standards set out the standard of care that a young person can expect from any care service including secure care. They aim to ensure a consistent standard of service provision and are underpinned by a set of values care providers are expected to adopt.</p>

  <p>The Care Commission is responsible for the regulation of secure units and has enforcement powers which it can use where services fail to meet the requirements set out in the legislation and the national care standards.</p>

  <p>The national care standards set out the standard of care that a young person can expect from any care service including secure care. They require the young person to have up-to-date information on the care home, and staff are expected to explain responsibilities, rules and policies in a way young people can easily understand.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has funded two booklets on children&rsquo;s rights for children and young people being looked after away from home, one specifically aimed at those in secure care. These booklets are being used as part of a package of information local authorities will provide to children and young people when they enter secure care.</p>

  <p>The national care standards require young people to have access to other agencies and services including advocacy. Young people in secure care have access to Who Cares? Scotland staff, children&rsquo;s rights officers or other independent advocacy organisations, including legal representation. The Care Commission takes into account the national care standards when inspecting secure care services.</p>

  <p>Responding to the recommendations of the recently published <em>Independent Inquiry into Abuse at Kerelaw Residential School and Secure Unit</em>, the Scottish Government recently announced its intention to commission a national survey to identify the access, availability and funding of advocacy services to children. We will seek to publish a report by the end of 2009.</p>

  <p>Local authorities have a duty to make a care plan for all their looked after children, including young people in secure care. This is monitored as part of inspection. The forthcoming Looked After Children (Scotland) Regulations 2009 seek to ensure that the young person is at the centre of decisions and require that young people are consulted about their care plan.</p>

  <p>The use of single separation should be covered within existing guidance for care staff and all incidences of single separation should be recorded. These records are monitored during inspections by the Care Commission.</p>

  <p>Some secure care services have clearly designated quiet rooms. However, it would not be appropriate or practical for all services to have them. Where time out is necessary, existing rooms &ndash; including young people&rsquo;s bedrooms &ndash; can be used for this purpose. The Care Commission monitors the use of time out during inspections.</p>
