We have undertaken to examine the case for additional financial support to the unit, which will include considering with the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland whether there could be a case for a collective contribution in recognition of the value which the unit provides to Scottish police services.

  <p>The plan for responding to bluetongue within the UK, including within Scotland, is outlined in the document &quot;UK Bluetongue Control Strategy&quot;, which was published in early August and is available on the Scottish Government and Defra websites. This strategy, on which any response to bluetongue is based, was jointly developed and agreed by UK Governments, experts, and industry.</p>

  <p>The main focus of a response to a bluetongue outbreak in Scotland would be to declare a 20km radius control zone around the infected premises, along with a minimum 100km radius protection zone and a surveillance zone extending 50km beyond that, and to introduce movement restrictions within these zones. Movement of animals within or out of these zones would only be permitted in certain circumstances and under licence with certain compulsory precautions, e.g. testing for disease or the use of insecticides. Routine on-farm use of insecticides would not be required. As bluetongue is a vector (i.e. midge) borne disease, large scale culling of animals is not expected.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether operation Artemis&rsquo; strategy recognises that, in areas where illegal killing of birds of prey occurs, the nature of offences against hen harriers may make them difficult to detect and the detection and investigation of offences involving other species can act as an early warning system that hen harriers may be at risk and may present an opportunity to apprehend offenders before they have a severe effect on hen harriers and other rare species in that area.</p>

  <p>Operation Artemis came to a close on the 30 September 2007. It was a part of the UK police service response to counter the criminal threat to hen harriers. The aims were to work in partnership to secure better prevention, detection and investigation of offences against the species across the whole of the UK.</p>

  <p>The police service response to tackling this criminal activity involves analysing all aspects of the modus operandi used by those who persecute hen harriers.</p>

  <p>Partly as a result of the investigative work carried out by Operation Artemis the illegal persecution of the hen harrier was reaffirmed as a UK wildlife crime priority for the period 2007-08 on 2 October 2007.</p>

  <p>National Planning Policy Guideline (NPPG) 14: Natural Heritage (published 1999) sets out government guidance on how policies for conservation and enhancement of Scotland&rsquo;s natural heritage should be reflected in land use planning. It explains how planning authorities are expected to have full regard to natural heritage considerations in determining planning applications. NPPG 14 is currently under review and will in due course be replaced by a new Scottish Planning Policy (SPP) 14. A draft version of SPP 14 will be issued for consultation early in 2008.</p>

  <p>The 2007-08 local government finance settlement has been fully allocated and it is for each authority to manage its spending within the overall resources available to it, including those provided by government and those raised locally. Within the 2007-08 budget the new government has already provided the City of Edinburgh Council since June with additional resources, both capital and current, in excess of &pound;5 million, for various purposes connected with the delivery of education and early years services.</p>

  <p>Information on intake levels for student nurses and midwives is published on the Scottish Health Statistics website under workforce statistics, at www.isdscotland.org/workforce.</p>

  <p>Section E gives details of the nursing and midwifery students in training. In particular, table E11 shows the intake numbers for student nurses and midwives by financial year and nursing speciality.
