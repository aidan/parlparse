  <p>We aim to implement Part 2 of the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act 2003 (which introduces a right for tenants to buy the farm they rent) in late spring 2004.</p>

  <p>Commencement requires Part 2 of the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 (which introduces the community right to buy), on which some of the provisions in Part 2 of the Agricultural Holdings Act hang, to be in force. Our target remains to commence Part 2 of the Land Reform Act during spring 2004. We separately require to bring forward to Parliament subordinate legislation to be made under powers contained in the Agricultural Holdings Act. The policy proposals will be the subject of a second consultation paper which we intend to issue in the near future.</p>

  <p>The provision and funding of family support facilities is a matter for discussion at local level, between the family support group, the local drug and alcohol action team and its partner agencies.</p>

  <p>However, the Executive is strongly committed to the support of families affected by drug and alcohol abuse. The partnership agreement committed the Executive to increasing support for alcohol services in our communities and highlighted support for the families of people affected by alcohol problems as a specific example of the services it wishes to enhance further. The Executive is providing &#163;180,000 from recovered criminal assets for the work of the new Scottish Network for Families Affected by Drugs. It has funded two national conferences to enable family members affected by drug misuse from across Scotland to share their experiences and to gain advice and support on issues such as funding and accessing premises for family support work.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Effective Interventions Unit has published a review of family support designed to help drug action teams and their partner agencies develop more effective ways of supporting the families and carers of drug users.</p>

  <p>The Executive sets objectives for environment protection annually in the corporate plan for the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA). Outcomes are reported in SEPA&#8217;s annual report. Both the report and the corporate plan may be found on SEPA&#8217;s website at www.sepa.org.uk. The Executive&#8217;s high-level objectives for environment protection for the present Parliament are set out in <em>A Partnership for a Better Scotland</em> , which may be found in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 27591). Achievements against objectives set during the previous Parliament are set out in <em>Reporting our Achievements,</em> which is also available in the information centre (Bib. number 25620).</p>

  <p>The Water Quality and Standards document, <em>Investment priorities for Scotland&#8217;s Water Authorities 2002-2006</em>, set a number of standards for progress during that period.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will report on the outcome of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council to be held in Brussels on 17 November 2003.</p>

  <p>I attended the one-day Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels on 17 November 2003 together with Margaret Beckett and Ben Bradshaw.</p>

  <p>On fisheries, three items were on the agenda. The first was a presentation by the Commission on this year&#8217;s scientific advice from the International Council of the Exploration of the Sea and the Commission&#8217;s own Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries; the second was a discussion on the Commission&#8217;s proposals for cod and hake recovery plans, and the third was a political agreement on the introduction of an experimental fishery in Greenland waters.</p>

  <p>The Commission said that the scientific advice indicated 14 stocks are now outside safe biological limits and this underlined the need for effective effort controls on top of catch limits to make conservation work. The Commission also expressed concerns about the accuracy of landings and discard data, which underpinned scientific assessments and called up on member states to improve on data quality.</p>

  <p>On cod and hake recovery, the Commission said that it was now more than two years since the first cod recovery proposals were tabled. Though the decisions on long-term arrangements were difficult, deferment continued uncertainty in the industry and the Commission&#8217;s long-term proposals offered greater certainty and stability.</p>

  <p>A subsequent round table discussion centred on the biological and management targets for cod and hake stocks, the need for effort control, and the merits of the Commission&#8217;s proposals as compared with the current, interim regime contained in Annex XVII to last December&#8217;s TAC and quota regulation.</p>

  <p>The UK stressed its commitment to recovery measures for stocks in serious difficulty, building on what had been achieved already. However, decisions taken this year would need to reflect what had already been achieved in terms of quota reductions and effort cuts and also take account of the impact on fishermen and communities; whilst there was a need to maintain measures to protect fishing for associated recovery stocks such as haddock, whiting and nephrops, it should be maintained at optimum levels. If the Annex 17 measures are to be continued into 2004 pending introduction of longer term measures, the UK agreed that the weaknesses of Annex 17 should be addressed.</p>

  <p>For the longer term, the UK agreed that the Commission&#8217;s proposal based on kilowatt days, should be further considered and, in particular, that multi annual approaches to fisheries management should be pursued.</p>

  <p>The UK supported a provisional decision by Council to apply two aspects of a recently negotiated fisheries protocol between the EC and Greenland, namely experimental fisheries in Greenland water to which the Scottish fleet will have access, and the budgetary support programme. This agreement was without prejudice to further discussions on the draft protocol as a whole, on aspects of which the UK has reservations.</p>

  <p>On agriculture, the Council discussed two aspects of a proposal on official controls of food and feed. A presidency compromise proposed setting rules governing the fees to be charged for control of animal products while leaving those on non-animal products to the discretion of member states. The compromise would also remove the proposed obligation to impose criminal sanctions for certain offences. All member states supported the first and the UK joined the majority in supporting the second.</p>

  <p>The Council took note of progress in discussion of proposals for improved identification of sheep and goats. The text had been modified to accommodate a number of practical concerns from member states but it was agreed, without discussion, to refer it to officials for further examination.</p>

  <p>The Council discussed further reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP). There was a first exchange of views on possible reforms in the sugar sector. The Commission reiterated the case for reform, noting in particular the external pressures on the EU market. Specific proposals were planned to be tabled in the early part of 2004. Meanwhile, the UK joined four other member states in arguing for a reform in line with the principles underlying the reforms that the Council had agreed for other sectors last June, particularly to ensure increased market orientation in this sector. Other member states took a generally more cautious approach, either seeking to delay reform until 2006 or arguing to limit the extent of any departure from the present arrangements. On tobacco, the six producing member states stressed the social and regional importance of tobacco production and expressed varying reservations about the scale of reform in general and, in particular, the full decoupling of aid or its transfer to the second pillar of the CAP. The UK supported the Commission's arguments for full and early decoupling. Given previous discussion on cotton and olive oil, there were only brief comments on this occasion, with producer member states re-emphasising the contribution of these crops to the agricultural economy. All the CAP reform dossiers will now be further considered by officials.</p>

  <p>Under any other business, Denmark drew attention to imports of cat and dog fur derived from animals kept in inhumane conditions; all member states supported Danish concerns. France asked for consideration to be given to the truffle sector which was in difficulties, partly due to this summer's drought. The Commission gave early notice that it would be proposing a reduction in the level of set aside for the 2004 crop to 5%; no member state opposed. Portugal drew attention to difficulties on the rice market. Spain pressed for release of intervention stocks of rye to alleviate animal feed difficulties. Commissioner Fischler reported on a successful Rural Development Conference held in Salzburg the previous week. Slovakia and several of the Accession States had concerns about the proposed treatment of foodstocks in their countries at the point of accession.</p>

  <p>The Executive's 1999 policy statement covering the provision of mental health and social work services for mentally disordered offenders made proposals for the organisation and development of these services throughout Scotland. The statement confirmed that NHS boards were responsible for assessing the need for the structured development of local facilities and services. Where these considerations involved medium secure services, it was proposed that these be taken forward by NHS boards working together in regional groupings.</p>

  <p>Progress on planning and providing local forensic services continues to be made. The Orchard Clinic with its 50-bed unit was opened on the Royal Edinburgh campus in 2001. Planning permission for the proposed 70-bed unit at the Stobhill Hospital site in Glasgow has been granted, and work is scheduled to begin in 2004, with an estimated completion date of mid 2006. The plans for the development of a 36-bed unit for the West of Scotland are currently out to consultation. Tayside, Grampian and the Highland NHS boards are assessing the needs of patients in the north and north east and are expected to come forward with proposals in 2004.</p>

It is not possible to separate the information into care types i.e. intensive or special care. The following table shows the average occupancy rate of cots in neonatal units for years ended 31st March 1997 to 2002 by NHS board area.</p>

  <p>Pupil:teacher ratios have declined in primary schools from 19.1 in 1999 to 18.0 in 2002. In secondary schools they have declined from 12.9 to 12.7 over the same period. Therefore previous circulars on staffing levels issued by the Scottish Office now have little relevance to today&#8217;s schools. This is now a matter for individual education authorities taking into account local circumstances and workforce planning assumptions now take place against actual pupil:teacher ratios rather than any historic staffing standard.</p>

  <p>Teachers in education authority schools are subject to national terms and conditions of service agreed within the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers. The national conditions contain remote schools and distant islands allowances. There are no plans to introduce &quot;golden hellos&quot; or other local incentive schemes.</p>

  <p>The requirement for supply staff is discussed with members of the Teacher Workforce Planning Advisory Group which includes representatives of education authorities, teachers&#8217; organisations and the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council (SHEFC). The purpose of the group is to offer advice on the requirement for newly trained teachers to Scottish ministers who in turn provide guidance to SHEFC. Intakes to courses of teacher training are a matter for SHEFC. An allowance of 7% in primary education and 6% in secondary education has been included within the statistical model from 2004 onwards, together with further additional supply cover in maths and English. This compares to an average teachers absence rate due to ill health of 4.0% in 2001-02.</p>

  <p>In the 2003-04 charges scheme, customers who consume large volumes of waters had the option to sign up for a three-year agreement at a discounted rate. The details are available on Scottish Water&#8217;s website at: http://www.scottishwater.co.uk/index.htm.</p>

  <p>The Water Industry Commissioner and Scottish Water are currently discussing the annual charges scheme for 2004-05.</p>

  <p>Local authorities were informed of their three-year allocations in December 2002, which were the consequentials of spending review 2002. Discussions with COSLA are starting for spending review 2004 but presently these discussions are still at an early stage and no decisions have been taken. Funding pressures will be included as part of these discussions.</p>
