  <p>The reimbursement paid to bus operators under the scheme is based on the revenue foregone for each journey, i.e. the fare that would have been paid in the absence of the scheme. Although these fares derive from fare tables submitted by the bus operators, journey distance is not recorded, and as such it is not possible to report on the average cost per kilometre travelled.</p>

  <p>NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde advise that the acute physician appointments are to supplement the team of physicians based at the Royal Alexandria Hospital who will be providing acute care at the Vale of Leven Hospital on a rotational basis. The NHS board point out that these appointments are therefore not as locums to the Vale; the clinicians will play their part as members of the overall consultant team providing acute care at the Vale. The board has assured us that these arrangements are sustainable whilst the full complement of staff is put in place in a planned way to deliver the Vision for the Vale of Leven Hospital.</p>

  <p>I was very concerned to learn of the fire at the Christie ward on 11 July 2010. I wrote to the ward staff shortly afterwards to pay tribute to their calm but rapid actions which I understand were instrumental in avoiding potentially very serious consequences, and ensured the safety of local patients.</p>

  <p>I understand that this will be discussed at the next Vale of Leven Monitoring Group on 30 August 2010. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde should be prepared to discuss all reasonable options with the Group in the first instance.</p>

  <p>The fact that the ward is no longer operational will clearly affect the way both NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and the monitoring group take forward their roles in relation to providing ministers with a further report on local demand for inpatient mental health services.</p>

  <p>I am aware that the board has been sharing data on the local demand for inpatient mental health services with the monitoring group since its inception. My view is that it is reasonable for the group to expect that the local demand for inpatient beds continues to be monitored over a longer period in order to establish a meaningful trend. I also think such an extended period, of around eight to 10 months, would allow the group to monitor the efficacy of the enhanced community-based services put in place by the board.</p>

  <p>The monitoring group&rsquo;s conclusions will ultimately inform consideration of future service proposals at Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS Board. Following a board decision, Scottish ministers will take all the available information into account in coming to a final view on the future of local inpatient mental health services.</p>

  <p>Having made this a specific requirement in the monitoring group&rsquo;s remit, and having ensured there is relevant representation on the group for mental health service users and carers, I expect NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to ensure that the group continues to be fully involved in the consideration of the future of local inpatient mental health services.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally as data on cleaning staff directly employed by NHS are not captured separately in the workforce statistics. NHS Services Scotland Information Services Division (ISD) Scotland publish data annually, as at 30 September, on Support Services - Hotel Services staff, which includes domestic staff but following agenda for change (AfC) assimilation the post descriptor domestic staff may not encompass all cleaners. Cleaning staff may have assimilated into other post descriptors. These figures include domestic supervisors and domestic managers. Furthermore, some NHS boards still externally contract cleaning staff which therefore makes it difficult to provide specific and accurate data on cleaners. Data for the years 2007 to 2009 for Hotel Services staff are presented in the following table:</p>

  <p>The data in the table for September 2009 covers only six months of the year 2009-10 for which an additional &pound;5 million was allocated to employ up to 600 more cleaners. When the September 2010 data is published it will show the full impact of that funding.</p>

  <p>Prior to 2007 NHS Workforce Information was published based on the Whitley pay structure. For this reason it is not possible to compare the Whitley staff in post information to AfC bandings. Domestic staff information for the years 1999 to 2006 is available at:</p>

  <p>Health is a devolved matter and therefore changes proposed by the UK Government to NHS services in England do not have a direct impact on NHSScotland, however we are working with colleagues in the Department of Health to keep in touch with ongoing developments.</p>

  <p>The principles within <em>Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS</em> echo the Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment to healthcare services free at the point of use for those who need them, and to our ambition to make NHSScotland a world leader in healthcare quality, which is set out in our recently published <em>Healthcare Quality Strategy</em>. However, some of the structural issues are of less relevance in Scotland and some aspects of the UK Government&rsquo;s proposed approach are very different from the mutual NHS to which we are committed in Scotland. We will continue to consider whether there are any aspects of the UK proposals which might help us deliver the kind of world class services we have set out in our Quality Strategy.</p>
