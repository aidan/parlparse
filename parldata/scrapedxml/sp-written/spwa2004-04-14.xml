  <p>The Scottish Executive recognises that small businesses play a key role in rural communities and is keen to encourage more start-up businesses in these areas. Responsibility for assisting business start-ups, including in rural areas generally, falls to Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise who, through their Enterprise Networks provide support services to encourage individuals to consider the option of running their own business. Within the Scottish Enterprise area, services are accessed through the Business Gateway which covers all public sector support available both locally and nationally for start-ups and businesses of all sizes. In the Highlands and Islands Enterprise area, the Local Enterprise Companies act as a single access point to support for start-ups and established businesses.</p>

  <p>The information is not available in the form requested.</p>

  <p>Information on the financial implications of devolved provisions in UK legislation has on each occasion been included within the Sewel memorandum that the Scottish Executive has provided to the relevant Committee of the Scottish Parliament since September 2003. This supplements information on the overall financial implications that is included within the explanatory notes that Her Majesty&#8217;s Government provides with UK legislation that it introduces at Westminster.</p>

  <p>Additional financial resources would not normally be made available by Her Majesty&#8217;s Government to meet the financial implications of devolved provisions in UK legislation, as responsibility for devolved matters rests with the Scottish Executive and Scottish Parliament.</p>

  <p>The requirement to register is an automatic requirement arising from a conviction or finding for a sexual offence. All of the sexual offences under the law of Scotland are underpinned by penalties that reflect the seriousness of the crime and enable the appropriate punishment of the offender. Following registration, it is the responsibility of the police in collaboration with the local authority social work services and other relevant agencies to carry out a risk assessment that will include an assessment of the level of violence and threat to society as well as other factors.</p>
