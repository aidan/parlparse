  <p>The &#163;18 million available to fish processors, is distributed through the FIFG Lowland Scotland Processing and Marketing Scheme, under a six-year programme ending in 2006. Processors can apply at any time, and awards are made on a quarterly basis through a competitive selection procedure.</p>

  <p>Applications receive priority if they add value in Scotland to primary produce, involve products designed for the export market, result in an increase or safeguarding of employment or demonstrate increased returns to the catching/fish farming sector.</p>

  <p>To date 39 applications have been awarded FIFG grant of &#163;3.8 million plus SEERAD support grant of &#163;1.3 million. These awards are expected to generate investment of more than &#163;26 million and lead to the creation of 900 jobs.</p>

  <p>This is a matter for the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council. However, my Guidance Letter to the council stated that delivery of the Executive&#146;s objectives for higher education will require collaboration with a wide range of other bodies, both on the part of the council and individual institutions. Key partners include schools and colleges, the Scottish Further Education Funding Council, Scottish Enterprise, Highlands and Islands Enterprise, the business community and recently created bodies, such as learndirect scotland. I look to the council to provide leadership on this and to promote a culture of partnership and co-operation across the sector and beyond, in particular to meet the challenges of creating a lifelong learning culture.</p>

  <p>Highlands and Islands Enterprise has received no lottery funding in respect of the Community Right to Buy and Crofting Community Right to Buy elements of the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill.</p>

  <p>The Land Reform (Scotland) Bill does not make any financial provision for land purchase by community bodies under either the Community Right to Buy or the Crofting Community Right to Buy Parts. The bill is designed to remove land-based barriers which historically have hampered development.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Land Fund was launched by the New Opportunities Fund in February 2001 and it is administered by Highlands and Islands Enterprise and Scottish Enterprise, on behalf of the New Opportunities Fund.</p>

  <p>The &#163;10 million fund is designed to support sustainable rural development in Scotland by helping communities to buy, manage and develop local land and related assets. The Scottish Land Fund will complement the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill, but it is not an integral part of it. Funding from the Scottish Land Fund may be one source of support for communities seeking to exercise their rights under the bill.</p>

  <p>The &#163;10 million allocated to the Scottish Land Fund amounts to 75% of Scotland's &#163;14 million (11.5%) share of the New Opportunities Fund's &#163;125 million Green Spaces and Sustainable Communities programme.</p>

  <p>The New opportunities Fund was created under the National Lottery Act of 1998 to fund Health, Education and Environment projects and the creation of the Scottish Land Fund is consistent with its remit.</p>

  <p>As indicated in paragraphs 324 to 334 of the Scottish Executive&#146;s Financial Memorandum, which accompanied the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill on introduction to Parliament on 27 November 2001, various costs to the Executive are envisaged in relation to the community and crofting community right to buy provisions of the bill. Further estimated costs to other parties are detailed in paragraphs 337 to 350 of the Financial Memorandum.</p>

  <p>The level of funding required to assist community and crofting community bodies in purchasing land under the provisions of the bill will depend on the level of uptake. There will be no financial assistance provided by the Executive towards the cost of purchasing the land itself. It will be for community bodies themselves to look for sources of funding. The Highlands and Islands and Scottish Enterprise Community Land Units and the Scottish Land Fund are one possible route.</p>

  <p>Copies of the bill and its accompanying documents are available from the Scottish Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 17790).</p>

  <p>The Forestry Commission is indeed taking such measures. It has agreed with the Interim National Park Authority that the Queen Elizabeth Forest Park will retain its own unique identity within the National Park. The commission is also taking this opportunity to review the future branding and promotion of the Forest Park and it is considering introducing an updated logo. Any new logo will, however, retain the main traditional features, including Ben Lomond, forests, lochs and deer. Furthermore, the commission is enhancing the tourism potential of the Forest Park by creating new recreational facilities and improving existing ones. This work is being financed in part by a substantial EU grant.</p>
