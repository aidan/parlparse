  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will report on the outcome of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council held in Brussels on 21 and 22 December 2004.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-01-25.S2W-13136.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80032" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa0125.htm#1">

  <p>I attended the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels on 21 and 22 December 2004 together with Margaret Beckett, Ben Bradshaw and Ian Pearson.</p>

  <p><strong>On fisheries</strong>, the Council agreed the total allowable catches (TACs) and quotas for 2005.</p>

  <p>Significant TAC increases in four of Scotland&rsquo;s most valuable fisheries were agreed: Northern Monkfish (47% initially); North Sea Herring (16%); North Sea Nephrops (12%) West of Scotland Nephrops (12%) with further significant TAC increases in important secondary fisheries: North Sea Whiting, Blue Whiting and West of Scotland Haddock (17%) also agreed. Rollover TACs were agreed for North Sea Cod and Rockall Haddock.</p>

  <p>Due to strong scientific advice, there were significant reductions in Western Mackerel (27%) and North Sea Mackerel (59%) quotas, the economic impact of which should be ameliorated in part by market responses. In conformity with the new long-term management plan agreed with Norway in advance of the Council, the TAC for North Sea haddock was also cut, by 14%. The impact of this reduction is expected to be offset by the less than full uptake of current quota allocations. The restrictions for Scottish vessels associated with special haddock fishing permits were removed.</p>

  <p>The UK delegation successfully rejected unjustified and unscientific proposals to close large areas of the North Sea to all fishing and also resisted the Commission&rsquo;s alternative position of further reductions in days at sea for North Sea whitefish vessels. The current monthly allocation will be cut by a single day, but skippers using fishing gear with 120mm mesh size &ndash; as is already used by most of the Scottish fleet - will be granted an additional day&rsquo;s allowance, with a net neutral effect.</p>

  <p>In light of scientific advice about the depleted West of Scotland cod stock, agreement was also reached on a reduction by two in the baseline number of permitted days at sea inside the West of Scotland cod recovery zone for vessels using whitefish (100mm plus) nets. However, an additional day is available to offset this, by way of a derogation for vessels fishing with nets of a mesh size of 120mm or above, subject to compliance with associated conditions. Days at sea available for other categories of fishing gear and areas of the cod recovery zone including to the west of Scotland are reduced by one day per month. However, the Commission&rsquo;s proposals to extend the current area of closure and also to reduce the allocation of permitted days at sea by three were successfully modified. The current closed area will not now be extended.</p>

  <p>Significantly the Council accepted our argument that the Scottish demersal fleet has already undertaken significant reduction in fishing effort alongside other conservation measures with the aim of recovering cod stocks, and that further radical measures at this stage &ndash; as was originally proposed - would have been both disproportionate and premature.</p>

  <p>Deep Sea TACs for 2005 and 2006 were also agreed at Council. Four new species; Alfonsinos, Deep Sea Sharks, Forkbeards and Greenland Halibut were added to the deep sea regulation. The TACs for all four species have been set at low levels, though the UK has secured a significant share of the TAC in all of them except Alfonsinos.</p>

  <p>Otherwise there were significant reductions in most deep sea TACs including 17% for both North Sea and West Coast Tusk, 17% for West Coast Blue Ling and 19% for North Sea Blue Ling. Cuts were justified on the grounds of very strong scientific advice that fishing effort on these stocks needs to be reduced, but the more stringent initial proposals from the Commission were successfully modified.</p>

  <p>Through working closely with our industry we have secured a deal on quotas that delivers on our priorities and maintains effective conservation measures. The deal restores flexibility for Scotland&rsquo;s fishing industry and shares efforts to protect threatened cod stocks more equitably between European partners, encouraging other fishing fleets to use more selective fishing nets &ndash; as the Scottish fleet already does - through the incentive of securing additional days.</p>

  <p>Like the Scottish fishing industry, I welcome the agreed arrangements.</p>

  <p>Finally, the Commission also presented a proposal on the simplification of the Common Fisheries Policy&rsquo;s rules. Work on this proposal is to be continued during the Luxemburg presidency.</p>

  <p><strong>On agriculture</strong>, the Presidency reported on two conferences which had considered the handling of animal disease outbreaks, including zoonosis (animal diseases transmissible to humans), from both the financial and disease control angles. The Commission indicated that it would be taking forward work in this area with a view to developing a more strategic approach to animal health. The UK strongly supported this initiative.</p>

  <p>The Council held an orientation debate on measures to deal with illegally logged timber imports. The UK joined a number of delegations in welcoming progress in this area while noting that further work to counter attempts at circumvention of EU controls was needed. The UK also welcomed the Commission&rsquo;s intention to work closely with interested non-governmental organisations on this subject.</p>

  <p>The Council endorsed conclusions on the application of Cross Compliance conditions in the reformed CAP. Member states agreed to review the working of these provisions in the light of further experience.</p>

  <p>Commissioner Fischer Boel informed the Council of her intention to prepare a paper reflecting on the possibilities for further simplification of the CAP; it would come to the Council towards the end of 2005.</p>

  <p>Under other business, Hungary, supported by several wine producing member states, expressed concern about the protection of geographical indications for wine in the EU/Australia wine agreement. Sweden sought views from the Commission on its plans for proposals to improve the welfare of farmed livestock. The Commission indicated that further work on pig welfare would be undertaken in 2005 and proposals on broiler and laying hen welfare were also likely.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally in the form requested. An estimate derived from information collected under NHS National Services Information and Statistics Division&rsquo;s Continuous Morbidity Recording system suggest that over the whole of Scotland in the 12 months ended in March 2004 approximately 213,500 people with asthma were seen by GPs, practice nurses, community nurses and health visitors. This figure is based on the activity of 59 Scottish general practices with a combined patient population of 375,539.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what legislation exists regarding the registration and monitoring of tattooing and body piercing establishments and whether such legislation covers all establishments which offer such services, including hairdressers, beauty therapy outlets and women&rsquo;s accessories stores; what qualifications must be held before a person can tattoo or pierce bodies; whether there is a standard qualification and, if so, which body awards it, and what organisation monitors and regulates establishments and individuals who offer tattooing and body piercing services.</p>

  <p>Tattooing, body piercing and other beauty treatments, invasive or non-invasive, are currently regulated by two main pieces of legislation, the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 and the Tattooing of Minors Act 1969. There is also some local legislation.</p>

  <p>Some local authorities in Scotland operate registration schemes whereby, once premises have been registered, they are routinely inspected by environmental health officers. However, this is not consistent across all local authorities and there are no defined standards.</p>

  <p>At present, there are no recognised qualifications for body piercers or tattooists. However, there are professional training courses for beauty therapy, hairdressing and acupuncture in existence, some of which are recognised by professional associations.</p>

  <p>In 2001, a consultation was undertaken to assess the need for further controls of skin and body piercing to reduce the risk of transmission of bloodborne and other infections. Following responses to that consultation plans are underway to bring into effect a Scotland-wide licensing regime monitored by local authority environmental health officers and supported by appropriate non-compliance penalties.</p>

  <p>The Executive made a commitment in our transport white paper, Scotland&rsquo;s Transport Future, to carry out a two-phase review of the tolled bridges in Scotland. Phase One of the review, which included an examination of the effect that various changes in tolls on the Erskine Bridge would have, is complete and available on the Executive&rsquo;s website at :</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library5/enterprise/tobr-00.asp" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library5/enterprise/tobr-00.asp</a>.</p>

  <p>Phase Two of the review is now underway. The terms of reference for Phase Two specifically include an assessment of the impact that any change in tolls on the Erskine Bridge would have on congestion and the local environment, in a way that achieves an optimum outcome without having a detrimental impact elsewhere in the local area.</p>

  <p>Estimates of the numbers and proportion of children living in low income households are available at Scotland level only, not by local authority or ward area.

This funding supports a range of anti-poverty initiatives, including measures to address child poverty.</p>

  <p>Glasgow has also received &pound;37.2 million funding through the Better Neighbourhood Services Fund over the period 2001-04 (2001-02 - &pound;6 million; 2002-03 - &pound;9 million; 2003-04 - &pound;12 million, and 2004-05 - &pound;10.2 million).

  <p>Infrastructure and the confidence and desire of people to engage are important elements of social capital.

  <p>Joined-up action on employment, education, health, community safety and other issues is required to address social exclusion within vulnerable communities.

  <p>The Scottish Executive measures (a) social exclusion through its Closing the Opportunity Gap targets. Further details of the targets and the indicators used can be found at:</p>

  <p><a href="www.scotland.gov.uk/closingtheopportunitygap/" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/closingtheopportunitygap/</a></p>

  <p>The Executive&rsquo;s guidance on Regeneration Outcome Agreements provides a menu of indicators which can be used in relation to (b) regeneration, depending on local circumstances and priorities. A copy of the guidance is available at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.communitiesscotland.gov.uk/upload/CRF-guidanceonROAsAugust2004.doc" target="_blank">http://www.communitiesscotland.gov.uk/upload/CRF-guidanceonROAsAugust2004.doc</a>.</p>

  <p>Scotland&rsquo;s three Pathfinder Urban Regeneration Companies are also developing appropriate indicators to assess their progress and learn lessons.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not have agreed indicators of (c) social capital. However, in the UK, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) leads a Social Capital Working Group whose remit it is to examine and develop a framework for the measurement and analysis of social capital, including agreeing a harmonised set of questions for use in government surveys.

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The redevelopment of the Granton waterfront is being led by Waterfront Edinburgh Limited. This is a Joint Venture Company created by the City of Edinburgh Council and Scottish Enterprise Edinburgh and Lothian. The Board of Waterfront Edinburgh Limited includes three elected members from the City of Edinburgh Council. This representation includes the elected members for Granton and the neighbouring Pilton ward, in addition to the elected member with executive responsibility for economic development and social inclusion.</p>

  <p>This is major industrial and brownfield redevelopment project which is expected to span over 12 to 15 years. The development plans for the area are based on a masterplan that was published in December 2000. The masterplan was developed in consultation with various stakeholders and community groups and included in excess of 15 separate workshops sessions.</p>

  <p>In addition to this, development in the area is subject to the usual planning requirements with regards to public consultation. The three major landowners that make up the waterfront site have all arranged public exhibitions of their proposals.</p>

  <p>It is recognised that a development of this scale and nature will have a significant impact, both on the communities immediately adjacent to the waterfront area, and also to the city and city region as a whole.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Communities Scotland monitors the effectiveness of community participation in different ways depending on circumstances. For example, Regeneration Outcome Agreements being prepared by Community Planning Partnerships will need to set out the nature and extent of community participation in key decisions. Also, Communities Scotland&rsquo;s regulation and inspection function looks at tenant participation as part of its inspection process. It is widely accepted that effective community engagement builds capacity and enriches the democratic process.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally. Average waiting times are not regarded as a particularly effective measure of the availability and efficiency of drugs services.</p>

  <p>The national framework collects information on the length of wait that clients experience from referral to assessment, <em>and</em> from an agreed care plan to one or more of four different types of intervention (i.e. preparatory and motivational intervention, prescribed drug treatment, community rehabilitation, and residential detoxification). The length of wait is collated in blocks of time i.e. the number of people who wait for less than one week, less than two weeks, and so forth.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are under a duty to provide primary medical services for the patients in their area and free to commission enhanced services, such as the treatment of patients suffering from drug misuse, from those providers which they consider most appropriate to meet local health needs. This means that an enhanced service for drug misusers could be provided by a GP practice or another NHS provider or even the board itself.</p>

  <p>A model specification for the delivery of a National Enhanced Service (NES) for patients suffering from drug misuse has been published. The specification sets out the service elements which the provider must already have in place, such as safe and secure premises, and details the elements which the commissioned provider must then deliver to its patients such as, developing and co-ordinating the care of drug users.</p>

  <p>The new General Medical Services contract comes with a patient services guarantee which ensures that patients continue to receive at least the level of services they received previously, although these may not necessarily be delivered in the same way.</p>

  <p>As set out in the National Strategy, <em>Tackling Drugs in Scotland: Action in Partnership</em> , it is for local drug action teams and constituent partners to plan and deliver the full range of drug treatment and care services in line with identified need and local priorities, and to spend available resources accordingly. Whilst it is not for the Executive to direct local plans, nor to make a judgement on whether or not there are &quot;sufficient&quot; crisis beds, or any other specific intervention in an area, a key element of the action plan published in the <em>Summary and Actions of the Drug Treatment and Rehabilitation Review is to widen and improve the range of interventions available locally, to improv</em> e outcomes for drug misusers. In support of this an additional &pound;6 million per annum has been identified to develop and enhance a full range of drug treatment and rehabilitation services from 2005-06 to 2007-08.</p>

  <p>Naloxone, primarily used as an antidote in opioid overdose rather than an alternative maintenance therapy, is currently only available to appropriate practitioners and paramedics. The Executive will follow the recommendations from the current consultation by the Medicine and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) on extending the use of Naloxone to include ambulance technicians.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&rsquo;s broadband strategy is facilitating the rollout and uptake of broadband technology across Scotland. Project ATLAS fits within this overall strategy but is led and funded by Scottish Enterprise. Issues about use of public funding and the benefits achieved are, in the first instance, operational matters for Scottish Enterprise.</p>

  <p>The Executive is aware of this important article which provides a combined analysis of the data from 13 case-control studies of residential radon and lung cancer in nine European countries. The results of this analysis confirm that radon gas is an important public health hazard, the second most important cause of lung cancer so far identified, after smoking and, in particular, estimates that radon in homes currently accounts for about 9% of deaths from lung cancer and hence 2% of all cancer deaths in Europe.</p>

  <p>The National Radiological Protection Board will consider the implications of this study on current guidelines for radon preventative and remedial measures and give advice if necessary. A sub-group of the board&rsquo;s independent advisory group on Ionising Radiation is currently conducting a review of the risks of radon exposure which will include this new study. The board will receive advice from this sub-group and will then consider, consult and issue advice on any changes that should be made to the UK scheme for controlling radon exposures.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Executive has commissioned the board to complete its survey of radon, in housing across Scotland, at a cost of &pound;303,000 and to update its advice on the radiological significance of levels of radon in Scotland accordingly. The survey findings will be available later in the year.</p>

  <p>Both the existing UK housing stock and new homes are considered in measures to control the radon risk to the population in areas where radon concentrations are likely to be high. The Building Regulations require that in certain parts of the country anti-radon preventative measures must be incorporated into new houses as they are being built. Public and private initiatives have involved testing almost half a million homes in the UK with a recommendation that remedial measures are undertaken if radon levels are found to be above the action level of 200 becquerels per cubic metre for radon in homes. Local authorities can assist with grant, owners who cannot afford to meet the cost of remedial works.</p>

  <p>The funding arrangements for voluntary hospices in Scotland are not the same as those in England. Voluntary hospices already receive an average of 36.7% of their funding from NHS boards and we expect this proportion to increase to 50% of agreed costs by the start of the 2006-07 financial year.</p>

  <p>These arrangements are set out in the Health Department letter: HDL(2003)18 available at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/sehd/mels/HDL2003_18.pdf" target="_blank">www.show.scot.nhs.uk/sehd/mels/HDL2003_18.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p>NHS boards also provide their own palliative care services alongside voluntary hospices, and meet the costs of these services entirely from within their allocated funding. Since 2002, NHS boards have invested &pound;2.4 million a year from the additional Cancer in Scotland investment to support and develop palliative care services and this benefits the services provided by both NHS boards and voluntary hospices.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The statistics dealing with recorded crime and court proceedings are not directly comparable as a person may be proceeded against for more than one crime involving more than one victim, and there is the possibility that the crime recorded by the police may be altered in the course of judicial proceedings. Also, a crime may be recorded by the police in one year and proceedings taken in a subsequent year.</p>

  <p>2. Figures for the total number of persons proceeded against may be underestimates due to time taken to record details of some court proceedings.</p>

  <p>3. Where these crimes were the main offence involved.</p>

  <p>We have no plans at present to establish a tribunal service for tribunals with a Scotland-only remit. However, we are in regular contact with the Department for Constitutional Affairs about the creation of the new Tribunals Service, which will include a number of reserved tribunals operating in Scotland, and we shall consider carefully whether there are any areas where our administrations can work together to provide improvements for tribunal users across Scotland.</p>

  <p>We have had various discussions with the Department of Constitutional Affairs (DCA) as policy has developed on the creation of the new Tribunals Service. The first phase of the service will incorporate the seven most used tribunals, which operate on a GB-wide basis.

  <p>This is a complex issue with set European legislative deadlines for registering and tagging calves. My aim is to find a pragmatic approach which does not jeopardise approval of our Cattle Tracing System or the credibility of our beef industry particularly in relation to export. Discussions are on-going with key interests to agree a sensible outcome as quickly as possible.</p>

  <p>The Executive has regular discussions with the UK Government on a wide range of issues. The requirements for 3G coverage were set in the conditions of the licences auctioned in April 2000 and now administered by the UK-wide regulator, OFCOM. Each 3G operator must be capable of offering a service to cover 80% of the UK population by the end of 2007. Provision beyond this figure is a commercial decision for operators.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what plans it has to provide recognition for rural general hospitals; how it will ensure that there are hospitals located outwith Scotland&rsquo;s cities that provide 24-hour acute services in the long term, and what measures it will take in respect of recruitment training practice to meet these objectives.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-01-25.S2W-13338.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80057" speakername="Mr Andy Kerr" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa0125.htm#21">

  <p>Hospitals in rural areas, including district general hospitals and community hospitals, make an important contribution to the well-being of populations in these areas. Maintaining high quality services in rural hospitals provides a number of challenges to NHS boards, who are responsible for planning sustainable services for the whole population of their area. Many boards are looking at strengthening linkages between rural hospitals and hospitals in larger population centres. The Executive has commissioned Professor David Kerr to undertake a review of NHS services, including how best to provide services in rural areas. The result of Professor Kerr&rsquo;s work is expected in late spring.</p>

  <p>Clearly the recruitment, retention and training of clinical staff is vital to the provision of safe and sustainable services. Several initiatives are under way. These include:</p>

  <p>the establishment of a chair of remote and rural medicine in Stornoway, jointly between Western Isles NHS Board and the University of the Highlands and Islands;</p>

  <p>fellowships in remote and rural general practice;</p>

  <p>an intercollegiate group of the Scottish Medical Royal Colleges is developing plans for specific training programmes in remote and rural medicine, and</p>

  <p>a short-life working group is currently assessing a range of retention initiatives aimed at all categories of staff.</p>

  <p>The Executive remains committed to building the capacity of the NHSScotland workforce and is pursuing several initiatives on behalf of the health service which will enable NHS boards to improve their ability to recruit and retain consultant staff for all specialities, including radiologists.

  <p>A Partnership Agreement commitment to increase the number of consultants within NHS Scotland;</p>

  <p>An action plan to take forward a range of options and measures to improve recruitment and retention in the short and medium term;</p>

  <p>An on-line recruitment website for NHSScotland, and</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive report <em>On the Borderline? People with Learning Disabilities and/or Autistic Spectrum Disorders in Secure, Forensic and other Specialist Settings (2004) </em> looked into the number of people with learning disabilities in prison or in secure accommodation and the arrangements for assessing and providing them with care. The two main aims of the research were to:</p>

  <p>Explore the number of people in secure settings in Scotland who are known to have a learning disability and/or ASD.</p>

  <p>Explore the means used to identify, assess their needs and provide services for people with a learning disability and/or ASD while in a secure setting.</p>

  <p>The findings show that, in practical terms, there is scope for raising awareness about people with learning disabilities and/or ASD across the different disciplines in non-health care settings.</p>

  <p>Subsequent action includes the Education Department seeking reports from Secure Units on how they intend to take forward the findings of the report and the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) taking steps to identify and address the needs of people with learning disabilities. The SPS will set up a Learning Disabilities Working Group to review its overall approach. Processes, are now in place for systematic assessment of offenders&rsquo; needs on reception into prison, which will assist in an overall screening process.</p>

  <p>The Executive supports a number of on-going railway projects north of the central belt, reflecting our commitment to improving the rail system across Scotland. These are at various stages of development and include:</p>

  <p>Commitments in First ScotRail&rsquo;s franchise to invest &pound;40 million for improvements for rail passengers across the whole of Scotland and throughout the seven year life of the franchise. Half of this amount will be spent on upgrading stations; &pound;2.4 million of which is for enhanced facilities at the four largest stations, including Aberdeen.</p>

  <p>Freight Facilities Grants to increase the capacity of the rail freight yard at Georgemas in Caithness and the building of a new rail freight facility at Dyce, enabling aviation fuel to be supplied to Aberdeen Airport by rail.</p>

  <p>The Stirling to Alloa to Kincardine (SAK) Railway Scheme will reintroduce passenger services between Stirling and Alloa and freight services to Kincardine Power Station. SAK has the added benefit of taking heavy freight away from the busy Glasgow-Edinburgh and Forth Bridge lines, allowing improved and more reliable passenger services within the central belt and into Fife and beyond.</p>

  <p>A number of additional projects awarded funding from the first four rounds of the Public Transport Fund are identified in the regional leaflets associated with the Scottish Executive transport delivery report, <em>Scotland's Transport: Delivering Improvements</em>, published in March 2002, available at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library3/transport/stdi-00.asp" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library3/transport/stdi-00.asp</a>. Those projects receiving awards under the fifth and final round of the Public Transport Fund were announced on 14 November 2002:</p>

  <p>http://www.scotland.gov.uk/pages/news/2002/11/SEET181.aspx.</p>

  <p>The relevant authorities in receipt of grant are responsible for delivery of these projects.</p>

  <p>Additionally, there are on-going feasibility studies into Aberdeen Crossrail, Laurencekirk Station and the Gauge Enhancement of lines in the north-east to permit passage of larger freight trains.</p>

  <p>The electricity consumed by the Scottish Executive is generated from 100% renewable sources. The Executive also has an overall energy target which states that it will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 7% from 2003-04 levels by 2011. There are no further targets specifically for renewable energy. There is a Partnership Agreement Commitment to work towards a target for 40% of Scottish electricity generation to be from renewable energy sources by 2020. The Executive have set the following target in respect of the overall Scottish position &ndash; 18% of all electricity generated in 2010 to be from renewable sources increasing to 40% in 2020.</p>

  <p>The Minister for Environment and Rural Development is leading our initiative to improve the environmental performance of public bodies. The first stage is to assess what environmental management systems are currently in place and providing assistance to Public Bodies and Agencies to ensure they have an environmental management system in place by 26 November 2005. Once the systems are in place, agencies and public bodies will be expected to report annually on their environmental management performance (which will include their targets) either in their annual reports or as a freestanding document and information on the use of renewables should be available in this data. This information will also be collated and published on the internet</p>

  <p>For the wider public sector, local authorities are subject to a general duty to contribute to sustainable development, including their use of energy, as part of the duty of best value.</p>

  <p>A specialist study into potential impacts on the pupils and residents at Camphill has been commissioned.

  <p>BEAR Scotland Ltd&rsquo;s performance on trunk road maintenance, which is monitored by the independent Performance Audit Group, has been generally satisfactory. Following an audit by the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency, it is understood that the Traffic Commissioner proposes to hold a Public Inquiry to hear evidence from Bear Scotland Ltd. In relation to drivers&rsquo; hours during bad winter weather. It is possible that any ruling from the Traffic Commissioner following the public inquiry could affect the current interpretations regarding drivers&rsquo; hours during winter maintenance operations and in these circumstances it would not be appropriate to comment further at this time.</p>

  <p>It is for the Highland Council to decide on the priorities for the provision of new schools in their area, within the resources available to them. These resources include the financial support we have offered the council for a schools PPP project with a capital value of around &pound;100 million; direct capital grant in the form of a Schools Fund allocation of &pound;4.332 million in 2005-06 rising to &pound;4.751 million by 2007-08, and the substantial resources which the Council can generate within the level they can afford, principally through borrowing, under the prudential framework.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to separate from the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s accounting system the full cost of the ministers&rsquo; travel costs from that of staff in their private offices. However, the information available is set out in the table below. Travel costs include air, rail, hired cars, taxi, miscellaneous travel, subsistence and motor mileage and bus tickets. Restructuring of departments in the Scottish Executive over the period affects some of the year on year comparisons.</p>

  <p>The Executive fully supports the development of the new sports centre for Grantown-on-Spey and is delighted that the project has been awarded funding of &pound;300,000 from <strong></strong> sportscotland&rsquo;s lottery-funded Building for Sport programme.</p>

  <p>Local authorities have a statutory responsibility to ensure adequate provision of sport and leisure facilities for their residents. As in the case of the sports centre in Grantown-on-Spey, funding may be available from <strong></strong>sportscotland through the Building for Sport programme. Applications are assessed by <strong></strong>sportscotland against set criteria for the programme and ministers have no role to play in considering individual applications.</p>

  <p>With regard to access for children to sports centres, many local authorities already have strategies in place to encourage increased access. However, this is an issue which has been identified as important in achieving targets 1 and 2 of Sport 21. The strategy to deliver these targets is seeking to create or amend existing discount schemes and also consider the provision of transport subsidies to ensure that potential barriers are removed which restricts access to sports facilities and participation in sports programmes.</p>

  <p>I am not aware of either any legal restrictions which prevent local authorities from establishing local authority-owned bus companies or any provisions which specifically empower a local transport authority to establish such a company. However, there are general powers on which transport authorities could seek to rely. Local authorities which are local transport authorities (i.e. local authorities outwith the area served by Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive (SPTE)) could rely on the power to enter into a contract at section 1 of the Local Government Contracts Act 1997. Similarly, the general power to enter into and carry out agreements at section 10(1)(xv) of the Transport Act 1968 would seem to allow for this situation in relation to SPT. In line with usual practice, it would be for any local transport authority, which wished to use these powers to set up a bus operating company, to take its own legal advice as necessary. Any transport authority which set up an operating company would of course also have to abide by the legislation in relation to subsidising socially necessary services.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it still considers that &quot;imposing a new layer of government between the local authorities and the Scottish Executive and Parliament would generate additional bureaucracy and involve significant disruption to local government&quot; in respect of transport policy, as stated in the policy memorandum prior to the Transport (Scotland) Act 2001.</p>

  <p>The assessment made by the Executive in 2000 that it would be best not to bring in new statutory regional transport bodies but to persist with a voluntary approach was the right one at the time and was based on a careful consideration of the views of local authorities and other interested parties. Even then, the prospect of returning with legislative proposals to create statutory bodies was highlighted in the policy memorandum, with particular focus, at that time, on the Highlands and Islands.</p>

  <p>Four years on, it has become increasingly clear that the voluntary partnerships can achieve more if they develop. The consultation undertaken in 2003 demonstrated clear support for the introduction of statutory bodies that would build on the progress made by the voluntary partnerships, and in west-central Scotland by Strathclyde Passenger Transport. The proposals for statutory regional transport partnerships currently being considered by Parliament as part of the Transport (Scotland) Bill have been broadly welcomed by most commentators.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has in recent years provided support for the administrative costs of the existing voluntary regional transport partnerships. In 2004-05, approximately &pound;1 million was provided to the partnerships for this purpose. The Executive intends to continue to provide similar levels of support to the statutory partnerships, once established.</p>

  <p>The Financial Memorandum contained within the Explanatory Notes to the Transport (Scotland) Bill (SP Bill 28) introduced to the Scottish Parliament on 27 October 2004 gives details of the sums to be made available for staffing and administration costs, members&rsquo; expenses and accommodation during the first year of operation. Following the outcome of the latest Spending Review, annual capital funding of &pound;35 million for regional transport partnerships will be available starting in 2006-07. How these funds will be disbursed between the partnerships has yet to be determined. This funding is additional to all on-going funding commitments to regional transport partnerships and to Strathclyde Passenger Transport.</p>

  <p>It is not possible for the Executive to estimate how much funding constituent local authorities will provide to the partnerships in future years, it is proposed that this will be a decision for each regional transport partnership to take.</p>

  <p>Data for 1999-2000 was not collected directly and has been calculated by multiplying the average amount of waste per household by the number of households in each authority. Consequently there may be inaccuracies in the 1999-2000 figures. The data supplied by Dumfries and Galloway for 2001-02 was unreliable. It has not been included in the all Scotland total for 2001-02.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has not carried out research specifically on mechanical and biological treatment technologies. However, the National Waste Plan 2003 recognises the role these technologies could play in delivering diversion from landfill. Information on these technologies, including case studies, can be found at <a href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/wtd" target="_blank">www.environment-agency.gov.uk/wtd</a> .</p>

  <p>Legislation to encourage manufacturers to reduce packaging already exists. Under the Packaging (Essential Requirements) Regulations 2003, anyone may complain to their local authority trading standards officer if they believe a product uses excessive packaging. The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 require businesses with a turnover of &pound;2 million and making or using over 50 tonnes of packaging a year to recycle or recover certain proportions of packaging waste. This acts as an incentive on them to minimise their packaging use.</p>

  <p>In addition, we support the Innovation Fund, run by the Waste and Resources Action Programme, to help retailers minimise waste from packaging and products.</p>
