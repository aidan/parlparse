  <p>The costings given in <em>A Partnership for a Better Scotland</em> &#8211; as is also the convention for all Executive financial publications &#8211; are given in cash terms: in other words, they are not index-linked unless specifically identified as such.</p>

  <p>In part this is because the UK Government uses cash numbers for setting the overall control total and in its publications. Having our published numbers on a consistent basis improves transparency. Since our budget is fixed in cash terms, index-linking particular items would also risk breaching the overall budget should inflation prove higher than forecast.</p>

  <p>There is no proposal for a ban on cod fishing. However, the Commission has presented a revised proposal for cod recovery that envisages reduced fishing activity.</p>

  <p>This more general question of cod recovery was discussed in general terms at the Council of Ministers on 22 July, and will now be discussed in detail in the Council working group, which reconvenes on 11 September.</p>

  <p>The Executive participates in these Council working groups, which afford on-going opportunities for informal discussion with officials from the Commission and other member states. In addition, we participate in more formal bilateral discussions with the Commission and other member states.</p>

  <p>Executive officials most recently participated in formal meetings with Commission officials on 24 June and 17 July.</p>

  <p>Assistance and encouragement for the establishment of owners&#8217; associations is the subject of recommendations by the Housing Improvement Task Force.</p>

  <p>The task force favours the establishment of owners&#8217; associations whether as a requirement for new developments of more than eight units, possibly by amendment to the draft Tenements (Scotland) Bill, or on a voluntary basis in other circumstances. It proposes that local authorities should actively promote the formation of associations particularly where they instigate action on repairs or maintenance. It recommends that local authorities should have power to provide modest grants to assist the establishment of associations. It also recommends that the Scottish Executive should seek to provide advice to developers on good practice and advice and information to owners on taking part in associations.</p>

  <p>We will consider all the recommendations of the Housing Improvement Task Force including those I have outlined.</p>

  <p>European law on public procurement prohibits discrimination between suppliers on grounds of nationality or locality. However, those involved in purchasing foodstuffs should always take full account of factors such as quality, freshness and, where relevant, sustainable development in their purchasing decisions. We are currently considering further options available to us which would help promote quality and healthy eating in food procurement.</p>

  <p>The procurement section of the <em>Scottish Public Finance Manual</em> emphasises that purchasing decisions should be based on value for money, not lowest price. The Executive has also published guidance for purchasers (<em>Public Procurement and Sustainable Development</em> available on the Executive&#8217;s procurement website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/procurement" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/procurement</a>) which emphasises the need to integrate relevant sustainable development factors in purchasing decisions.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has not made such an assessment. However, the Water Industry Commissioner provided an economic assessment for Scotland as a whole in the Strategic Charges Review, following which ministers set the revenue cap for Scottish Water and decided that charges should be harmonised across Scotland and reflect the costs of provision of water and sewerage services. Under the Water Industry (Scotland) Act 2002, it is then for Scottish Water and the Water Industry Commissioner to decide the level of individual charges for particular groups of customers within the framework set by ministers.</p>

  <p>The regulation of international trade is reserved and as such the Department of Trade and Industry take the lead on this matter. The Scottish Executive remains in close contact with Whitehall colleagues on matters of international trade, including WTO negotiations, and how they may impact on the Executive&#8217;s responsibilities.</p>
