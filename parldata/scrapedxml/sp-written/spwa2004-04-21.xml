From 1 May, agricultural employers will be able to recruit workers from the accession countries either directly or through SAWS operators.</p>

  <p>The recent decision by Bayer CropScience to withdraw their application to add Chardon LL maize to the national seed list reduces the likelihood that GM crops would be grown in Scotland in the foreseeable future. Notwithstanding, the Executive intends to consult on co-existence measures later this year, in order to ensure that such measures are in place before any possible planting of GM crops in Scotland. The detailed terms of such a consultation have still to be determined, but it will include consultation on the desirability of a separate threshold for organic crops and separation distances between GM and non-GM crops.</p>

  <p>The draft EU Directive on Environmental Liability establishes liability for environmental damage to protected species and habitats resulting from a range of activities, including the release of GM organisms. It does not cover damage to private property or any economic loss, for example losses arising from GM contamination of non-GM crops. It is this issue which the Executive will seek to address in its consultation on co-existence.</p>

  <p>A total of &pound;22 million for the period 2003-4 to 2005-6 has been made available to local authorities in respect of access related activity. Over the same period, the two national park authorities are spending &pound;0.7 million on the development and the provision of access and Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) is spending over &pound;28 million to promote and facilitate access. A proportion of this SNH spend is in the form of grants to local authorities to assist them in preparing for their new functions under the legislation.</p>

  <p>We are continuing to work with SNH and local authorities to estimate the costs of implementing the new arrangements for access. Some of these costs will arise soon after the legislation comes into effect, which we plan should be in the autumn of this year. However, the costs associated with core paths provision are likely to be later because it is expected that it will be some years before most local authorities are in a position to adopt their core paths plans.</p>

  <p>We are currently considering SNH and local authority funding requirements for the period 2005-06 to 2007-08, and an announcement on this will be made in the autumn.</p>

  <p>We are still considering, with interested parties, how to use the new beef national envelope provided for in the recent Common Agricultural Policy reform agreement. The legislation relating to this new envelope provides for payments to be granted for specific types of farming which are important for the protection or enhancement of the environment, or for improving the quality and marketing of agricultural products.</p>

  <p>Under the current subsidy arrangements there is an existing beef national envelope which is used to support suckler cow production in Scotland. Payments are made by way of an additional headage payment on animals eligible for the Suckler Cow Premium.</p>

  <p>The funding provided is set out in the following table by financial year. The Executive's support for Caledonia Youth is in the context of an integrated project to provide start-up costs for the establishment of four new centres, and to contribute to the running costs of these centres and the existing centre in Edinburgh. Centres in Glasgow and Dundee have been opened. The centre in Falkirk, which will soon have its formal opening, and the proposed centre in Aberdeen have formed part of the project from the outset.</p>
