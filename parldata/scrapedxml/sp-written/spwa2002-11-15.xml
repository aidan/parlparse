  <p>At present, with the exception of decisions relating to de-crofting and re-letting, the Crofters (Scotland) Act 1993 provides that all decisions by the Crofters Commission, including decisions regarding procedures to be adopted in handling individual cases, are final. There is no formal route of appeal other than to challenge such decisions by seeking judicial review or, if it is believed that there has been maladministration, by recourse to the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman.</p>

  <p>This is why we proposed a new coherent and consistent system of appeals against all Crofters Commission regulatory decisions in the consultation document <i>Crofting Reform Proposals for Legislation</i>, published in July of this year.</p>

  <p>Policy in respect of apportionment applications is a matter for the Crofters Commission. The policy of the Crofters Commission is that there will be a presumption against approval of apportionments where the Grazings Committee has entered into a management scheme which provides financial or other benefits for the township and where apportionment may prejudice that scheme. The Executive&#8217;s policy was to accept all eligible applications to join an Environmentally Sensitive Area (ESA) scheme until the schemes closed to new applicants in [December 2000. The ESA scheme conditions are binding on all crofters in the common grazings.</p>

  <p>Much of the work contained in the recently published Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department/Industry/Science Partnership Report was designed to assess the impact of the technical measures agreed upon under the cod recovery plan; other assessments have been conducted by the Fisheries Research Services Marine Laboratory.

  <p>The Chief Scientist Office (CSO), within the Scottish Executive Health Department has responsibility for encouraging and supporting research into health and health care needs in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The CSO is not aware of any recent research having been carried out on links between HIV/AIDS and exposure to radioactivity. From peer-reviewed internationally published literature, research carried out in the 1990s suggests that exposure to radiation can weaken the immune system and make the body more susceptible to infection including HIV/AIDS.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mr Bob Millar, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Communities Scotland&#8217;s housing investment programme has increased access to social housing for local people in urban and rural areas by providing new or improved housing, to meet the needs of those on low incomes seeking to rent social housing and through providing housing to replace or improve non-effective or poor quality housing thus improving the quality of life of the residents.</p>

  <p>As a result, Communities Scotland expenditure on social rented housing in Urban and Rural Areas (1999-2000 to 2001-02) has been as follows:</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, with regard to its news release SE4054/2001 of 27 September 2001, what progress has been made with its mortgage to rent scheme in respect of the conditions and general workings of the scheme; how much of the available budget has been spent to date, and how many householders have taken part, or are likely to take part, in the scheme in each year for which funding has been allocated.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mr Bob Millar, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Ministerial approval will be sought shortly to the proposed Mortgage to Rent scheme with a view to the scheme being operational early in 2003. The scheme has been developed by the National Co-ordinator, appointed in April 2002, in conjunction with a working group comprising relevant lending, housing and consumer advice interests. Expenditure to date has been restricted to administrative costs (&#163;26,500). It is expected that the scheme will be able to support up to 150 households each year.</p>

  <p>There has been one such report in the year 2001-02. The charge of a contravention of section 7(1)(a) of the Criminal Law (Consolidation) Scotland Act 1995 was one of four charges in a case reported to the Procurator Fiscal at Edinburgh. The case was disposed of by way of an indictment in terms of section 76 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995, which is an accelerated mechanism in solemn procedure for disposing of case where a plea has been agreed; the indictment is served on a shorter notice period and contains only the charges to which it has been agreed guilty pleas will be tendered and accepted. The section 76 indictment in this case did not include the section 7(1)(a) charge. A sentence of six months imprisonment was imposed.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is approaching this in a number of ways. The Scottish Schools Standard Public Private Partnerships Contract was recently issued to all local authorities. The Scottish Executive, through Partnerships UK, are carrying out reviews of schools Public Private Partnership projects at key stages to ensure the robustness of projects as they go through the procurement phase. In addition, we are ensuring the procuring body is an informed client through a programme of training and support. These measures are aimed at streamlining the procurement process.</p>

  <p>The National Debate on Education website was launched on 20 March 2002. Since then, there have been approximately 21,000 hits to the homepages for the Discussion and Reflection stages of the Debate.</p>

  <p>No pre-launch projections were made, but the performance of the website will form part of a wider evaluation of the Know the Score Drugs Communications Strategy, which will commence early next year. The website was established as part of the Communications Strategy in response to independent research, commissioned by the Executive, which showed that there was a desire from the public for access to factual information on drugs, and the risks associated with their use.</p>

  <p>The number of hits on the site since its introduction in May 2002 is 199,970. However, given the opinion of the National Audit Office, in their report on government websites, that hits is not a reliable way to measure activity, we monitor the site using figures relating to page impressions. Page impressions measure the number of actual pages a user views on the site.</p>

  <p>Since its introduction and to the end of October 2002, there have been 122,615 page impressions viewed on the M74 Completion website &#8211; monthly figures are shown in the following table. We had no projections of how many page impressions the site would attract as there were no precedents to benchmark against.</p>

  <p>The website is managed by Scottish Property Network (SPN) who regularly analyse site activity using the proprietary WEBTRENDS software.</p>

  <p>The total and monthly number of hits on the Scottish Executive public sector property website are shown in the following table.

  <p>There were no pre-launch projections of numbers of hits. The success criterion for the site is an assessment at the end of the three-year pilot period through consulting the major public sector participants on how useful a marketing tool it is to them.</p>

  <p>In the majority of situations, the Central Registered Body Scotland does not make a charge to organisations in relation to attending introductory seminars on the administration of criminal records checks, nor for advice in processing applications.</p>

  <p>However, in those circumstances where expenditure is incurred in travel, or where sessions have been held at the specific request of groups to meet their particular location, needs and requirements, expenses have been sought.</p>

  <p>The fees for these events are based on the nature of the training, location, numbers and whether external specialists require to be brought in to deal with specific matters.</p>
