  <p>The Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005 already sets mandatory conditions for licensed premises in relation to pricing of alcohol and irresponsible drinks promotions. It also gives the Scottish ministers powers to add such further conditions as they consider necessary or expedient for the purposes of any of the licensing objectives set out in the act. Use of these powers will of course be subject to parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

  <p>There are no plans for a specific body to keep a central record of the number of teachers seeking to enhance their continuing professional development by focusing on dyslexia.</p>

  <p>However, the General Teaching Council for Scotland maintains a record of those teachers who have gained recognition in the area of professional interest &ndash; dyslexia.</p>

  <p>The decision was based on the recommendations of a detailed review of the service which was completed in May 2006. The review involved consultations with the parents of children with cleft lip and palate, in particular the Cleft Lip and Palate Association, looking at issues such as patient choice, the importance of distance to families, and the elements of the service which parents considered necessary and desirable.</p>

  <p>Staff involved in the provision of all cleft lip and palate services were also consulted, through the mechanism of cleftsis, the national managed clinical network for cleft lip and palate services. In particular, there were separate consultations with the multi-disciplinary teams at each of the three sites where the highly specialised surgery was undertaken, and with each of the surgeons providing the service.</p>

  <p>It is recognised that out-of-hours services in remote and rural areas face a number of unique challenges.</p>

  <p>An out-of-hours strategy group - made up of representatives from NHS boards, NHS QIS, NES, and NHS 24 - is developing a strategy for future sustainable models of out-of-hours care. A key component of this strategy will reflect the needs of rural areas, addressing the requirement to redesign services to reflect a multi-disciplinary approach with extended role development for nursing staff and other health care professionals. The strategy will also look to promote existing good practice in rural locations, models that are both sustainable and cost effective in the long-term, but continue to set high standards of patient care.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Legal Aid Board will be seeking information from all firms registered to provide legal assistance throughout November 2007. The information collected will be used to support both the board&rsquo;s telephone helpline service and its interactive online solicitor finder tool.</p>

  <p>The board operates a national telephone helpline (0845 122 8686) that allows members of the public to find out more about legal aid, including whether they qualify and where to find a legal aid solicitor. The helpline is open seven days a week 7am to 11pm. Potential applicants can also use the board&rsquo;s online interactive solicitor finder tool to search for a solicitor by postcode and geographical area. Currently the information supporting both services is limited to the contact details of the solicitor firm and whether they are registered to provide criminal and/or civil legal assistance.</p>

  <p>The survey results will enable the board to provide potential legal aid applicants with more detailed information such as the types of cases which firms handle under legal aid and their future intentions of providing legally aided advice, as well as ensuring that contact details are up to date. The new information has been designed to help members of the public make a quicker and more informed choice about where they might access legal aid services.</p>

  <p>The board expects that the enhanced information will be available to potential applicants in early January 2008.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2007-10-30.39.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80341" speakername="Kenny MacAskill" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-07/wa1030.htm#15">

  <p>Solicitors in private practice are free to choose whether or not to provide a legal aid service and, if so, to what extent. Solicitors cannot be compelled to provide particular services in particular places for particular clients. It is, therefore, possible that some clients may experience difficulty in finding a solicitor able and willing to take on their case, particularly where there are few solicitors providing a civil legal aid service in general.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Legal Aid Board is currently finalising a review of civil legal aid fees, requested by the government, and the outcome of this work will shortly be available for ministers&rsquo; consideration. The board is also taking a number of steps to simplify the administration of the civil legal assistance system (further details of these steps are provided in the answer to question S3W-3938 on 14 September 2007). Both of these strands of work are designed to encourage solicitors to continue to provide civil legal assistance.</p>

  <p>If evidence emerges of difficulties being faced by potential clients in particular areas of the country or in particular areas of law, the board will report this to the Scottish Government with recommendations on how best to address the matter, including, where appropriate, further use of employed solicitors. In response to such evidence, ministers recently authorised the board to employ two solicitors to provide a casework service across the Highlands and Islands for clients who are unable to find a solicitor in private practice. The board is currently recruiting and the service will be operational early in the New Year. The service will be based in Inverness and cover a wide geographic area that has been highlighted as being at risk of under supply.</p>

  <p>NHS Glasgow and Clyde have, following extensive consultation, developed a strategy for the future delivery of health care services for the area covered by that board. This service strategy involves the replacement of a number of existing facilities which are not considered appropriate for the delivery of health care services in the 21st Century and the Victoria Hospital falls into that category.</p>

  <p>Not only are models of care vastly different to those practised when the Victoria Hospital was built but the use of modern materials and methods of construction result in buildings which frequently differ in appearance to those being replaced. Indeed we should expect and welcome change to the physical appearance of healthcare buildings as we place increasing emphasis on environments which are supportive of the recovery process and of the staff who work in our hospitals.</p>

  <p>The building currently under construction to replace the Victoria Hospital will be very different in appearance but what is critical is that it delivers the appropriate range of healthcare facilities in an appropriate environment. I am confident that the new building will deliver these clinical services from a building which has been designed to the highest standards.</p>

  <p>The NHS in Scotland is working to ensure delivery of a number of national waiting times targets for the benefit of patients. These national targets are published on the <em>Acute Hospital Care</em> website, which is operated by NHS National Services Scotland&rsquo;s Information Services Division. The website can be accessed at: <a href="http://www.isdscotland.org/waiting_times" target="_blank">www.isdscotland.org/waiting_times</a> .</p>

  <p>The website is updated regularly and statistics on performance against all the national waiting times targets are shown on the website, with the exception of the target that every patient should have access to a GP, nurse or other health care professional within 48 hours. For the years 2005-06 and 2006-07, NHS boards reported that some 99% of practices demonstrated compliance with requirements for this target, compared with 97% in 2004-05.</p>

  <p>We are supporting NHS boards as they work towards abolishing availability status codes and introducing new arrangements for measuring waiting times, so that all patients waiting for a first out-patient appointment with a consultant or for hospital inpatient or day case treatment come within the scope of national targets from the beginning of next year.</p>

  <p>Consideration is currently being given to ways in which waiting times targets can be turned into legally binding waiting times guarantees and so make them more meaningful to patients. We will consult widely on this in due course.</p>

  <p>Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) Guideline 71 on osteoporosis sets out the evidence for the optimal management of those with osteoporosis. We expect NHS boards to implement that, and other relevant guidelines, locally.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Enhanced Services programme for primary and community care circular (PCA (M) (2007)10) has a service specification for falls and bone health. NHS boards can elect to choose this area and there are additional resources to implement the activities. We have also encouraged boards to think about an initiative dealing with early intervention.</p>

  <p>We have drawn boards&rsquo; attention to the findings of an NHS Quality Improvement Scotland audit (2005) showing the benefits in preventing future osteoporotic fractures of direct access to DEXA scanning by patients who have sustained a fracture. We also continue to encourage NHS boards to provide DEXA scanners, in line with SIGN Guideline 71. There is also a national DEXA scanning facility at the Golden Jubilee hospital.</p>

  <p>In February 2007 we issued HDL(2007)13, which indicates that every NHS board should have a falls and fracture prevention strategy, with each CHP appointing a falls prevention and management lead to work alongside the rehabilitation co-ordinator which each board is expected to appoint to take forward the national rehabilitation strategy.</p>

  <p>NHS Quality Improvement Scotland will consider the multiple technology appraisal by the National Institute for health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) of drugs for the primary prevention of osteoporosis in post-menopausal women. NHS boards are expected to take account of NICE appraisals in their planning, funding and provision of services, to ensure that recommended drugs or treatments are made available to meet clinical need.</p>

  <p>We are aware of concerns about the need for younger (i.e. under 70) women to have access to treatment when their risk of fracture is equal to, or greater than, that of women aged over 70. The information to NHS boards from SIGN Guideline 71 is to target osteoporosis assessment at those with the highest risk, to ensure the most efficient use of resources. The need for younger women to be assessed when they have low bone mineral density is recognised by the National Institute for health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) report. When the final report is released, NHS Quality Improvement Scotland will give advice to NHSScotland on the recommendations from NICE on primary prevention of osteoporotic fragility.</p>

  <p>I fully recognise the constructive role that voluntary organisations can play in tackling sectarianism and religious intolerance in Scotland, and am aware that there are already many voluntary groups making a positive contribution to this agenda. That is why I intend to convene a meeting with voluntary sector representatives, including Nil by Mouth, to discuss how we can build on what has already been achieved to rid Scotland of religious bigotry and discrimination.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body does not have a specific annual budget for the acquisition of art. Where the SPCB might decide to purchase art, we would look to resource this through capital contingency, prioritising against other demands. The expenditure on the acquisition of art, which included the establishment of an art collection for the Parliament, since 2002 is as follows:</p>

  <p>Since 2005-6, the SPCB has identified a budget to manage the care of the art collection and it is used to resource areas of work such as conservation, loans, framing, display, labelling, installation and art handling services. The expenditure on this is as follows:</p>
