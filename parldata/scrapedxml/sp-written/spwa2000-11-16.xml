  <p>The recommendation of the Health and Safety Commission, based on current medical advice, is not to remove asbestos that is in good condition. Slightly worn material should be sealed or enclosed intact. Only badly worn, damaged or very fibrous materials are recommended for removal. In such instances, the Health &amp; Safety Executive enforces the regulatory controls on the process and publishes a wide range of guidance for clients, contractors and operatives.</p>

  <p>The Chancellor&#8217;s cash freeze on all road fuel and oil duties and a carefully targeted package of measures for road transport equivalents worth a 4p real terms cut in duty for motorists and 8p for hauliers will help all road users in Scotland and especially those in rural areas where car usage is essential.</p>

  <p>In addition, all 840,000 pensioners in Scotland will benefit from an above inflation increase in the basic state pension. In addition, increases in the Minimum Income Guarantee will tackle pensioner poverty. Wider measures will promote social inclusion through fiscal measures to regenerate Scotland&#8217;s urban areas, increasing employment opportunities, supporting families and tackling child poverty. A major new VAT package will ease the burden on many of Scotland&#8217;s 230,000 small to medium-sized enterprises.</p>

  <p>We provided an overview of our empowering communities agenda in the <i>Social Justice Action Note</i> published in June (copies available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre, Bib no. 6978). We are further developing this agenda through practical action to support those from Social Inclusion Partnerships and Working for Communities Pathfinders involved in regenerating disadvantaged areas. This will include: work to achieve greater clarity and awareness of roles and responsibilities of those within the partnerships; ensuring adequate support to enable those from the community to be equal partners; ensuring training opportunities, such as our national skills programme Working Together Learning Together, are explored and prioritised, and facilitating the sharing of good practice, for example through promoting networking arrangements.</p>

  <p>Looking beyond these practical actions to support those working in our communities, we intend to explore much wider-ranging opportunities that will enable local people to directly influence decisions which affect their neighbourhoods.</p>
