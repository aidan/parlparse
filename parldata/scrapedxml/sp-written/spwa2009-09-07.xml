  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Where main offence.</p>

  <p>2. Covers crime categories sale of drink to person under 18 and wholesaler selling liquor to person under 18, although no crimes of the latter have been recorded in the years reported.</p>

  <p>Please note that prosecution is not the sole course taken in dealing with these offences. Where persons under 18 possess alcohol in a public place, the police have powers under section 61 of the Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Act 1997 to confiscate this alcohol and dispose of it. If the alcohol is surrendered to the police, it is not an offence and so is not included in the recorded crime statistics. It is, however, an offence to fail to comply, for example by failing to surrender the alcohol or by failing to give name and address if requested. During the years reported, for the Lothians region, there were no recorded instances of persons under 18 failing to comply with such a request.</p>

  <p>With regard to this answer, and the answer to question S3W-26513 on 7 September 2009, it should be noted that statistics dealing with court proceedings and recorded crime are not directly comparable as a person may be proceeded against for more than one crime involving more than one victim and there is the possibility that the crime recorded by the police may be altered in the course of judicial proceedings. Also a crime may be recorded by the police in one year and court proceedings concluded in a subsequent year.</p>

  <p>The programme&rsquo;s age range was reviewed by the National Advisory Group on Breast and Cervical Screening in 2005. The group&rsquo;s advice at that time was to maintain the current age range and frequency but to review again in 2010, when any new published evidence will be taken into account.</p>

  <p>PACE support to assist employees made redundant from the TSC contact centre in Greenock is delivered by services accommodated via mainstream resources and therefore no additional financial support is required. PACE activity has been supported by an additional &pound;7 million nationally which I announced on 25 January this year.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what its response is to concerns expressed by residents and businesses in the Orkney Islands and other islands in the Highlands and Islands that are currently not participating in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Road Equivalent Tariff ferry pilot, that their exclusion from the pilot is unfair and places them at a competitive disadvantage, particularly in respect of attracting tourists.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government understands the concerns about high ferry fares in Scotland. That is why we are undertaking a study and a pilot exercise into Road Equivalent Tariff (RET) as the basis for future ferry fares in Scotland. The Scottish Government are focussing the RET pilot on the ferry routes to the Western Isles. Pilots are selective by nature and consequently cannot include all areas. Only a real world pilot will tell us how island residents, tourists, businesses, the freight industry and local economies will react to a significant reduction in ferry fares.</p>

  <p>The consultants undertaking the study are closely monitoring the Road Equivalent Tariff pilot to capture all the information we need to take decisions on future fares levels across the entire Scottish ferries network. That assessment is comprehensive and considers usage and revenue impacts as well as economic and social impacts. The monitoring and evaluation includes Orkney and Shetland and other areas not included in the pilot.</p>

  <p>The target grant per unit (for a three person house) for a Registered Social Landlord in 2009-10 is &pound;74,000. The final grant rate in a year is dependent on the actual costs and grant rates of all of projects approved in the year. We do not estimate an overall average cost for Registered Social Landlords for the current financial year, but details of actual unit costs in 2008-09 can be found in our outturn report published on 6 August, available at:</p>

  <p>The maximum subsidy for the programme to incentivise council house building was set at &pound;25,000 per unit. The average grant allocated per unit in 2009-10 for council house building from the first tranche of funds, is &pound;19,000. Councils will be asked to supply construction cost data as projects start on site, allowing the council data to form part of the outturn report for 2009-10.</p>

  <p>No. Scottish Prison Service guidance from 2005 provides that in cases where compassionate release is being considered a medical opinion stipulating as clearly as possible the current level of incapacity and likely life expectancy should be obtained. In most cases applications are made very close to the point of the offender&rsquo;s death and at a time when they are in hospital under the care of a specialist consultant operating in the area of disease from which they are suffering. Specialist consultants are best placed to give a medical opinion on prognosis. It is often the case that the person is not in receipt of palliative care.</p>

  <p>The majority of local authorities have already extended their free school fruit scheme beyond P1 and P2 pupils and we are currently exploring the possibility of securing funding for 2010-11 from the EU under the &quot;EU school fruit scheme&quot; to extend provision of free school fruit to further year groups.</p>

  <p>In addition, in June 2008 we published <em>Healthy Eating Active Living &ndash; An action plan to improve diet, increase physical activity and tackle obesity. </em>This included a commitment to broaden out the pledge to provide free fruit to pregnant women and pre-school children using the model of market-led pregnancy cards from the major supermarkets, to encompass maternal and infant nutrition generally and not limited to specific models.</p>

  <p>In September 2008, we also announced support of &pound;19 million available to NHS health boards over the period 2008-11 to improve the nutrition of women of childbearing age, pregnant women and children under five in disadvantaged areas. The broad criteria within which NHS boards have been asked to work include increasing uptake of the Healthy Start scheme, to ensure that everyone who is eligible to claim vouchers to exchange for fresh fruit, vegetables, milk and infant formula does so; supporting work on increasing breastfeeding rates, and investing in training for health professionals. Years 1 and 2 of that funding have already been allocated to NHS boards. Details of the allocation were outlined in CEL 36(2008) Nutrition of women of childbearing age, pregnant women and children under five in disadvantaged areas which can be found at:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has produced a leaflet <em>Your Guide to Free NHS Eye Examinations in Scotland </em> in association with Health Rights Information Scotland for issue to vulnerable groups in the community. Supplies of the leaflet were sent to Community Health Partnerships for distribution of the leaflets locally to raise awareness of the NHS eye examination with such vulnerable groups, as well as to GP and optical practices.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government also produces leaflet HCS2 <em>A Quick Guide to Help with Health Costs</em> which contains information on charges for prescriptions, eye examinations, dental treatment, wigs and fabric supports and the value of the vouchers available for glasses and contact lenses. The leaflet is available from GP Surgeries, Community Pharmacies, Dental Practices, Job Centre Plus offices and Citizens Advice offices. It is available online at<a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/healthcosts" target="_blank"> www.scotland.gov.uk/healthcosts</a>. The HCS1 <em>Are you Entitled to Help with Health Costs</em> is also available on line, providing more detailed information on NHS charges in Scotland. And since the introduction of the NHS eye examination, leaflets and posters issued by NHS Scotland Counter Fraud Services have publicised the eye examination.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has also agreed with Optometry Scotland, the professional representative body for optometrists in Scotland, that they will undertake road shows around Scotland to inform optometrists of forthcoming changes to primary and supplementary eye examinations under NHS general ophthalmic services. Associated publicity material will also be provided to the profession to explain the changes which are proposed to take place in early 2010.</p>

  <p>The recent figures released on 28 July 2009 showed that the number of NHS eye examinations has increased by 6.2% from 1.63 million for the year ending 31 March 2008 to 1.73 million for the year ending 31 March 2009 which demonstrates that people in Scotland are clearly recognising the benefits of having an eye examination.</p>
