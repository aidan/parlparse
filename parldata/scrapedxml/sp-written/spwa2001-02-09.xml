  <p>A Command Paper was laid at the Westminster Parliament today setting out the Government&#8217;s interim response to the BSE Inquiry Report. The interim response considers the inquiry&#8217;s findings and conclusions along with the major themes which emerge from these such as openness, the handling of risk and uncertainty, the use of scientific advice in policymaking, the structure of Government and the legislative framework. It details the action which Government has already taken to address these issues as well as the challenges which must continue to be addressed.</p>

  <p>Many of these issues are of common interest across the UK. The Scottish Executive has been fully consulted as this response has been developed. I welcome its publication and the consultation process which will now commence. I encourage all consultees in Scotland to contribute their views on both the position UK-wide and the particular Scottish aspects which arise, to ensure that the final report is comprehensive in UK terms while also providing input on how further progress may be achieved in Scotland.</p>

  <p>I understand that the Registrar General is today issuing a policy statement on marriages at Gretna in the light of recent concerns. His statement outlines the legal background to the solemnisation of marriages in Scotland, summarises recent marriage trends at Gretna and sets out the main considerations taken into account by the Registrar General in carrying out his responsibilities under the Marriage (Scotland) Act 1977. The Registrar General hopes that his statement will be a useful source of guidance to religious bodies, who also have responsibilities under the Act. Copies of the statement have been placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>I am launching today a consultation paper that deals with the technical and operational aspects of the Landfill Directive and I am placing a copy in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre. Large landfill sites (sites receiving more than 10 tonnes in any day or having a total capacity exceeding 25,000 tonnes) already come within the scope of the Pollution Prevention and Control (PPC) Regulations, and legislation is now required to implement the Landfill Directive at all landfill sites. The Executive therefore proposes that all landfills be regulated by the PPC regime. The Landfill Directive requires the ending of co-disposal of different classes of waste at the same landfill site and bans the disposal of tyres, corrosive and liquid wastes at landfill sites. These requirements will have a major impact on both the waste management industry and waste producers. It is therefore important to consult on the proposed implementation strategy as widely as possible and I am particularly keen to hear from those who believe they will be effected by these changes. The responses of the consultation will help to inform the drafting of amendments to the PPC Regulations. A further consultation on a draft of the proposed amendments will be held later in the year.</p>

  <p>The binding Decision 98/3 agreed by Contracting Parties at the First Ministerial meeting of the OSPAR Commission in July 1998 was reached prior to devolution. Scottish Office Ministers were consulted about, and agreed to, the UK policy position adopted for the meeting.</p>

  <p>This Decision constitutes an international obligation of the United Kingdom and, as such, is reserved to the UK Government under Schedule 5 of the Scotland Act 1998. There are no plans to make representations about a review of the Decision. The Decision, however, includes a provision for a review by the OSPAR Commission at its meeting in 2003.

  <p>The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) has lead responsibility for arranging UK participation at meetings of OSPAR (the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic). There were 80 meetings in the period 1 January 1997 to 31 December 2000, of which two were ministerial meetings. In addition, there were a number of regional meetings, workshops and inter-sessional working groups. Generally the Scottish Executive is well represented at meetings with either participation within the UK delegation or at the briefing meetings convened in advance by the DETR. The Scottish Executive comments on meeting papers and contributes to the development of a common UK line before OSPAR meetings.</p>

  <p>During the period in question the Scottish Executive was represented at 28 meetings either as members of the UK delegation or, in some instances, as Chair or Head of Delegation.</p>

  <p>Environmental monitoring of depleted uranium (DU) is undertaken by the Defence Evaluation Research Agency (DERA) Radiation Protection Services. The programme includes analysis of marine environmental samples collected in the Solway Firth area, and the reports are publicly available.</p>

  <p>In relation to the food chain we are advised by the Food Standards Agency and have been informed that, to date, they have had no indication that there are detrimental effects on the food chain. Should monitoring raise concerns, the agency would investigate the situation urgently.</p>

  <p>I announced on 18 December that the pay recommendations of the DDRB were being accepted in full and without staging. The DDRB recommended an overall pay increase of 3.9% for salaried doctors and dentists and general medical and dental practitioners.</p>

  <p>To encourage the retention of general medical practitioners, the DDRB has also recommended a 7% increase in seniority allowances, worth in the region of &#163;500 for a GMP with 25 years service. This is in addition to the 3.9% increase in intended average net remuneration.</p>

  <p>The supplementary report from the DDRB which is being published today covers areas of GPs income aimed at meeting the expense of running their practices and any balancing recovery from debts owed by the profession. In its considerations of what provision to make for indirectly reimbursed practice expenses and the operation of the balancing correction the review body have recommended:</p>

  <p>provision for indirect expenses of &#163;23,790 for each GP;</p>

  <p>a recovery of &#163;248 per GP in accordance with normal rules, and</p>

  <p>a joint review by the BMA and Health Departments of the operation of the pay system This should look at handling the cumulative overpayment that has occurred in the system (&#163;2,684 per GP), the operation of the balancing mechanism and forecasting of expenses in time for next year&#8217;s round.</p>

  <p>We have accepted DDRB&#8217;s recommendation on the level of practice expenses.</p>

  <p>We share DDRB&#8217;s concerns about the operation of the balancing mechanism, the setting of practice expenses and the management of the cumulative debt. We have agreed that the BMA and the Health Departments should put work in hand immediately to develop a review of these issues. That being the case, the balancing mechanism will be suspended pending the outcome of the review.</p>

  <p>The average GP will benefit by a further &#163;248 above what the DDRB have recommended. In addition, in conjunction with the other Health Departments, we will consider constructively how to manage the cumulative debt of the profession (around &#163;100 million) for the benefit of patients and the development of practices.</p>

  <p>The Gross Income of GPs will therefore increase to &#163;80,300 per year, as shown in the following table, with effect from 1 April 2001:</p>

  <p>We are determined to help the textile sector in its transition from volume manufacturing to higher added-value markets. Since the Scottish Textile Forum was established on 6 June last year, nearly &#163;3 million of public support has been provided to the textile sector in Scotland. The Scottish Executive and its agencies have over this period provided: over &#163;2 million towards retraining of those made redundant by textile companies; &#163;300,000 in Regional Selective Assistance to textile companies; &#163;10,000 to support companies attending London Fashion Week; &#163;449,000 over two years for the cashmere club; &#163;20,000 support for in-store promotion; &#163;20,000 for the development of a website for the Scottish textile industry; &#163;15,000 to support companies attending industry trend presentations, and &#163;20,000 support for the development of a national textile action plan. The DTI has also provided &#163;70,000 under their Engineering Technicians programme to raise skill levels in the Borders and are currently considering support for various other projects from Scottish companies. The &#163;3 million figure does not include a &#163;1.2 million DTI Faraday award for the UK-wide Technitex project led by Heriot-Watt University in Galashiels.</p>
