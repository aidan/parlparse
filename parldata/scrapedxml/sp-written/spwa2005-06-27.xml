  <p>Alcohol and Drugs Action Teams were required to draw up, publish by April 2003 and subsequently implement a local three year alcohol action plan based on an assessment of local needs and resources.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive provided individual feedback on each of these plans which were subsequently published on the alcohol information website.</p>

  <p>As a result, the Scottish Executive made available specific funding of &pound;8 million over two years. We indicated that we would expect priority to be given to filling identified service gaps in the current funding round, using the Alcohol Problems and Support and Treatment Services Framework as a guide.</p>

  <p>Under Joint Future, local authorities and health boards are expected to at least align their resources for particular services and to decide together on their use. The precise use of these resources, however, is for local determination</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive strongly encourages NHS boards and local authorities to work closely together to plan and address the health and social care needs of their local population, including the needs of individuals with alcohol dependency problems. The emphasis on joint planning and joint working is reflected in local Joint Health Improvement Plans as part of overall community planning. The focus on multi-agency partnership working has also been reinforced recently through the development of Community Health Partnerships across Scotland which are intended to bring together the key providers of services (health, local authorities, voluntary sector) and the public to plan and design services that address local need. However, decisions on how resources are deployed to address local need is a matter for NHS boards and their partners.</p>

  <p>Ensuring that everyone has the chance to learn regardless of their background or current personal circumstances is one of the five people-centred goals of our lifelong learning strategy. The Executive provides guidance to the Scottish Further Education Funding Council on the strategic priorities for the further education (FE) sector. This guidance covers support for students with additional support needs, including those with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD).</p>

  <p>Our recent publication, Partnership Matters, sets out the statutory responsibilities of further education colleges, local authorities and NHS boards on the provision of support to students with additional support needs generally. This publication can be found at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/01/20504/49607" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/01/20504/49607</a>.</p>

  <p>Sections 12 and 13 of the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004, which will commence on 14 November, places duties on education authorities to ensure early planning, information sharing and preparation for the transition to post-school life for young people with additional support needs, including those with ASD. Further information on preparing for adulthood is contained in the draft code of practice which will accompany the act. The draft code can be found at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk</a>. The final version will be published in late August and will be distributed to all local authorities and those with responsibilities under the act.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive recognises the importance of dictionaries for the language and culture of Scotland and commends the valuable work that has been done over the years. Scottish Executive funding for Gaelic and Scots lexicographical projects is provided through the Scottish Arts Council and B&ograve;rd na G&agrave;idhlig, with additional support from the Heritage Lottery Fund, the Leverhulme Trust and other sources. The level of support for such projects is a matter for the bodies concerned.</p>

  <p>Experts worldwide differ in their opinion on whether Mycobacterium Avium subspecies Paratuberculosis (Map) causes Crohn&rsquo;s disease. The Department of Health&rsquo;s Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens has on two occasions (1992 and 1998) concluded that a link could not be established on current evidence. A similar view was reached by the EU Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare who recommended increased and urgent research activity to resolve the issue. The Food Standards Agency and the UK Health Departments have kept and continue to keep this matter under close review with their expert committees, but the evidence on cause and effect remains inconclusive.</p>

  <p>A link between Mycobacterium Avium subspecies Paratuberculosis (Map) and human illness has not been established on the basis of current evidence.</p>

  <p>Food Standards Agency officials are not aware of any developments to suggest its advice on the drinking of milk needs updating at this time. That advice remains that there is no need for anyone to change dietary habits.</p>

  <p>A study of Map in water distribution systems and consumers&rsquo; premises completed by the Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS) now part of the Health Protection Agency (HPA) in August 2003 did not detect the presence of Map. This strengthens the view that drinking water is unlikely to be a source of exposure.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are establishing Community Health Partnerships as committees or sub committees of NHS boards with devolved responsibility for a range of functions and services as outlined in their scheme of establishment.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive provides NHS boards with a unified budget. It does not allocate budgets directly to Community Health Partnerships. It is the responsibility of each NHS board to allocate budgets and resources to fit local circumstances and to deliver the Local Health Plan. This includes assigning budgets to secondary and primary health care.</p>

  <p>The Kerr Report reaffirmed the role of Community Health Partnerships as vehicles for integration of services at a local level. NHS boards will be asked to consider removing any budget barriers to developing integrated care solutions and to consider innovative ways of using resources to enable the shift in the balance of care into community based services.</p>

  <p>Yes, all existing stoma patients will be able to choose their appliance supplier route, provided their appliance continues to be clinically appropriate, meets the laid down service standards and the supplier wishes to enter and accept the terms of the supply contract.</p>

  <p>The Executive will ensure that this is the case through directions and comprehensive guidance to the service providers.</p>

  <p>Perhaps I could usefully add that the new arrangements are being designed to ensure that current availability of services will be maintained and duly enhanced. This means that there will be no reduction in the range of appliances available to patients and, importantly, that new patients will not be disadvantaged by comparison to the current arrangements. It also means that the existing suppliers of appliance will continue to have the opportunity to enter into arrangements to provide appliance services that meet nationally agreed NHS standards, on which discussions with key stakeholders are currently taking place.</p>

  <p>Finally, I can advise that it is the Executive&rsquo;s intention that the new arrangements will be subject to review after their first year of operation.</p>

  <p>We have no difficulty in reconciling the answers given to S2W-16495, S2W-16933 and S2W-16934. While legislation in the general area of criminal law and procedure is devolved under the Scotland Act 1998, the subject matter of the current draft Framework Decision on data retention falls within the reserved area of telecommunications and wireless telegraphy under schedule 5 to that act. The extent to which changes to criminal procedure are required will be considered in detail when implementing the Framework Decision, as will the reserved/devolved divide in relation to those changes. In view of section 29(3) of the Scotland Act, the creation of procedural rules specific to the Framework Decision &ndash; if any are required - may be reserved. However, general rules of criminal procedure are devolved.</p>

  <p>1. Figures prior to 2002-03 exclude home care.</p>

  <p>2. North Lanarkshire - high increase in 2003-04 due to change in the councils&rsquo; treatment of supporting people income and expenditure.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-06-27.28.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80109" speakername="Tavish Scott" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa0627.htm#13">

  <p>The Scottish Executive has published an up-to-date list of departments and agencies being considered for relocation, on its website at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/Public-bodies/Relocation/Introduction" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/Public-bodies/Relocation/Introduction</a> .</p>

  <p>Full information can be found there on the following significant developments.</p>

  <p>Of the departments and agencies under consideration, we expect to be able to announce decisions in the next few weeks on Registers of Scotland, <strong></strong>sportscotland and the NHS special health boards &ndash; Education Scotland, Health Scotland and Quality Improvement Scotland.</p>

  <p>Other departments and agencies under consideration for relocation include the Scottish Further and Higher Education Funding Council. With a lease break in 2009, a decision on location will be announced in 2007-08. Consideration of the location of the Scottish Arts Council was deferred until the outcome of the cultural review, and there may also be other relocation candidates from that sector announced following the outcome of the Culture Commission&rsquo;s review.</p>

  <p>Other organisations under consideration for relocation will be the Scottish Court Services HQ, in advance of a lease break in 2009, and the Scottish Legal Services Ombudsman before a 2008 lease break. We have already announced the future relocation of the Transport Agency, which will locate 200 posts in Glasgow. To add to that, earlier this month, the Minister for Communities also announced that Communities Scotland is to relocate 100 to 110 HQ posts from Edinburgh to Glasgow.</p>

  <p>Under the Small Units Initiative strand of the policy, which aims to bring the benefit of government jobs to fragile, rural communities, we have announced five relocations in the last year. They were the Transcription Units within the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service to Dingwall and Tain; the Central Enquiry Unit to Kinlochleven; the NHS Central Registrar to Dumfries and Crofting House Grants Scheme to Tiree. There will now be more relocations of Small Units, including the Convenor of Water Customer Consultation Panels, and another Transcription Unit within the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has also published lists on its website of locations to which these departments and agencies could relocate. The lists have been developed in partnership with local authorities and local enterprise companies. This will allow relocations to be targeted at areas of most need, and make a strategic link between Relocation Policy and a range of publicly-funded initiatives already in place locally.</p>

  <p>The following tables show the number of care homes and the number of registered care home places for March 2000 to March 2004.</p>

  <p>The most recent three year comparison available is between March 2001 and March 2004. During this period the number of registered places has fallen by 1,246 across all client groups and by 308 in care homes for older people.</p>

  <p>The change in the number of care home places during this period is due to a combination of care home closures, the opening of new care homes, increases in the capacity of some care homes and reductions in the capacity of others.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not provide capital funding direct to either state or independent special schools. Capital funding is provided to local authorities, but they themselves decide on the details of their expenditure programmes.</p>

  <p>The sexual health strategy is based upon responses received to a wide ranging and inclusive consultation process. The implementation of that strategy will be guided by the National Sexual Health Advisory Committee, chaired by myself. The membership of this committee is drawn from key stakeholders including health and local authority interests, voluntary organisations and faith groups.</p>

  <p>NHS boards have been asked to submit detailed clinical plans and inter-agency strategies to support the delivery of the Sexual Health Strategy by end September 2005.

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-06-27.36.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80057" speakername="Mr Andy Kerr" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa0627.htm#23B241.htm">

  <p><a name="23B241.htm" id="23B241.htm"></a> The Executive has agreed additional funding of &pound;15 million over the next three financial years to help with the implementation of the strategy. Most of the first year&rsquo;s funding of &pound;5 million, some &pound;4.5 million, has already been made available to NHS boards and is directed towards improving frontline clinical services and in particular, reducing waiting times and improving service access and availability.</p>

  <p>This is new money which is in addition to the resources already being spent by NHS boards and other agencies taking forward sexual health initiatives on behalf of the Executive and in 2005-06 is approximately &pound;10.5 million. Over &pound;500,000 of these funds has gone to voluntary organisations.</p>

  <p>I have also asked NHS boards, in collaboration with other local stakeholders such as local authorities and voluntary sector partners, to provide local interagency sexual health strategies that reflect the underpinning principles and general themes of <em>Respect and Responsibility</em>. The voluntary sector is also well represented on the National Sexual Health Advisory Committee, which will advise the delivery of the national strategy.<a name="hit0" id="hit0"></a></p>
