  <p>We expect all local authorities to have in place plans for the implementation of Curriculum for Excellence (CfE), but information on local funding to support these is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>Despite current financial constraints, the Scottish Government is providing significant funding to local government - &pound;35 billion over the period 2008-11. Under the terms of the Concordat, all education authorities have flexibility to allocate available resources in response to local needs and priorities, including implementation of CfE.</p>

  <p>We are providing direct support to local authorities for CfE through the 10 point plan, including targeted support for those schools who need it, practical materials to provide clarity on what is expected, and &pound;3 million to help support the implementation of quality assurance and moderation of assessment.</p>

  <p>However, as part of the annual pupil census the Scottish Government collects information on the reasons for the provision of additional support. This can be found at:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government presently does not consider that there is a conservation case for full protection of brown hares. However, the option remains available in the future, to add the brown hare to the species protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act by secondary legislation at any time, and following consultation with Scottish Natural Heritage. Mountain hares already receive a degree of protection through The Conservation (Natural Habitats, &amp;c.) Regulations 1994 which prohibits certain methods of killing or taking this species, including any means which is indiscriminate and capable of causing the local disappearance of, or serious disturbance to, a population of them.</p>

  <p>The Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) consulted a wide range of interest groups before making their recommendations. These can be found listed in documents on the JNCC website at <a href="http://www.jncc.gov.uk/page-4292" target="_blank"> http://www.jncc.gov.uk/page-4292</a> . Section 22 of the 1981 Act requires the Scottish Government to consult Scottish Natural Heritage, and any other body it deems necessary before bringing forward proposals for changes to the schedules of the 1981 Act. The Scottish Government will shortly be issuing a consultation document which will be available on the Scottish Government website.</p>
