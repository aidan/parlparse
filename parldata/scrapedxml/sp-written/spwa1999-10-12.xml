  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive why it did not make an earlier statement on issues relating to the lifting of the beef on the bone ban given that the Chief Medical Officer for England issued his latest advice on this matter seven weeks ago, and whether it will take steps to expedite the completion of the Wellcome Trust Centre study in order that further consideration may be given to lifting the ban prior to the main autumn beef cattle sales in October and November.</p>

  <p>All four CMOs have been in discussion on this matter since July. The CMOs met as recently as 8 September to review the current position in an effort to reach common medical advice. This did not prove possible so each CMO then issued individual advice to their respective Ministers.</p>

  <p>The CMO England&#8217;s advice was referred to on Monday 20 September in a statement made by Mr Nick Brown, UK Minister for Agriculture, about aid for farmers. The full advice was published on the MAFF website 22 September 1999; the CMO Scotland&#8217;s advice was published on the Scottish Executive website the same day. Professor Carter has been keeping this matter under regular review and the published advice reflects his most up to date assessment.</p>

  <p>Scientists at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Epidemiology of Infectious Disease in Oxford have been asked to provide further analysis of the BSE epidemic in cattle for consideration by the CMOs. They are aiming to complete their analysis as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, with reference to the Chief Medical Officer for Scotland&#8217;s recommendation that the beef on the bone ban should be &lsquo;subject to review on receipt of the definite estimates from the Oxford Group and to re-appraisal in January 2000 if the ban has not been lifted by that time&#8217;, whether it will explain the difference in meaning between &lsquo;review&#8217; and &lsquo;re-appraisal.</p>

  <p>The Chief Medical Officer keeps under review all relevant developments concerning BSE and vCJD epidemics and pays particular heed to information relating to the bone-in-beef ban. The production by the Oxford Group of their risk estimates concerning maternal transmission, due now in November, would prompt a review of all the factors relating to these Regulations, and consideration of the validity of interim advice which is updated on these occasions. If no change appears appropriate at that time, the CMO proposed that a further exercise would take place in January 2000 to examine all the information then available. The terms "review" and "reappraisal" are interchangeable and in this particular context the CMO referred to the exercise in January 2000 as a reappraisal.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it accepts the Chief Medical Officer for England&#8217;s view that the additional health risk created by lifting the beef on the ban would be tiny and unquantifiable.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive intends to lift the controls on beef on the bone as soon as medical advice justifies such action.</p>

  <p>At present there is a difference of professional view between the Chief Medical Officer for England and the CMOs for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on the evidence available. All the CMOs agree that the ban should not be lifted on manufactured beef products. The Scottish CMO, in common with his professional colleagues in Wales and Northern Ireland, however, remains concerned that there is insufficient evidence available to underpin a recommendation to lift the ban now on visible cuts of meat. The Scottish CMO does not consider that there is enough scientific certainty to depart from the current precautionary stance and recommends that the ban stays in place. The Scottish Executive has accepted his advice.</p>

  <p>We will, however, continue to keep the position under review and as indicated, the ban will be lifted as soon as the medical advice indicates that it is safe to do so.</p>

  <p>Information regarding payment of financial assistance to companies, whether inward investment or indigenous, is commercially confidential. Unisys is eligible for support on exactly the same basis as any other commercial venture bringing investment and jobs to an Assisted Area.</p>

  <p>All offers of regional selective assistance (RSA) contain specific provisions relating to the clawback of grant, should there be a breach of the grant agreement by the grantee. Once an RSA application has been approved, grant is always paid retrospectively and only when set conditions have been met. If these conditions are not met, then no grant is payable.</p>

  <p>This is an operational matter for Scottish Enterprise.

  <p>The Scottish Executive welcomed the plans for new Assisted Areas in Scotland put to the European Commission on 15 July by the UK Government. We recognise that a number of areas not covered by the map have made representations to the Scotland Office concerning the needs of their areas and understand that these points are currently being considered by the UK Government.</p>

  <p>The Objective 2 proposals are complementary to those on Assisted Areas and are based on similar, but not identical criteria. In line with the focus of the Objective 2 proposals on areas of need, Bonnybridge featured in the recommendations put forward by the Scottish Executive and is included in the UK Government&#8217;s Objective 2 proposals. The list of proposed areas has now been submitted by the Government to the European Commission.</p>

  <p>As with any other form of development, mobile phone transmitter masts require planning permission from the planning authority, unless they qualify for permitted development rights under the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Scotland) Order 1992. Class 67 of the Order sets out the permitted development rights for telecommunications code system operators, and includes, among other things, the erection of masts. Not all mobile phone masts benefit from permitted development rights. For example, permitted development rights do not apply in the case of ground based masts over 15 metres in height. Such masts would require planning permission from the planning authority.</p>

  <p>Telecommunications code system operators are granted Telecommunications Code powers (contained in Schedule 2 to the Telecommunications Act 1984 (&quot;the Code&quot;) in their Telecommunications Act licences. In respect of land, the Code requires operators to obtain the agreement of the occupier of the land to install apparatus or execute works on it. If such an agreement is not made, operators may ask the Court to allow them to dispense with consent to access particular land and to set out the consideration to be paid for such access.</p>

  <p>* Schemes 5 to 8 are currently awaiting funding opportunities to allow them to be progressed.</p>

  <p>In addition to the above a package of improvement measures aimed at improving road safety and the level of service was identified under the RAP. To date some &pound;1.5 million has been spent with further works due to be implemented when trunk road funds permit.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it intends to seek information from Her Majesty&#8217;s Government on any derogations from the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive (91/271/EEC) which were sought for areas of high natural dispersion and, if so, whether it will make this information available.</p>

  <p>I understand that Her Majesty&#8217;s Government submitted an application to the European Commission for a derogation under the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive for the discharge from Aberdeen in February 1998. The UK withdrew the application after discussions with the European Commission and other Member States who indicated that they would not support such a proposal.</p>

  <p>Ireland also sought derogation for more time to implement treatment for two of their discharges although these applications did not relate to areas of high natural dispersion. It also withdrew its proposal following similar discussions.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Office published a map showing high natural dispersion areas around Scotland in October 1998 and I have arranged for a copy to be placed in the Scottish Parliamentary Information Centre. There are no derogations from the requirement for secondary treatment in place for the UK at present. I understand the European Commission has published a map of the European Union showing high natural dispersion areas. There are no derogations shown.</p>

  <p>We are currently considering a range of measures designed to improve environmental water quality standards. We will consult widely on proposals once our considerations are complete.</p>

  <p>A full consultation is planned for spring 2000 on draft drinking water quality regulations. New regulations transposing the latest EU Drinking Water Directive into Scottish Legislation are required by December 2000.<br /></p>
