  <p>The duty under the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004 does not give local authorities new functions. Instead it requires them to review the way they carry out their existing functions, to maximise the benefits for biodiversity. Many public bodies, including most local authorities, are already actively engaged with biodiversity, and COSLA agreed during the passage of the act that for local authorities the implications of implementing the duty should be broadly cost neutral and should not require significant new resources. Most local authorities already receive funding from Scottish Natural Heritage to support local biodiversity officer posts, and a number of local authorities have also been awarded grants under the new Biodiversity Action Grants Scheme, which we launched recently to support positive action for biodiversity.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to provide a break down of disruptions to criminal networks by police board or police force areas as many networks, by their very nature, tend to operate on a national or international basis.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Drug Enforcement Agency (SDEA) publishes Scotland-wide figures in its annual reports. Since its launch in 2000, operations involving the SDEA and the Scottish police service have led to the disruption of the following numbers of criminal networks.</p>

  <p>In financial year 2004-05, the Lothian and Scottish Borders Consortium has been allocated grant of &pound;173,141 for its Domestic Violence Probation Project (DVPP). This funding is provided through Section 27 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968. Indicative funding has been provided on a three year basis. As part of the strategic planning process, the consortium has submitted its plan to the Executive for the period beginning April 2005. The target is to inform the consortium and all other groupings/unitary authorities of funding for 2005-06 by end January 2005. Funding decisions in respect of such programmes as DVPP will be determined on the evidence of effectiveness and value for money within the level of available national resources.</p>

  <p>A report of an evaluation, sponsored by the Scottish Office and the Home Office, was published in 1996. The report was positive, concluding that the project was considered to be more successful than other forms of court disposal in reducing the frequency of violence. Since then, the consortium has continued to monitor and evaluate the project, primarily through consultation with the partners of the men on the programme.</p>

  <p>There have been 58 new referrals in 2001-02; 61 in 2002-03, and 61 in 2003-04, rising to 77, 79 and 67 men if those already on the programme are included. In the period from April to August 2004, there were 24 new orders, reflecting a greater proportion of men assessed as suitable, as a result of the increased use of risk assessment and risk management procedures.</p>

  <p>The notional working capacity has recently been increased to 50 men and their partners at any one point in time. The project is currently working with 60 men following imposition of a quota last July when the number of men receiving a service was 63. The project is currently carrying one vacant post which it expects to fill next month.</p>

  <p>The consortium has submitted a bid to the Executive to increase the capacity of the scheme to approximately 70. This bid will be considered alongside bids from other groupings/unitary authorities as part of the overall funding proposals for 2005-06.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Executive is supporting the DVPP which is working in partnership with the SACRO Falkirk Domestic Violence Project and the CHANGE project to develop a domestic violence programme that will be submitted in 2005-06 for accreditation.</p>

  <p>Re-indexing GDP performance to the year 2001 is an integral part of the chain-linking methodology whereby industry weights are updated on an annual basis.</p>

  <p>Chain-linking methodology is recommended by Eurostat as the preferred methodology for calculation of GDP volume indices and, on this basis, it is used by Scotland and the UK. Re-weighting the index each year improves the accuracy of the GDP estimates for both Scotland and the UK, and therefore improves the comparability between the two series.</p>

  <p>Comparisons with other parts of the UK are not possible as quarterly GDP is not produced for any other region of the UK.</p>

  <p>The use of index numbers is an appropriate method where the subject being reported on is a complex grouping of a range of different types of activity. The indexing method used in the reporting of GDP was developed to be consistent with the UK methodology. The GDP index is constructed from component proxy indices weighted together by their relative value added size. Producing the results in indexed form is considered the most appropriate way of presenting the results.</p>

  <p>Other Government statistics are based on very different types of data sources, some administrative, some census and some sample based. In each case, the most appropriate methodology is used for timeseries reporting purposes. Where these are National Statistics, as with the GDP, these methodologies are consulted on regularly, and any opportunities for improvement in terms of data sources, or methodological advances, are explored and exploited.</p>

  <p>According to the Scottish House Condition Survey 1996, 738,000 households lived in fuel poverty which made up approximately 35% of the total housing stock. The Scottish House Condition Survey 2002 showed that 286,000 households lived in fuel poverty, approximately 13% of the total housing stock. The Scottish House Condition Survey is the only source we have for reliably measuring fuel poverty.</p>

  <p>The impact of particular price rises will depend on the number of customers affected by the price rise, the energy efficiency of their properties and their household income. The interplay of these factors makes it impossible for us to assess the impact of each price rise in isolation. The Fuel Poverty in Scotland Report for the Scottish House Condition Survey estimated that an across the board rise of 5% would increase the number of fuel poor households by 30,000, assuming that incomes and household energy efficiency remained static.</p>

  <p>We have committed to eradicate fuel poverty in Scotland as far as reasonably practicable by 2016. Increases in energy prices will make it more difficult to achieve the target. The impact of particular price rises will depend on the number of customers affected by the price rise, the energy efficiency of their properties and their household income. The interplay of these factors makes it impossible for us to assess the impact of each price rise in isolation.

  <p>We continue to work to increase the chances of survival for heart attack patients by recognising that care for patients with life threatening conditions does not need to begin in a hospital setting, but can begin where the attack takes place. For many such patients, that care will be provided by paramedic staff from the Scottish Ambulance Service as soon as an ambulance arrives. Paramedics are trained and equipped to use defibrillators and administer &quot;clot busting&quot; drugs to patients at the scene, significantly increasing the probability of survival.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has invested an extra &pound;16.5 million in the ambulance service over the past two years, enabling it to deploy 240 more paramedics across Scotland, and make further progress towards its target of reaching 75% of Category A (life threatening) calls within eight minutes by 2008.</p>

  <p>Consequently, the issue of distance from and therefore time to reach hospital accident and emergency units is no longer the most important consideration in treating patients who suffer heart attacks.</p>

  <p>There is currently no national screening programme for the detection of foot problems or abnormal gait in children. The most recent Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health review of childhood screening and surveillance activity found little evidence to support a formal screening programme for defective or abnormal gait. However, a check of the hips is part of the general physical examination of all children within the first 24 hours of birth and at six to eight weeks. Health professionals will also explore any cause for concern in the course of their regular contact with children and their families. Information about local practice is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>There is no single measure that captures the &quot;drop-out rate&quot;. The Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) has published a range of indicators relating to student retention within the higher education system, since 1996-97. The table below reports data on the performance indicator &quot;Non-continuation following year of entry&quot;, published annually by HESA (formerly published by the Higher Education Funding Council for England). It shows the percentages of entrants to full-time degree courses who are no longer in higher education in the year following their entry into higher education. However, this indicator does not give information on the relatively small percentages of students who leave higher education in the years after their first year.</p>

  <p>Also, some of the individuals who leave in the first year will return to higher education after a year out and HESA publishes an indicator containing those data (in Table 4 of their performance indicator data). Further information on this and other higher education performance indicators can be obtained via the following link <a href="http://www.hesa.ac.uk/pi/" target="_blank">http://www.hesa.ac.uk/pi/</a>.</p>

WHO has approved the use of more detailed optional codes to identify antibiotic resistance. These new codes will be introduced from January 2006 and will be used by GROS.</p>

  <p>The Executive considered as part of its Affordable Housing review whether there was a case for any specific housing support for defined key workers. It was considered better to think in terms of house prices, the levels of incomes necessary to purchase a house and the difficulties experienced by households on low or moderate income wanting to buy a home.</p>

  <p>The Executive is providing assistance to workers to gain access to housing through a number of areas, including:</p>

  <p>expansion of the Low Cost Home Ownership programme, operated by Communities Scotland, which provides funding for developments in disadvantaged communities to replace or improve poor quality housing and also in areas where demand exceeds supply or where market prices are beyond the reach of local or average incomes;</p>

  <p>development of a range of new flexible grant mechanisms, based on the concept of shared equity, particularly aimed at increasing availability of affordable housing;</p>

  <p>discretion for landlords to offer priority to housing allocation to incoming workers essential to an area, subject to the requirements in the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001;</p>

  <p>participation in the development of a UK-wide mobility scheme, based on existing housing mobility schemes, which has the added benefit of offering employment as well as housing opportunities for people who wish to move around the UK, and</p>

  <p>encouraging local authorities and Registered Social Landlords to develop Common Housing Registers within each local authority area across Scotland. Common Housing Registers will provide a single route of access to social rented housing within a local authority area.</p>

  <p>The feeding of patients is an operational issue for local NHS health boards. In general domestic assistants are not involved in the feeding of patients.</p>

  <p>However, training for domestic staff and other ancillary staff includes the principles of safe food hygiene and some NHS boards have trained domestic assistants to become ward hostesses. This role is intended to provide a supporting role, working with trained nurses and health care support workers to meet the nutritional needs of patients. Common elements of this role are the distribution and collection of menus and meal trays to patients.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has funded the development and delivery of an open learning programme on nutrition for 11,000 healthcare clinical support staff in NHSScotland. This covers understanding basic nutrition, factors affecting food choice, common health problems in elderly people and their impact on nutritional needs, understanding basic nutrition, and what can be done to optimise nutritional care. NHS boards are rolling this programme out to all health care clinical support staff that assist patients to eat and drink.</p>

  <p>Any doctor wishing to work in the UK must be registered with the General Medical Council (GMC). The arrangements for obtaining registration with the GMC differ for European Economic Area (EEA) and non-EEA doctors. By virtue of mutual recognition arrangements contained in EC law, EEA nationals with EEA medical qualifications do not need to undergo any exam in order to register with the GMC and take up medical practice in the UK. Doctors from outside the EEA who wish to register must, among other things, provide the GMC with objective evidence of their capability for practice and evidence of their proficiency in English.</p>

  <p>There are several different types of evidence of capability for practice that the GMC will accept. However, the majority of non-EEA medical graduates are required to pass the GMC&rsquo;s own Professional and Linguistics Assessment Board (PLAB) test. This is a test of professional knowledge and skills designed to test the ability of international doctors to work safely in a first appointment in the UK as a senior house officer in the NHS.</p>

  <p>All non-EEA doctors are also required to satisfy the GMC of their proficiency in English by achieving a satisfactory score in the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) exam. This exam is not administered by the GMC but by the British Council on behalf of Cambridge English for speakers of Other Languages. EC law precludes the language testing by the GMC of doctors from the EEA.</p>

  <p>The requirements for registration including entry to general and specialist practice are determined by the GMC, The Specialist Training Authority (STA) and the Joint Committee on Postgraduate Training for General Practice (JCPTGP). The latter two are to be replaced by the new Postgraduate Medical Education and Training Board. The requirements for the PLAB test are set by the GMC. The PLAB test is governed by a board and panels whose role includes recommending changes to the examination. In addition to this, there was a major external review of the test in 1999. Another review has just been completed and a report will be issued to the council on 30 November 2004. Although the GMC has no input into the design or running of the IELTS exam, the GMC does determine the level of achievement in the test that doctors must reach before they are eligible for registration.</p>

  <p>The emphasis is on ensuring that overseas doctors have the required information before they leave their home country and indeed to undertake any assessment there, where possible. Both the British Council and the General Medical Council (GMC), often supplemented by the Royal Colleges, provide extensive information on what may be required and continue to do so once the doctor comes to the UK. It is emphasised that satisfying registration and examination requirements will not entitle the doctor to employment in the NHS in either a training grade or a career grade. Appointments are made in open competition.</p>

  <p>Information on the number of overseas people completing exams to obtain the required medical qualifications to practice in Scotland is not held centrally by the Scottish Executive. The website for the GMC provides statistical information on the numbers of doctors registered with them. The number of non-UK doctors who first obtained registration with the GMC is provided in Table 1. As part of the registration arrangements, all overseas doctors must undertake a Professional and Linguistic Assessment Board (PLAB) test with the GMC, unless they meet clear criteria for exemption. The number of PLAB test places for the last five years is provided in Table 2. The Specialist Training Authority confirm the total number of CCSTs awarded together with the number of overseas doctors being added to the Specialist Register and who have not completed training in the UK, as provided in Table 3.</p>

  <p>The Executive must authorise any proposed use of availability status code 9 on a waiting list. In the last year, authorisation has been given once, in response to a request from NHS Greater Glasgow following a major accident at a warehouse in the city in May 2004.</p>

  <p>Thirty-three patients had their planned in-patient/day case treatment, mainly in orthopaedics and plastic surgery, postponed and availability status code 9 applied. NHS Greater Glasgow report that all 33 patients have since been admitted for treatment.</p>

  <p>The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Scotland) Order 1992 (the GPDO), grants a general planning permission (or permitted development right) for a variety of developments. These developments are either minor or uncontentious in nature or are required in relation to existing land uses and would be likely to be granted planning permission.</p>

  <p>Schedule 1 to the GPDO sets out the 72 different classes of permitted development rights and individual restrictions and conditions on those rights.</p>

  <p>Permitted development rights may be restricted in individual cases and a planning application required as a result. For example, most conservation areas, designated under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) (Scotland) Act 1997, are subject to directions under the GPDO which specify restrictions on classes of permitted development rights particular to the individual conservation area. The Conservation (Natural Habitat, &amp;c.) Regulations 1994 contain restrictions on permitted development rights within designated Natura Sites where a development would adversely affect the integrity of the site. Also, where a project required environmental impact assessment under the planning provisions of the Environmental Impact Assessment (Scotland) Regulations 1999, then the permitted development rights would not apply and a planning application would be required.</p>

  <p>As an executive Non-Departmental Public Body, it is for Scottish Enterprise to determine how it conducts its pay negotiations with the unions. I understand that there is still scope for negotiation on several aspects of the pay award and I have encouraged all parties to continue discussion with a view to achieving a satisfactory outcome.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is currently a public member of Network Rail. Members have a duty to act in the best interests of Network Rail and perform a corporate governance role. This includes reviewing the performance of Network Rail against its commercial and other targets, as well as against railway industry benchmarks for the provision, maintenance and management of the railway infrastructure.</p>

  <p>As a member, the Executive does not make strategic decisions on behalf of the company but collectively members can hold the board to account for its management of Network Rail.</p>

  <p>In light of the conclusions of the UK Government review of rail, Scottish ministers will in future have an extended role with regard to rail infrastructure in Scotland. The Executive&rsquo;s role as a public member is not anticipated to change.</p>

  <p>Only hydro schemes with a declared net capacity of up to 20 MW in size are eligible for support under the Renewables Obligations. A number of hydro schemes were down-rated in order to be eligible for such assistance; the decision to do so was a matter for the generators concerned.

  <p>Direct Payments Scotland is a time limited project that was extended to ensure that maximum support could be offered to certain disabled groups who were originally eligible for direct payments. The Executive also funds the Scottish Personal Assistants Employers Network (SPAEN) to assist those who wish to employ their own workers through a direct payment. The intention now is to make direct payments available to all community care groups and support will be offered to the relevant organisations to make this possible e.g. to older peoples&rsquo; organisations for roll out to older people.</p>

  <p>In terms of speech and language therapist pay bands this, in conjunction with all aspects of the job evaluation process, will be monitored by the Job Evaluation Working Party, reporting to the Shadow Executive of the new NHS Staff Council. This monitoring will be supported by CAJE, the new Computer Aided Job Evaluation system.</p>

  <p>In Scotland informed evidence from this system will be gathered by the Pay Modernisation Team for Agenda for Change and reported to the Scottish Pay Reference and Implementation Group, a partnership body set up to advise Scottish ministers on the implementation of Agenda for Change.</p>

  <p>Under the Agenda for Change job evaluation process staff will be evaluated on their current jobs and assigned to pay bands based on the weighting the job achieves. This will not in itself alter the existing skill mix for speech and language therapists. Over time, there could be changes to the skill mix for this profession as a result of service change and development.

  <p>The Lord Advocate&rsquo;s Guidelines on the Operation of Police Conditional Offers of Fixed Penalty, that contain instructions on the relevant thresholds for speeding offences, are confidential. It would not be in the public interest for those who are intent on driving in excess of the speed limit to know at what levels and in what way the various speed limits are enforced. The guidelines do not set hard and fast rules, but allow for downward variation of thresholds for action by local agreement between Area Procurators Fiscal and Chief Constables where there are particular issues of road safety. It could therefore be misleading to motorists if normal thresholds were published, since these local agreements allow for enforcement at lower speeds.</p>

  <p>Students studying with Open University are defined as distance learners in relation to student support. Eligible full-time, part-time and distance learning students who incur additional expenditure whilst undertaking their course because of their disability can apply for additional support in the form of a Disabled Students Allowance (DSA). The DSA comprises a yearly basic allowance of &pound;1,525 and a non-medical personal help allowance of &pound;11,550. These allowances are paid on a pro-rata basis to those studying part-time or by distance learning. A further allowance of up to &pound;4,565 for the purchase of major items of equipment is available for the duration of the course. Help with the cost of travel may also be provided where the student incurs additional costs as a result of their disability.</p>

  <p>The non-medical personal help allowance and help with the cost of travel (for both the student and their helper if required) are available to distance learning students for attendance at tutorials and summer schools which form a compulsory part of the course.</p>

  <p>Following the review of Funding of Learners, the Disabled Students Stakeholder group was established to consider and address issues relating to the support available for disability related additional needs in further and higher education. The Open University disability adviser has recently joined the group.</p>

  <p>(1) The allocation methodology is based on a formula composed of indicators that reflect the key client groups which are intended to benefit from the Supporting People programme and for which data of a sufficient quality is available. The formula is composed of four elements (a) the number of elderly people in the local authority area; (b) the number of people with disabilities; (c) the number of homelessness allocations (averaged over a three year period), and (d) the degree of deprivation.</p>

  <p>(a) The number of elderly people in the local authority area was calculated using the population of 65 years and over as at mid-year 2003. This contributed 30% toward the formula allocation.</p>

  <p>(b) The number of people with disabilities was calculated using the number of people receiving Disability Living Allowance as at February 2004. This contributed 20% toward the formula allocation.</p>

  <p>(c) The number of homelessness applications (averaged over a three year period) was calculated from the number of applications under the homelessness persons legislation by local authority using an average of the 2001-02, 2002-03 and 2003-04. This contributed 30% toward the formula allocation.</p>

  <p>(d) The degree of deprivation was calculated using the population in the worst 15% of data zones by the 2004 Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation. This contributed 20% toward the formula allocation.</p>

  <p>(2) The formula distributes resources more fairly against relative need across Scotland. To help those authorities in the transition to the new arrangements the minister has set limits to the maximum reduction that any authority will face for each of the three year of this spending round with over &pound;16 million of transitional support for those most affected by the redistribution formula.</p>

  <p>(3) However, discussions with COSLA on the speed of redistribution are continuing. We expect to be able to make a new announcement in due course.</p>

  <p>Yes; only teachers who have graduated from Scottish Higher Education Institutions with a Teaching Qualification whose training has been publicly funded are eligible for a probationer post on the Teacher Induction Scheme. However, the Teacher Induction Scheme is not the only route into the teaching profession in Scotland. Newly qualified teachers from England and Wales, once registered with the General Teaching Council for Scotland, can apply to local authorities to work as a probationer teacher on a supply basis or on a temporary contract.</p>

  <p>This application was considered at a public local inquiry and the Scottish ministers advised all parties, on 5 February 2004, that they were minded to accept the reporters&rsquo; recommendation that planning permission should be granted. Whilst every effort will be made to reach an early decision it is not possible to say, at this stage, when a final announcement will be made. This is dependent on the satisfactory conclusion of a legal agreement between the applicant and North Lanarkshire Council which requires the applicant to provide a bond covering the eventual removal of buildings and restoration of the site.</p>
