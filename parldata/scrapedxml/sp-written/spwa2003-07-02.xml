  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what its position is on whether patients should wait up to two years to see an audiologist in a Fife Acute Hospitals NHS Trust hospital and what action it will take to remedy any such situation.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2003-07-02.1.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80077" speakername="Mr Tom McCabe" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-03/wa0702.htm#1">

  <p>Reducing waiting is a priority for the Executive. This was set out in the health white paper, <em>A Partnership for Care.</em> On Friday 13 June Malcolm Chisholm launched the Out-patient Action Plan which will help Scotland achieve the maximum wait of 26 weeks for out-patient appointments by 2005.</p>

  <p>The Executive made a commitment to modernise audiology services in response to the Public Health Institute report <em>NHS Audiology Services in Scotland</em>.</p>

  <p>We have asked NHS boards to develop modernisation action plans for hearing aid services, and an additional &#163;1.5 million was made available earlier this year for the purchase of new audiology equipment. &#163;750,000 was made available during 2002-03 to reduce waiting times.</p>

  <p>In 2003-04 boards will receive an average increase of 7.8% in their budget allocations. We expect boards to use some of this funding to help implement these plans. In addition the Executive is making &#163;8 million of central funding available over the next four years to support the modernisation process, and will appoint a project manager to facilitate and co-ordinate modernisation over the next two years.</p>

  <p>Much has been achieved already to implement the commitments set out in the Carers Strategy, and the resources available to local authorities to support carers and provide respite care have more than quadrupled over the past five years. We will continue to work in partnership with local authorities, the NHS, carers and the voluntary sector to improve support for carers.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive when it will establish an outreach training centre for dentists in Aberdeen; whether it will give details of any consultation exercise on the matter, including when any such exercise will be undertaken; whether it will provide details on any subsequent consultation on the need to develop the centre to a full dental school, as referred to in <em>A Partnership for a Better Scotland</em> , and how much funding is available for such projects.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2003-07-02.4.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80077" speakername="Mr Tom McCabe" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-03/wa0702.htm#4">

  <p>In a <em>Partnership for a Better Scotland</em> we highlighted our commitment to the development of an outreach centre and the associated increase in dental students to occupy such a centre. This is at present part of an outline cost appraisal exercise being undertaken by officials within the Scottish Executive in both Health and in Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning as the agreement could have implications for both departments.</p>

  <p>A dental hospital is a longer term option and could be disproportionately expensive. It is important that any consultation did not delay any initiatives. However, following discussions with key external agencies such as Grampian Health and universities associated with dental student teaching, we will publish our intentions.</p>

  <p>I have emphasised in a previous debate that shortages of dental workforce will not be solved by single issue initiatives but by a comprehensive change to the whole system which we have already started. One of our early successes has been the "golden hellos" which on initial assessment have assisted in recruitment of young graduates this year to Grampian and to dental practices in remoter parts of Scotland.</p>

  <p>Increasing awareness of health issues in Aberdeen and the Grampian NHS Board area is the responsibility of Grampian NHS Board's Health Promotion Unit. The unit provides information and advice on a wide range of topics including diet, exercise, smoking cessation, oral health, mental health and well-being aimed at the whole community and also targeted at specific groups where appropriate. The board is planning a men's health month to take place in August this year.</p>

  <p>Grampian NHS Board should be approached directly for information about their plans and strategies for men's health.</p>

  <p><em>The Scottish Executive Health Department is taking forward a number of national approaches which will increase awareness of men's health. We are working with Men&#146;s Health Forum Scotland (MHFS) to ensure that men&#146;s health improvement is considered as an integral part of health policy. The National Sexual Health Strategy for Scotland which will go out for public consultation in the autumn will look at all aspects of sexual health, including men's health. We are funding Scotland's Health at Work (SHAW) over three years, 2001-02 to 2003-04, to create more health promoting workplaces as part of an integrated occupational health strategy for Scotland. There are four strands to the Executive's occupational health policy agenda: working with the Health and Safety Executive and others to implement the UK agenda; delivering improvements for NHS staff, and raising awareness and practice in the private and public sectors across Scotland. Whilst not targeted specifically at men, these occupational health initiatives will provide further opportunities for men to think about their health and to take measures to improve their health. We will also be developing and piloting a range of innovative programmes including well man clinics.</em></p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it is still its intention not to impose tolling on the newly announced Stirling to Alloa to Kincardine rail line, as stated by the Minister for Transport in the debate in the Parliament on 12 June 2003 on public transport ( <em>Official Report</em> , c743), and whether it will seek to obtain, either directly or indirectly, any additional revenue from the re-opening of the line.</p>

  <p>There is no intention to impose toll charges on the Stirling to Alloa to Kincardine line.</p>

  <p>The Office of the Rail Regulator has the power under the Railways Act 1993, as amended by the Transport Act 2001, to approve access agreements that require a user of the infrastructure to pay incremental charges reflecting the costs of the enhanced infrastructure. It is for the promoter of infrastructure projects to ask the rail regulator for these powers to be used in relation to their particular project.</p>

  <p>In the case of the Stirling to Alloa to Kincardine rail link, the promoter of the railway has been considering the option of asking the Office of the Rail Regulator to approve an additional freight track access charge for the section from Alloa to Kincardine for companies that will benefit from the re-opening of the railway to freight traffic.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has not been approached by the Royal Mail on this issue. As I stated during the public transport debate in the Scottish Parliamentary Chamber on 12 June 2003, I intend to make representations to the UK Government to address the issues that led to the Royal Mail&#146;s proposal to end its contract with EWS.</p>
