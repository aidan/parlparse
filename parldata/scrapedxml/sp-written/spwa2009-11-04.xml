  <p>Within the last year, advice has been given in response to queries from two local authorities. Aberdeen City Council asked about rent levels for allotments in its area. The advice given was that this was a matter for the council. The City of Edinburgh Council asked about the process attaching to the confirmation of allotment regulations prepared by the council. The advice given explained the process.</p>

  <p>The 2004 consultation sought views on issues which could be included in a new animal welfare act to replace the Protection of Animals (Scotland) Act 1912. The new Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006 applies to all captive animals, not animals in the wild, therefore captive raptors are fully protected under its provisions.</p>

  <p>The consultation paper specifically sought views on birds reared for sport shooting and the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006 has a provision to enable Scottish ministers to issue a statutory code of practice on the rearing of gamebirds. A draft code is presently being developed and will be issued for consultation early next year.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is satisfied that swallows visiting Scotland in summer fall within the definition of &quot;wild birds&quot; for the purposes of Part 1 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, since Section 27 of the Act defines a wild bird for those purposes as &quot;any bird of a species which is ordinarily resident in or is a visitor to Great Britain in a wild state&quot;.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government, in partnership with COSLA and the Association of Scottish Community Councils (ASCC), are developing a package of measures to raise the profile and effectiveness of community councils throughout Scotland.</p>

  <p>A <em>Model Scheme of Establishment of Community Councils</em> and <em>Code of Conduct for Community Councils </em>developed by the Community Council Working Group (CCWG) became available for adoption by local authorities earlier this year. The CCWG also developed a support document in the form of Good Practice Guidance for use by both local authorities and community councils.</p>

  <p>Additionally, we have developed and launched three out of six community council pilot projects. The other three pilot projects are in train.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to the continued progress of community councils in Scotland as it recognises the important role, within the wider community empowerment agenda, that community councils can play in local life.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it is concerned at the comments of Ken Ross of the Fire Brigades Union to the Justice Committee on 6 October 2009 that the COSLA was unable to tell the fire service &quot;what formula or criteria it was using to determine the allocation that the fire service was going to get&quot; and that &quot;it seems that there is no longer a clear and transparent set of criteria for setting fire and rescue service budgets&quot; ( <em>Official Report</em> c. 2286) and, if so, what action it will take.</p>

  <p>The allocation of revenue funding to fire and rescue services is currently a decision for their constituent local authorities, taking into account their statutory obligations and national and local priorities.</p>

  <p>We believe that local government is best placed to understand the unique geography, population spread and risk profile of their communities. For these reasons, a uniform funding formula may not be practical. But we remain open to discussing alternative approaches with our partners, where these bring clear benefits to the frontline services delivered in our communities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has made clear its expectation that future spending decisions should, wherever possible, protect the frontline services on which our communities depend. We are clear that when considering the delivery of services, local government should deploy the principles of Best Value, as well as considering options for shared services.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government and COSLA believe that there are significant efficiencies to be realised within our fire and rescue services and that these can be delivered without a reduction in the overall capacity of the service to protect our communities.</p>

  <p>We discussed the Home Report with all of Scotland&rsquo;s major lenders for house purchase mortgages (as distinct from remortgage) around the time the Home Report was introduced and they confirmed that they would regard the Home Report as a sound basis for valuations, provided the surveyor was on their panel, the valuation was prepared within their time limits and there were not concerns about risk related to the particular house or borrower which required additional assurance on value. These parameters are generally the same as lenders applied to surveys and valuations prior to the introduction of the Home Report. We understand from the Council of Mortgage Lenders that they are not aware of any change in this approach and we do not have other evidence to suggest such a change.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has made numerous representations to the UK Government on the subject of access to Scotland&rsquo;s Fossil Fuel Levy surplus.</p>

  <p>The matter has been raised at ministerial meetings with UK Government counterparts and has been discussed at official level. We continue to make the case for a solution which would allow these funds to be released for investment in renewable energy in Scotland.</p>

  <p>For example, a letter of 30 July 2009 from the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth to the Chancellor included a request for a meeting with UK ministers to discuss the Fossil Fuel Levy as part of our joint preparation for the Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen in December. To date, no reply to that correspondence has been received.</p>

  <p>Developers do not receive WATES grants in each year of the scheme. Funding is drawn down on receipt of proof of eligible expenditure based on agreed milestones.</p>

  <p>All payments of funds to companies under the Wave and Tidal Energy Support (WATES) Scheme are issued in arrears, and on the evidence that the costs in question have actually been incurred. Based on this criteria, the following payments have been issued:</p>

  <p>All payments made to companies under the Wave and Tidal Energy Support (WATES) Scheme are made retrospectively based on legitimate evidence that eligible costs have been incurred. The Scottish Government remains committed to ensuring that WATES grants allocations are transferred to WATES project developers by March 2011. We are in discussions with all outstanding WATES developers regarding progress being made on their projects, in order to ensure that they remain active and that the deadlines for project completion and grant spend will be met.</p>

  <p>If the developers are unable to provide evidence that they can do so by the March 2011 deadline, the WATES offer will be withdrawn and the funds recycled into future support for the sector, to be announced as part of our current budget considerations.</p>

  <p>Once the property has been declared surplus to requirements, it will be offered back to the previous owner or their successor at current market value in accordance with the Crichel Down Rules.
