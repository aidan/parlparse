  <p>It is the responsibility of each local authority to determine what level of provision is required to meet the needs of its local population and to arrange an appropriate range of services.</p>

  <p>We of course recognise the importance of providing authorities with sufficient resources to fulfil that responsibility.

  <p>The Fleet Renewal Programme has led to an important improvement in the capability of the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency (SFPA) to deliver its fisheries enforcement duties, and by the end of this year three out of four of the SFPA&rsquo;s vessels will be new. Therefore, I propose to initiate a review of the Fleet Renewal Programme in order to assess the performance aims of the agency, including the case for an increase in the SFPA&rsquo;s fleet from four to five vessels, the case for an enhanced presence in inshore waters around Scotland in relation to monitoring and surveillance tasks, and other related matters. Pending that review, a contract for the construction of a new fisheries protection vessel is not anticipated in the immediate future.</p>

  <p>I am advised on food and feed issues, including labelling, by the Food Standards Agency. Food labelling rules are governed by EU law. Where there are no mandatory requirements, Scottish food can be labelled on a voluntary basis provided it does not mislead the purchaser. The agency has advised me that existing country of origin labelling requirements are currently being considered as part of a wider EU review of food labelling.</p>

  <p>It is a matter of personal choice on the part of the health care professional whether or not they wish to work in a remote and rural area of Scotland. Local health systems determine local needs and NHSScotland has a workforce planning framework in place to assist NHS boards in planning ahead for the workforce they need and the actions they require to take to deliver future services for patients.</p>

  <p>A range of policies, including incentive schemes, are in place which support recruitment and retention in remote and rural areas. Improved educational support for rural health care is being developed and implemented which will make rural training more accessible and attractive.</p>

  <p>In addition; the Government is committed to supporting and developing Rural General Hospitals, building on the work of the National Remote and Rural Steering Group, which will encourage health practitioners to work in rural areas. A core set of services to be delivered in those areas will be published in late summer 2007.</p>

  <p>A tripartite group made up of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges and Faculties in Scotland; NES; and the National Remote and Rural Steering Group is developing appropriate training pathways for doctors in remote and rural areas, including Rural General Hospitals. That group is also defining the skills and competencies required, scoping educational requirements, including appropriate curricula and identifying the infrastructure for continuing professional development. The Remote and Rural Steering Group believes that the provision of such training, tailored to the specific needs of remote and rural health services, will provide a sustainable solution to the issue of medical workforce supply which has been problematic for rural areas in the past.</p>

  <p>NHS boards and their partners are already making a significant investment in mental health and wellbeing services. They are using this existing investment to increase the availability of evidence based psychological therapies and to improve uptake of self help and social prescribing approaches to help achieve a reduction in the use of antidepressants.</p>

  <p>While there are costs to increasing provision in this way there are also savings, in particular, to the prescribing budget. We have signalled our intention to reduce the use of antidepressants and will be monitoring progress on this work to see if further interventions are required to achieve our objective of a 10% reduction by 2009.</p>

  <p>As I made clear in my statement to Parliament yesterday, I will operate a presumption against centralisation of core services whenever NHS boards bring forward proposals for significant service changes.</p>

  <p>That does not mean no change in any circumstances. However, it does mean that any proposals will have to be robust, that the alternatives will have to be properly considered, and that due weight must be given to public opinion. To ensure this is the case, I have decided that all future significant service change proposals should be subject to independent scrutiny.</p>

  <p>I will make a further announcement soon about the form of independent scrutiny that will apply to future service change proposals.</p>

  <p>The A82 Tarbet to Fort William Action Plan recommended a ten year improvement programme at a cost of &pound;90 million. The outcome of this study will feed into the Strategic Transport Projects Review which will examine the needs of our national strategic transport corridors. This is due to report in summer 2008.</p>

  <p>Meantime, Transport Scotland is planning a &pound;16 million improvement package to be delivered over the next five years. This package includes improvements at Pulpit Rock between Tarbet and Ardlui, a Western Bypass at Crianlarich, additional road safety measures, new lay-bys and picnic sites.</p>

  <p>Highland Council is currently carrying out the Inverness South Connectivity Study into possible improvements to the Inverness Southern Distributor Road (ISDR), including its connections with the A9 trunk road and onwards to the A96. This study is programmed to be completed in autumn 2007. Officials from Transport Scotland are working closely with Highland Council and are on the working group to represent trunk road interests in relation to the connections between the ISDR and the existing trunk road network.</p>

  <p>The Government proposes to invest &pound;1.6 billion in rural Scotland over the next seven years through the Scotland Rural Development Programme 2007-13.</p>

  <p>Measures to deliver a wealthier and fairer Scotland include:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>&pound;31 million for the restructuring of agricultural businesses;</p>
<p>&pound;70 million for the processing and marketing of agriculture and forestry products;</p>
<p>&pound;18 million for diversification out of agriculture or forestry;</p>
<p>&pound;18 million for the creation and development of micro-enterprises;</p>
<p>&pound;10 million to deliver our manifesto commitment to new entrants to farming, and</p>
<p>&pound;43 million in skills development in rural areas, underpinning our commitment to economic development and driving forward a smarter Scotland.</p>
</blockquote></p>

  <p>We look forward to receiving from the Borders high-quality applications for funding under these measures once the programme is up and running.</p>

  <p>The Howat report published last week clearly supports our view that the landscape of public sector delivery is crowded. Reviewing and understanding this landscape will allow changes to be made that both create efficiencies but more importantly improve the service provided to our customers - whether they be land managers, individuals, businesses or communities.

This is because the majority of the latter are likely to have been suicides. The following table provides information on this basis.</p>

Guidance for building owners is currently being prepared by the SBSA for publication and we expect details of the method of modelling to be part of this guidance. Our intention is to apply this method to the Holyrood building to calculate its rating as soon as we are in a position to do so.</p>
