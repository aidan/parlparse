  <p>It is a matter for NHS boards to assess and provide for local needs, including the numbers of staff required for effective service delivery.

  <p>We are committed to ensuring that older people have their say in the development of polices which affect them. Already through the work of the Care Development Group and the Chief Medical Officer&#146;s Expert Group on the Healthcare of Older People, older people have been able to present their views through a range of consultation methods such as newspaper advertisements, questionnaires, telephone surveys, public meetings and focus groups.</p>

  <p>We have established an Older People&#146;s Unit within the Executive to take forward the development of an over-arching strategy for older people across the Executive and are in discussion with a range of older people&#146;s organisations about appropriate mechanisms for consultation and involvement. In some areas older people are already working in partnership with local authorities and other agencies in the planning and delivery of public services.</p>

  <p>Controls over the burning of waste in industrial processes, including the production of cement, is the responsibility of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA). There is one cement kiln in Scotland, operated by Blue Circle near Dunbar. In law, the expression used to describe hazardous waste is &quot;special waste&quot;. Blue Circle&#146;s plant uses recycled liquid fuel which is treated by SEPA as special waste. The Special Waste Regulations 1996 require SEPA to impose strict standards and controls.</p>

  <p>The UK National Screening Committee (NSC) has now considered the final evaluation report of the chlamydia screening pilot projects run in England over the year to August 2000 and has concluded that a universal national screening programme for chlamydia is not feasible at the present time. The emphasis should rather be on targeted programmes for particular groups. In this respect the national health demonstration project, Healthy Respect, will shortly pilot chlamydia testing in a range of settings to help achieve its headline target of an increase in the reported cases of chlamydia amongst young people by 2003 through raised awareness. This will underpin delivery of the longer-term target to decrease reported prevalence of this infection by 50 per cent by 2010.</p>

  <p>A vast amount of activity takes place at both national and local level with a view to providing the Scottish population with the information they need to help them become and stay healthy. At national level, the Health Education Board for Scotland undertakes a wide range of initiatives including, for example, the award winning &quot;Big 3&quot; (coronary heart disease, cancer and stroke) campaign for adults and the &quot;Think About It&quot; (smoking, drug misuse, alcohol misuse and sexual health) campaign for young people. This is complemented at local level by a broad variety of services offered by health board Health Promotion Departments ranging from the provision of leaflets/information/advice to the organising of exercise classes and healthy eating demonstrations. The Food Standards Agency provides advice on public health in connection with food standards and safety.</p>

  <p>All three organisations make extensive use of their websites as a way of getting the message across.</p>

  <p>Tackling health inequalities is the overarching aim of our public health strategy, as set out in the white paper <em>Towards a Healthier Scotland</em> and <em>Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change</em> . Measures being taken to realise that aim include the network of Healthy Living Centres now being established, the Scottish Community Diet Project which works with low-income communities, a range of smoking, alcohol and drug misuse initiatives and the National Health Demonstration Projects in the priority areas of child health, sexual health, cancer and heart disease. Moreover, the Health Improvement Fund is investing an additional &#163;100 million over four years in health improvement work.</p>

  <p>As well as addressing lifestyles and particular health topics, the Executive &#150; in conjunction with partner organisations in Scotland and the UK Government &#150; is also working to address the poor life circumstances that can contribute to ill health. Health is at the heart of the Executive&#146;s approach to social justice and actions across the whole range of its programmes (for example, Social Inclusion Partnerships) is contributing to the fight to reduce health inequalities and improve the health and well-being of all Scots.</p>

  <p>The needs of rural areas will be taken closely into account in the forthcoming UK-wide negotiations to amend the GP contract. We will also learn from the work of the solutions group which the Remote and Rural Areas Resource Initiative has established to examine specific recruitment and retention issues affecting staff across the full range of NHS work &#150; including doctors. These include professional isolation and out-of-hours commitments associated with working in remote areas.</p>

  <p>Also, Personal Medical Services schemes allow different contractual arrangements to be tested. GPs can be salaried either by Primary Care Trusts or within practices or pilots can be practice-based. Earlier this year I announced an additional investment of &#163;18.5 million to support the development of PMS. The extra resources were allocated to all health boards but the greatest share of resources went to those areas with high levels of deprivation and rural communities.</p>

  <p>In the year ended 31 March 2001, the median waiting time for a first out-patient appointment with a Consultant in Restorative Dentistry at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary was 118 days.</p>

  <p>Restorative dental treatments carried out within the Hospital and Community Health Service settings are primarily undertaken on an out-patient basis, and information on waiting times for such treatments is not held centrally. At Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, no patient was admitted from the waiting list for in-patient or day case treatment in the speciality of restorative dentistry in the year ended 31 March 2001.</p>

  <p>The only specific disease known to be linked to selenium deficiency is Keshan Disease, a disorder of the heart muscles primarily in children found in some areas of China where the soil is severely deficient in selenium. The Committee on the Medical Aspects of Food and Nutrition Policy (COMA) reviewed the nutritional implications of estimated selenium intakes in the UK and agreed that:</p>

  <p>selenium intakes and measurements of selenium status should continue to be monitored;</p>

  <p>further research should be encouraged to investigate whether the current levels of intake are adequate or whether the body adapts to changing intakes;</p>

  <p>there is currently no evidence of adverse health consequence from current intakes.</p>

  <p>Information on the number of domiciliary sight tests paid for by health boards and Primary Care NHS Trusts in Scotland is collected by the Common Services Agency as part of the General Ophthalmic Services return. The domiciliary information collected is not published due to concerns about the robustness of the data.

  <p>Grants are awarded by Historic Scotland on behalf of Scottish ministers in support of repairs to the historic fabric of buildings regarded as being of outstanding historic or architectural importance. The Government&#146;s Listed Places of Worship Grants Scheme will operate retrospectively from 1 April 2001 and will have the effect of reducing the rate of VAT on certain costs to 5 per cent. The effect of the Listed Places of Worship Grants scheme will thus be to reduce the costs of such repairs, net of Historic Scotland grants, which fall upon the church authorities.</p>

  <p>The Government has announced that the Listed Places of Worship Grant Scheme will operate retrospectively from 1 April 2001 and payments will commence in the financial year 2001-02. As the project costs borne by church authorities are thus reduced, Historic Scotland&#146;s grant support, which is based on the eligible costs of projects, falls to be reduced proportionately. I have asked my officials to re-consider the mechanism for achieving this.</p>

  <p>Proposals to repair or adapt listed buildings which may affect their architectural character or quality including the erection of telecommunications equipment are normally subject to listed building control and require the submission of an application for listed building consent to the planning authority. However, places of worship are currently exempt from this control, under section 54 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) (Scotland) Act 1997. Historic Scotland operates the Ecclesiastical Exemption Pilot Scheme with the agreement of the Scottish Churches Committee for dealing with proposals for works to the external fabric of buildings in ecclesiastical use which, were it not for this exemption, would require listed building consent. The arrangements apply to all such buildings irrespective of whether planning permission would, or would not, also be required.</p>

  <p>We welcome the close partnership between the NHS and the hospice movement in Scotland. The totality of specialist palliative care provision is currently being reviewed as part of the implementation of the Scottish Cancer Plan. That work will take account of the Scottish Executive&#146;s policy that palliative care has a role to play in respect of all progressive conditions, not just cancer.</p>

  <p>The pattern of acute hospital services in Tayside is a matter for the NHS board, in consultation with its planning partners and the people of Tayside. The decision to withdraw acute services from Stracathro was a clinical safety issue and was not taken on cost grounds.

  <p>There has been a slight increase in the number of organ donors for transplantation in the period 1January 2001 to 31 August 2001 compared to the same period last year. Overall, however, there has been a decline in organ donation rates in recent years, and the Executive is currently considering what action can be taken to improve them.</p>

  <p>The information available suggests that there has been a drop in the number of hospital post-mortems, and it can therefore be assumed that this will have led to a decrease in the number of organs retained for research.

  <p>The number of organ donor leaflets requested from the Scottish Executive so far this year has already exceeded last year&#146;s total by over 31,000. The Scottish Executive has recently provided funding support towards a billboard and cinema advertising initiative organised by the Scottish Transplant Co-ordinators, which took place during Transplant Awareness Week.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is currently considering a range of potential measures to raise public awareness about organ donation. We have asked the Scottish Transplant Group to develop a strategy to increase organ donation and I expect to be able to make an announcement once I have received its report later this year.</p>

  <p>One key way of helping to increase organ donation rates is for people who would be willing to donate organs to discuss their intentions with their family, so that the family is aware of those intentions if they are ever asked to decide whether organ donation should take place.</p>

  <p>The costs of the Ryder Cup bid were met from provision made in 2000-01 and 2001-02. This cannot be identified separately in the annual expenditure reports. Provision for the additional programmes identified as part of the Ryder Cup bid was made each year of the spending period and forms part of the provision for sport and VisitScotland.</p>

  <p>In the case of Euro 2008, provision for the preparation of a bid will be met from provision made for this financial year. Funding implications of further commitments which may be made within the bid have yet to be identified.</p>

  <p>Funding for the implementation of the national cultural strategy is also being provided for each year of the spending period.

  <p>Approximately &#163;100,000 has been spent from this allocation on bidding for the Ryder Cup.</p>

  <p>We are in discussion with the Scottish Football Association (SFA) about the costs associated with the preparation a bid for Euro 2008. We have identified a provisional budget of &#163;500,000 for work in this financial year from the major events budget the detailed allocation of which will be agreed with the SFA. Any funding in future years would be dependent on whether Scotland bids to host the Euro 2008 finals.</p>
