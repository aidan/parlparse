  <p>The central heating programme is aimed at those who have no central heating at all. The only circumstance in which existing systems will be replaced is where they are completely broken and beyond repair. In such cases the existing system will be taken out if it prevents installation of the new central heating. The heating company will remove the existing system but it will be for the householder to arrange for its disposal and bear the cost of doing so.</p>

  <p>Instructions to contractors working on the central heating programme are issued to them as they are appointed. The instructions provide that any existing heating system is to be taken out if it prevents the fitting of new central heating under the programme.

  <p>The proportion of children living in low-income households in Scotland was 30% in 2000-01. This is our headline measure, based on 60% of median GB income (after housing costs) for the relative year. In order to have a detailed understanding of children in low-income families we track a number of measurements, as outlined in our <i>Social Justice Annual Report</i> .</p>

  <p>There has been considerable progress in improving the position for families on the lowest incomes. The proportion of children in severe income poverty (below 50% of median income) has fallen markedly from 21% in 1996-97 to 16% in 2000-01. There has also been a substantial improvement in income levels for low income families generally, as shown by the 13 percentage point drop in the number of children living in low-income households in absolute terms, from 34% in our baseline year of 1996-97 to 21% in 2000-01. These figures demonstrate that poor children in Scotland have been benefiting from our policies of supporting parents into training and work, underpinned by the modernisation of the tax and benefit system by the UK Government.</p>

  <p>We remain committed to defeating child poverty in a generation.</p>

  <p>It is the Executive&rsquo;s policy to encourage the development of managed clinical networks where patients and health professionals believe they would lead to improved services for patients. Proposals for pilot managed clinical networks for epilepsy are currently being developed in different parts of Scotland. The Executive has made it clear to Epilepsy Action Scotland, and the neurologists with whom they are working, that we would be willing to consider bids for pump-priming funds to help with the development of such managed clinical networks.</p>

  <p>We sought views last year, when we reviewed the regulation of the aquaculture industry, on the proposition that a central regulatory authority might be created. This was not favoured by the majority of our consultees.</p>

  <p>The present statutory controls interface, but are distinct. Our judgement is that they are better discharged by the separate bodies currently involved (whose regulatory functions could in any case be changed only through amending statute).

  <p>A central plank of our freight transport policy is encouraging freight to be transferred from road to rail and water. Our commitment to encouraging modal shift is demonstrated by a doubling of resources to &#163;36 million in the three-year period up to 2003-04 for the Scottish Executive's Freight Facilities Grant scheme. This scheme helps companies invest in the alternative facilities needed to compete in financial terms with road transport.</p>

  <p>Awards of grant totalling up to &#163;5.1 million have already been made to two projects transporting timber by sea from the Mull of Kintyre and the Morvern Peninsula to Ayrshire.

  <p>Although the Scottish Executive receives estimates from forces relating to the costs associated with retirements in future years, no information is held centrally on the likely numbers of officers involved. Nor is detailed information held on the estimated number of police officers likely to complete their probationer training in future years.</p>

  <p>The resources provided to the Scottish Police College are to enable it to provide on-going training and development for serving officers as well as probationer training for recruits. Around 1,600 probationers were trained at the college in 2001-02 and the current plans assume that demand will continue at around that level. However, the number who complete their probation training by force will depend on how many are recruited to each force in each future year and that is an operational matter for Chief Constables to determine within the budgets available to them.</p>

  <p>Railway infrastructure projects may qualify for financial assistance from either the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s Public Transport Fund (PTF) or Integrated Transport Fund (ITF). Bids under the PTF would have to satisfy eligibility criteria and compete with other bids, and those under the ITF would have to be considered by the Scottish Executive as being of sufficient strategic importance.</p>

  <p>The Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive is looking at options for Glasgow Crossrail. However, the Scottish Executive has not been approached for funding a cross-city rail link.</p>

  <p>The Regulation of Investigatory Powers (Scotland) Act 2000 strengthens the rights of individuals by providing a statutory framework specifying the circumstances in which certain covert investigative techniques may be used, their authorisation, oversight and complaints procedures.</p>

  <p>The legislation requires the appointment of surveillance commissioners to keep under review the performance of functions under the act. The Chief Surveillance Commissioner is required to prepare an annual report and to lay it before the UK and Scottish Parliaments. The annual report for 2001-02 was laid before both Parliaments on 17 January 2002.</p>

  <p>In addition, the act makes provision for complaints by members of the public to be made to an independent tribunal.</p>

  <p>The targets set in <i>Another Kind of Home</i> in 1992 proved difficult to meet and were re-established in 1999. This may be due to the fact that whilst the number of children and young people accommodated in residential schools and units has decreased, there has been a major increase in staffing.</p>

  <p>Additional commitments will follow for two local roads PPP projects: M77/GSO joint project and A92 dualling. These will probably fall within the timescale but it is too early to firm up on estimates of payments at this stage.</p>

  <p>No accurate profile of spend on structural repairs, or routine and winter maintenance can be provided for the years after 2003-04, as final allocations to these budget lines are dependent upon the outcome of SR2002.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no plans to extend the monitoring system of annual condition surveys on trunk roads to include non-trunk roads.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for non-trunk roads, including carrying out surveys of non-trunk roads lies with each council as the local roads authority for its area. The Scottish Executive fully supports the Society of Chief Officers of Transport in Scotland&rsquo;s plans to carry out a condition survey of the local road network across Scotland, which is to be launched shortly.</p>

  <p>Trunk roads in Clydesdale are managed and maintained on behalf of the Scottish Executive by the Operating Companies, Amey Highways and Autolink Concessionaires. The trunk road maintenance contract requires the Operating Companies to carry out regular safety inspections on these roads. Annual road condition surveys are carried out on the trunk road network and from these the Operating Companies identify a programme of structural maintenance schemes to improve the condition of the network.</p>

  <p>Local roads in Clydesdale are the responsibility of South Lanarkshire Council as the local roads authority for the area. It is entirely a matter for the council to decide what priority should be given to the maintenance and improvement of local roads. Additional capital allocations for local roads and bridges amounting to &#163;70 million across Scotland were announced in Spending Review 2000. On 25 February 2002, I awarded a further &#163;20 million in revenue funding to speed up maintenance activity on local roads: South Lanarkshire&rsquo;s share of this extra cash injection is &#163;959,000.</p>

  <p>The Debt Arrangement and Attachment (Scotland) Bill was introduced on 7 May 2002. The bill introduces a radical new approach to debt management which puts money advice and information at the forefront to enable debt problems to be tackled before court and enforcement action become a possibility. It implements the central recommendations of the independent Working Group&rsquo;s report <i>Striking the Balance: a new approach to debt management</i> , published on 6 July 2001, which were the subject of extensive public consultation and which received widespread support. In particular, it establishes the framework for a nation-wide debt arrangement scheme to allow managed repayment of multiple debt by negotiated instalment. In doing so, it fulfils the Executive&rsquo;s commitment to bring forward an humane and workable alternative to the existing system in response to the request of the Justice and Home Affairs Committee expressed in its <i>Stage 1 Report on the Abolition of Poindings and Warrant Sales Bill</i> (SP Paper 82, paragraph 48).</p>
