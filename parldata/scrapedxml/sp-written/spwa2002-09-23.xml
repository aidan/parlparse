  <p>As part of the annual process of compiling the Aggregate Account for Agriculture to calculate the total income from farming, data on cereal crops are collated from a variety of sources. The estimated gross output of Scottish barley for the calendar year 2001 was &#163;196.5 million, including &#163;66.6 million of direct subsidies. The revenue for malting and feed barley were estimated at &#163;48.5 million and &#163;73.5 million respectively.</p>

  <p>Local authorities have the power to apply to the sheriff court for an anti-social behaviour order. Housing associations (and any other landlord) can request that the local authority apply for an order on their behalf. The Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill will give courts the power to grant an interim anti-social behaviour order to take effect pending the outcome of the substantive application. This will provide more immediate relief from anti-social behaviour.</p>

  <p>By way of background I would refer to answers given by Mr Sam Galbraith in response to Mr Bristow Muldoon and Mr Alex Neil on the same matter (S1W-1004 and S1W-1240 on 14 September 1999). There is no statutory upper age limit for children&rsquo;s panel members. In keeping with the ethos of the Kilbrandon report that members should broadly be the contemporaries of the parents of the child or young person, panel members are not normally appointed beyond their 66th birthday.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-22343 by Ross Finnie on 8 February 2002, whether it has any plans to set targets for major energy users such as Scottish Water.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-09-23.S1W-29099.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80155" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0923.htm#5">

  <p>Targets can be set under the negotiated agreements procedure whereby companies get a discount on climate change levy in return for meeting agreed targets. Only companies using processes (irrespective of thresholds) covered by Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) are entitled to enter into such agreements with the Government.</p>

  <p>Apart from some waste sites, the water industry is not covered by IPPC. It is already regulated by a number of other European Environment Directives, and was excluded to avoid duplication of regulation. Specifically in relation to Scottish Water, it is not a private company and thus does not benefit from enhanced capital allowances, this is because it does not pay corporation tax nor is it in profit.</p>

  <p>The recording of crimes and offences is a matter for local police forces. The member may be referring to police reports of crimes and offences to the procurator fiscal which are now being handled electronically as part of the Integration of Scottish Criminal Justice Information Systems programme. This involves a range of criminal justice organisations, not only the police, but includes the use of a Scottish Criminal Records Office reference number. While implementation of the programme may create additional local pressures initially, I have not been advised of any circumstances in which police officers have not recorded crimes or offences or have not reported to procurators fiscal because of systems failure.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for the overall provision of NHS dental services in an area rests with the relevant NHS board or Primary Care NHS Trust. Tayside Primary Care NHS trust recently received approval to appoint a joint CDS/GDS dentist, i.e. a community dental officer who provides general dental services for part of his/her time, based in Arbroath. If the trust considers that a further gap in provision exists it can apply for approval to appoint a salaried dentist.</p>

  <p>Such guarantees are already in place. Under the Employment Rights Act 1996, the Department of Trade and Industry can pay redundancy pay and certain other debts owed to former employees of insolvent companies out of the National Insurance Fund. This legislation implements the EU Insolvency Directive and guarantees a basic minimum of payments to employees of insolvent employers who would normally have to wait some considerable time for payment as creditors in the insolvency proceedings.</p>

  <p>The Redundancy Payments Service has investigated the transfer of business from Telesens to Convergys and is satisfied that the dismissals were either unconnected with the transfer, or were made for economic, technical or organisation reasons entailing changes in the workforce. This means that liability for payment lies with the National Insurance Fund. The payments for the former employees have been processed and they should by now have received payment.</p>

  <p>No specific monitoring was carried out on non-GM crops situated in the vicinity of the GM crop trial at Munlochy.</p>

  <p>Separation distances are in place around GM crop trials to minimise the potential for cross-pollination. They do not reflect any doubts about safety; they are used to maintain high levels of purity in adjacent crops and are a recognised method of enabling different crops to co-exist. The Executive&rsquo;s scientific advisers are satisfied that neither cross-pollination involving the variety of GM herbicide tolerant oil seed rape being grown in the farm-scale trials, nor the pollen itself landing on neighbouring crops, poses a threat to human health or the environment. The harvested GM crop and any sexually compatible crops grown within the separation distances surrounding GM crop trials will not enter the human food or animal feed chain.</p>

  <p>Legislation on the classification of drugs is reserved to the UK Parliament, and it will be for them to decide finally whether cannabis will be reclassified. The Executive has, however, worked closely with the Home Office about these proposals.</p>

  <p>The proposals to reclassify cannabis are based on the outcome of a comprehensive scientific assessment of its risks to health, relative to other drugs. We can, therefore, deliver a credible message to young people in Scotland about the levels of harm posed by cannabis, compared to other illegal drugs.</p>

  <p>We have achieved this by giving wide distribution to a guide to cannabis reclassification, which was published to coincide with the Home Secretary&rsquo;s announcement on 10 July. The guide was published as part of our Know the Score Drugs Communications Strategy. It sets out the legal position, and the risks to physical and mental health associated with cannabis misuse.</p>

  <p>This information requested is not held centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>

  <p>It is Scottish Executive policy that services should be acquired following competition wherever possible. Contract notices are commonly placed in <em>Government Opportunities </em>magazine, trade press and newspapers. Where the value of the contract is anticipated to be above the EC threshold, competitions are run in accordance with the procedures of the EC Services Directive, under which contract notices are required to be placed in the <em>Official Journal of the European Community</em>.</p>

  <p>No such analysis has been conducted. European law prohibits discrimination in favour of firms based on geographic location.</p>

  <p>Audit Scotland carried out a recent study of the PFI procurement of schools by Scottish councils on behalf of the Accounts Commission. The resulting report<sup> </sup>was published earlier this year and includes a commentary on the financial consequences of the first round of schools PFI contracts and on the tendering and appraisal processes for such schemes, including the need for objective appraisals. This report did not include any assessment of the wider impact of these projects on the Scottish economy.</p>

  <p>In determining NHS boards&rsquo; unified budgets each year, the Scottish Executive Health Department takes account of the expected costs of implementing likely recommendations from the Health Technology Board for Scotland (HTBS).

  <p>The Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland has made clear that baton guns are to be deployed in Scotland in situations where police officers are faced with life threatening incidents as a less lethal alternative to conventional firearms. I have been assured that there are no plans for the police to use baton guns in Scotland when dealing with public order disturbances or political demonstrations, and I have made clear that Scottish ministers would need to be consulted were that position ever to change.</p>

  <p>The deployment of police officers within the Lothian and Borders Police area is an operational matter for the Chief Constable. Information is held centrally on the numbers of police officers in the force, on a quarterly basis, but not on the deployment of those officers to divisions or stations within the force area.</p>

  <p>The information requested is displayed in the tables and is grouped into four categories:</p>

  <p>Procurator Fiscal and Promoted Legal Staff (Procurator Fiscal (PF), Assistant Procurator Fiscal (Asst PF); Senior Principal Depute (SPD); Principal Depute (PD));</p>

  <p>Procurator Fiscal Depute (entrant level for fully qualified solicitor);</p>

  <p>Legal Trainees (serving a two-year traineeship prior to full admission as solicitor), and</p>

  <p>Non-Legally Qualified Staff includes all other staff (Executive, Precognition, Administrative, Secretarial and support staff).</p>

  <p>Each office has a procurator fiscal who holds the Lord Advocate&rsquo;s commission with the exception of Selkirk/Peebles and Jedburgh/Duns where one fiscal holds a commission for both offices. All information is based on permanent staff in post (full-time equivalent).</p>

  <p>The Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive is funded by the Strathclyde Passenger Transport Authority.

  <p>The current peak-time bus service between Ferrytoll and Victoria Quay is taken into account in the Scottish Executive Travel Plan.</p>

  <p>HM Treasury publish an estimate of impact of the use of the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s tax varying powers each year in the Financial Statement and Budget Report.

  <p>The performance data from the pilot water treatment plant at Milngavie is highly technical in nature and consequently Scottish Water has no plans to publish it. However, the Water Research Centre (WRc) has carried out an expert review of the treatment process selection and design, and this is publicly available. The WRc report has previously been submitted to East Dunbartonshire Council, by Scottish Water, in support of the planning application for a new treatment works.</p>
