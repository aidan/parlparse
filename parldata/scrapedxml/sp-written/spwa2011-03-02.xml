  <p>As part of the procurement process, the Registrar General obtained references about previous contracts that CACI (UK) Ltd had completed, as assurance of the company&rsquo;s capability to deliver the required services. The main reference related to Ireland, because CACI (UK) Ltd had provided support services for the two previous Irish censuses.</p>

  <p>The Registrar General also obtained copies of recent published accounts for CACI (UK) Ltd to ensure its financial stability, as well as details of its insurance cover and accreditations, and carried out other research on the status and history of the company.</p>

  <p>The contract to help with the Scottish census is with CACI (UK) Ltd. It was awarded under EU procurement rules which do not allow bidders to be excluded because they are subsidiaries of US companies. But the Registrar General put in place contractual precautions described in paragraph 6.8 of <em>Scotland&rsquo;s Census 2011: A Government Statement</em> , laid before the Parliament in December 2008, to ensure that personal information collected in the census could not leave Scotland and that the US Patriot Act could not catch that information.</p>

  <p>Interrogation of prisoners is a legal activity, but the website alleges that a different subsidiary of CACI International, working for the US Government in Iraq, was involved in human rights abuses at Abu Ghraib. The company vehemently denies these allegations and strongly deplores any form of abuse of human rights. The allegations of involvement in torture of inmates at Abu Ghraib have never been proved. Nor has the US Government, which court-martialled some of its troops over abuses at Abu Ghraib, taken any action against CACI or its subsidiary.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government fully endorses the principle that opportunities to participate, including standing for elected office, should be open to everyone and that active citizens are at the heart of the democratic process. Ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation and similar factors should never constitute a barrier to involvement. The Scottish Parliament is founded on important principles which emphasise the importance of access, power-sharing and equal opportunities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government provided funding of &pound;2.1 million over 2008-11 to national disabled people&rsquo;s organisations with the aim of increasing the participation and inclusion of disabled people in the development and delivery of public policy at a national and local level. Ministers will shortly announce what national disability projects will be funded in 2011-12.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not hold this information.</p>

  <p>Information from inspection activities suggest that most primary schools provide children with an opportunity to experience a residential outdoor education experience at some point during primary school - most typically during P6 or P7 in which almost all young people participate. Most secondary schools provide young people with an opportunity for at least one residential stay of some description during secondary school but this might not be a traditional outdoor education type experience. Inspections suggest that opportunities for outdoor learning in secondary schools such as participation in the John Muir Award and Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme Programmes are increasing and support the drive for greater opportunity for and recognition of wider achievement enshrined within the expectations of Curriculum for Excellence.</p>

  <p>Delivery of education is devolved to local authorities and funding for this is included in the local government settlement. It is for education authorities to consider the provision of outdoor education in their areas and make arrangements with providers as necessary, in addition to any facilities that they may operate. They are locally elected and accountable for such decisions.</p>

  <p>The current position is to support industry to take voluntary measures which has seen average consumption of trans fats drop to below 1% and to only support placing a limit on trans fats if the evidence supports that there would be a significant health benefit in doing so the Food Standards Agency Scotland has confirmed that there is no new evidence to support a change of position.</p>

  <p>We will continue to keep trans fats levels under close review, actively monitoring outputs of ongoing work and new research in Scotland, the UK and internationally.</p>

  <p>The &pound;268.5 million allocated to Supporting Economic Growth/Housing Supply in the Draft Budget 2011-12 covers a range of expenditure. This includes spending commitments in relation to previously approved affordable housing and regeneration projects, and new investment in affordable housing supply through the New Supply Shared Equity Scheme with Developers (amounting to &pound;5 million), and the Investment and Innovation Fund (IIF) (amounting to &pound;50 million). Our current proposed timetable is that IIF bids will be assessed in June/July 2011 and allocations, including those to local authorities for council house building, will be decided in August 2011.</p>

  <p>The evaluation of the Energy Saving Scotland home loans pathfinder scheme was published in December 2010. It is based on interviews and data analysis and therefore provides useful information a number of aspects of the scheme including:</p>

  <p>The customer&rsquo;s decision making process;</p>

  <p>The mix of customers and what measures they are likely to install;</p>

  <p>The cost effectiveness of loans;</p>

  <p>The difference a loan makes; and</p>

  <p>Recommendations for refinements to the scheme.</p>

  <p>It fulfils the Scottish Government&rsquo;s aim to determine the receptiveness of domestic consumers to government-backed interest-free loans and gives strong evidence which will be used to inform future development of policy for domestic energy efficiency and micro-renewables.</p>

  <p>Over the three years of the current spending review period capital investment in NHSScotland has totalled &pound;1.676 billion, an increase of 19.9% on the previous three years. NHS boards operate within delegated limits for the delivery of capital projects.

Accordingly, only details of capital projects with a value in excess of &pound;5 million are held centrally.

  <p>This administration has worked closely with local NHS and local authority partnerships to tackle delayed discharges over the last four years, greatly reducing the number of patients delayed over the six week discharge planning period, and achieving a zero level at the April census in 2008, 2009 and 2010.</p>

  <p>Our Joint Improvement Team has been made available to work with partnerships with specific problems.</p>

  <p>There are some cases where it is not appropriate to discharge a patient within six weeks, such as where there are concerns about someone&rsquo;s capacity. However, we are working towards reducing the length of these delays with local partnerships, the Mental Welfare Commission and Scottish courts, amongst others.</p>

  <p>There is no recommended fixed distance between turbines and individual properties. The topple distance of a free-standing turbine would be the absolute minimum between it and a neighbouring property. Scottish Government planning advice on wind turbine development, which can be accessed at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/212607/0113777.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/212607/0113777.pdf</a> , states that shadow flicker can generally be dealt with by a separation distance equivalent to 10 rotor diameters of the turbine. Mitigating noise will also have a bearing on what the appropriate separation distance should be.</p>

  <p>All representations made by members of the public, including the views of local residents, are taken into account before ministers determine an application under section 36. In addition, the views of local community councils are an important consideration for Scottish ministers in determining applications.</p>

  <p>I have asked John Ewing, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS), to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Smoking by staff and prisoners is not permitted in any enclosed space on SPS property with the exception that prisoners are able to smoke in their cells.</p>

  <p>The Prisons and Young Offenders Institutions (Scotland) Rules, Rule 31, states that no prisoner shall smoke in a prison except:</p>

  <p>In a cell or room in which that prisoner is accommodated by him or herself or;</p>

  <p>In a cell or room in which that prisoner is accommodated and which the Governor designates as a smoking area in accordance with a direction given by Scottish ministers or;</p>

  <p>In the open air; in any place as Scottish ministers may specify in a direction.</p>

  <p>Prisoners admitted to SPS establishments are subject to a cell sharing risk assessment as part of the reception process during which the prisoner can request a non-smoking cell. Where a non-smoking prisoner&rsquo;s preference cannot be met immediately steps are taken to accommodate the request as soon as possible and for the position to be reviewed within 7 days.</p>

  <p>Blair House at HMYOI Polmont, opened in November 2009 for young offenders aged under 18. Prisoners in this age group are not permitted to purchase tobacco products and therefore Blair House is a totally smoke free environment.</p>
