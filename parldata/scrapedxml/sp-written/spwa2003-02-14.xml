  <p>The Executive issues guidance to all education authorities regarding how schools should record incidents. The guidance makes it clear that all incidents should be reported to the head teacher and on to the education authority. The Executive has not undertaken any assessment regarding the awareness by teachers of the need to record an incident of violent or threatening behaviour. However, we do know that a number of authorities have adopted a zero tolerance policy and have encouraged school staff to report all incidents of violence and anti-social behaviour, which would include threatening behaviour.</p>

  <p>Since 1999, the Scottish Public Pensions Agency (SPPA) has had a contract with Workability Ltd, formerly Lanarkshire Health Executive for the provision of medical advice, primarily assessments of employees seeking early retirement on medical grounds.

  <p>The process following the refusal of medical early retirement allows the applicant to apply for a review of the decision at any time.

  <p>In these cases, a specialist, independent of Workability, is appointed to conduct an examination and make a recommendation to ministers.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will have any input into the House of Commons European Standing Committee C's inquiry into the proposed EU regulations on official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption (COM (2002) 377); whether the scope of the proposed regulations falls within the Executive&#146;s responsibilities, and, if so, whether it will lay the proposed regulations before the Parliament for scrutiny and, if so, when it will do so.</p>

  <p>Food safety is a devolved matter and Scottish ministers are advised on this issue by the Food Standards Agency.</p>

  <p>If asked by the committee, Scottish ministers - advised by the agency - would be pleased to provide evidence to the House of Commons European Standing Committee C's inquiry into the proposed EU Regulation on official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption.</p>

  <p>The European Committee of the Scottish Parliament considers EU legislation and proposals. The committee was sent an Explanatory Memorandum (EM) for the proposed EU Regulation on 19 August 2002 which was produced in consultation with devolved administrations. When the EU Regulation is finally agreed, Scottish ministers will be responsible for bringing forward any transposing legislation that may be needed to ensure it is given full effect in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The application of the Competition Act 1998 is a reserved matter.</p>

  <p>Our understanding of the Competition Commission ruling in the BetterCare case is that it established that in the circumstances of that particular case the public body involved could be regarded as acting in itself as an undertaking and hence was subject to the Competition Act 1998 and further examination by the Office of Fair Trading. Our understanding is that any other cases would also have to be considered on their own merits.</p>

  <p>Properties in Orkney and Shetland which have written title deeds recorded in the Register of Sasines will be treated in the same way as property owned in mainland Scotland for registration purposes. No special evidence should be required.</p>

  <p>The Keeper of the Registers of Scotland has recently had discussions with solicitors in Orkney and Shetland and has been given to understand that there are very few properties in the islands for which title deeds have not been previously recorded in the Register of Sasines. In these few cases where Udal property is still held on the basis of succession and possession, without prior written title deeds, the keeper is prepared to consider sympathetically whatever evidence the applicants for registration are able to provide - for example, family trees, affidavits from third parties and written title deeds for adjoining property.</p>

  <p>Anyone acquiring Udal land after the commencement date of the Land Register in Orkney and Shetland on 1 April 2003 will only be able to obtain a real right in the land by registration in the Land Register. However, existing proprietors&#146; rights will not be affected: land registration affects only the rights of persons acquiring title after the commencement date.</p>

  <p>The Keeper of the Registers of Scotland will deal with applications for first registration in the Land Register of the very few udal titles for which no written deeds exist by considering such other forms of evidence which may be open to him.
