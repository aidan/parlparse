  <p>The relevant recommendations in the report published by the Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee (RWMAC) make it clear that the responsibility for reviewing waste characterisation and management arrangements rests with the Ministry of Defence.</p>

  <p>Before the waste can be disposed, the site operators will have to satisfy the Scottish Environment Protection Agency that the waste has been properly characterised, that the levels of radioactivity associated with the waste are accurately quantified and that these levels do not exceed the site&#8217;s authorised limits for the disposal route used.</p>

  <p>The regulation of the transport of radioactive material (including waste) is a reserved matter for the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions.

  <p>A working group comprised of officials from the local council and agencies as well as the Scottish Executive has met on several occasions to provide strategic co-ordination of the recovery plan. The announcements of extra Scottish Executive resources to alleviate hardship and assist recovery were influenced by these discussions. The group will continue to take stock of the progress in each of the main areas of the plan.</p>

  <p>There have been a number of discussions with ministers from the National Assembly for Wales about foot-and-mouth disease recovery. These include my regular meetings with the three UK Agriculture Ministers, which have recently focused on various aspects of foot-and-mouth disease, including recovery measures. The Deputy Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning, Mr Alasdair Morrison, also hosted a meeting of UK Tourism Ministers in April, at which the main item for discussion was the impact of foot-and-mouth disease on the tourism industry, and the recovery measures which would be put in place, particularly those planned by the British Tourist Authority. In addition to these meetings, Executive officials have been keeping in regular contact with officials from the National Assembly for Wales on foot-and-mouth disease recovery issues.</p>

  <p>The Executive is working with VisitScotland to monitor the effectiveness of the actions put in place to assist the tourism industry to recover from the effects of foot-and-mouth disease. It is not, however, possible at this time to make the assessment requested and Mr Mundell will appreciate that tourist demand is affected by a number of factors. Much of the funding provided prior to 2 August was also used to alleviate immediate hardship.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive Health Department has not issued formal guidance to general practitioners regarding prescription of potassium supplements to elderly people taking diuretics on a long-term basis as this is essentially a clinical decision dependent on the specific diagnosis, the clinical condition of the patient, concurrent treatment or drug therapies and the clinical assessment of the patient by their general practitioner.</p>

  <p>General advice on the long-term use of potassium supplements for elderly people taking diuretics on a long-term basis, is provided by a number of authoritative bodies including the British National Formulary (BNF); Scottish Medicines Resource Centre (SMRC); the Audit Commission Report entitled <i>Supporting Prescribing in General</i> <i>Practice</i>, and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN) publication Number 35 on <i>Diagnosis and Treatment of Heart Failure due to Left Ventricular</i> <i>Systolic Dysfunction</i> and 49 on <i>Treatment of Hypertension in Older People</i>.</p>

  <p>The Students Awards Agency for Scotland is the only body within the Scottish Administration that currently utilises customer relationship management systems in delivering its online services. The agency has recently introduced facilities to allow students to track the progress of their application via its website. A basic support calculator and the ability to request duplicate award letters have also been introduced on the site. The agency is planning to introduce other web services in line with the Modernising Government initiative, including online applications, over the next 18 months.</p>

Public kiosks form part of this process and to this end the Executive, through the Modernising Government Fund, has provided funding to Dumfries and Galloway Council to undertake a pilot project centred around public access standalone kiosks.

A number of contracts have been awarded by participants in e-government initiatives, and a number of these initiatives and projects have been supported by the Executive through the Modernising Government Fund.

  <p>The number of higher specialist training posts available in Scotland is regularly adjusted to meet the projected number of new consultants needed to meet known and anticipated turnover and local service developments. In March 2001 the specialist registrar establishment for radiology was increased from 76 to 88, meaning that the total number of specialist training posts in radiology has risen by almost 16% in the last year.</p>

  <p>We will consider whether further posts should be part of the targeted increase of 375 junior doctors for future years which I announced on 2<sup> </sup>April 2001. As I announced on 20<sup> </sup>June, Professor John Temple is chairing the fundamental review of workforce planning which was a commitment in <i>Our National Health: A plan for</i> <i>action, a plan for change</i>. This review will consider the many complex areas surrounding the supply of trained doctors to NHSScotland.</p>

  <p>Information from ISD Scotland for 30<sup> </sup>of September 2000, which is the latest available, indicates that there were 16 consultant vacancies and no staff grade vacancies in the specialty of radiology, a reduction from 18 vacancies in the previous year. Vacancy data is collected for consultant and staff grades only. Information on waiting lists and waiting times for radiology is not currently available centrally, but we are testing how such information might be collected.</p>

  <p>A number of options were considered and closing the Stirling, Dundee and Forfar offices and centralising functions in a new building at Perth was the most attractive. As well as being most efficient from an operational point of view, it will save around &#163;100,000 in annual running costs, compared to not closing the Stirling office.</p>

  <p>Local Volunteer Development Agencies (LDVAs) were not funded under the Active Communities Initiative in 2000-01. I announced in June that &#163;300,000 would be made available in 2001-02 to engage the national network of LVDAs in delivering the Active Communities Initiative at local level across Scotland. I anticipate that each LVDA will receive some &#163;10,000. Active Communities Initiative funding for the network will increase to &#163;1 million in 2002-03, with each LVDA receiving some &#163;30,000. These sums are in addition to the &#163;31,500 that each LVDA already receives annually.</p>
