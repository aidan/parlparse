  <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service has advised that this information is not recorded. However, the Scottish Ambulance Service has a Memorandum of Understanding with the British Red Cross which sets out a framework for responding to major incidents and major public events.</p>

  <p>In addition, the British Red Cross supports the Scottish Ambulance Service in the provision of patient transport and as part of Community First Responder schemes. In respect of the latter role, all first responders have received training and have qualified as &quot;First Persons on Scene&quot;.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of reducing numbers of blood donors, what steps it has taken, or is taking, to ensure that NHS boards are encouraged to maximise autologous cell salvage use of blood and what audit arrangements are in place to ensure that the use of such cell salvage blood is maximised.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-07-22.S3W-14714.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80379" speakername="Shona Robison" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa0722.htm#2">

  <p>The optimal use of donated blood involves a balanced approach between carrying out only necessary transfusions and implementing blood use avoidance strategies. The Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service (SNBTS) has invested in a wide range of optimal blood use strategies, co-ordinated within the Better Blood Transfusion Programme (BBTP), to encourage delivery within and by NHS boards.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Clinical Transfusion Advisory Committee has considered cell salvage in some detail at meetings over the last 18 months. While acknowledging that perioperative cell salvage is an important part of the Better Blood Transfusion initiatives, it is likely to be applicable to a minority of blood recipients.</p>

  <p>SNBTS actively supports and encourages the use of intra-operative cell salvage (IOCS) and provides &pound;113,000 (recurring) funding for this purpose. Part of this allocation provides funding for a specialist practitioner in operating theatre blood conservation at NHS Lothian, who takes the national lead in Scotland on intra-operative blood matters. Over the past four years, several NHS boards have also used BBTP funds to purchase IOCS equipment.</p>

  <p>The UK Cell Salvage Action Group, which SNBTS is actively involved with, is in the process of establishing a national audit database for IOCS.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government remains committed to the establishment of Creative Scotland. In this context, I welcome the support of the Parliament for the principles of the Creative Scotland Bill. The government regrets, however, that the Parliament voted against the financial resolution relevant to the bill, causing the bill to fall. The government remains committed to introducing a bill to establish Creative Scotland, and will consult with the Parliament as appropriate as these plans develop.</p>

  <p>As I said in my statement to the Parliament on 18 June, public bodies will work in partnership to support the creative industries. That creative partnership will be represented in a creative industries forum.</p>

  <p>The forum will act as a catalyst, bringing together the public bodies involved in supporting the creative industries to make sure that services are effectively co-ordinated and to share intelligence in a way that will stimulate innovation. Its first task will be to develop a route map for creative entrepreneurs that shows how to best access those services, ensuring that these services are fit for purpose.</p>

  <p>Creative Scotland will continue to evolve complementary specialist advice and information services for creative enterprises.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many real-time closures of cod fishing grounds took place from October 2007 to June 2008; for how many days each such closure was in operation; how many Scottish fishing boats were affected, and which fishing grounds were the subject of such closures.</p>

  <p>To date a total of 14 Real-Time Area Closures have taken place, with each closure valid for a period of 21 days. It is difficult to predict how many vessels would have intended fishing in an area that was subsequently closed, though the closed areas, in total size, were relatively small, therefore minimising the effect on fishing vessels&rsquo; alternative fishing opportunities. Of the 14 closures, nine applied in ICES Sub-Area IVa (North Sea) and five applied in ICES Sub-Area Via (West of Scotland).</p>

  <p>BOC supplies oxygen to NHS community pharmacies in Scotland. Manufacturing problems at the French company which supplies BOC have been the cause of a temporary shortage of portable cylinders across the UK. This shortage has affected supplies of the Drug Tariff-listed DD cylinders available to community pharmacies across Scotland, and PD cylinders which require separate headsets have been issued to some patients over the past few months.</p>

  <p>We have been assured by BOC that the supply problems which led to this situation are easing. PD cylinders will be withdrawn as more of the integrated headset DD cylinders come on stream.</p>

  <p>The Clinical Change Governance Group within NHS 24 is responsible for reviewing published national clinical guidelines, and other government and health related documents and policies, in order to assess their impact on the organisation, including in the delivery of front-line clinical services.</p>

  <p>The Clinical Change Governance Group meets on a monthly basis to discuss clinical guidance published by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network.

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The information in this table has been extracted from the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service&rsquo;s Case Management Database. The database is a live, operational database used to manage the processing of reports submitted to procurators fiscal by the police and other reporting agencies. If a Procurator Fiscal amends a charge submitted by a reporting agency the database will record details only of the amended charge.</p>

  <p>2. The database is charge-based. The figures quoted therefore relate to the number of charges rather than the number of individuals charged or the number of incidents that gave rise to such charges.</p>

  <p>The government funds the Envirowise programme, which provides advice to business on how to reduce the amount of waste they produce <a href="http://www.envirowise.gov.uk/scotland" target="_blank">http://www.envirowise.gov.uk/scotland</a> . Other measures also help to reduce the amount of commercial waste sent to landfill including producer responsibility for certain materials, such as packaging, and the UK Government&rsquo;s Landfill Tax. As part of the forthcoming review of the National Waste Plan, the Scottish Government will consider what further steps can be taken to reduce the amount of commercial waste that is produced and landfilled. We are also planning to consult shortly on possible legislation on waste management with the aim of increasing waste prevention and recycling.</p>

  <p>The main financial penalty for commercial and other business that fail to reduce, reuse and recycle their waste is the landfill tax, which is the responsibility of the UK Government. We are planning to consult shortly on possible legislation on waste management with the aim of increasing waste prevention and recycling.</p>

  <p>Single outcome agreements (SOAs) for 2008-09 have been agreed with all 32 councils and should all now be publicly available.</p>

  <p>As councils were responsible for producing the SOAs and are responsible for the delivery of local services, questions regarding the content of individual SOAs should be directed to them in the first instance.</p>

  <p>All SOAs should reflect priorities and agreed outcomes, including waste outcomes, for each council and include relevant supporting indicators and targets.</p>
