  <p>The review of national child protection guidance aims to meet the needs of all Scotland&rsquo;s at-risk children, including those with disabilities. The review started its work in February 2009, and one of its two workstreams is taking forward a piece of work around the needs and rights of children with disabilities. The review will receive input on current research on the protection of children with disabilities. In addition, the Scottish Child Care and Protection Network (SCCPN), a national research network, is represented on the review group and helps to ensure that it is fully informed by relevant research.</p>

  <p>Local authority budget allocation spend is a matter for individual councils, and I would suggest that you contact the relevant Highlands and Islands local authorities to obtain this data.</p>

  <p>Highlands and Islands Enterprise has never run a &quot;business improvement tools&quot; programme as such, but has provided and continues to provide a range of support and advice services, where appropriate, to account managed businesses.</p>

  <p>Details of the services provided are an operational matter for Highlands and Islands Enterprise. I will ask its chief executive to write to you in this regard.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it plans to increase the number of schools that have an anonymised system of payment for school meals.</p>

  <p>The Schools (Health Promotion and Nutrition) (Scotland) Act 2007 places a legislative duty on local authorities to take reasonable steps to protect the identity of all pupils receiving free school lunches. Therefore, decisions on anonymised payment systems, or other forms of protecting identity, are taken by local authorities themselves.</p>

  <p>There is a range of research on this issue of which Scottish ministers are aware. Some highlights the importance of male role models in schools whereas other research suggests that the focus should be on attracting high quality and motivated people into teaching irrespective of their gender.</p>
