  <p>We would expect the central heating programme to go out to tender sometime in the next 18 months, subject to the recommendations by the Scottish Fuel Poverty Forum on the future shape of the programme.</p>

  <p>Tendering of the central heating programme was last undertaken in 2006. The contract was for two years, with the option of a further two extensions for up to 12 months each. The first extension is currently being used from April 2008 to March 2009.</p>

  <p>A joint policy statement on early years and early intervention was launched by Scottish ministers and COSLA on 18 March 2008.</p>

  <p>The work on developing the early years framework is now being taken forward by four task groups, each focusing their attention on one of the themes of the framework: building parenting and family capacity; creating communities that provide a supportive environment for children and families; delivering integrated services that meet the holistic needs of children and families, and developing a workforce to support the framework.</p>

  <p>The task groups are being chaired by:</p>

  <p>Val Cox, Depute Director, Workforce and Capacity Division, Scottish Government - Developing a workforce to support the framework;</p>

  <p>Martin Crewe, Director, Barnardo&rsquo;s Scotland - Creating communities that provide a supportive environment for children and families;</p>

  <p>Julia Swan, Director, Education Services, Falkirk Council - Delivering integrated services that meet the holistic needs of children and families, and</p>

  <p>Malcolm Wright, Chief Executive, NHS Education for Scotland - Building parenting and family capacity.</p>

  <p>The names of the members of the task groups and of the members of the programme board overseeing the framework are now available on <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/earlyyearsframework" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/earlyyearsframework</a>.</p>

  <p>The launch of the policy statement was followed by a short consultation on the tasks on which the task groups should focus. An updated list of tasks reflecting the views of respondents is also available on the website.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is aware of the recommendations made by the Sentencing Commission in August 2006, in particular that steps should be taken to introduce a procedure that gives effect to a system of sentencing guidelines.</p>

  <p>As set out in our manifesto, we believe that such a system would deliver more consistent and transparent sentencing and intend to set up a sentencing council to take this work forward. We plan to consult with key interests and stakeholders, especially the judiciary, on the issues around establishing such a body before coming forward with detailed proposals.</p>

  <p>Both recommendations relate to the disclosure of evidence in criminal proceedings by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) and the Scottish police.</p>

  <p>Recommendation 29 suggested that the police and COPFS should commit to a process of full disclosure in all solemn cases in connection with the implementation of High Court Reform in 2005.</p>

  <p>Recommendation 30 suggested that COPFS should consider a pilot for routine disclosure of a summary of the Crown case in summary cases.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to confirm that both recommendations have been implemented in full, Recommendation 29 was implemented in November 2004 when the then Lord Advocate Lord Boyd issued a Crown Practice Statement in relation to the disclosure of evidence by the Crown in High Court Cases.</p>

  <p>The Crown Practice Statement took full effect from 1 January 2005 and continues to apply to all High Court cases indicted on or after 1 April 2005 and was extended to all solemn cases from 1 September 2005.</p>

  <p>In relation to Recommendation 30, a successful pilot was conducted in Dumfries and Galloway in 2007 and the new process was rolled out nationally in September 2007 to support the Summary Justice Reform programme. All summary complaints now include a summary of evidence against the accused.</p>

  <p><em>Delivering for Remote and Rural Healthcare</em> will impact on all Rural General Hospitals (RGH) including Gilbert Bain Hospital by improving local access to a range of emergency, diagnostic and planned treatment services.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are responsible for planning and delivering services to meet the healthcare needs of their resident populations. Work is on-going to implement the recommendations contained within the report and boards are expected to deliver these objectives in accordance with Chief Executives Letter 23/2008 circulated on 13 May 2008.</p>

  <p>The number of physical attacks is not recorded.</p>

  <p>The arrangements for primary medical services are set out in regulations. These provide that practices may request the immediate removal of patients who commit an act of violence or behave in such a way that a person connected with the practice or present in the premises has feared for their safety. Removals for other reasons do not take effect immediately.</p>

  <p>The numbers of removals under the violence provisions since 1997 are as follows.</p>

  <p>I met Mrs Elizabeth Buggins last month, along with Chris Rudge, in his new role as National Clinical Director for Transplantation in England. The meeting gave me an opportunity to express my commitment to the implementation for Scotland of all the recommendations in the taskforce&rsquo;s first report.</p>

  <p>In order to ensure good communications, we agreed that Mr Rudge would, in his new role, attend meeting of the Scottish Transplant Group, since I have asked that group to take responsibility for implementation of the recommendations in Scotland. We also agreed to strengthen Scottish representation on the Taskforce through the appointment of a clinician, and a consultant in accident and emergency medicine at Ninewells Hospital, Dundee, has now been appointed.</p>

  <p>I indicated my personal support for opting out, but also my recognition of the complex issues it raises and the need for a change of this sort to be supported by evidence of its effectiveness. Mrs Buggins suggested that, while the taskforce was due to produce an interim report in the summer, a slightly longer timetable might prove necessary in order to produce a more finished document. I expressed support for that approach.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to tackling all forms of football related violence, abuse and disorder. Over the last year we have provided &pound;250,000 to support campaigns and organisations such as Show Racism the Red Card and Football for All as part of our work specifically targeted at tackling football related racist and sectarian behaviour.</p>

  <p>We are totally committed to working with football authorities, clubs and the police to ensure that bigotry, discrimination and antisocial behaviour does not ruin our national sport. Scottish ministers will meet the SFA, SPL, SFL, sportscotland and the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland on 5 June to review the impact of football related initiatives and agree how we can work together to ensure that all initiatives to tackle prejudice through football are properly targeted and will have the maximum impact.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to provide details on the actual time taken for graduates to repay as the majority of borrowers still have outstanding loans. However, a forecast of the average and median times to repay can be estimated using the student loan model. The model does not produce estimates on the precise number of days.</p>

  <p>The model estimates that the average and median times to repay are approximately 13.1 years and 12.7 years respectively.</p>
