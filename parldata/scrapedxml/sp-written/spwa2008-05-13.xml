  <p>Shona Robison: Almost &pound;25 million has been made available to NHS boards in 2008-09 specifically for tackling alcohol misuse. We have made it clear that first call on this funding is to implement screening for alcohol misuse and delivery of brief interventions where appropriate, in line with a new NHS target. Priority areas are primary care, emergency departments and antenatal care.</p>

  <p>Note: *Information provided by the Scottish Ambulance Service.</p>

  <p>Cathy Jamieson (Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley) (Lab): To ask the Scottish Executive when the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing last met the Scottish Ambulance Service to discuss the provision of ambulance services in Ayrshire and Arran.</p>

  <p>Shona Robison: The Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing met the board of the Scottish Ambulance Service on 30 January 2008. A range of issues were discussed.</p>

  <p>Cathy Jamieson (Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley) (Lab): To ask the Scottish Executive what its position is on any proposals by the Scottish Ambulance Service to withdraw double-crewed ambulances from service and replace them with rapid response vehicles staffed by a single paramedic.</p>

</ques>


<ques id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-05-13.S3W-12645.q4" nospeaker="True" spid="S3W-12645" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa0513.htm#2">

  <p>Shona Robison: The Scottish Government supports the work the Scottish Ambulance Service has undertaken to benchmark its operational practices against those adopted by other UK ambulance services. The greater use of rapid response vehicles represents the decision of the Scottish Ambulance Service board to adopt what is known as the &quot;front loaded model&quot;.</p>

  <p>We welcome the more recent improvements the ambulance service has made to the performance of the emergency service, particularly in relation to category A life threatening calls.</p>

  <p>Cathy Jamieson (Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley) (Lab): To ask the Scottish Executive what cost savings would be gained by replacing a double-crewed ambulance with a single-crewed rapid response vehicle.</p>

  <p>Shona Robison: The proposed adjustments to the emergency fleet mix will enable the Scottish Ambulance Service to deploy an extra 30 emergency vehicles across Scotland in 2008-09. Changes to the fleet mix are not about achieving savings, rather they will enable the service to further improve the responsiveness of the service it offers for those people who most need it.</p>

  <p>Jackson Carlaw (West of Scotland) (Con): To ask the Scottish Executive what mileage rate were payable to volunteer drivers who took patients to health-related appointments in each year since 1997 in (a) cash and (b) real terms and when these rates will be reviewed.</p>

  <p>Note: *Information provided by the Scottish Ambulance Service</p>

  <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service has recently reviewed the mileage allowance as part of its annual budget setting process and has no plans to increase the rate payable. However, the service was asked to look again at this matter, and have confirmed that they will now be reviewing the rates on a monthly basis to ensure that costs continue to be covered.</p>

  <p>We understand that some other NHS boards may use volunteer drivers and are aware that they also indirectly support initiatives involving community transport schemes. Information on mileage rates paid are not held centrally.</p>

  <p>Shona Robison: Volunteer ambulance car drivers are used to convey patients where the patient&rsquo;s medical condition impacts on their mobility to such an extent that they would be unable to access health care and/or it would be detrimental to the patient&rsquo;s condition or recovery to travel by other means.</p>

  <p>This would include people who have reduced mobility or frail health which renders them unable to travel by public transport, who do not have access to private transport, and who do not need the full service provided by a patient transport ambulance and crew.</p>

  <p>Local authorities are responsible for making free, local, money advice services available in a way appropriate to the needs of their area. The Scottish Government provides funding support through the local government settlement. The Scottish Government also part-funds National Debtline, the UK-wide telephone and e-mail service, to ensure that it can deliver debt advice which reflects specific Scottish differences, for example, in the legal system. We are supporting Citizens Advice Direct to extend its telephone and e-mail advice service, which includes debt advice, to cover the whole of Scotland.</p>

  <p>Shona Robison: The Scottish Government recognises the importance of promoting the health of those working in the public sector and the benefits for both the wellbeing of the individual and for improved efficiency and productivity for the employer.</p>

  <p>One hundred and forty-one NHS organisations and 28 local authorities already hold a Healthy Working Lives award or the predecessor Scotland&rsquo;s health at work (SHAW) award. The Scottish Government is currently working towards acquiring the gold healthy working lives award.</p>

  <p>The award programme is run by the Scottish Centre for Healthy Working Lives and is funded by the Scottish Government through NHS Health Scotland. The Centre&rsquo;s Healthy Working Lives advisers can provide employers with advice on good workplace policies that promote health and wellbeing, such as healthy eating, physical activity, tobacco cessation and mental wellbeing. The centre promotes the uptake of the award scheme widely across the public, private and third sectors.</p>

  <p>The Chief Executive of NHSScotland issued a letter to all NHS boards on 20 March 2008 (CEL 14 [2008]) on the role of the acute sector as a health promoting health service. Included in this is a requirement for all NHS board acute services to work towards acquiring a healthy working lives award, or a higher level of award where one is already held, as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>The <i>Better Health, Better Care: Action Plan </i>also sets out the Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring safe and health-promoting environments, and to ensuring that all NHS boards, both as employers and as service providers, adopt existing good practice in working with community planning partners and employability services to enable people to work in a health promoting environment, retain work if ill, or return to work from illness or injury.</p>

  <p>Shona Robison: The commissioning of NHS services such as pharmacist prescribing services is a matter for the NHS boards who are best placed to assess local service and patient needs. There are currently approximately 90 such pharmacist prescribing services in place in Scotland.</p>

  <p>NHS National Education for Scotland funds training for pharmacist prescribing through Robert Gordon and Strathclyde Universities. The first courses for pharmacist supplementary prescribers began in 2003. Since 2006, changes to legislation enable pharmacists to train as independent prescribers. Conversion courses have been provided to allow supplementary prescribers to develop and convert their prescribing skills to become independent prescribers.</p>

  <p>The following table shows the total number of pharmacists who have trained as supplementary and independent prescribers and the number of pharmacists who have successfully completed and are undertaking the conversion course.</p>

  <p>Adam Ingram: We have not set any targets for the use of fair trade products in school meals. As of 4 August 2008, under the Schools (Health Promotion and Nutrition) (Scotland) Act 2007, education authorities and managers of grant-aided schools will have a duty to have regard to guidance issued by Scottish ministers on the application of the principles of sustainable development when providing food or drink or catering services in schools.</p>

  <p>The existing guidance, <i>Integrating sustainable development into</i> <i>procurement of food and catering services</i>, is available on the Scottish Government website at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/Procurement/PublicProcurement/ProcurementPolicy/coporate-responsibility/Integrationofsusdevinfood" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/Procurement/PublicProcurement/ProcurementPolicy/coporate-responsibility/Integrationofsusdevinfood</a>.</p>

  <p>The guidance contains advice on various sustainable development issues, including fair trade, and how to pursue these various issues whilst staying within EU procurement law. We are currently refreshing the guidance and intend to reissue it during the summer.</p>

  <p>Maureen Watt: As indicated in the answer to question S3W-5517, our manifesto commitment was to match the previous Scottish Executive&rsquo;s planned school building programme brick for brick, by supporting the investment plans which were in place prior to the election. We have done that.</p>

  <p>Since last May we have honoured all the previous offers of financial support for school PPP projects made by the former administration. In addition, under the terms of the concordat signed with COSLA in November 2007, almost &pound;3 billion of capital resources is available to authorities over the three years from April 2008. That represents significant growth in the capital resources available to local authorities with an increase of &pound;115 million capital in 2008-09 alone, for investment in schools and other infrastructure.</p>

  <p>We anticipate that, with the funding we have put in place, authorities will be enabled, in the context both of new build and refurbishment and through a range of funding mechanisms, to complete or have under construction around 250 schools during the current parliamentary period.</p>

  <p>Fiona Hyslop: The Scottish Government has publicised details of the changes to the means test for higher education in a number of ways. These include:</p>

  <p>Full details of the changes are set out on the Scottish Government&rsquo;s website with an accompanying press release, dated 15 February 2008: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Education/Funding-Support-Grants/FFL/PMB/Completed" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Education/Funding-Support-Grants/FFL/PMB/Completed</a></p>

  <p>Details of the changes can also be found in the &quot;Notes section&quot; of the SAS3 application for support in 2008-09 as well as the SAS4 guide which is issued by SAAS to every student on receipt of their application for support.</p>

  <p>In February this year, SAAS wrote to all continuing students, their parents and spouses outlining details of the revised income assessment as well as all colleges, universities, Association of Scotland&rsquo;s Colleges, Universities Scotland and the National Union of Students.</p>

  <p>SAAS also carried out two workshops for colleges and universities earlier this year and have taken part in approximately 90 open days to schools, colleges and universities between October last year to date.</p>

  <p>Publicity will continue throughout the rest of this year in the run up to the new academic session in 2008-09. We plan to carry on the dissemination process at (approximately) another 80 events up to the end of September, including the UK National Association of Student Money Advisors event in July.</p>
