  <p>A high level, policy-based response to the UK Green Paper, <em>Shaping the Future of Care Together</em> , is being drafted by the Health and Community Care Delivery Group. The membership of this group includes the following organisations: COSLA, Association of Directors of Social Work, City of Edinburgh Council, Perth and Kinross Council, NHS Dumfries and Galloway, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, NHS Lanarkshire, NHS Lothian, NHS Health Scotland and the Care Commission. The draft response will be signed off jointly by Scottish ministers and COSLA.</p>

  <p>The UK Department of Health has an extensive interactive consultation running on a dedicated website. Any individual or interest group in the UK can post comments and responses to the consultation up until it closes on the 13 November. I understand that Scottish voluntary organisations are fully aware of the paper and that some of them may be responding to the consultation.</p>

  <p>The Energy Assistance Package is a holistic approach to tackling fuel poverty that addresses both the home and householder and includes services to maximise income, reduce fuel bills and improve energy efficiency. Stage 4 of the package offers a menu of enhanced physical measures to groups most likely to be fuel poor including central heating.</p>

  <p>Applications referred to Stage 4 of the Energy Assistance Package are considered for heating installations, but it may be appropriate to undertake other measures. Heating systems installed through Stage 4 are given in the following table.</p>

  <p>The majority of eligible applicants in Dumfries and Galloway have been waiting for no more than three months, although some have been waiting longer. There may be several reasons for a delay in installation, other than simple pressures of demand, such as the need for improvements to the existing infrastructure, particularly where customers request a change in fuel.</p>

Stage 4 of the package offers a menu of enhanced physical measures to groups most likely to be fuel poor including central heating.</p>

  <p>In 2008-09 the managing agent reduced the average waiting time from application to installation on the central heating programme, from six months to five months, with particular priority given to those households who have waited longest. The Scottish Government continues to press the to do all it can to ensure waiting times are kept to a minimum on the EAP.</p>

Stage 4 of the package offers a menu of enhanced physical measures to groups most likely to be fuel poor including central heating.</p>

  <p>As a new package, it would be premature to expect many Stage 4 installations to have been completed by this point in the year. However, work is on-going to stimulate demand. Recent marketing activities have already increased the rate of enquiries, including applications from households who have then been referred to Stage 4 of the Package.</p>

Stage 4 of the package offers a menu of enhanced physical measures to groups most likely to be fuel poor including central heating.</p>

  <p>The programme of installations under Stage 4 of the Energy Assistance Package is progressing, but work is also continuing to complete the installations that are a legacy of the central heating programme. The total number of installations for the year up to 30 September is 4,225. Any comparison of total annual figures should await the end of the first year of the programme.</p>

  <p>Borrowing undertaken by each local authority in support of its capital works is reflected by that authority in a separate statutory fund - the loans fund. The level of debt recorded by the loans fund is the value that must be charged to services over a number of years. The total loans fund debt outstanding for all Scottish local authorities as at 31 March 2008 (the most recent date for which information provided by authorities is available centrally) was just over &pound;9.5 billion.</p>

  <p>Local authorities are able to determine the repayment periods for borrowing undertaken to support capital expenditure within maximum limits set by ministers.

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s public sector pay policies for staff pay remits and for senior appointments are revised annually. The 2009-10 pay policies were published in May 2009. The staff policy applies to pay settlements with effective dates from 1 May 2009 to 30 April 2010 inclusive and the senior appointments applies from 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2010 inclusive.</p>

  <p>Consideration of the public sector pay policies for 2010-11 will be undertaken in time to enable publication in spring 2010.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has regard to a wide range of factors when reviewing its public sector pay policies, including, for example, the prevailing economic and financial climate, the UK Government&rsquo;s pay policies and proposals, feedback from questionnaires and seminars with stakeholders, the views of the main unions, and comments from the Public Sector Pay Implementation Working Group.</p>

  <p>In 2010-11 we face the tightest financial settlement provided to any Scottish Administration and this is likely to be the first of several years of severely constrained resources. It is more vital than ever to ensure that limited resources are used prudently and effectively. We will continue to ensure that public sector pay policy is right for public bodies and right for Scotland, and works towards our Purpose of increasing sustainable growth.</p>
