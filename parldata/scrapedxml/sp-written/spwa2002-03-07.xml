  <p>Access to higher bandwidth telecoms services is already available across central Scotland by means of leased lines. Access to services such as ADSL and cable-modem currently stands at about 43% population coverage in central Scotland (taking Central, Fife, Lothian and Strathclyde together). In addition, broadband fixed wireless access licences are expected to be available shortly in Scotland, while trials of satellite ADSL-level services are also taking place.</p>

  <p>Further roll-out of higher bandwidth services in central Scotland will be a commercial matter for the providers and will depend upon demand. The Executive is working with the enterprise agencies to develop a Scottish programme of demand stimulation measures under the DTI fund for innovative uses of broadband.</p>

  <p>Finally, the Executive is taking forward aggregated public sector procurement in the Highlands and Islands and the south of Scotland as a means of extending broadband access in those areas. The Executive will consider the need for and timing of the roll out of this approach more widely across Scotland, taking into account progress in pathfinder areas and the extent that operation of the market is increasing access to broadband services.</p>

  <p>Protecting our communities from drug-related anti-social and criminal behaviour is one of the four pillars of our drugs strategy, along with helping young people, treating those affected by drug misuse, and stifling the availability of drugs. Through Scotland Against Drugs' Challenge Fund and Community Fund, the Executive is supporting a wide range of diverse and innovative projects designed to address local drugs problems. Along with the <em>Daily Record</em> , we have recently launched the Scottish Communities Against Drugs initiative.</p>

  <p>Progress in delivering our strategy is set out in our Annual Report, which was published in November. Copies were sent to all MSPs, and the report is also available in the Parliament's Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>The National Grid for Learning (NGfL) programme in Scotland aims to deliver the infrastructure, learning material and training to ensure that all pupils and teachers have access to modern ICT facilities in order to develop their skills. Between 1999 and 2002, the Scottish Executive has invested more than &#163;90 million in the programme. A report on progress on the NGfL was published in August 2001 and can be found at:</p>

  <p>http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library3/education/nglr-00.asp.</p>

  <p>The Executive has worked with the New Opportunities Fund (NOF) to maximise the impact of the NOF's &#163;23 million programme to offer ICT training to all teachers and school librarians in Scotland. This programme is helping to make sure that staff are encouraging pupils to use ICT skills throughout the curriculum.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the Executive has issued revised national 5-14 guidelines for ICT. The guidelines and associated guides for teachers and managers provide advice and assistance to education authorities and schools in developing pupils' skills, knowledge and informed attitudes to ICT.</p>

  <p>Evidence of harm would be considered "credible" if that evidence had the support of the scientific advisers to ministers. Dependent upon the nature of the evidence highlighted, that advice could come from the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment, the Health &amp; Safety Executive, the Food Standards Agency or Scottish Natural Heritage.

  <p>In relation to the proposed site near Newport-on-Tay, the Executive has undertaken a number of measures in addition to the statutory notice which the applicant placed in the <em>Courier</em> on 7 February. The Executive has written directly to Fife Council, local elected representatives, community councils, national beekeeping and organic interests and the National Farmers Union. An information leaflet has been prepared and distributed widely including local libraries and post offices. Officials from the Executive have visited neighbouring properties to the proposed site to discuss any issues of concern to residents.</p>

  <p>In addition, I addressed a well-attended public information meeting in Newport-on-Tay on 4 March.

  <p>The prime responsibility for ensuring that guidance is implemented and complied with lies with NHS organisations. Where necessary, organisations which provide guidance also monitor compliance. Examples include the work of the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland in monitoring and reporting on performance against standards developed by the board.

  <p>The report of the Glasgow street homelessness review team recommended that the city's large-scale hostels be closed over time. Glasgow City Council and its partners have established a Planning and Implementation Group to take forward the recommendations of the report in a way which will ensure that appropriate accommodation and services are in place before hostels are closed. The Executive is making <strong></strong> &#163;12.5 million available over three years to 2003-04 to assist the de-commissioning process. This will include the provision of a range of alternative accommodation options, depending on the needs of individuals.</p>

  <p>There is no recognised Scottish governing body for horse racing. Consequently, no approach has been made to <strong></strong> sportscotland for the recognition of horse racing as a sport. Horse racing has not been identified separately in the Executive's tourism strategy, although individual race courses feature in the promotional activity of relevant area tourist boards.</p>

  <p>I welcome this opportunity to confirm that UK ratification of the Kyoto Protocol was today announced in the House of Commons by Margaret Beckett. This confirms the UK commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and its continuing leading role in international efforts to tackle the threat of climate change.</p>

  <p>Part 1 of the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill provides rights of responsible access to land and inland <em></em> water for recreation and passage. A person will be presumed to be exercising access rights responsibly if they do not interfere unreasonably with the rights of others. <strong></strong> There is no reason why the responsible exercise of access rights at night should impact unreasonably on the lives of those who live and work in isolated situations. The bill does not distinguish, therefore, between daylight hours and the hours of darkness. However, when access outside daylight hours would create problems in a particular local situation, section 11(1)(d) of the bill provides that <strong></strong> local authorities may, <strong></strong> by order, restrict the responsible exercise of access rights over a particular area of land during the hours of darkness.</p>

  <p>Section 9 (2)(a) of the bill excludes commercial activities from access rights created under the bill. Commercial businesses currently access private land only <strong></strong> with the express or implied consent of the owner. When the legislation comes into force there will be no change in the way in which existing or new businesses operate. Guidance on access for commercial activities, including when the express agreement of the landowner should be sought, will be set out in the Scottish Outdoor Access Code. The code will also provide guidance for landowners in respect of access to their land for commercial activities.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-22140 by Malcolm Chisholm on 11 February 2002 on the fall in the number of cases of negligence against the NHS in Scotland, whether the increase in the budgetary provision for such claims from &#163;3.5 million in 1999-2000 to &#163;6.5 million in 2000-01 was necessary.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-03-07.50.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80140" speakername="Malcolm Chisholm" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0307.htm#28">

  <p>The figures of &#163;3.5 million and &#163;6.5 million are the actual value of negligence cases settled against the NHS in 1999-2000 and 2000-01, respectively. The cost of settlements has remained relatively constant over the last four years with an average of &#163;4.6 million per annum. The increase in 2000-2001 is explained in part by one large settlement of &#163;1.7 million.</p>

  <p>While the value of cases increased in 2000-01 this has to be viewed in the context of total NHS spend of &#163;5.5 billion. There is no evidence that this represents a permanent upward shift.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive made &#163;90 million of additional funding available on 19 September 2001. The distribution of these funds to NHSScotland resulted in all operational cumulative deficits as at 31 March 2001 being eliminated providing a clean slate for the new NHS boards.</p>

  <p>As on all other matters, the Scottish Executive seeks legal advice as and when necessary and acts on it appropriately. Planning matters in Scotland are devolved. In addition, powers conferred by section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 have been executively devolved to Scottish ministers. Any application to build an electricity generating station in Scotland therefore requires the consent of the Scottish ministers; several such applications are currently under consideration.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-22137 by Malcolm Chisholm on 11 February 2002, whether the increase in agency nursing and recharge staff costs has contributed to the North Glasgow University Hospitals NHS Trust's deficit of &#163;9.5 million and whether such an increase in costs indicates that the trust is not meeting the guidance issued by Audit Scotland on the employment of agency and bank nursing staff.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-03-07.57.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80140" speakername="Malcolm Chisholm" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0307.htm#1">

  <p>The &#163;13.5 million for agency and recharged costs shown in the 2000-01 Annual Report, arose as a result of a change in accounting methodology. Had a consistent approach between 1999-2000 and 2000-01 been maintained, the reported increase would have amounted to around &#163;700,000. This represents under 0.2% of the annual budget for North Glasgow University NHS Trust and is likely to have had a minor effect on the amount of the trust deficit.</p>

  <p>All NHSScotland trusts and island health boards have been reminded they should use the recommendations in the Accounts Commission Report when considering employing a bank or agency nurse.

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>A model grievance procedure is contained within the terms and conditions of service for teachers. It is the responsibility of individual education authorities to determine the composition of panels established to consider grievances against teachers under that model. Information on the composition of such panels is not held centrally. The Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers has established a working group to review disciplinary and grievance procedures.</p>

  <p>Distribution of the grant takes into account the estimated number of appliances arising in each local authority area as estimated in the Executive's reply to parliamentary question S1W-19533 on 13 November 2001, and is based on an amount of &#163;30 per appliance. I intend that the grant will be payable to authorities under a new Financial Assistance Order which is due to come into force on 26 March 2002.</p>

  <p>I am also aware that authorities will have to meet additional costs in 2002-03. I can therefore announce that the Executive will continue to provide additional assistance but, as for this year, I shall wish to review the costs to the authorities, bearing in mind developments in the storage and treatment market. In particular, I would expect the costs of storage and treatment to reduce substantially as treatment capacity expands and, I would hope, becomes available more locally, providing increased investment and employment opportunities.</p>

  <p>I shall announce the actual level of support for next year at a later date.</p>

  <p>Measures to reduce water consumption include informing water authorities that applications for new Water Orders or amendments to existing Water Orders for the abstraction of water for public water supplies will not be approved unless they can demonstrate that they have achieved the economic level of leakage. Other measures include encouraging the water authorities to undertake joint publicity campaigns to promote water efficiency among customers. They are also required to carry out efficiency audits of their own operations with the proviso that nothing done should compromise public health and that full use should be made of the Welfare to Work scheme to provide an inspection/leakage repair service.</p>
