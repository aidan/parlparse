  <p>The Scottish Executive supports a range of measures to tackle young people&#8217;s drinking. Alcohol education in schools is an integral part of health education and personal and social development. This ensures that information about alcohol is given as part of a programme aimed at helping young people develop sound lifestyle choices and healthy living. We are also continuing to provide funding for agencies including the Health Education Board for Scotland, Alcohol Focus Scotland and DrinkWise who provide a range of information and advice on the dangers of under-age and excessive drinking and undertake a wide variety of preventative activities with schools and youth and community groups.</p>

  <p>The Executive is currently developing a national plan for action on alcohol misuse. The need to address young people&#8217;s drinking has emerged strongly during the Executive&#8217;s consultation on the plan.</p>

  <p>The principal reporter is required by the Children&#8217;s (Scotland) Act 1995 to investigate each report. Action can and frequently does occur without a children&#8217;s hearing being necessary. A child will be referred to a hearing only where supervision on a compulsory basis appears necessary.</p>

  <p>Information about the progress of reports is a matter for the Scottish Children&#8217;s Reporter Administration. The information requested is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Children&#8217;s Reporter Administration (SCRA) was established in 1996 to ensure a consistent approach by reporter staff is achieved.</p>

  <p>I have asked the principal reporter and his response is:</p>

  <p>&quot;SCRA have placed particular emphasis on the need to share casework information amongst professional staff and several initiatives have been launched to improve the quality of such communication with the ultimate objective of improving consistency.</p>

  <p>SCRA&#8217;s internal practice guidance notes give direction on the standards of service expected. The introduction of a casework investigation framework has also promoted further standardisation.</p>

  <p>Overall patterns of decision making by reporters are influenced by significant local variations in levels of need, referral practice by other agencies and the type and range of resources to work with children and families.&quot;</p>

  <p>As noted by the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee report following its inquiry into the new economy, the Scottish Executive has already taken significant steps to address issues connected to the new economy in Scotland. Today I am issuing the Executive&#8217;s response to that report.</p>

  <p>One of the key issues highlighted by the report is telecommunications infrastructure across Scotland. The Executive has identified this as a priority issue and I am today announcing our strategy for making broadband connections more pervasive and affordable.</p>

  <p>Copies of both the Executive response and the broadband strategy are available on the Scottish Executive website. Copies have also been placed in the Parliament&#8217;s reference centre.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many GPs (a) retired, (b) resigned and (c) took up post in each of the last five years in each health board area.</p>

  <p>Robust information on the numbers of GPs who retire or resign is not available as many do not supply a reason for leaving. Table 1 shows the numbers of GPs, by health board area, who ceased to practise as GP principals in each of the last five years. Table 2 shows the numbers of GPs who took up post over the same period. A direct comparison between tables 1 and 2 does not take full account of the impact of the increasing move into salaried general practice. For example, of the 29 salaried GPs currently employed under the personal medical services scheme in Scotland, 28 were previously employed as GP principals. Although they are recorded (in Table 1) as having ceased to practise as principals they are still providing GP services.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has regular discussions with NHS bodies about a range of issues, including winter planning. Discussions about winter planning have covered arrangements for flu immunisation; the role of social services and of primary care organisations in treating and caring for people at home; the importance of effective joint working between the NHS and local authorities; the need to reduce the number of patients waiting for discharge from hospital; the importance of adequate capacity in hospital critical care and high dependency units, and staff recruitment and retention.</p>

  <p>Health boards have provided draft winter plans to the Scottish Executive health department and these are being reviewed.</p>

  <p>Health boards were notified of their annual financial allocation for 2001-02 before the beginning of the financial year. Total resources across Scotland are up 8.1 per cent on last year. Boards are expected to plan and manage the provision of health services, including responding to winter and reducing the number of patients waiting for discharge, within their overall allocation.</p>

  <p>In June of last year, I announced an additional &#163;60 million for health boards to help address key priorities, including work on winter preparations and delayed discharges. This additional allocation has been built into health boards&#8217; allocations for the current and future years.</p>

  <p>We have emphasised to local planning partners the importance of working together to tackle this issue, for the benefit of people living in their areas. Examples of local strategies which have been shown to work include joint rapid response teams to avoid inappropriate hospital admissions and joint supported discharge teams.</p>

  <p>At a Scottish level, the quarterly census of patients waiting for discharge provides accurate and consistent information about trends and reasons for waiting; this allows local planning partners to direct efforts at reducing delays. Additionally, we hold discussions with NHS organisations and local authorities about joint planning and working and are taking forward implementation of the recommendations of the joint future group. Other actions are under discussion with the NHS and local authorities.</p>

  <p>National planning policy guideline (NPPG) 5: archaeology and planning acknowledges that some development which is permitted development may give rise to a real and specific threat to a scheduled monument or other significant archaeological site, or their setting. It goes on to say that in such cases planning authorities may wish to consider the use of their powers under article 4 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Scotland) Order 1992 to withdraw particular permitted development rights.</p>

  <p>We have no plans to revise or augment these arrangements or guidance.</p>

  <p>The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Scotland) Amendment (No. 2) Order 2001 (Scottish Statutory Instrument 2001/266) revoked and replaced the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Scotland) Amendment Order 2001 (SSI 2001/244) and specified a transitional arrangement applying to development started before it came into force.</p>

  <p>The transitional arrangement allows development under permitted development rights started before 23 July and completed within 14 days of that date to benefit from the permitted development rights which were in place prior to the new tighter controls coming into force. If such development is not completed within that timescale, any development carried out on or after 23 July will be subject to the planning controls which came into force on that date.</p>

  <p>The new planning legislation does not provide for an extension to the 14-day period described in the transitional arrangement, which runs consecutively without interruption. Enforcement action in relation to any breaches of planning control will be a matter for the planning authority to consider.</p>

  <p>The Independent Advisory Committee on Business Appointments advises on the business appointment rules for crown servants. The chief executive of the West of Scotland Water Authority is not a crown servant. The post is therefore not covered by the business appointment rules for crown servants. His appointment is subject to ministerial approval but not all such appointments are bound by the business appointment rules.</p>

  <p>It is for an individual public body, as an employer, to determine the precise terms and conditions for its staff. The Executive is currently reviewing the framework for issuing guidance to public bodies following the public bodies review to ensure consistency in approach. This will cover a wide range of issues, including staff issues.</p>
