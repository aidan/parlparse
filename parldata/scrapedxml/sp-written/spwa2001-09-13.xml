  <p>I have asked the Forestry Commission to invite different groups with an interest in the social, economic and environmental benefits of forestry, to participate in a Scottish forestry forum. Key tasks of the forum will be to promote discussion about how to maximise the social, economic and environmental benefits of forestry in Scotland; to consider how Scottish forestry can best contribute to the wider rural development agenda in Scotland, and to ensure that successful progress is made in taking forward the Scottish forestry strategy. The forum will also have a role in disseminating information about implementation of the strategy; identifying areas where more effort is needed, and, when the time comes in three or four years time, assisting with the review of the strategy. The forum will probably meet about once a year and it will be supported by a steering group that will meet more frequently.</p>

  <p>From this year, lone parents in full-time higher education will be able to claim a grant of &#163;1,000 per year to help them meet their formal child care costs. This is the first ever child care grant for students in higher education in Scotland and is expected to benefit 3,500 lone parent students each year. These students will continue to be eligible to receive the existing dependants&#8217; grant and the new school meals grant, also being introduced this year.</p>

  <p>In addition, as part of the new package of student support introduced for full-time higher education students this year, new mature students will be able to access a discretionary grant of up to &#163;2,000 from the Mature Students&#8217; Bursary Fund through their college or university. Priority for payments from the fund will be given to students who have formal child care needs, particularly those who are lone parents.</p>

  <p>&#163;7.5 million has also been allocated over the next three years to widen child care provision in Scottish further education colleges to meet locally-identified needs, particularly those of lone parents. This is expected to help between 3,000 and 5,000 full- and part-time students annually and to ensure that further education is genuinely accessible to all. This funding is in addition to the existing &#163;3 million per annum support for the study-related child care costs of FE students.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s 21st century government agenda is a citizen focussed approach aimed at providing better public services for everyone, in ways that meet the needs of users not the providers. Our efforts are geared towards benefiting all sectors of the population, regardless of age, background, status or location, and to including those most at risk of social exclusion. Key aims are to improve the accessibility and the responsiveness of services.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is supporting the development of a multi-channel approach, including iDTV, internet and WAP and recognises that the telephone remains the most popular communication route for most purposes.</p>

  <p>The Executive has already provided &#163;26 million in direct support through the modernising government fund for more than 30 projects across Scotland which involve innovative ways of improving access to public services, including for example kiosks, one-stop shops and call centres. The potential contribution to social inclusion was one important criterion used in deciding which projects were successful in gaining funding.</p>

  <p>Following the launch of a UK antimicrobial resistance strategy last year, the Executive issued publicity materials to increase awareness of this issue. These included posters and leaflets, which were circulated widely to GP practices, dental practitioners and pharmacists to help bring the issue to the attention of the general public. At that time, the Executive also issued a draft action plan for Scotland, covering issues such as surveillance, prudent antimicrobial use in human, animal and agricultural practice, and infection control. This document is currently being reviewed in the light of comments received, and a final version will be issued to a wide range of interests later this year.</p>

  <p>A sub-group of the Advisory Group on Infection produced proposals for the surveillance of hospital acquired infection (HAI) in Scotland. These formed the basis for the national surveillance system for Scotland, which was announced on 6 August. Proposals for the surveillance of antimicrobial resistance patterns will follow later this year. The Executive is working with other UK Departments to take forward plans to tackle the issue of antimicrobial use in the animal field.</p>

  <p>The Chief Scientist Office (CSO) is currently funding five research projects with a total value of &#163;452,226 into the resistance of bacteria to antibiotics.</p>

  <p>The draft Land Reform (Scotland) Bill places no limit on the number of land registrations which can be made by community bodies.</p>

  <p>The new opportunities fund&#8217;s Scottish land fund is one possible source of funding for community land purchases. Any future allocations beyond the land fund&#8217;s current &#163;10 million budget can be considered in the light of experience of its operation.</p>

  <p>The health department&#8217;s publication &quot;Immunisation against Infectious Disease 1996&quot;, states that MMR vaccine should be given irrespective of a history of measles, mumps or rubella infection.

  <p>It also advises that children with untreated cancer or diseases of the immune system, those receiving immunosuppressive therapy or high dose steroids should not have live viral vaccines, i.e. MMR or single vaccines.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is responsible for the maintenance for 94 Gatso and 45 loop or subsurface sensor type speed camera sites on the trunk road network in the following police force areas:</p>

  <p>The police have been supplied with cameras for both types of site. The Executive pays only for the maintenance of 21 cameras for Gatso sites held by Tayside, Grampian and Lothian &amp; BORDERs police. The Executive does not meet the cost of maintaining any cameras for the sub-surface sensor sites.</p>

  <p>The cost paid by the Executive to maintain these cameras and sites in 2000-01 was &#163;20,040. The cost of operating them is met by the police.</p>

  <p>In addition to these sites and cameras on the trunk road network, local authorities and police forces have cameras and camera sites on local roads.</p>

  <p>Figures are not held for fixed penalties and fine income generated by camera locations on the trunk road network alone. However, across Scotland in 1999, an estimated 51,000 police conditional offers were made for speeding offences which had been automatically detected, of which an estimated 83 per cent were paid, (approximating to &#163;1,705,000). Figures for 2000 are not yet available.</p>

  <p>Local authorities retain a 10 per cent handling charge for fixed penalty notices, the remainder being remitted to the Treasury. In Glasgow, a pilot scheme allows the police and local authority to retain money raised through fixed penalties to fund additional enforcement activity.</p>

  <p>The adjustments to the transport programme, which are to fund other Executive priorities, are set out in the table. The SPT adjustment will bring provision in line with payments due under the franchise and is not expected to affect operations and services. I am also confident that the small reductions made to the roads programme and on the Integrated Transport Fund will not have a significant impact on the delivery of our transport priorities. The additional funding will be used to fund a pilot scheme for child pedestrian training and to assist with modernisation of the road haulage industry. Funding will be allocated to schemes across Scotland and is not broken down by local authority area.</p>

  <p>The statement of 28 June committed &#163;5 million for key priorities across the transport programme. We propose to allocate &#163;25,000 of this money in the current year, and a further &#163;200,000 in 2003-04 to a pilot child pedestrian training scheme. No decisions have yet been taken on which areas will participate in the pilot projects.</p>

  <p>Together with the United Kingdom Government and the other devolved administrations we are launching a public consultation which will lead to decisions on a long-term management strategy for radioactive waste. An initial consultation document, &quot;Managing Radioactive Waste Safely&quot;, seeks views on how to promote public debate, on a proposed programme for reaching decisions and on the form of an independent advisory body.</p>

  <p>I am arranging for copies of the consultation document to be placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre. The document may also be obtained from:</p>
