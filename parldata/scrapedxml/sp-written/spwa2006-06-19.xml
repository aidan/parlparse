  <p>Scottish Executive funding to tackle antisocial behaviour has been made available to local councils on behalf of their Community Planning Partnerships since 2004. We do not hold records centrally on locally funded initiatives prior to that date. Funds were allocated to local authority areas as a whole and it is therefore not possible to identify resources allocated specifically to the Dumbarton parliamentary constituency.</p>

  <p>Argyll and Bute Council was allocated &pound;184,000 in 2004-05 and &pound;204,700 in 2005-06. This supported the following services:</p>

  <p>community wardens;</p>

  <p>an antisocial behaviour coordinator;</p>

  <p>provision of witness support services;</p>

  <p>extending mediation services;</p>

  <p>surveillance equipment to record incidences of antisocial behaviour;</p>

  <p>community consultation on the antisocial behaviour strategy, and</p>

  <p>collection of data and monitoring and evaluation.</p>

  <p>In addition, Argyll and Bute Council were awarded &pound;26,600 for 2004-06 to support provision of services to respond to antisocial noise.</p>

  <p>West Dunbartonshire Council was allocated &pound;1,364,000 in 2004-05 and &pound;1,513,550 in 2005-06. This supported the following services:</p>

  <p>community wardens;</p>

  <p>an antisocial behaviour coordinator;</p>

  <p>extending mediation services;</p>

  <p>intensive supervision of perpetrators of antisocial behaviour;</p>

  <p>support for witnesses and victims;</p>

  <p>Local authorities currently provide free personal care to elderly people who have been assessed as requiring it.

  <p>This year (2006-07), Childcare Strategy Grant Aided Expenditure of &pound;44.256 million has been allocated to local authorities. It is for each local authority, in conjunction with the local Childcare Partnership, to decide how best to allocate this funding at the local level.</p>

  <p>In 2003, the Executive published <em>School&rsquo;s Out &ndash; Framework for the Development of Out of School Care </em><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2003/02/16322/17791" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2003/02/16322/17791</a>.</p>

  <p>This publication includes at Section 11, sustainability and looks at the various models used for delivering out of school care. The Executive also commissioned a report <em>Management Models and Business Planning:</em></p>

  <p>This provides information on possible ways to tackle sustainability issues in Out of School Care.</p>

  <p>The Executive core funds the Scottish Out-of-School Care Network (SOSCN). SOSCN provides information, advice, direct support and training to out-of-school providers across Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Tax Credits system and child care vouchers provide support for parents with child care costs. These are both the responsibility of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and are reserved matters.</p>

  <p>The figures in the table are taken from the Childcare Strategy GAE (Grant Aided Expenditure) line and is provision to spend. It should be noted that these figures are not budgets or spending targets but part of the more complex local government funding formula used to allocate one block grant figure to each council. It is up to each council to decide how best to allocate their resources based on their local needs and priorities.</p>

  <p>In addition to Childcare Strategy funding, West Dunbartonshire has been allocated Working for Families Funding (WfFF) of &pound;600,000 each year since 2004-05. WfFF can be used for a number of projects, including creating and subsidising child care.</p>

  <p>The numbers of jobs located outside Edinburgh associated with each relocation of staff in each Executive department, agency and non-departmental public body are set out in a table on the Executive&rsquo;s website. This can be accessed through the following link:</p>

  <p>Although many relocation projects will include a number of newly-created jobs, the majority of newly-created jobs will be associated with newly created organisations. These include, in particular: Food Standards Agency, Public Guardian&rsquo;s Office, Scottish Social Services Council, Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care Headquarters, Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator, Mental Health Tribunal Service, Scottish Building Standards Agency and the Risk Management Authority.</p>

  <p>Changes to the arrangements for quota management in Scotland are being considered jointly with the other three fisheries administrations and with stakeholders under the Quota Management Change Programme, which commenced in April 2005. No decisions have yet been taken on the specific changes needed. Final decisions on any changes to the current quota management system will only be taken after full consultation with industry, but, at this stage, we are not necessarily convinced that a full blown ITQ system would benefit the industry as a whole.</p>

  <p>An industry Consultative Group met on the 29 March 2006 where Fisheries Administrations&rsquo; current thinking on the central components for the new system were discussed. We will continue to work closely with Scottish stakeholders to ensure that any changes to the UK wide quota management system are appropriate for the Scottish industry.</p>

The group&rsquo;s report, published on 8 October 2004, makes 14 recommendations impacting on a number of different areas including the criminal justice system, the education curriculum, new legislation and media reporting. Careful consideration has been given to all of the recommendations made by the working group and a formal response to their report, including an update on progress against each of the recommendations, will be issued in the near future.

  <p>A number of the recommendations made by the Working Group have resulted in action being taken. For example, since 1 April this year the Vulnerable Witnesses (Scotland) Act 2004 has offered the possibility that some of those at risk from hate crime may benefit from special measures and other provisions designed to help vulnerable witnesses who may be in fear or distress in connection with giving evidence to give the best evidence they can. The act currently applies to vulnerable adults and children where cases are being heard in the High Court or in solemn proceedings in the sheriff court including Children&rsquo;s Hearings Court Proceedings.

  <p>The information available is provided in a document titled NHSScotland: Elective Inpatient Day Case Episodes and New Outpatient Attendances 1989-90 to 2005-06, a copy of which has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib number 39861).</p>

  <p>Please note that the out-patient information system (SMR00) started from 1 April 1991 so no earlier figures are available.</p>

  <p>The data are broken down by NHS board of residence. The elective hospital admissions are shown for acute specialties only (defined as non-obstetric/non-psychiatric specialties). The new out-patient data covers consultant-led clinics and are shown separately for acute specialties and for all specialties and for GP referrals and all referrals.</p>

  <p>In interpreting these data, it should be noted that they reflect, amongst other things, changes in medical technology, clinical practice, service redesign and the desire to provide care in the most appropriate setting by whoever is the most appropriate health professional. Many procedures carried out on an in-patient/day case basis in 1990 are now provided in an out-patient setting and very often are done at a return appointment so are not included in the figures provided. In addition to hospital premises, care is increasingly provided in community settings, by General Practitioners (GPs), nurses and Allied Health Professionals (AHPs). The focus on health care redesign has also meant that more innovative ways of providing care have been introduced and, for example, telephone consultations and/or the use of telemedicine for the follow-up of appropriate patients may provide a more responsive service to the patient but are not counted for national activity purposes.</p>

  <p>It should also be noted that the out-patient information system (SMR00) has developed over time in the terms of the specialties included.</p>

  <p>I am not aware of any studies into the expected incidence of mesothelioma broken down by island, rural or urban communities in Scotland.</p>

  <p>However, the Health and Safety Executive have conducted a study into expected mortality from mesothelioma in Great Britain that was published in the British Journal of Cancer in 2005.

  <p>Historic Scotland, a Scottish Executive agency, sought to recognise the historic merit of the Government Buildings (former Textile College) in Galashiels by listing the property as a building of special architectural and historic interest in 2004. In doing this, they took the exceptional step of listing in the face of a live planning application, against stated policy. Ensuing action by Tesco Supermarket saw the listing reduced by the Court of Session in June 2004.</p>

  <p>In the absence of statutory protection Historic Scotland no longer has any formal locus in the case or remit under planning law to intervene. However, in May 2006 the agency formally invited the Scottish Borders Council to alert them should Tesco decide not to demolish the buildings on the site, as this could give them the opportunity to consider statutory protection afresh.</p>

  <p>The Rough Sleepers Initiative (RSI) was launched in 1997. Between 1997 and 2002 local authorities received funding from the Rough Sleepers Initiative on the basis of bids made to the Executive setting out the need for such funding in their area.</p>

  <p>Local authorities&rsquo; activities funded as a result of RSI have now become integrated with local authorities&rsquo; wider homelessness strategies and since 2004-05 these activities have been included within their local outcome agreements, which set out on an annual basis how they are implementing these strategies.</p>

  <p>The final evaluation of the RSI was published in March 2005 (which can be found at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/03/20886/54982" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/03/20886/54982</a>) and concluded that this initiative had achieved significant progress and produced tangible reductions in the need to sleep rough across the country. The evaluation concluded that the RSI enhanced services in cities and often created specific services for the first time in rural and smaller urban areas.</p>

  <p>The following table shows the allocations of funding to Argyll and Bute and West Dunbartonshire authorities under the RSI:</p>

  <p>The main source of new affordable, good quality housing in the Dumbarton constituency is Communities Scotland&rsquo;s Affordable Housing Investment Programme. This programme includes their Core Development Programme and the Community Ownership Programme.</p>

  <p>The Dumbarton constituency will this year benefit from over &pound;10 million of investment from the Core Development Programme. This will include the expected approval of 48 new units of affordable rented housing. In addition, five units of shared equity housing funded from the Homestake scheme (located in Alexandria) will go on sale.</p>

  <p>West Dunbartonshire Council has yet to take a final decision on making an application to join the Community Ownership Programme. It has been consulting with tenants and residents over its intention to do so. It has also been developing linked proposals to bid for resources from the Early Action Fund of the Community Ownership Programme.</p>

  <p>Where areas are proposed for significant levels of investment, involving demolishing existing stock and building new homes, local housing associations will be working with the Council and local residents to develop area-based regeneration plans.</p>

  <p>For existing social rented housing, the Scottish Executive has a policy objective of ensuring that stock owned by local authority landlords, and registered social landlords (housing associations) meet the Scottish Housing Quality Standard by 2015.</p>

  <p>Trafficking of people for the purpose of exploitation is an offence under Section 4 of the Asylum &amp; Immigration (Treatment of Claimants) Act 2004. Trafficking of people for the purpose of sexual exploitation is an offence under Section 22 of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2003.</p>

  <p>These offences apply, whether the victims are adults or children. It is not possible to separately identify child trafficking cases from the statistics held centrally.</p>

  <p>To date, there have been no proceedings under the 2003 act or the 2004 act for trafficking offences.</p>

  <p>There have been no prosecutions completed in relation to offences of controlling a child providing sexual services under Section 11 of the Protection of Children and Prevention of Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2005 since this act came into force in October 2005.</p>

  <p>Prior to this time, there was no specific offence of controlling or managing a child involved in prostitution, and consequently, statistics on charges and convictions are not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The &pound;20,000 sponsorship was part of a total package of support of &pound;38,258.80 towards the hosting of this high-profile event in Scotland. Permission to brand the lectern, stage and room with the Saltire and images of contemporary Scotland was received as part of this sponsorship package &ndash; the first time this has been granted by President Clinton. This was also the first time President Clinton has allowed press into such an event &ndash; 33 journalists attended &ndash; which resulted in substantive press and TV coverage.</p>

  <p>What we received in return for the &pound;20,000 element of the sponsorship package is as follows:</p>

  <p>Permission to brand the lectern, stage and room with the Saltire and images of modern Scotland</p>

  <p>The inclusion of information on Scotland in press packs (32 journalists attended)</p>

  <p>Permission to use photography and film footage of the event for Scottish Executive purposes. For example, we are currently considering the scope to use the DVD of the speech in schools as a supplement to wider activity under Determined to Succeed</p>

  <p>One table for 10 guests (including senior representatives from the media and the Convenor of the European and External Relations Committee).</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has a key role to play to stimulate the debate on global issues and supporting this event has allowed us to do just that. The event received considerable media coverage and has helped to position Scotland as a leading country for high-profile events and, as such, this sponsorship packages represents good value for money.</p>

  <p>The NHSScotland Resource Allocation Committee (NRAC) was established in March 2005 to improve and refine the Arbuthnott Formula. Members were chosen through the public appointment process and Dr Karen Facey, a self-employed health policy consultant and non-executive Director of Forth Valley NHS Board acts as Chairman. The remit and membership of NRAC was detailed in the answer to question S2W-14556 on 21 February 2005.</p>

  <p>Over the summer of 2005, the committee consulted with a number of NHS boards to assess what issues they have with the current formula and identify criteria that NHS boards consider a successful Formula could be measured against. To inform the work undertaken by NRAC, the issues were collated into groups and a summary of the issues and an outline of the proposed handling of the evidence was published on the NRAC website (<a href="http://www.nrac.scot.nhs.uk" target="_blank">www.nrac.scot.nhs.uk</a>). Individual responses will not be given to boards, but issues will be considered as research progresses and new elements of the allocation formula are created.</p>

  <p>Research has been undertaken during the past six months to determine how the formula could be improved. The areas of research include demography (population measurement and how age/sex cost weights for Care Programmes are assessed); morbidity and life circumstances, and the excess costs of supply (including remoteness). This research is currently being finalised.</p>

  <p>The committee will issue these research reports on their website in early July, with an overview document summarising the key issues, presenting options and raising questions. Engagement and feedback will be sought mainly with NHSScotland, but also other interested parties including, for example, the Royal Colleges, BMA and COSLA.</p>

  <p>No. The new arrangements have ended the practice of specialist stoma nurses advising NHS patients being employed or sponsored by appliance contractors or manufacturers. Transitional funding for a period of two years, based on the historic level of sponsorship or employment cost is, however, being made available by the industry to allow time for NHS boards to adjust to the new regime.</p>

  <p>The ingredient cost of appliances continues, as previously, to be a call on NHS boards&rsquo; unified budget.</p>

  <p>A sum of &pound;2.5 million has been added to NHS boards&rsquo; unified budget in respect of dispensing fees which now fall to be met directly by NHS boards.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The information requested is not available. Most foodstuffs used in prisons are procured centrally to ensure both the required level of quality and value for money.</p>

  <p>The SPS have established a good food group to ensure that prisoners are provided with a healthy and balanced diet.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The start of formal negotiations needed to await the Scottish Executive pay remit and analysis of the details of the Agenda for Change whose implementation by the NHS was delayed.</p>

  <p>The SPS has now received a pay remit and the Agenda for Change analysis is complete.</p>

  <p>Pay negotiations are now in process. Among SPS&rsquo;s aims is to conclude them as soon as the negotiating parties agree.</p>

  <p>As part of the EARL project consultation process a number of members of the public put forward a very similar proposal to the one suggested. The option was considered and appraised in accordance with the Scottish Transport Appraisal Guidance (STAG) process. This proposal became known as the &quot;Turnhouse option&quot;.</p>

  <p>The Turnhouse option was appraised using the STAG process against the same planning criteria as all other options. The option required a means of transporting passengers from the new station to the airport and three options were considered being a bus shuttle (total option cost &pound;134 million), a travellator (total option cost &pound;321 million) and a driverless shuttle (total option cost &pound;415 million).</p>

  <p>All Turnhouse options acted to reduce patronage with the bus shuttle reducing demand by 46%, the travellator reducing demand by 72% and the driverless shuttle reducing demand by 64%. The Turnhouse option was not taken forward as it failed to achieve any better performance than the runway tunnel option against the set planning objectives.</p>

  <p>A full report on the Turnhouse option is available on the Earl Website at <a href="http://www.Earlproject.com" target="_blank">www.Earlproject.com</a>.</p>

  <p>It is anticipated by both us and bus operators that there will be growth in the usage of long distance services as a result of the new Scheme. It is ultimately a commercial issue for the bus industry to decide how best to meet demand.

  <p>&quot;Value for money&quot; is defined in the manual as the optimum combination of whole-life cost and quality (or fitness for purpose) to meet the user&rsquo;s requirement. Securing value for money in procurement is crucial to the wider objective of delivering high quality, cost-effective public services.</p>

  <p>We are not aware of any evidence of cartel practices amongst those submitting tenders to the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>The available information is given in the following table. The ratios represent the number of individual convicted offenders to the number of qualified criminal justice social workers.</p>

  <p>The ratios are not an indication of the workload of criminal justice social workers. Individual offenders may receive any type of court disposal including custody, community sentences and monetary penalties, and may receive more than one conviction in a given year. Criminal justice social workers provide services in relation to the supervision of community sentences and wider services including Throughcare and Voluntary Assistance for released and supervised prisoners, diversion from prosecution and the preparation of reports for court (e.g. Social Enquiry Reports).</p>

  <p>The Scottish tourism sector was represented at the 2006 London Golf Show. However, there was a reduced presence as compared with the previous year due to a clash of dates. The organisers of the Golf Show had taken the decision to move their original dates to prevent a clash with the London Marathon, which in turn meant that the new dates fell in the same week as VisitScotland&rsquo;s &quot;Expo&quot; in Glasgow, the annual flagship trade show for the Scottish tourism industry.</p>

  <p>The conflicting dates not only prevented VisitScotland from taking a stand at the London Golf Show, but also meant that many of Scotland&rsquo;s golf suppliers and related businesses found themselves in the same position and unable to be at both events.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, although VisitScotland did not have a stand, staff were in attendance at the London Golf Show, and the Official Guide to Golf in Scotland was distributed through an industry partner. In addition to this, a number of private businesses were present at the Show.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what steps will be taken to inform parents of any international concerns over the safety record of the MMR vaccine and what steps will be taken to withdraw and replace all advertising literature that asserts that no child has ever died as a result of MMR vaccination, in light of the death of a child and adverse effects on other children in Vietnam following the administration of the Priorix vaccine.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-06-19.81.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80057" speakername="Mr Andy Kerr" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0619.htm#42">

  <p>Priorix has been successfully used to prevent measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) since 1997. More than 145 million doses have been administered worldwide and the vaccine has an excellent safety track record.</p>

  <p>Preliminary results from the investigation into the death of a child, and into the cases of the eight children who fell ill in Vietnam after being immunised with three different infant vaccines, (GSK&rsquo;s MMR vaccine [<em>Priorix</em>], or a GSK Varicella vaccine [<em>Varilrix</em>] or a non-GSK hepatitis B vaccine), suggest that the vaccines are unlikely to have been responsible. The events appear to be isolated to one district, one health centre, and a limited time period.</p>

  <p>The latest reports from Vietnam suggest that the cause of the reactions observed in these children was likely to be Staphylococcus aureus infection, and that the same organism has been isolated from two workers at the vaccination centre. Tests, which need to be finally confirmed, have determined that the strain isolated from the health care workers is genetically identical to that isolated from the vaccinees. The final results of the investigation are expected to be announced in the latter part of June.</p>

  <p>The safety of MMR vaccine is closely monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the government agency which is responsible for ensuring that medicines and medical devices work, and are acceptably safe. MHRA will take any action that is necessary to ensure that patient safety is not compromised. The current view within the UK and Europe is that the balance of risks and benefits for MMR vaccine remains overwhelmingly positive.</p>

  <p>Paediatric vaccines are not advertised in the UK, and as such the MHRA is unaware of any advertising which asserts that no child has ever died as a result of Priorix vaccination. The MHRA will take action if such a claim is brought to its attention.</p>

  <p>On household waste, we are supporting waste prevention work by the Waste and Resources Action Programme including home composting, work with retailers to minimise waste from products and packaging, and real nappies. We have also provided resources to community sector projects carrying out work on waste prevention through our INCREASE programme.</p>

  <p>On commercial and industrial waste, we support programmes such as Envirowise and Business Environment Partnership which provide direct advice to business on waste prevention. The Landfill Tax and improved standards at landfill sites also encourage waste prevention.</p>

  <p>We carried out a consultation earlier this year on Preventing Household Waste in Scotland. The responses to this consultation are currently being analysed and we intend to produce an action plan later this year.
