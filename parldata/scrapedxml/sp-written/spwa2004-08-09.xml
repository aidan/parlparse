  <p>Vocational learning is integral to the Executive&rsquo;s education strategy - <em>Educating for Excellence </em> and our Partnership Agreement set out our commitment to enable pupils to acquire vocational skills. Through Determined to Succeed (DtS), our Enterprise in Education strategy, we have allocated funding to local authorities to enable them to increase vocational options to pupils, including in construction. Some schools already offer school pupils in third year and above training in construction skills, principally through collaboration with colleges. The Executive is currently reviewing such collaboration to examine how such vocational opportunities can be best facilitated. The current review of the curriculum three to 18 will consider existing and future vocational provision.</p>

  <p>Under Devolved School Management (DSM) arrangements, an education authority passes control of a proportion of a school's budget to the headteacher through a detailed scheme which lays out clear spending requirements. Each local authority operates its own DSM Scheme, in accordance with guidance issued by the Scottish Executive. In 2004-05, councils are budgeting to allocate on average 78.3% of secondary education net expenditure to head teachers.</p>

  <p>The Commission has sought and secured a delay in the production of a report into the effectiveness of access restrictions, which was originally intended to be made available by 31 December 2003. During 2003 and 2004, the Commission secured agreement on the scope of the review, established a scientific expert group to agree its terms of reference and established scientific expert sub-groups to conduct reviews and draft reports for evaluation of each access rule. The Commission&rsquo;s scientific expert groups first met in April 2004 and the sub-groups are now preparing their reports. No revised timescale for the Article 19 review has been agreed, but the Commission&rsquo;s final report and corresponding proposals are expected before the end of 2004.</p>

  <p>In the course of routine business the Scottish Executive has made numerous written and oral representations to the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) on several aspects of the Article 19 review, concentrating on the implications of the review for the Shetland Box access arrangements. Representations from Scottish Executive have included views on the proper scope and timetabling of the review, the membership and terms of reference for the Commission&rsquo;s scientific expert groups, and the UK strategy for anticipating and handling proposals arising from the Commission&rsquo;s report, including effective stakeholder engagement and consultation.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive provided DEFRA with detailed submissions on the effectiveness of the Shetland Box during the negotiations leading to the reformed framework regulation of the Common Fisheries Policy. No further submissions have been provided.</p>

  <p>No. The principle of relative stability is not being reviewed.

Sheep from these farms must be monitored for radioactivity prior to being moved off farm. A further nine farms are restricted in West Cumbria and 359 farms in North Wales.</p>

  <p>The public sector is made up of independent - or at arm&rsquo;s length - corporate bodies which determine their own pay and grading structures. Ministers are ultimately responsible for approving the pay structures of non departmental public bodies (NDPBs) but have no specific power to intervene in relation to local authority (LA) staffing matters.</p>

  <p>However, the Scottish Executive plays a key role in promoting good employment practices in both the public and private sector, particularly in relation to equal pay. It leads by example, as detailed in my response to question S2W-9693 answered on 28 July 2004, and is a partner (together with the Equal Opportunities Commission Scotland, the Scottish Trade Union Congress and others) in the <em>Close the Gap</em> campaign, which aims to raise awareness about the pay gap between women and men in Scotland and encourage activity to reduce it. This includes encouraging employers to carry out equal pay audits or reviews. More specifically, all Scottish pay bodies, who submit pay remits for ministerial approval (i.e. the Scottish Executive, executive agencies and executive NDPBs), were requested to conduct an equal pay review by April 2003 with an update on progress by June 2004.</p>

  <p>The Executive has also introduced a statutory duty of best value to LAs and the wider public sector (including the Executive and its agencies, all executive NDPBs with an accountable officer and a range of NHSScotland bodies). This requires these bodies to demonstrate that measures are in place to encourage observance of equal opportunities&rsquo; requirements, including those relating to the Equal Pay Act 1970, which is the legislation which implemented the provisions of the Equal Pay Directive in GB. The Accounts Commission for Scotland will audit Best Value in Local Government.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held by the Scottish Executive. A list of registered community amateur sports clubs (CASCs) throughout the UK can, however, be found on the Inland Revenue website. The following link <a href="http://www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk/casc/registered-clubs.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk/casc/registered-clubs.pdf</a> provides access to the relevant page of the Inland Revenue website.</p>

  <p>In August 2002, following an announcement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer about a new tax relief package to support CASCs, <strong></strong>sportscotland wrote to sports clubs across Scotland to make them aware of this package of tax reliefs. And on 4 May 2004, the Scottish Sports Association in conjunction with <strong></strong>sportscotland wrote to the Scottish Association of Local Sports Councils, Sports Governing Bodies and Local Sports Councils providing information on the voluntary agreement the Scottish Executive has reached with local authorities regarding the provision of rate relief for registered CASCs. The recipients were asked to disseminate this letter, which also contained updated information about the tax benefits to be gained from CASC status and how to obtain CASC status to all member clubs and councils.</p>

  <p>There is no immediate intention to publish guidance on the Integrated Transport Fund (ITF), since substantial resources have already been allocated to delivering our partnership commitments such as Edinburgh trams, the redevelopment of Waverley rail station and re-opening the Stirling to Alloa to Kincardine rail line. However, additional resources may be identified in the future, and the provision of guidance will be considered at that time.</p>

  <p>Executive officials are always available to discuss at an early stage proposals from local authorities and others for public transport projects. Officials can provide an initial view on what detailed information might be required and the likelihood of funding being made available, whether from the ITF or some other funding stream.</p>

  <p>We are not aware of any local authorities preparing to submit Integrated Transport Fund (ITF) bids for such projects. Since substantial resources from the ITF are already committed to the delivery of our partnership commitments, we would not encourage local authorities to work up detailed proposals for any transport project until these have been first discussed with their usual contacts in the Executive.</p>
