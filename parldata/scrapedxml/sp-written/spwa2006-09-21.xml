  <p>I regret that the Environment and Rural Affairs Department (SEERAD) does not capture information on the status of those entering agriculture in any detail that would allow a complete answer to the question. Nevertheless, following the convention that where proxy information is available it should be supplied, my officials have sourced the following from successful New Entrant applications to the National Reserve of the Single Farm Payment Scheme</p>

  <p>Under the National Reserve, to qualify as a New Entrant a business must meet the following criteria: they had entered an approved sector in the period 1 January 2003 to 2 November 2004 and had not, in their own name or at their own risk, been involved in agriculture in the previous five-year period prior to their application.</p>

  <p>In 2005, 303 businesses were approved as New Entrants and this equates to 1.41% of the average number of all farm businesses registering with SEERAD over the period of the Single Farm Payment Scheme to date.</p>

  <p>A number of allowances are available for the recruitment, retention and training of NHS Dentists.

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not hold information centrally on planned investment in schools facilities as this is the responsibility of individual local authorities. However, you may wish to note that both East and West Dunbartonshire councils are each taking forward school PPP projects with a capital value of over &pound;100 million for which the Executive will provide revenue support. In addition, East Dunbartonshire Council will receive &pound;3,319,000 and West Dunbartonshire will receive &pound;2,671,000 this financial year from the Schools Fund.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Funding Council has approved a capital funding grant of &pound;23.4 million towards a new purpose built campus for Clydebank College at Queens Quay Clydebank. The estimated completion date for this project is July 2007.</p>

  <p>It is for individual local authorities to interpret the legislation and discharge their duties in line with the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 (the Act). The Scottish Executive has been made aware that local authorities do vary in their approaches to implementing the Act. However, the Scottish Executive has commissioned a series of Information Sharing Seminars across Scotland to facilitate the sharing of practice across education authorities, health boards and other services.

  <p><a name="txtTopLine" id="txtTopLine"></a> No-one should have work in fear of being attacked or abused. Attacks on emergency workers are unacceptable, dangerous and callous. Those working in emergency situations fill an essential role, and should be able to go about their already difficult and often dangerous work without fear of assault or further threat.</p>

  <p>That is why the Executive brought forward the Emergency Workers (Scotland) Act 2005 to make it a specific offence to assault, obstruct or hinder emergency workers (and those assisting them) when they are responding to emergency situations. The act sends a clear message to emergency workers and to the perpetrators of these abhorrent crimes - a message that we value emergency workers; that we condemn the assault of emergency workers or disruption of emergency services, and that we are prepared to take action to see such behaviour is punished appropriately.</p>

  <p>The Executive in also working with the STUC to tackle violence against all workers serving the public. This involves a package of measures, including an awareness campaign with the very clear message that physical or verbal violence against those who serve the public is unacceptable.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive why recipients of income support or income-based jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance qualify automatically for free advice and assistance from the Scottish Legal Aid Board, whereas those in receipt of pension credit do not.</p>

  <p>Recipients of income support or income-based job-seeker&rsquo;s allowance qualify automatically for free advice and assistance only on income grounds. A capital test also however applies. If the applicant has more than the prescribed limit for disposable capital (currently &pound;1,450), they will be ineligible for advice and assistance whether in receipt of income support or job-seeker&rsquo;s allowance or otherwise.</p>

  <p>The position with pension credit is different. An applicant in receipt of pension credit does not qualify automatically for free advice and assistance on income grounds; however any pension credit income they receive is disregarded in the assessment of disposable income. As with income support and job-seeker&rsquo;s allowance, a capital test also still applies.</p>

  <p>For those with no other source of income, or for whom all other income comes from benefits, the effect of disregarding pension credit will be the same as for those receiving income support and job-seeker&rsquo;s allowance as their assessed disposable income will be nil.</p>

  <p>Our longer term aim is to reach a situation where all benefits are disregarded for both advice and assistance and civil legal aid. We will work towards this aim as resources allow.</p>

  <p>I am aware of the difficulties Highland Council is experiencing in meeting the community care needs of some older people on discharge from hospital due to geographical considerations. I understand that the council is addressing this issue and will submit a report to the Executive shortly for consideration.</p>

  <p>Improving efficiency is a key element of our programme of modernisation of the planning system. To that end the Executive recognises the need for a culture change in the way people and statutory bodies engage with the planning system. I am therefore keen to encourage a prompter response in respect of planning applications from those statutory consultees whose current response times are causing undue delays within the system.</p>

  <p>I will be raising this issue with my ministerial colleagues in relation to the statutory consultees for which they are responsible and with UK Government Ministers in relation to those bodies for which they are responsible.</p>

  <p>No. The recommendation from the 2004 PMP/Donaldsons Report was based on an analysis of the socio-economic benefits to Scotland as a whole rather than on what is best value to the organisation at the current time. In the longer term, I would hope that the opportunities afforded by relocating to Glasgow will be beneficial to <strong></strong> sportscotland and present an exciting opportunity for it to develop and influence the future of sport in Scotland. This relocation is also good news for the east end of Glasgow, an area with pressing social and economic needs.</p>

  <p>Corporation tax is liable to be paid on profits from trading activities, or from investment income or capital gains.</p>

  <p>It is not anticipated that Parent Councils will, in normal circumstances, require to pay tax since fundraising activities such as school fetes, dances, coffee mornings etc. are generally not considered to be trading activities.</p>

  <p>The number of full time equivalent staff employed by VisitScotland in each year since 1999 along with their associated costs is shown in the following table:</p>

  <p>A breakdown of staff costs by department and salary band would not be consistent over the period as a result of the restructuring of VisitScotland which took place in 2001-02 when changes were made to both the department and salary grading structures of the Scottish Tourist Board.</p>

  <p>Figures for 2004-05 include the staff costs of the transition project to merge VisitScotland with the 14 area tourist boards, which was implemented in April 2005. Figures for 2005-06 will not be available until VisitScotland publishes its audited accounts later in the year.</p>
