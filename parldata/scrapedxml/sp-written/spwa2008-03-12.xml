  <p>The information held centrally in the Scottish Government Court Proceedings Database is an historical snapshot rather than real-time information, and so information on the last conviction recorded is based on the latest year of data held (2005-06). The last person under the age of 18 with charge proved in this data, where the main offence related to underage drinking in Grampian police force area, had a sentence date of 27 February 2006. Offences included are buying excisable liquor or consuming in a bar, or for contraventions of bye-laws prohibiting the consumption of alcohol in designated places.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is exploring options, including legislative ones, for supporting a means of last resort for resolving disputes about high hedges. This will be done in parallel to the national antisocial behaviour review. In doing so, we will bear in mind consultation on the issue by the previous administration, the provisions in place in England and Wales and Scott Barrie&rsquo;s bill, which fell at dissolution of the last session of the Parliament.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is agreeable in principle to the issue of licences for a limited translocation research project. The purpose of the project is to assess whether trapping and relocation of sparrowhawks is a satisfactory solution to the problem of sparrowhawk predation on racing pigeons. The work will be carried out by an independent contractor. The contractor will be approved to fit rings to the relocated sparrowhawks. A Larsen trap will be used to catch the sparrowhawks. Live pigeons will be used to attract the sparrowhawks. The pigeons are not put at risk using this method, and conditions to protect their welfare and that of any trapped sparrowhawk are specified in the Project Protocol.</p>

The new and more streamlined structures from 1 April 2008 present savings under a range of headings including staff and administration costs, but we have yet to decide their final distribution.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is the principal funder of the adult literacies strategy and routes this funding through the 32 local authorities. The funding is included within the grant aided expenditure (GAE).</p>

  <p>Learning connections provide guidance and development support to the 32 adult literacy and numeracy (ALN) partnerships and national partners. It also works with national organisations to move forward the training, practice development and research agendas for adult literacies.

  <p>In the last two calendar years (2006 and 2007), there were 445 applications for Regional Selective Assistance (RSA). In the same period, 344 companies received payment of RSA grant totalling over &pound;87 million.</p>

  <p>During the same period, 257 applications for innovation grants were received. These included applications for SMART: SCOTLAND, SCORE and SPUR. 224 businesses received funding over the same period with payments totalling over &pound;13 million.</p>

  <p>In addition, businesses can apply to Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise for funding support for growth and development. As this is an operational matter for both organisations I will ask both chief executives to write to you in this regard.</p>

  <p>These are matters for NHS Lanarkshire and neighbouring NHS boards because specialist services are being planned and developed on a regional basis.</p>

  <p>I have given in principle approval for further work to be carried out on providing specialist primary angioplasty services at Hairmyres. This is consistent with the service model provided in Glasgow where patients requiring this treatment go the Golden Jubilee Hospital and not the accident and emergency units at the Southern General Hospital or the Glasgow Royal Infirmary. Robust evidence shows that for a minority of patients who suffer a heart attack as a consequence of a blocked coronary artery, this is the most appropriate treatment for them and will deliver the best outcomes.</p>

  <p>For this group of patients, the evidence is also clear that the sooner the intervention is carried out, the better the clinical result. Patients in North Lanarkshire who suffer a heart attack of this kind do not, at present, have immediate access to these specialist services. These proposals will provide fast access to such a service at Hairmyres Hospital to patients from all over Lanarkshire, and also Ayrshire. These proposals will affect those patients who require primary angioplasty only &ndash; the majority of heart attack victims will continue to be treated locally.</p>

  <p>No UK Government minister was invited to the Convention of the Highlands and Islands in Shetland in March 2008.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers have reviewed the list of attendees and decided that the membership of the convention will in future consist of Scottish ministers and relevant invited public sector organisations, together with co-opted experts as required.</p>

  <p>The role of the convention is to strengthen the co-ordination between member organisations and the Scottish Government and to work together to deliver the Scottish Government&rsquo;s strategic objectives. Scottish ministers, therefore have decided that they will not extend an invitation to UK ministers to attend future conventions unless the agenda particularly requires it.</p>

  <p>However, meetings are open to the public in the capacity of observers.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to introducing an alternative funding mechanism to the traditional costly &quot;standard form&quot; of PFI, in the Scottish Futures Trust (SFT). We have already stated that PPP could continue as one of several delivery options open to public sector bodies whilst the SFT is being developed. Where PPP is to be used, the preferred option is for procuring bodies to follow the non-profit distributing (NPD) model. This provides for capped equity returns thus ending the very high gains seen in the &quot;standard PFI&quot; model via the secondary market. The NPD model was piloted successfully in the Scottish schools projects and is now being developed in the health and transport sectors.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not hold a breakdown of the equity invested by consortia for all individual &quot;standard PFI&quot; projects. However, the normal gearing in such contracts involves about 90% senior debt, 8 to 9% junior debt, and 1 to 2% uncapped equity. The uncapped equity element does not exist in the non-profit distributing model which is now preferred in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Once a contract becomes operational, companies involved in the PFI consortia may alter their equity stakes, and be replaced by other equity partners. Such changes do not affect the contracted service and price agreed between the consortia and the respective public sector bodies.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not hold comprehensive information on the actual or projected return on each consortium&rsquo;s investment. Returns reflect the fluctuating market norms in different sectors at the time of procurement, and correspond to the risks taken by investors in each project.</p>

  <p>Ultimately, the level of fares and the provision of bus services is a matter for individual bus operators who use their own commercial judgement in these matters. The Scottish Government currently provides substantial funds to the bus industry of around &pound;260 million a year. This covers Bus Service Operators Grant (BSOG), concessionary fares, local authority supported services and Bus Route Development Grant. Following the budget statement by the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth on 6 February 2008, I can confirm that it is our intention that the budget for BSOG will be around &pound;61 million in 2008-09.</p>

  <p>We read the Crown Estate report with interest and believe it provides a useful contribution to our discussions with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR) and other stakeholders on future grid development.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises that further grid reinforcements will be necessary if we are to exploit Scotland&rsquo;s potential for renewable energy, particularly in the Highlands and Islands, where much of the resource lies. This could bring significant economic benefits to the region and the whole of Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is also working with BERR on a strategic environmental assessment for offshore wind. This will include the deep waters of Scotland&rsquo;s renewable energy zone where there is significant potential for development.</p>

  <p>Under the previous Scottish Executive, the information we would need to be able to calculate how many students will lose bursary income as a result of the changes to student support in 2008-09 was not collected.</p>

  <p>In spite of this, the Scottish Government did attempt to model the cost involved in estimating how many students in Scotland will see a reduction in the grant or bursary or student support that they currently receive due to the means testing arrangements.

  <p>The form of contract under which teachers are employed are matters for local authorities as employers. The Scottish Government carries out an annual teacher workforce planning exercise to estimate the number of new teachers required in the years ahead at national level irrespective of the type of contract under which they are employed.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-8485 on 29 January 2008. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="../../../webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a> .</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s consolidated resource accounts are laid before Parliament annually and detail expenditure on the government&rsquo;s stated aims for each financial year, including spend on children and young people. In the period 2003-07 there was no &quot;children and young people&quot; budget line, rather expenditure on these groups ranged across the government&rsquo;s budgets.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what plans it has to establish anaerobic digestion plants as a way to reduce methane emissions, treat organic waste and contribute towards Scotland&rsquo;s renewable energy targets.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-03-12.S3W-10453.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80347" speakername="Jim Mather" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa0312.htm#34">

  <p>The Scottish Government is keen to encourage the development of anaerobic digestion projects in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) will run a capital grant scheme in Scotland worth &pound;6 million over the next three years for infrastructure to recycle organic waste, including anaerobic digestion plants. In addition, WRAP provides support to companies involved in recycling and composting (including companies planning to install anaerobic digestion plants) through their business support service. More information on WRAP&rsquo;s work can be found at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.wrap.org.uk/nations_and_english_regions/scotland/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.wrap.org.uk/nations_and_english_regions/scotland/index.html</a>.</p>

  <p>We also intend to allocate over &pound;100 million from our three-year &pound;150 million zero waste fund to support recycling and composting infrastructure and other infrastructure to divert waste from landfill, including anaerobic digestion plants. We are establishing a working group with COSLA to discuss how best to use these resources.</p>

  <p>For renewable energy, support is available in the form of renewables obligation certificates for the biomass fraction of electricity output from energy from waste plants using anaerobic digestion. In addition, the new Scotland rural development programme will make available options that will provide support towards the purchase and installation of equipment with small scale renewable energy capacity, which will include anaerobic digestion.</p>

  <p>All low income households, including low income pensioner households, already receive reductions in their water services charges.</p>

  <p>The focus of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s general policy is the achievement by Scottish Water of substantial efficiency savings to keep charges down for all water customers. As a result water services bills are set to rise by less than inflation for the third consecutive year.</p>
