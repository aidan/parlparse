  <p>The nature and application of measures announced make it very difficult to arrive at an accurate figure for any particular region. However, we estimate that over the next 2 years the aid package could be worth about &pound;7.5m to Dumfries and Galloway.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has not commissioned any studies in these areas.

A public consultation has recently been completed on the findings of this review, and the responses are currently being analysed.</p>

  <p>It has not been the policy of successive governments to compensate for losses due to disease or other natural phenomena in the marine environment. The Scottish Executive is continuing to assess the economic impact of the ban, with the assistance of the catching and processing industries.

  <p>The Scottish Parliament and Scottish Ministers have competence in relation to all devolved matters in or as regards Scotland.</p>

  <p>In respect of sea fisheries, the Scottish Parliament and Scottish Ministers will legislate and act up to the boundaries defined in the Scottish Adjacent Waters Boundaries Order 1999. In addition, they can legislate and act in respect of Scottish fishing boats wherever in the world they may be.</p>

  <p>Oil and gas are reserved matters. The Civil Jurisdiction (Offshore Activities) Order 1987 made under the Oil and Gas (Enterprise) Act, 1982 defines an area of sea where the civil law in force in Scotland and the jurisdiction of the Scottish civil courts applies in relation to alleged offences taking place in connection with any activity related to the exploration of, or the exploitation of, the oil and gas resources in that area of sea. Part of this area of sea is outwith the sea area covered by the Scottish Adjacent Waters Boundaries Order.</p>

  <p>In a speech to the Association of Directors of Social Work in May 1998 I enumerated a 7 point plan to modernise social work. This included the need to support front-line staff. They undertook to take forward action on this topic and have been developing a guidance pack on supporting front-line staff. This includes dealing with stress and violence to staff. The guidance pack will be launched in December and I am sure this will help employers deal with this difficult issue.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Social Services Council will have the responsibility of issuing codes of conduct and practice for both the workforce and their employers. The Scottish Executive, the UK Government and the administrations in Wales and Northern Ireland are commissioning the development of draft codes of conduct and practice. I will ensure that the code of practice for employers includes violence and stress reduction.</p>

  <p>There will be a number of opportunities within the Holyrood building to commemorate Scottish achievements. Specific suggestions should be put to the Holyrood Project Team in the first instance for consideration by the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body in due course. <br /></p>
