  <p>I am today announcing a significant programme of reform and development for the workforce. The Review of the Early Years and Childcare Workforce will:</p>

  <p>examine and define the role and responsibilities of staff in the early years, child care and play workforce;</p>

  <p>determine an approach to national workforce planning;</p>

  <p>rationalise and modernise early years/child care qualifications, ensuring that they are appropriate for the different sectors of the workforce;</p>

  <p>develop vertical and lateral career pathways which provide for progression within a chosen area and lateral movement between different sectors of the workforce, and</p>

  <p>consider the implications of these considerations for pay and conditions.</p>

  <p>Although the review will comment on pay and conditions, these remain matters for employers.</p>

  <p>The review&#8217;s recommendations will have to take into account current levels of resources and planned spending following the outcome of this years spending review. The review should also reflect the interests of the different sectors which provide childcare and early years services, including the private, voluntary and social economy sector and self-employed individuals.</p>

  <p>A steering group involving key stakeholders, to be chaired by a senior Scottish Executive official, will be set up. It will include:</p>

  <p>COSLA</p>

  <p>UNISON</p>

  <p>Local authority early years manager</p>

  <p>Local authority practitioner</p>

  <p>Private sector provider</p>

  <p>Voluntary sector provider</p>

  <p>Voluntary sector overview</p>

  <p>Social economy sector provider</p>

  <p>Parents&#8217; representative</p>

  <p>SQA</p>

  <p>Scottish Social Services Council</p>

  <p>Further and higher education training providers</p>

  <p>Scottish Executive officials</p>

  <p>A wider range of interests will be involved through working groups which will develop detailed proposals for the steering group.</p>

  <p>I anticipate that the initial work of the group will last 12 months.</p>

  <p>At 16 May, the average processing time for applications for all three levels of Disclosures was 12 days. This applies to applications which do not require the correction of errors in the application form, clearance of payment arrangements or enquires to police forces for any relevant non-conviction information.</p>

  <p>Also at 16 May, approximately 24,000 applications were being processed by Disclosure Scotland. In addition, there were approximately 21,500 applications where staff were pursuing the correction of errors in the application form, clearance of payment and enquiries to police forces for any relevant non-conviction information. Disclosure Scotland has assigned additional staff to complete the processing of these outstanding applications.</p>

  <p>Local authorities and other employers are best placed to make decisions about the appointment of individuals to posts which involve working with children and vulnerable adults. Appointments to such positions need to be considered very carefully and a range of pre-employment checks, including a criminal record check, should be carried out.</p>

  <p>Where, in exceptional circumstances, an employer feels it is essential to appoint an individual to such a post pending receipt of a disclosure from Disclosure Scotland, but after all other pre-appointment checks are completed, the employer should consider appointing the individual on a temporary contract and ensure that the person concerned does not work unsupervised when dealing with children or vulnerable adults.</p>

  <p>The Scottish GDP index is measured in basic prices (also known as Gross Value Added) and is not available in market prices. The main difference between these two measures is the inclusion (in the market prices measure) of taxes and subsidies on products. Due to the difficulty in apportioning taxes and subsidies below national level, growth of GDP in market prices is not currently available.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Programme for Clinical Effectiveness in Reproductive Health (SPCERH), commissioned by the Chief Medical Officer, held a consensus conference in 2003 to reconsider the eligibility criteria for access to NHS funded infertility treatment. The Executive are currently reviewing the feedback from the conference and are also reviewing the current level of service provision across NHS Scotland. If after the completion of these reviews, expected later in 2004, there was a recommendation to change the criteria then this would be subject to a full public consultation exercise.</p>

  <p>The Expert Advisory Group on Infertility Services in Scotland (EAGISS) was published in February 2000. The report provides a robust evidence base for the management and delivery of infertility services and it will provide equity of access to services and treatment. NHS boards have been asked to work towards the implementation of the recommendations from the report as existing resources allow and bearing in mind local and national priorities.</p>

  <p>The expert group recommended that once accepted onto an assisted conception programme, couples should be permitted to undergo successive cycles within a time frame of their own choosing. They should not return to the end of a waiting list following an unsuccessful cycle.</p>

  <p>As recommended by the Expert Advisory Group on Infertility Services in Scotland, the initial investigation and management of infertility, provided by the primary care team, should be couple-based, covering basic history-taking and clinical examination. This stage should also include laboratory investigations to evaluate the woman&#8217;s general health status, to confirm ovulation and to assess the quality of the semen of the man.</p>

  <p>The couple should then be referred, if necessary, for further investigation and management provided by a special infertility team in a district general hospital.

  <p>The report of the Expert Advisory Group on Infertility Services in Scotland (EAGISS). <em>Evidence and Equity</em> , was published in February 2000. The report provides a robust evidence base for the management and delivery of infertility services and it will provide equity of access to services and treatment. All NHS boards have been asked to work towards the implementation of the recommendations of the report, as existing resources allow, bearing in mind local and national priorities.</p>

  <p>One of the principle outcomes of EAGISS was to produce eligibility criteria for accessing NHS funded assisted conception. These criteria are:</p>

  <p>Infertility with an appropriate diagnosed cause of any duration or unexplained infertility of at least three years duration.</p>

  <p>Female partner aged less than 38 years at the time of treatment.</p>

  <p>Neither partner previously sterilised.</p>

  <p>Less than three previous embryo transfers funded from any source.</p>

  <p>The answer given to question S2W-7167 on 22 April 2004, gave a figure of 5,327 outstanding apprehension warrants in relation to Strathclyde Police as at 14 April 2004. At end-May 2004, Strathclyde Police <strong> </strong> held the following number of warrants in relation to serious crime investigations:</p>

</table></p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Other outstanding apprehension warrants relate, for example, to failure to appear in court, common assault and fraud. A detailed breakdown of such warrants would require an examination of each warrant and would only be available at disproportionate cost. In 2003-04, procurators fiscal passed 52,338 warrants to the police.</p>

  <p>2. The police must execute all warrants without undue delay. Following a protocol agreed between Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland and the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, forces prioritise the handling of the most serious warrants first. However, in some cases, because the individuals against whom the warrants are issued go to ground (including abroad), the police are not always able to execute a warrant quickly.</p>

  <p>3. The number of warrants outstanding is greater than the number of individuals involved because some people have multiple warrants issued against them.</p>

  <p>No. There is no evidence to say whether PFI/PPP has had no impact on the capital costs of the NHS. Before PFI/PPP is used a full economic appraisal is conducted which compares PPP/PFI with a traditionally procured option to assess which approach provides better value for money. I would further refer the member to the answer give to S2W-7829 answered 12 May 2004 which advises that PFI/PPP contributes to capital investment in NHSScotland and is an additional source of funding.

When the City of Edinburgh Council approved an increase in the number of spaces, it was agreed that NHS Lothian would receive 25% of any surplus income for the additional car parking spaces, the City of Edinburgh Council 50% (for the continuing implementation of its Green Policy) and the remaining 25% of any surplus income to be retained by Consort.</p>

  <p>We are unable to say whether all categories of dementia sufferers will or will not be included in the Blue Badge Scheme until after the research by the Department for Transport is completed. The research will look at the mobility needs for these groups and will be carried out on a UK-wide basis.</p>

  <p>The station opened in 1994 at a cost of around &#163;2.2 million. The Scottish Executive did not contribute but the station&#8217;s public authority funders included Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive, Ayrshire Enterprise, and Kyle and Carrick Council.

  <p>The report recognises that capital costs account for a significant proportion of the cost of generating wind power, at between 75%- 90% of the total costs. Such costs are predicted to fall significantly as the global wind energy market expands.</p>

  <p>The full cost of nuclear power, including decommissioning costs, has not been included in the report.</p>

  <p>The average student loan debt for Scottish domiciled borrowers starting repayment in each year from 1999 onwards is shown in the following table:</p>

</table></p>

  <p>This data is from the Student Loans Company (SLC) and is for borrowers entering repayment in April of each year.</p>

  <p>Between 1994-95 and 1997-98 students were supported through a combination of grant and student loan. The level of loan support was increased over that period to make up 50% of the total support available. In 1998-99 this system of support was replaced by income contingent repayment student loans. Given these changes to the student support arrangements it is inappropriate to compare each of the figures in the table on a like-for-like basis.</p>
