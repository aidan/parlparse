  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it is its policy that residential in-patient facilities for treating patients with serious alcohol and drug dependency problems should be part of the range of provision in each NHS board area and, if so, what action it is taking to ensure that NHS boards make use of existing facilities and, where necessary, create new ones.</p>

  <p>It is for each of the 22 Alcohol and Drug Action Teams (ADATs) to determine the range and availability of services at local level. Record levels of funding are being made available in 2005-06 and 2006-07 by the Executive to support the expansion of treatment and rehabilitation services, and the detail of what is now available locally can be found on the ISD Scotland website at</p>

  <p>The Health Economics Research Unit study of effective and cost effective measures to reduce alcohol misuse reviewed UK and international research on the effectiveness of interventions. This review notes that all studies need to be interpreted with caution and that more research is needed about the effectiveness of different treatment settings in a UK context. The review is available at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.alcoholinformation.isdscotland.org/alcohol_misuse/files/MeasureReduce_Full.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.alcoholinformation.isdscotland.org/alcohol_misuse/files/MeasureReduce_Full.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p>A large amount of research has been conducted both in the UK and internationally which compares, or enables comparison of, the effectiveness of residential treatment with community-based treatments for drug addictions. The Scottish Executive is currently undertaking a review of the available evidence, to inform policy.</p>

  <p>The Chief Scientist&rsquo;s Office of the Scottish Executive Health Department has funded a study of environmental risk factors for congenital eye defects in children of women exposed to pesticides and pollutants. The tentative conclusion was that genetic factors were the most important cause of the eye defects.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive Health Department maintains an overview of these public health issues and takes advice on the health effects of environmental factors on all sectors of the Scottish population from a number of relevant agencies including the Health Protection Agency, Health Protection Scotland, and expert committees including the Committee on Medical Effects of Air Pollutants and the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products, and the Environment.</p>

  <p>1. For this analysis, the amount of each discount was converted to 2006 prices using the UK GDP deflator. The GDP deflator is a measure of inflation across the whole domestic economy.</p>

  <p>2. Cases where no discount was granted have been excluded from the analysis.</p>

  <p>3. In some local authorities, there have not yet been any sales under modernised right to buy. This is indicated by N/A (not applicable).</p>

  <p>4. By definition, the maximum and minimum discounts represent data outliers, or atypical extreme values, and should be interpreted with caution.</p>

  <p>5. Right-to-buy sales are subject to modernised terms as of 30 September 2002.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what discussions it has had with NHS Lanarkshire with regard to the provision of visitor transport services for patients who are admitted to Hairmyres Hospital or Wishaw General Hospital as a result of the downgrading of accident and emergency services at Monklands Hospital.</p>

  <p>Transport is a significant issue which NHS boards must take into account in the design and delivery of local health services. When submitting a proposal for a service change, boards are expected to have fully assessed the impact of the proposed changes on the travel arrangements of patients, carers, visitors and staff. We therefore required NHS Lanarkshire to carry out a full transport needs assessment as part of the consultation process on the redesign of services in NHS Lanarkshire.</p>

  <p>I was aware of the level of concern that was raised during NHS Lanarkshire&rsquo;s consultation process about transport issues and in particular about the difficulties for relatives and other visitors in travelling from the Monklands area to Wishaw and Hairmyres. I questioned the board about these matters at their Annual Review, and subsequently I required them to give me an assurance that a shuttle bus service will operate between Monklands and the other two hospital sites. This service will be available for the use of patients, relatives and staff and will be in place by the time Accident and Emergency provision changes at Monklands Hospital.</p>

  <p>More generally, we are establishing Transport for Health sub-groups in each of our three Regional Planning Groups to bring together NHS boards and their transport planning partners, including the Scottish Ambulance Service, local authorities and community transport providers, to allow them to develop innovative, integrated transport solutions that will provide better access to health care facilities for patients, carers, visitors and staff. NHS Lanarkshire will play a full part in the West of Scotland Partnership.</p>

  <p>Draft Scottish Planning Policy 6: Renewable Energy was published on 10 July. In support of the Executive&rsquo;s policy on micro-renewables, the draft specifically seeks views on the introduction of a target for a percentage of on site generation from micro-renewables technologies in certain new developments. The closing date for responses to the draft is 6 October 2006.</p>

  <p>The Executive is due to publish the first Energy Efficiency and Microgeneration Strategy and Action Plan for Scotland by the end of the year. This will look at the contribution that micro-generation and energy efficiency can play in helping us to meet our climate change targets.</p>
