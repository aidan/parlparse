  <p>Causes of death are categorised using the World Health Organisation&rsquo;s International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (Tenth Revision: ICD10). This classification does not separately identify deaths caused by the consumption of animal products.</p>

  <p>The table gives the numbers of deaths caused by the adverse effects of drugs and medicaments in therapeutic use. Additionally, drugs cause a significant number of deaths by poisoning (mainly associated with drug abuse, accidental poisoning or intentional self-poisoning). Statistics are available on the General Register Office for Scotland website:</p>

  <p>Many of these deaths involve prescription drugs, sometimes in combination with non-prescription drugs, but the ICD10 classification does not categorise such deaths separately.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the procedure is for, and what the implications are of, inclusion of a Ramsar site in the Montreux Record because of potential or actual adverse change in its ecological character and what information it has on the extent to which, in relation to Ramsar sites in Scotland, the procedure involves UK government departments or agencies.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2004-12-21.10.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80064" speakername="Lewis Macdonald" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-04/wa1221.htm#6">

  <p>The Montreux Record was established at the 4th Conference of the Contracting Parties to the Ramsar Convention in 1990. It is a listing of sites where changes in ecological character have occurred, are occurring or are likely to occur. The main objective of this mechanism is to draw attention to the need for action and to provide assistance to countries in solving the problems at particular Ramsar sites in need of priority conservation action. A site can only be included in the Record with the approval of the Contracting Party concerned. Contracting parties are requested to fill out a voluntary questionnaire with information on the site, normally to be returned to the Ramsar Bureau within three months.</p>

  <p>The procedure when a site is listed on the record is for the Ramsar Secretariat to seek the view of its Scientific and Technical Review Panel (STRP) and then arrange a technical mission (Ramsar Advisory Mission) to the site in order to advise on possible solutions.</p>

  <p>The UK is the Contracting Party to the Ramsar Convention and Defra acts as the Administrative Authority on behalf of the UK. The Administrative Authority formally submits any request to list a site on the Record to the Ramsar Secretariat, but it would be for the Scottish Executive to make such a request and complete the questionnaire in consultation with Scottish Natural Heritage along with voluntary bodies, site managers / owners and interested parties.</p>

  <p>A wetland will be removed from the Montreux Record based on the request of the Contracting Party and after consideration of advice and/or comment from the STRP.</p>

  <p>No sites in Scotland are currently on the Montreux Record.</p>

  <p>Further information on the operation of the Montreux Record can be found at:</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it intends to make representations to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport regarding the National Lottery Bill, in particular regarding the potential impact of clauses 7 and 8 on the Heritage Lottery Fund in Scotland.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2004-12-21.14.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80030" speakername="Ms Patricia Ferguson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-04/wa1221.htm#10">

  <p>The Scottish Executive has maintained a constant dialogue with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) during the drafting of the National Lottery Bill.</p>

  <p>Clause 7 is a power for the Secretary of State to reallocate money from the account of one distributor to the account of another, either for the same purpose or for another lottery good cause. It will only be exercised after a debate and affirmative resolution in each House of the Westminster Parliament and following consultation with the devolved administrations. The DCMS&rsquo; policy is that this reserve power will only be used when a distributor has built up an excessive balance and has not implemented the National Audit Office and DCMS recommendations for reducing it. In addition, under new section 29A, it has been decided that for the Heritage good cause, money will only be reallocated for heritage purposes.</p>

  <p>Clause 8 provides for the interest which is earned on all the unspent balances to be shared on the same basis as the income itself. Currently those distributors that have built up large balances retain the interest. Sharing interest fairly among all the good causes removes a possible incentive to maintain large unspent balances.</p>

  <p>We have not taken exception to the terms of these two clauses in the Westminster Bill, and have no plans to make representations to the UK Government regarding their potential impact.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive believes that all support, care and treatment services should be working to promote and support recovery.</p>

  <p>To help enable and facilitate this, the Scottish Executive has established the Scottish Recovery Network, which will be formally launched on 16 December 2004. The Scottish Recovery Network is funded with an initial budget of &pound;285,719 (2004 to 2006) of health improvement funds, through the National Programme for Improving Mental Health and Well-Being.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Recovery Network will compliment the work of health boards and local authorities and voluntary agencies in promoting and supporting recovery.</p>

  <p>In addition to core grants from health boards and local authorities, &pound;20 million is allocated to local authorities under the Mental Health Specific grant arrangements to support nearly 400 community based projects nationally, many of these support and complement recovery.</p>

  <p>In addition to support, care and treatment services, people&rsquo;s recovery is also promoted and supported through improving employment and employment opportunities for people, access to social, arts, cultural and recreational activities, training and education opportunities, housing and transport. Sections 25 &ndash; 27 of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003, identify the importance of these wider social issues as helping to promote the well-being and social development of people with a mental disorder.</p>

  <p>Supporting People funds the housing support needs of individuals: it was not introduced to deliver the policy of closure of long-stay learning disability hospitals.

  <p>We do not have information on the number of independent grocery retailers that have gone out of business in the last two years. However, the following table reports the number of independent businesses that closed in the grocery retail sector between 2001 and 2003, where a closure is defined as a business no longer appearing on the Inter Departmental Business Register (IDBR).</p>

  <p>The Executive made representation to the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), early in 2003, to the effect that there was a very strong view from suppliers in Scotland that the Supermarket Code of Practice was not working. The representation made it clear that fear of de-listing was preventing suppliers making complaints under the code, together with concerns about lack of substantive penalties for non-compliance. The outcome of this representation, and other similar representations, was the OFT&rsquo;s announcement of an audit of the code, aimed at establishing the effectiveness of the code. The report of the audit is nearing completion and is likely to be published early in 2005. The Executive will make further representation once the outcome of the audit is known.</p>

  <p>The Executive has received little formal correspondence where the supplier wanted to register concern over the Supermarket Code of Practice, but was reluctant to make an official complaint under the code. However, informal and anecdotal views have been expressed over the lack of effectiveness of the code. The Executive in all cases has invited complainants to contact the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), and also, early in 2003, made representation to the OFT about these views.</p>

  <p>The question of the effectiveness of the Supermarket Code of Practice is the subject of an audit being carried out by the Office of Fair Trading. The issue of change to the code will be considered in light of the results of that audit, which are due to be published early in 2005.

  <p>The question of the effectiveness of the operation of the Supermarket Code of Practice is currently the subject of an audit by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT). The Executive made representation to the OFT about the effectiveness of the code which, along with other representations, led to the audit being conducted.

  <p>I have met representatives from supermarkets on several occasions over the last two years, as have officials of the Executive. The main topic for discussion has been these companies&rsquo; sourcing policy in Scotland and their relationship with suppliers. I have also discussed other issues such as environmental concerns, including the use of plastic bags.</p>
