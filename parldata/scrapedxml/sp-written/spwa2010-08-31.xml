  <p>The UK Government has kept the Scottish Government informed of its proposals. The UK Government and the Scottish Government together with the Welsh Assembly Government and the Northern Ireland Executive are discussing options for a joint position statement on high-level principles for nature conservation.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-35599 on 31 August 2010. The natural environment crosses national boundaries and <em>An invitation to shape the Nature of England</em> recognises that the UK Government and the Devolved Administrations will need to work together for a strong UK position in EU negotiations over environmental policy.

  <p>The provision in the Patient Rights (Scotland) Bill at 16(d) (ii) states that a function of the Patient Rights Officers is to direct people &lsquo;to persons providing representation or advocacy services&rsquo; and this applies to all patients, irrespective of age. The Explanatory Notes, which accompanied the Bill, explain that new funding will be made available to cover the potential impact of this provision.</p>

  <p>NHS boards, working with partner organisations, should provide access to independent advocacy services to all users of NHS services (including the NHS complaints process) who need this support. The Scottish Independent Advocacy Alliance (SIAA) will work with NHS boards during 2010-11 to undertake a needs assessment and develop advocacy plans to ensure that any gaps in provision are addressed. The Principles and Standards for Independent Advocacy produced by the SIAA identifies the special considerations needed in relation to the provision of advocacy services for children and young people.</p>

  <p><em>Advocacy Makes You Feel Brave: Advocacy support for children and young people in Scotland </em>commissioned by the Scottish Executive was published in January 2010. The report makes a number of recommendations and dedicated work with relevant stakeholders is being forward on this.</p>

  <p>The Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 provides for everyone, including young people, with a mental disorder in Scotland &ndash; not just those who are subject to compulsory measures &ndash; to have a right of access to independent advocacy.</p>

  <p>Patient Rights Officers (PROs) will deliver the functions of the Patient Advice and Support Service (PASS) set out in the Patient Rights (Scotland) Bill at provision 15(2).</p>

  <p>The Common Services Agency (CSA) will secure the provision of the PASS, which will not be provided by either a health board, special health board or the CSA.</p>

  <p>The PASS will operate independently of NHS boards and NHS Complaints Officers and will provide advice and support in relation to patient rights. PASS will not investigate complaints but will provide advice and support to people who want to make a complaint about the healthcare they have received. PASS will also provide advice in relation to other support services such as advocacy.</p>

  <p>I have asked John Ewing, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service, to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The Prisoner Survey captures data from prisoners reporting to be in receipt of a methadone prescription and whether they are receiving a reducing dose.</p>

  <p>The following table is an extract from the Prisoner Survey 2009. The survey was conducted between 15 May and 10 July 2009. The overall response rate was 62%. Column (a) records the number within the establishment that responded to the survey; column (b) records the number reporting being prescribed methadone, and column (c) records the number who report they are in receipt of a reducing dose.</p>
