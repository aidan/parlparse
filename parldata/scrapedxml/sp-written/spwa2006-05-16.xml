  <p>The Scottish Executive expects to present to Parliament later this year an amending order to update the Community Right to Buy (Definition of Excluded Land)(Scotland) Order 2004. This will take account of changes to population statistics and settlement boundaries since implementation of the Community Right to Buy legislation in June 2004. The effective date will depend on Parliament&rsquo;s determination of the amending order, which will be subject to affirmative resolution.</p>

  <p>In accordance with ministers&rsquo; duties under the Electricity Act 1989 any application to construct a new nuclear power station would be fully considered on its individual merits.

  <p>17 May 2002 - Comment on the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) Technology Appraisal Guidance number 35 on the use of etanercept for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis.</p>

  <p>17 May 2002 - Comment on the NICE Technology Appraisal Guidance number 36 on the use of etanercept and infliximab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.</p>

  <p>The comments can be accessed at <a href="http://www.nhshealthquality.org" target="_blank">www.nhshealthquality.org</a>.</p>

  <p>On 12 July 2004, the SMC issued advice to NHSScotland on the use of etanercept for the treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults. The SMC advice can be accessed at: <a href="http://www.scottishmedicines.org" target="_blank">www.scottishmedicines.org</a>.</p>

  <p>In each case, the HTBS and the SMC advised that NHSScotland should take account of the advice and ensure that recommended drugs and treatments are made available to meet clinical need.</p>

  <p>The Rent (Scotland) Act 1984 makes it a criminal offence to evict a tenant without due process of law. Where allegations of such an offence are substantiated following investigation, the police will submit a report to the Procurator Fiscal for consideration of whether or not to raise criminal proceedings. We have no plans to alter these arrangements.</p>

  <p>The requirement in Part 8 of the Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004 for private landlords to register allows a local authority to act against a landlord who is using unacceptable letting practices. Evidence of illegal eviction or harassment would be material which could lead the local authority to decide that a landlord&rsquo;s registration should be refused or removed, leading to the potential for criminal and civil penalties should the landlord continue to let.</p>

  <p>Officials are in discussion with representatives of Shelter, ACPOS and COSLA on how police powers and the new local authority powers can be used most effectively to address illegal eviction.</p>

  <p>The only complaint of this nature of which we are aware is the complaint to which reference is made in the answer to question S2W-23612 on 20 April 2006.

  <p>Scotland already boasts a number of world class sports facilities but through the national and regional sports facilities strategy we are aiming to put in place a network of multi-sport facilities across Scotland, including a national indoor arena for competition. On coaches, many individual athletes will have their own personal coach and that is a decision for them. Through <strong></strong> sportscotland, however, the Executive grant aids a number of sports governing bodies to support the employment of high performance coaches.</p>

  <p>It is for individual athletes to decide the level they should aspire to. The Executive&rsquo;s role is to work with <strong></strong> sportscotland, the Scottish Institute of Sport network, governing bodies and other relevant sports organisations to ensure that the necessary infrastructure is in place to meet those aspirations. We are currently considering what further investment is needed to build on the successful performance of the Scottish team at the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how much VisitScotland has spent on marketing Scotland in Australia in each year since 1997; what forms of media have been used, and how much it will spend for these purposes in the next three years.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-05-16.40.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80030" speakername="Patricia Ferguson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0516.htm#18">

  <p>VisitScotland works closely with VisitBritain in marketing Scotland to the Australian tourism market as part of the Britain brand portfolio. VisitBritain&rsquo;s Australia marketing budget has risen from &pound;0.9 million in 1997-98 to &pound;1.4 million in 2005-06. Prior to 2004-05, VisitScotland invested only in public relations and travel trade activity in Australia. Its spend on marketing Scotland in Australia in 2003-04, 2004-05, and 2005-06 was &pound;20,000, &pound;100,000, and &pound;140,000 respectively. The increase in 2004-05 was aimed at exploiting the opportunities provided by the new Emirates Dubai-Glasgow service. In addition, the Edinburgh Military Tattoo visiting Sydney in 2005, and the VisitScotland budget was further increased in 2005-06 to exploit this opportunity.</p>

  <p>VisitScotland&rsquo;s marketing activity in Australia includes press and on-line advertising, e-promotions, public relations, and travel trade activity, all supported by VisitBritain&rsquo;s Britain brand portfolio. Given the future growth potential of the Australian market, VisitScotland plans to continue to invest at the same level as 2005-06 in future years.</p>
