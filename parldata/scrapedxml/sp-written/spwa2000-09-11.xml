  <p>My answer to question S1W-9281 confirms the Scottish Executive&#8217;s position on compensation and possible assistance for the scallop sector through the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG) programme.</p>

  <p>In February this year, I introduced a relaxation to licensing and quota management provisions to allow certain vessels with Category C licences which were affected by the scallop fishery closures to fish for West of Scotland nephrops until the end of August.</p>

  <p>In view of the most recent closures off the west coast, I have decided to extend this relaxation to the end of the year.</p>

  <p>During the 1990s, Fisheries Research Services participated in a number of collaborative projects to address the issue of whether the sandeel fishery had potential implications for wild salmonid stocks.</p>

  <p>Direct impacts were investigated by placing observers on sandeel trawlers off the Scottish east coast. No by-catch of salmon smolts was encountered. Potential indirect effects include the suggestion that the sandeel fishery might remove an important source of food for salmonids. An assessment of this possibility concluded that sandeels were just one of many prey species taken by salmonids, and that a properly managed sandeel fishery was unlikely to threaten the availability of this particular food source.</p>

  <p>The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 makes it an offence to release any fish not native to Great Britain into the wild without a licence. The Import of Live Fish (Scotland) Act 1978 also gives powers to Scottish Ministers to prohibit the import, keeping or release of fish that are not native to Scotland which might compete with, displace, prey on or harm the habitat of any freshwater fish, shellfish or salmon in Scotland. To date, only three Orders have been made under the 1978 Act. Whether further Orders should be made to prohibit other species which may be used as live bait will be considered under the <i>Protecting and Promoting Scotland&#8217;s Freshwater Fish and Fisheries</i> review.</p>

  <p>Under the provisions made in the UK Transport Bill, introduced on 1 December 1999, the Scottish Ministers will be able to issue directions and guidance to the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) for passenger rail services that begin and end in Scotland (effectively the ScotRail franchise). Since the Bill has not completed its passage through Parliament at Westminster, the Scottish Ministers are not yet able to exercise these powers.</p>

  <p>We will, however, shortly be consulting on strategic priorities for Scotland&#8217;s railways as part of the process of developing directions and guidance to the SRA. During this process we will give consideration to a wide range of issues, including proposals such as upgrading the railway line between Ayr and Mauchline.</p>

However, the Scottish Executive funds disease surveillance through the Scottish Agriculture College Disease Surveillance Centres (SACDSC) and records are kept of ragwort poisoning submissions.

  <p>The Scottish Executive investigates all reported incidents of ragwort on land where livestock are at risk, whether or not the land is in agricultural use.</p>

  <p>The Weeds Act 1959 places the responsibility for weeds control on the occupier of the land, and where livestock may be at risk, in the first instance, the Scottish Executive advises the occupier to carry out control measures. Where necessary, powers are available under the Weeds Act to give occupiers of land formal written notice requiring them to take such measures, failing which the Act has powers to enable the Executive, as a last resort, to employ control measures themselves and thereafter charge the occupier accordingly.</p>

  <p>Local authorities may also take action either under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 or the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 which provide powers for local authorities to serve notice on an occupier of any land which is harming the amenity of the area.</p>

  <p>No. But the Scottish Executive funds the Scottish Agriculture College to provide advice to farmers and horse owners on a wide variety of livestock diseases. The most recent Technical Note entitled <i>Ragwort Poisoning in Livestock &#8211; Prevention and Control</i> was published earlier this year. It is available free to Scottish Agriculture College subscribers and to other interested parties on request.</p>
