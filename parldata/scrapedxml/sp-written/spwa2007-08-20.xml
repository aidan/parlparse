  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>The information in this table has been extracted from the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service&rsquo;s Case Management Database. The database is a live, operational database used to manage the processing of reports submitted to procurators fiscal by the police and other reporting agencies. If a Procurator Fiscal amends a charge submitted by a reporting agency the database will record details only of the amended charge.</p>

  <p>The database is charge-based. The figures quoted therefore relate to the number of charges rather than the number of individuals charged or the number of incidents that gave rise to such charges.</p>

  <p>Scottish Executive funding to tackle antisocial behaviour is supporting community wardens in every local authority area in Scotland.

  <p>Funding for the performing arts in Scotland, including theatre, is disbursed by the Scottish Arts Council (SAC). Once I have set its overall budget, it is for the SAC to determine which organisations and bodies to fund. Further information about the work of the SAC is available at <a href="http://www.scottisharts.org.uk" target="_blank">www.scottisharts.org.uk</a> . The only exception is the funding of Scotland&rsquo;s five national performing companies, which includes The National Theatre of Scotland. Previously, these companies received funding from the Scottish Arts Council, however, since the beginning of this financial year they have been funded directly by the Scottish Government.</p>

  <p>I used this phrase within the context of the information available on the percentage of children learning a musical instrument compared to those who received vocal coaching.

  <p>Scottish Opera is one of Scotland&rsquo;s five national performing companies.

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to improving its understanding of flooding in Scotland. To this end we commissioned JBA Consulting to undertake the web-based development of the Scottish Asset Database project.</p>

  <p>The aim of the project is to provide a web-based tool to view detailed information on flood prevention schemes and their associated assets within Scotland. The database is a register of fluvial and coastal defences constructed in Scotland under the Flood Prevention (Scotland) Act 1961, containing detailed records of the assets, the defended areas and number of properties protected. In order to obtain this information a number of flood defences were assessed to establish the condition of the defences and the current standard of protection.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Flood Defence Asset database will be launched shortly enabling flood prevention practitioners and other professionals engaged in flood mitigation and management to use the website as a valuable reference source.</p>

  <p><em>The Scope to Improve Consistency in Sentencing</em> was presented to the previous administration and published in September 2006. It contains 25 recommendations which for the most part pertain to the introduction of a process for giving effect to sentencing guidelines and the creation of a new statutory body which would be responsible for their preparation and presentation for consideration to the Appeal Court of the High Court of Justiciary.</p>

  <p>We believe that there is a case for sentencing guidelines in order to deliver consistent sentencing and so improve public confidence in the criminal justice system. We are taking forward our consideration of the case for a Sentencing Council but our immediate priority in the context of sentencing is to improve the delivery of community sentences so as to improve judicial and public confidence in them as alternatives to custody.</p>

  <p>Scotland at present has no system of sentencing guidelines. We believe that there is a case for guidelines so as to deliver more consistent sentencing and for setting up a Sentencing Council to create them. However, we consider that there needs to be further consultation and dialogue with key interests, principally the judiciary, on the arguments for establishing such a body.</p>

  <p>The Protection of Vulnerable Groups (Scotland) Act 2007 is intended to deliver a modern, streamlined, efficient and effective vetting and barring system. The legislation will come into force once all the constituent elements are in place to ensure that that is what is delivered. This necessarily involves the development of processes and IT systems, a comprehensive programme of consultation and secondary legislation and guidance and training for users prior to the system going live.

  <p>There is no requirement to introduce further legislation to confirm St Andrew&rsquo;s Day as a national holiday. The St Andrew&rsquo;s Day Holiday (Scotland) Bill passed by Parliament on 30 November 2006 added St Andrew&rsquo;s Day to the list of statutory bank holidays in Schedule 1 of the Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971.</p>

  <p>We will engage with employee organisations and trade unions to encourage them to negotiate with their employees to come to a decision on St Andrew&rsquo;s Day and how best to celebrate Scotland&rsquo;s national day.</p>

  <p>The teacher census conducted in September every year will provide information on the total number of teachers employed at that time. The current estimate is that with the promised additional 300 posts teacher numbers may reach over 54,000 full-time equivalent at that time. It should be noted, however, that the total number of teachers employed by local authorities is in a constant state of flux due to teachers entering and leaving the profession as part of a normal turnover of staff.</p>

  <p>Funding has been provided to authorities to employ 300 additional teachers. Authorities will need to formulate plans for their deployment and the timing of their employment will be a matter for each authority although we are aware that teachers have been offered posts in recent weeks, made available by the Scottish Government&rsquo;s recent announcement of extra funding for the employment of teachers. We will monitor the employment of these teachers through the National Priorities Action Fund.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has provided funding for 300 additional teaching posts. The exact number employed by each local authority will be determined at local level and be influenced by such factors as the placement of individual teachers on the teachers&rsquo; salary scale.</p>

  <p>Early intervention is critical to reducing the number of young people who are not in education, employment or training &ndash; identifying those who are most at risk of disengaging and targeting the support they need. We must also ensure that the right learning experiences are available to young people.</p>

  <p>We are working closely with a range of partners, including local authorities, Careers Scotland, colleges, the voluntary sector, and employers to understand these young people&rsquo;s needs and ensure that the opportunities and support available to them are right.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body what information is available about carbon emissions from the Parliament building and what plans are in place to reduce emissions.</p>

  <p>The gas and electricity used in the Scottish Parliament building resulted in the emission of 328 tonnes of carbon in 2005-06 and 232 tonnes in 2006-07. In October 2005, the SPBC agreed an environmental policy which includes an objective to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.</p>

  <p>In order to help achieve this objective, a large range of actions have been undertaken to reduce the emissions directly attributed to the running of the building. A study was undertaken by the Carbon Trust to identify where energy use could be reduced and, based on this information, a target was set to reduce use by 8 per cent by March 2009. This target is on course to be met with a 3 per cent reduction achieved by March 2007. Progress towards the target will continue through a combination of:</p>

  <p>encouraging all building users to follow good practice by turning off equipment and lights, refinements to the operation of the building management and lighting management systems, and the installation of more efficient lighting and equipment.<br /> In October 2006, the Parliament moved from purchasing electricity generated from 80% renewable sources to 100% renewable sources, resulting in a significant reduction of 76 tonnes in carbon emissions.<br /> Indirect emissions resulting from travel and transport, waste and procurement are also being addressed through initiatives to reduce deliveries to the Parliament, to encourage staff to travel by sustainable modes, to prevent and minimise waste and to purchase sustainable goods such as recycled paper.<br /> We are also currently working towards calculating the Parliament&rsquo;s ecological footprint and carbon footprint and are investigating the feasibility of setting a target to become carbon neutral as well as the costs and benefits of carbon offsetting.</p>
