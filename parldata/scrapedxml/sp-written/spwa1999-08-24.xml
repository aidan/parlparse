  <p>It is for the EC Commission to monitor the position and take action as it judges necessary. The UK Permanent Representative to the European Union has already raised the German position with the Commission. All Member States have to comply with the Commission Decision setting 1 August as the date when beef may be exported under the Date Based Export Scheme. The majority of Member States have indicated that they will accept beef produced in accordance with DBES conditions. It would be for individual companies, rather than the government or the Executive, to seek redress in the Courts for losses incurred due to a Member State failing to implement its Community obligations.</p>

  <p>Not all the information requested is available. The most recent reliable population estimate available for the sparrowhawk is the 1988-91 Breeding Bird Atlas Survey. This gives an estimated figure of 7,000 breeding pairs.</p>

  <p>The most recent full survey of the peregrine was in 1991. This showed a population of 634 occupied territories (occupied territories will generally be occupied by a breeding pair of birds, but not in every case, and single occupancy does occur). The previous figures were: 1961 &#150; 446 occupied territories; 1971 &#150; 365 occupied territories; and 1981 &#150; 489 occupied territories.</p>

  <p>Arrangements vary for different species. Common species such as the kestrel sparrowhawk and buzzard are monitored by the Breeding Bird Survey organised by the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO). In Scotland much work is undertaken by Raptor Study Group members, all of whom are volunteers and undertake the work in their spare time.</p>

  <p>Some scarce species (e.g. peregrine, merlin, hen harrier and golden eagle) are surveyed by dedicated professional surveyors who are employed by one of the main bird conservation groups such as RSPB.</p>

  <p>All surveyors are familiar with the species concerned and possess good field ornithological skills. Where appropriate, they are licensed by Scottish Natural Heritage, and in this event SNH undertakes checks on all applicants to establish that they are fit and proper persons to undertake such work.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive holds records of all licensed fishing vessels administered by Scottish ports. These records include any associated Fixed Quota Allocation units, details of catches of quota species and the names and addresses of licence holders, whether resident in Scotland or not. Information on fishing vessels, licences and quotas elsewhere in the UK is obtained where necessary from other UK Fisheries Departments.</p>

  <p>There are no territorial restrictions on the transfer of fishing vessels, licences or quota within the UK. This reflects the highly mobile nature of the industry and the stocks they prosecute.

  <p>The criteria for the prescription of Beta Interferon are based on objective consideration of all available guidance. This includes guidance about new drugs for multiple sclerosis, which was issued to all Health Boards in 1995 from The Scottish Office Department of Health and the advice from their expert Committees.</p>

  <p>The criteria contained in the advice given by the Standing Medical Advisory Committee is that GPs should determine on clinical grounds whether to refer patients for specialist assessment. The clinical grounds include mobility and disease type. The specialist should take into account the patient's clinical history and contra indications of the drug when determining the suitability of treatment for an individual patient. Where treatment is indicated, it should be initiated and continued by the specialist. Only certain patients with multiple sclerosis benefit from the use of this drug, and decisions as to individual patients' eligibility for treatment depends on the clinical judgement of the medical practitioners' concerned.</p>

  <p>We are committed to increasing recycling where it provides benefits by saving natural resources, reducing energy consumption and waste disposal, and cutting costs to business. While a number of universities are involved in projects in this area, it is a decision for them as to how they commit their resources.</p>

  <p>On 18 August, I was pleased to launch a new project, REMADE, which is aimed at demonstrating the potential value of materials from recycled waste in Scotland. The &pound;1 million three year market development programme is to be funded jointly by The Scottish Executive, Local Authorities, Scottish Environment Protection Agency, Scottish Enterprise, Valpak Ltd and landfill tax credits (from Haulwaste and Shanks Waste Solutions). It is intended that the programme will be lead by Caledonian Shanks Centre for Waste Management, a part of Glasgow Caledonian University.</p>

  <p>The effect on the number of car journeys arising from any road charging scheme would depend critically on the characteristics of the scheme, including the charge levels set, the hours over which they applied, the categories of vehicle/road user exempt from charges and the alternative transport options put in place using the resulting revenue.</p>

  <p>In recognising the important role which these bodies can play in supporting voluntary organisations and community groups in this work, I intend to commission a review to examine how the role of the Councils of Voluntary Service in delivering the social inclusion agenda can be strengthened. I have asked that priority be given to work on the review so that I can consider its recommendations in the late Autumn.</p>

  <p>The development of an equal opportunities policy for the Parliament is ultimately a matter for the Parliament itself.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body recently endorsed the establishment of a Working Group, comprising Parliamentary officials and MSPs, to take forward consideration of this issue and to report in due course to the Corporate Body with a draft equal opportunities policy for the Parliament. Details of the Working Group, its membership and remit, will be published in &quot;What&#146;s Happening in the Scottish Parliament&quot;.<br /></p>
