  <p>I refer the member to the Executive&#8217;s position on the Cuillins sale, which I set out in the debate held on 11 May. Since that time the Crown Estate have investigated title to the Cuillin Estate and concluded that they have no claim to title.</p>

  <p>A Scottish Executive co-funded GB survey into mental health of children and adolescents showed approximately 10% with a mental disorder. No significant geographic differences were shown.</p>

  <p>The results of the survey are being used to inform future planning of services and areas of research that could further assist in the best organisation of child and adolescent services, screening and support. The Scottish Executive is funding three separate studies into mental health problems amongst school-age children. &pound;225,000 has been awarded for research into adolescent psychiatry outpatient services, adolescent depression in schools and adolescent psychosis. A further 18 projects are under way in NHS Trusts in Scotland on child and adolescent mental health problems.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has any plans to give local authorities powers to cleanse litter on private land when it does not constitute an environmental health hazard.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-09-25.S1W-9564.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80134" speakername="Sarah Boyack" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa0925.htm#9564">

  <p>Section 90 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 allows local authorities to designate certain categories of land not in public ownership as litter control areas. They may do so if they are of the opinion that the presence of litter or refuse on the land is detrimental to the amenity of the area and is likely to remain so. Designating land as a litter control area places a duty on the occupier of the land to keep it free of litter and refuse. Failure to do so risks court proceedings being instigated against the occupier by the local authority or an aggrieved member of the public.</p>

  <p>There are no plans to extend existing local authority powers regarding litter on privately owned land.</p>

  <p>Provision of oral and maxillofacial services in Grampian is a matter for Grampian University Hospitals NHS Trust and Grampian Health Board. The Scottish Executive has, however, substantially increased funding to health boards this year with a view to securing a range of improvements to services, including reductions in waiting lists and waiting times. At over &pound;416 million, Grampian Health Board&#8217;s revenue allocation is 5.25% greater than its comparable allocation in 1999-2000.</p>

  <p>The latest local authority estimates of the number of houses below the Tolerable Standard (BTS), as at 31 March 1999, were published in the housing series statistical bulletin HSG/2000/1, copies of which are available from SPICe. Notes to the table explain that the 1996 Scottish House Condition Survey gave a national BTS estimate which was significantly lower than the amalgamation of local authority estimates for 1996. A research study commissioned by the Scottish Executive to identify the reasons for the divergence will shortly be published and will be helpful in allowing more accurate numbers to be compiled in the future.</p>

  <p>We are committed to increasing the number of doctors working in the NHS in Scotland, particularly in the area of cancer treatment. That is why I have recently announced a package of additional investment in the workforce which includes provision for 10 extra consultant posts, eight of which will be in the specialties of radiology and histopathology, and 100 extra junior doctors.</p>

  <p>The Executive also met last year with representatives of the Royal College of Radiologists to discuss workforce issues and, as a result of this meeting, increased the number of posts for doctors in higher specialist training in this specialty from 71 to 76. Further increases in trainee numbers will be considered in the future to improve the balance of supply and demand in the coming years.</p>

  <p>The latest information supplied by ISD Scotland indicates that there is an adequate supply of qualified radiographers to fill current establishment posts, as at 30 April 1999 only 0.9% of whole-time equivalent posts had been vacant for three months or more.</p>

  <p>I refer Ms Cunningham to the answer the Minister gave to question S1W-5668. The 1999 Review of Medical Service Provision looked at how current contractual arrangements might be improved. Prison healthcare staff, the Health Department, together with a number of NHS Primary Care Trusts and commercial organisations, were consulted.</p>
