  <p>Food labelling is a devolved matter and the Scottish Parliament has powers to legislate in this area but only within the parameters of EU legislation. The Food Standards Agency is responsible for implementing EU legislation as it relates to labelling standards and for providing advice to Scottish Ministers on food labelling and other issues. The Food Standards Agency will require enforcement authorities to ensure that standards are met, so that consumers have sufficient information to make informed choices about the food they buy.</p>

  <p>The working group was set up by the English Chief Medical Officer, and its remit extends only to producing good practice guidelines for England. It would not be appropriate for Scottish representatives to take a direct part in this.

  <p>The Annual Survey of Information and Communications Technology, carried out across a sample of Scottish schools in October 1999, showed that 12% of teachers had access to e-mail. The information requested is not available by local authority area. We are aware that since the survey was carried out a number of local authorities have provided e-mail addresses to all their teachers. We expect that this year&#8217;s survey will show a considerably higher percentage.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive, and before it, The Scottish Office, has always taken a close interest in the future of the Longannet deep mine and has maintained close contact with Mining Scotland. The company has kept Scottish Ministers informed on a day-to-day basis of the issues that were recently facing the deep mine. Ministers are delighted that new shareholder funding has been made available to enable the mine to continue in operation and they wish Mining Scotland well under its new ownership.</p>

  <p>I apologise for the delay in providing the answer to this question which arose because of an administrative error. We are reviewing procedures to minimise the risk of such errors in future.</p>

  <p>Between 1 July and 31 December, Ministers replied to 3,719 letters from MSPs and MPs.</p>

  <p>The volume of correspondence from MSPs and MPs has risen by about a third since the establishment of the Parliament. The proportion receiving replies within the target of 17 working days has fallen from around 60% before May 1999 to 41% for the period between July and December 1999.</p>

  <p>To help improve response times, the Executive is improving and standardising the recording, monitoring and workflow systems used to handle ministerial correspondence. The introduction of a new corporate system will enable central scanning, logging and allocation of all ministerial correspondence and will produce management information not readily available at present. This will include information on cases in progress and average response times. The introduction of the new system is due to be completed in the spring of 2000.</p>

  <p>Correspondence is handled by staff in relevant policy areas as part of their general responsibilities. Specific work on the handling of correspondence is not budgeted for or recorded separately. A study of the cost of answering ministerial correspondence is planned after the new system has been introduced across the Executive: this will provide cost estimates on a comparable basis to those used for Parliamentary Questions. The results of this study will be made available to members.</p>

  <p>While the economic evaluation of the 1999 event does demonstrate potential for growth, this is dependent on significant increases in the number of competitors and supporters. At the time the decision not to hold the event in 2000 was taken, there had been fewer than half the number of applications as at the equivalent date last year.</p>

  <p>The detailed growth potential, as outlined in the economic impact assessment of the 1999 event, is illustrated in the table below, but again it must be stressed that achieving the designated target of runners is the main determinant in realising these figures.</p>

  <p>The Ministerial Group on Sustainable Scotland was established as part of the delivery of the <i>Programme for Government</i> commitment to integrate the principles of environmentally and socially sustainable development into all Government policies.</p>

  <p>The remit is to:</p>

  <p>identify priorities for action on sustainable development in Scotland;</p>

  <p>co-ordinate implementation action;</p>

  <p>support Cabinet colleagues in embedding sustainable development in their policies and programmes;</p>

  <p>report to Cabinet on these matters.</p>

  <p>The members of the group are listed below, but others may be invited to join as the work of the group develops.</p>

  <p>Sarah Boyack MSP Minister for Transport and the Environment</p>

  <p>Ms Wendy Alexander MSP Minister for Communities</p>

  <p>Mr Jack McConnell MSP Minister for Finance</p>

  <p>Nicol Stephen MSP Deputy Minister for Enterprise &amp; Lifelong Learning</p>

  <p>Kevin Dunion OBE Friends of the Earth Scotland</p>

  <p>Mark Hope Shell UK Exploration and Production</p>

  <p>At its first two meetings the group reviewed the task ahead and identified the main priorities for sustainable development in Scotland as resource use, energy and travel. It set in train work on developing indicators of sustainable development and on guidance for public bodies. Over coming months it will examine policy proofing mechanisms, greening government and procurement. The group expects to consult widely as it makes progress and will report to Parliament in the autumn.</p>

  <p>Recycling of sludge to agricultural land is the most sustainable environmental option for disposal or re-use of sludge in most cases. It is controlled under the Sewage Sludge (Use in Agriculture) Regulations 1989 and a supporting Code of Practice. Sludge may be recycled by spreading on land or injection into it, depending on how the sludge has been treated, and the Code of Practice lists acceptable treatment processes, including composting. Sewage sludge contains significant proportions of nitrogen, phosphorus and organic matter and is a fertiliser in its own right. Following a recent agreement between the British Retail Consortium and the water industry, which sets even tighter voluntary standards, including ruling out altogether the use of untreated sludge on farmland, we plan to amend the current Regulations to increase further the statutory safety standards.</p>

  <p>The car park forms part of the substructure works package for the west part of the site and comprises 45% of the total west basement area. The costs for the car parking area and the building structure support cannot be separately identified.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer what is (a) the total value of the contracts awarded to date in respect of the Holyrood project, (b) the percentage of the total value that related to prime costs, provisional sums and contingency, and (c) the estimated value of those contracts at completion.</p>

  <p>The information is as follows:</p>

  <p>The total value of works packages awarded to date is &pound;13.5 million.</p>

  <p>The level of provision sums is on average 2%. The project cost estimate contains an overall contingency allowance which is not allocated to individual works packages.</p>

  <p>The estimated final value of the works packages awarded to date is &pound;15 million.</p>

  <p>These costs exclude site purchase, demolition, archaeology, design team fees and VAT.</p>

  <p>The base works cost estimate will be used in the final fee calculation for each of the design team members and will directly relate to the amount of work done to the date of cancellation. The SPCB&#8217;s agreement will be required.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer, <a name="QuestionText"> further to the answer to question S1W-232 by him on 8 July 1999, whether the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body will list the numbers and categories of staff to be accommodated in the new Parliament building for each of the cost reports contained in paragraph 4.2 of the Spencely Report.</a></p>

  <p>I have updated in the table below the information given in my answer to question S1W-232 to reflect the staff and wider occupancy levels covered in the latest design scheme. It is not possible for me to provide figures that can be readily applied to fit in with the table referred to in Mr Spencely&#8217;s report.</p>

  <p>Note: The additional numbers recorded for March 2000 do not all translate into additional space requirements. For example, an adjustment to the scheme design for the MSP Block now enables two research staff to occupy the office space adjustment to each MSP room.</p>
