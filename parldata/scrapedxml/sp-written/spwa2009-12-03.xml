  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive which NHS boards make sentinel node biopsy available to patients with breast cancer.</p>

  <p>Sentinel node biopsy is currently available to all breast cancer patients in Scotland where this is clinically appropriate. Services are configured so that all suitable patients are offered the procedure at their nearest breast cancer unit providing it.</p>

  <p>All breast surgeons are required to undertake the necessary training before performing this procedure and have to comply with nationally agreed protocols regarding training and monitoring. Training in the sentinel node biopsy technique is delivered locally and consideration is currently being given to the training needs of new recruits.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-18880 on 8 January 2009 where I outlined that Better Cancer Care: An Action Plan stated that the Scottish Government together with the Regional Cancer Advisory Groups and NHS boards would explore the feasibility of sentinel node biopsy being made available across NHSScotland. Scottish Government has not committed to undertaking a feasibility study into the availability of sentinel node biopsy.</p>

  <p>The regional cancer networks have been working with their constituent NHS boards to progress making sentinel node biopsy available across NHSScotland and as the above information denotes, the procedure is now available across all regions.</p>

  <p>In Scotland, a Significant Case Review will be undertaken in those instances identified in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s national guidance <em>Protecting Children &amp; Young People: Interim Guidance for Child protection Committees for Conducting a Significant Case Review</em> .

  <p>As Mr Henry knows from the response to his freedom of information request of 27 February 2008 it is considered that the minute of the meeting with universities does not describe the advice given to ministers with sufficient accuracy to provide the information requested. If it were ministers would then have to consider whether the exemptions to disclosure in the Freedom of Information Act applied and if so whether in the circumstances of the case the public interest in disclosing the information is not outweighed by that of maintaining the exemption.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government welcomes the <em>Digital Britain Report</em> &rsquo;s intention to implement a universal service commitment (USC) for broadband at 2 megabits per second (Mbps), which is an improvement on our current commitment of provision of basic broadband (defined at 512Kbps) to known demand. At this time we have no plans to set a different target.</p>

  <p>We have formally requested from the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) for there to exist an appropriate mechanism by which the Scottish Government can effectively contribute to the work of the Network Design and Procurement Group (NDPG), which will have responsibility, at UK level, for delivery of the USC. However to date, we have not reached agreement with BIS on this matter.</p>

  <p>We are hopeful that BIS will agree to a formal mechanism by which the Scottish Government can represent Scotland&rsquo;s particular needs, issues and experiences at UK level to the NDPG. Through this mechanism, we are hopeful that we can work with the NDPG to try to ensure delivery of the USC at 2Mbps to Scottish citizens, and that Scotland benefits from an appropriate share of the UK funding. The UK Government has not made any formal approach to the Scottish Government for a contribution to the funding package.</p>

  <p>It is not known by the Scottish Government how many consumers currently do not have access to broadband at a speed of 2Mbps. Similarly, it is not known whether or not the backhaul infrastructure in Scotland is sufficient to allow delivery of the USC at 2Mbps, nor are we aware of, or do we currently plan to commission work to assess, any bottlenecks in backhaul capacity.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s current commitment extends to provision of a basic broadband service (defined as 512Kbps) only, to known demand. This notwithstanding, we are in the early stages of defining our policy towards next-generation broadband. To produce an updated evidence-base to inform policy development in this area, I have already hosted an industry seminar, and officials will early next year be commissioning research and engaging with other public and private sector interests.</p>

  <p>It is too early to say what direction this future policy will take, but in our approach, we will certainly consider all appropriate broadband technologies, including wireless; different intervention models, including demand-side ones; and existing public sector-led and community-led projects, of which Cybermoor is an example of the latter.</p>

  <p>The primary responsibility to safeguard property and businesses from hazards of nature such as flooding lies with the owners concerned. They are required to take all reasonable steps to protect their property from such hazards.</p>

  <p>However, farmers can expect advice on flood risk and flood warnings from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA). SEPA operates flood warning schemes on most of the large rivers and their tributaries in Perthshire and Angus, with warnings for the North Esk becoming operational in March 2010. Farmers can currently access information on flooding through SEPA&rsquo;s Floodline telephone system, 0845 988 1188, or SEPA&rsquo;s website <a href="http://www.sepa.org.uk" target="_blank">www.sepa.org.uk</a>. SEPA&rsquo;s Flood Warnings Direct service will become operational in March 2011 when farmers who pre-register their landlines and mobiles with SEPA, will be sent messages free of charge about flooding in areas covered by flood warning schemes. The messages will point them to Floodline for more detailed information; providing them with crucial time to take action.</p>

  <p>With Parliament&rsquo;s support we accelerated some &pound;350 million of capital spending from 2010-11 into 2008-09 and 2009-10. That money has delivered real benefits, but it means, of course, that the budget for 2010-11 had to be reduced accordingly. Similarly if we seek to accelerate capital spending into 2010-11 we will have to repay it in subsequent years and for the GARL project the call on capital funding would be greatest in 2011 through to 2014.</p>

  <p>Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) has no records of paying grants to the Loch Lomond Regional Park, which ceased to operate as regional park following the designation of the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park in 2002.</p>

  <p>As part of the Concordat agreed by Scottish Government and Convention of Scottish Local authorities, Scottish ministers agreed to transfer to the local government finance settlement for 2009-10 and 2010-11, the resources which SNH would have paid to local authorities for their natural heritage projects on the basis that this would enable local authorities to determine local priorities in the use of these funds. This transfer took account of the funds which SNH had previously paid to regional parks. SNH will, however, continue to respond to requests for advice from the regional parks and from the local authority partners who constituted the regional parks.</p>

  <p>The Periodic Review for Control Period 4 (2009-14) includes confirmation from the Office of Rail Regulation that the projects Airdrie to Bathgate, GARL mainline and Glasgow Barrhead Kilmarnock are funded through the Network Rail Regulatory Asset Base (RAB). The associated payments are included within the current determination payments to Network Rail.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland is also pursuing the necessary process with Network Rail and the Office of Rail Regulation to secure the use of RAB finance for a number of other projects, including: the Edinburgh&ndash;Glasgow Improvements programme; the provision of escalators and lifts at Edinburgh Waverley; extended platforms and other infrastructure works in Ayrshire and Inverclyde to facilitate the introduction of the new electric train fleet and improvements to parts of the Highland rail network.</p>

  <p>RAB funding is where Network Rail finances the investment, from borrowing against the value of their asset base and repays the loans from the revenue stream provided by government over the life of the project, which for rail is normally thirty years.</p>

  <p>I am currently considering a proposal which would enable the Iona Community to deliver anti-sectarian workshops in adult prisons. This would be an extension of the work they currently undertake with inmates at Polmont Young Offenders Institution using <em>Beyond a Culture of Two Halves, </em> an anti-sectarian youth work education resource developed by YouthLink Scotland, for which we provided &pound;22,000 and which I launched in December 2008.</p>

  <p>Following the outcome of the Central Scotland Transport Corridor Studies which were announced in 2003, the then ministers decided that in view of their policy aspirations for traffic stabilisation in the medium term, the recommended full upgrade as indicated by the Congestion Reference Flow, should be replaced by a limited upgrade. This upgrade would provide an appropriate balance in terms of operational improvements, while limiting any unsustainable growth in traffic volumes. An important part of that decision was the undertaking that, should they be required, integral traffic management measures would be implemented to maintain an acceptable level of service on the route. These measures may include ramp metering to assist joining traffic to take advantage of the gaps in the mainline traffic and upstream ramp availability constraints and online metering to give priority to high occupancy vehicles and other economically important traffic.</p>
