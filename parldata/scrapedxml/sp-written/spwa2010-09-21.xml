  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it regards the powers available to inspectors in the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006 as sufficient to inspect, investigate and instigate a prosecution where a farmer is suspected of having failed to ensure the welfare of animals.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-09-21.S3W-36074.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80340" speakername="Richard Lochhead" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa0921.htm#1">

  <p>The Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006 empowers inspectors to enter and inspect any premises, with the exception of domestic premises, without a warrant if they have reason to believe that animal welfare offences have been committed.</p>

  <p>A warrant from a sheriff or justice of the peace is required to allow an inspector to enter domestic premises or to carry out a search of the premises, except where the delay in obtaining a warrant would frustrate the purpose for the search.</p>

  <p>These provisions are satisfactory to allow entry, inspection and investigation for inspectors and the need to obtain a warrant in certain circumstances provide appropriate safeguards for the public.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is aware that the Department of Health plans to publish later in the year, a consultation on establishing a cancer drugs fund from April 2011 and that interim funding will be made available for cancer drugs via clinically led panels in October 2010. The Scottish Government will give due consideration to the consultation and its proposals when further details are made available following the Comprehensive Spending Review.</p>

  <p>However, the extant guidance on the introduction and availability of newly licensed medicines published on 17 May 2010 provides a robust, equitable and transparent framework for NHS boards to make decisions about all newly licensed medicines and not just those to treat cancer. The guidance includes specific advice in relation to making such decisions for individual patients. These arrangements are intended to ensure that, where there are demonstrable benefits, NHS patients in all parts of Scotland are able to access newly licensed medicines in accordance with their particular needs.</p>

  <p>Implementation of the Wider Role Fund is administered by officials within the Housing and Regeneration Directorate. Current monitoring procedures are as follows:</p>

  <p>Each grant award letter contains a schedule listing activities, outputs and outcomes the project intends to achieve.</p>

  <p>At quarterly intervals RSLs provide monitoring information for their projects. This sets out progress compared to that anticipated in the grant award letter.</p>

  <p>Monitoring visits are made to randomly selected projects.</p>

  <p>Informal monitoring of project progress is undertaken through regular contact with RSLs.</p>

  <p>The fund is subject to standard Scottish Government financial monitoring and reporting systems.</p>

  <p>Selected projects are written up as case studies and published online by the Scottish Centre for Regeneration&rsquo;s Learning Networks.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is opposed to holding the proposed Alternative Vote referendum on the same day as elections to the Scottish Parliament.</p>

  <p>The timing of the Scottish Parliament elections is set out in the Scotland (Act) 1998. The date of the proposed referendum will be set by the UK Government&rsquo;s Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Bill. Neither the Scottish Government nor the Scottish Parliament has the power to change the date of Scottish Parliament elections or the proposed UK referendum. This is one reason why we will continue to press the UK Government to devolve legislative responsibility for elections to the Scottish Parliament.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has a clear commitment to decarbonise the electricity generation sector by 2030 and strongly supports the early demonstration of CCS at commercial scale. As stated in our Roadmap published in March 2010, the role of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) in this process will be subject to a rolling review of its technical and economic viability.</p>

  <p>That review process will also take place in conjunction with the knowledge gained from UK and EU CCS demonstration programmes. Should CCS be deemed not to be technically feasible, it will be important to ensure that any future liabilities are fully understood and effectively addressed.</p>

  <p>In such a circumstance, we would expect other market interventions, such as revisions to the EU Emissions Trading Scheme and the proposed UK-wide Emissions Performance Standard would be used to ensure decarbonisation of electricity generation by 2030, whilst maintaining security of supply.</p>

  <p>The costs to engage the consultants to undertake the Study will be about &pound;25,000.

  <p>It is very unlikely that Marine Scotland&rsquo;s compliance monitoring capability will prove to be insufficient for current or anticipated future tasks. In extreme circumstances, and if absolutely necessary, short-term issues can be dealt with by Marine Scotland chartering a suitable vessel and placing its own enforcement officers on board. This is not an unusual practice in many other countries. Marine Scotland do not anticipate requesting assistance from the Royal Navy.</p>

  <p>We are aware the Scottish Huntington&rsquo;s Association believes there are between 600 and 900 people in Scotland with the disease. The upper end of that range would suggest a prevalence higher than the internationally accepted figure of 1 in 10,000.

  <p>In NHS Ayrshire and Arran, a Huntington&rsquo;s disease (HD) management clinic is led by a consultant liaison psychiatrist, and a HD specialist nurse service is provided by the Scottish Huntington&rsquo;s Association. The board has developed a care pathway for those with HD, as a result of which specialist services are thought to be well integrated with other health and social work agencies.</p>

  <p>In NHS Dumfries and Galloway, people living with HD are supported by the single gene complex needs service. The project is funded by the Scottish Government, and one of its main roles is to provide direct support to families living with single gene conditions, such as HD, that cause complex physical, cognitive and/or psychiatric change.</p>

  <p>We have indicated our strong support for the implementation of NHS Quality Improvement Scotland&rsquo;s clinical standards for neurological health services, published in January. To encourage that process, we are offering funding of around &pound;550,000 in total to the territorial NHS boards to help them develop neurological managed clinical networks as the main vehicle for driving local improvements in services for all neurological conditions, including Huntington&rsquo;s disease.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s challenging target of 18 weeks from referral to treatment is not due for delivery until end December 2011. ISD Scotland has started to collect data on the 18 weeks referral to treatment time, but it is at an early stage of development. ISD is currently assessing the quality and the reliability of the data ahead of any publication. They hope to announce plans for publication of this new data in the near future.</p>

  <p>We continue to monitor the milestone stage of treatment time standards set as part of the delivery of the 18 weeks referral to treatment time target. The latest published figure for 30 June 2010, showed that NHS Scotland effectively delivered a 12 week wait for a first outpatient consultation and nine weeks for inpatient and day case treatment &ndash; three weeks earlier than the current waiting time standard. In addition, 99.8% of patients received one of the eight key diagnostic tests within four weeks &ndash; two weeks earlier than the current standard. This excellent performance clearly indicates that NHS Scotland is well on track to deliver the 18 weeks referral to treatment time target.</p>

  <p>Extant guidance contained within the Scottish Capital Investment Manual (SCIM) issued to NHS boards on 1 May 2009 already requires NHS boards to test all new build projects over &pound;20 million for private finance.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is supporting the development of the hub initiative, a new joint venture delivery vehicle being taken forward by the Scottish Futures Trust. This will support the delivery of community based facilities for public sector bodies and will utilise both public and private finance. NHS boards will be expected to test private finance for projects delivered through the hub initiative. The application of private finance is predicated on the demonstration of value for money.</p>

  <p>The recommendations of the Capital Strategy Group do not change the Scottish Government&rsquo;s position on the use of private finance.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has successfully applied the Non Profit Distributing model within NHSScotland and will continue to do so where value for money is demonstrated.</p>

  <p>The hub initiative being taken forward by the Scottish Futures Trust is supporting collaborative planning and procurement of community based facilities across public sector bodies. This model will utilise both public and private finance where appropriate.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government considers that the use of private finance should only be considered where value for money can be demonstrated. The Scottish Government believes that the Non Profit Distributing model demonstrates best value to the tax payer by capping private sector returns.</p>

  <p>The median wait for a first assessment with an audiologist for the quarter ending 30 June 2010, by NHS board is as follows.</p>

  <p>Information on waiting times to see an audiologist is published by ISD Scotland as data under development. The quality and accuracy of the data are continuing to be monitored and ISD Scotland is actively working with NHS boards to improve consistency, completeness and timeliness of audiology data.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has included audiology services in the 18 weeks referral to treatment time target, which is due for delivery by end December 2011. This is the first time that patients requiring audiology services will be covered by a waiting time target. NHS boards are now actively working to reduce waits for this service.</p>

  <p>I have asked John Ewing, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS), to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>(a) The total net cost on the legal aid fund legal aid for those prisoners who have raised proceedings is &pound;376,014. This cost includes the payment of some final accounts. A large part of this cost is made up of cases where the case has not been concluded and the solicitor has been paid on account. These cases are where an action has been raised and sisted whilst a few test cases are pursued. Depending on the outcome of the test cases much of this cost may end up being paid under judicial expenses and therefore will not be a cost on the legal aid fund.</p>

  <p>(b) The estimated cost of defending the proceedings since May 2007 can only be obtained at disproportionate cost. The Scottish Government Legal Directorate represents the Scottish ministers in most of the actions raised since May 2007. As in-house solicitors, their costs are not charged directly to SPS. SPS records from April 2008 show the cost for defending proceedings has been &pound;217,067. These are largely counsel costs. In addition each case is likely to have incurred the following court costs:</p>

  <p>Notification of Intention to Defend: approximately &pound;80</p>

  <p>Motion to sist: approximately &pound;40</p>

  <p>This would give an additional indicative cost of approximately &pound;249,600 for the 2,080 actions.</p>

  <p>(c) The cost of payment in compensation to successful litigants to September 2010 is &pound;297,500.</p>

  <p><em>Public Sector Pay Policy for Senior Appointments 2010-11</em> , published on 5 May 2010, sets out the Scottish Government&rsquo;s policy for public sector pay for chief executives of NDPBs and public corporations:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2010/04/27100002/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2010/04/27100002/0</a></p>

  <p>The guidance makes clear that where a contractual entitlement exists, a non consolidated performance related pay may be proposed in recognition of exceptional performance; that any such proposals must include robust supporting evidence; and must be approved by the Scottish Government before any payment is made.</p>

  <p>Since May 2007, we have consistently borne down on both the scale and the coverage of non-consolidated performance-related payments for senior public sector staff. We have reduced the total number of chief executives who have a contractual entitlement for non consolidated performance related pay through changed terms of employment on appointment.</p>

  <p>In addition, in 2009-10 and again this year, we have asked the chairs of non-departmental public bodies and public corporations to invite their chief executives to waive part or all of any bonus to which they may be entitled.</p>

  <p>In the tough financial climate facing us we will continue to restrain the pay and reward packages of senior public sector leaders.</p>

  <p>A number of very significant items of work have been undertaken on the Borders Railway in 2010, the most notable being procurement and utilities work.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland commenced formal procurement with the publication of a Contract Notice in the <em>Official Journal of the European Union</em> (OJEU) in late December 2009. A Market Day held in January 2010 to promote the contract was attended by over 55 UK and European companies, resulting in a strong response with five formal expressions of interest received. The five organisations that submitted an expression of interest, comprising a total of 12 construction and financial companies, submitted pre-qualification questionnaires in March 2010. A rigorous and robust evaluation was then undertaken by Transport Scotland to identify the preferred organisations to be invited to participate in the next stage of procurement. Three successful organisations were announced in June 2010 and are currently participating in a period of competitive dialogue with Transport Scotland, set to continue over the next year, to discuss their proposals for delivering the railway and associated infrastructure.</p>

  <p>On 3 March 2010, ancillary works started on site at Galashiels. This package of works includes the movement or protection of a large number of utilities along the route, as well as additional environmental work. These utilities works triggered a clause in the Waverley Railway (Scotland) Act 2006 which states that once work has begun on the railway, the Scottish Government must finish it in its entirety from Edinburgh to Tweedbank.</p>

  <p>With reference to when the line will open to passenger train services, I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-27487 on 25 September 2009.

  <p>District heating is a new focus in our policy development and actions relating to this will be highlighted in the forthcoming energy efficiency action plan.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Government is funding a heat mapping pilot in the Highland Council area. The data collected will incorporate heat demand and supply as well as skills and services.

  <p>In response to enquiries from the Clerk of the Petitions Committee, the Scottish Government replied on 3 March 2009 to say that a feasibility study had been undertaken in spring 2009 into the operation and levels of the Personal Expenses Allowance (PEA). The study revealed that there was limited primary evidence about how residents receive and make use of the PEA, and it set out options and methodologies for undertaking further research about the PEA. The letter went on to explain that any decisions about research on the PEA would feed into the wide ranging review of long-term care funding and delivery in Scotland, and that engagement with stakeholders would be a key part of the long term review.</p>

  <p>Since the date of that letter, many programmes are underway, including our Reshaping Care for Older People Programme, both in Scotland and across the UK, looking at all aspects of the future shape and delivery of long term care for older people including how that care is funded. As this work progresses it would be unhelpful to focus attention narrowly on the value of the PEA. The financial implications of any increase in the PEA would need to be considered within the context of other pressures and priorities for the social care budget.</p>

  <p>The PEA feasibility study took the form of desk-based research relying on evidence and research already in the public domain, and a literature search of published data and reports was undertaken and reviewed. The feasibility study can be accessed on the Scottish Government website at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/care/CrossCuttingIssues/feasibilitypea" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/care/CrossCuttingIssues/feasibilitypea</a>.</p>

  <p>The Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth wrote to the chairs of non-departmental public bodies in April 2010 asking them to invite their chief executives to consider waiving, on a voluntary basis, some or all of any bonus they might be offered in 2010-11 (in respect of exceptional performance in 2009-10). The bonus payment to the current Chief Executive of Scottish Enterprise (Lena Wilson) in respect of her performance in 2009-10 was awarded to her in respect of her performance as Chief Operating Officer of Scottish Enterprise and Chief Executive Officer of Scottish Development International, during the period 1 April to 3 November 2009. The payment of such a bonus was an operational matter for Scottish Enterprise. Ms Wilson took up post as Chief Executive of Scottish Enterprise on 4 November 2009. She was not considered for a bonus in respect of her performance in that role during the period ended 31 March 2010. Ms Wilson and the other members of Scottish Enterprise&rsquo;s Executive Leadership Team have indicated that they will not accept a bonus in respect of their performance in the year to 31 March 2011.</p>

  <p>Jack Perry formally resigned as Chief Executive of Scottish Enterprise on 28 May 2009. His contract of employment provided for a 12 month notice period and Scottish Enterprise decided that it would hold him to that whilst it recruited a new chief executive and negotiated a start date. Filling a senior appointment like that can often take up to 12 months as a result of the notice period to be served by the successful candidate on his/her existing employer.</p>

  <p>In the event, the successful candidate was an internal candidate, Lena Wilson. She was able to start more or less immediately and Scottish Enterprise decided that she should take up her new post on 4 November 2009. As a consequence, Jack Perry&rsquo;s notice period was terminated early and he left at that time.</p>

  <p>Decisions on how best to manage the transition were operational matters for Scottish Enterprise. In making those decisions it sought to act in the best interests of the organisation. The final payments made to Jack Perry were no more than was required under his contract.</p>

  <p>As operational matters, decisions on the handling of the transition did not require Scottish Government approval. Ministers and officials were however advised at the time of Scottish Enterprise&rsquo;s plans. They did not seek to intervene.</p>

  <p>As the post that Lena Wilson had occupied (i.e. the post of Chief Operating Officer) was not backfilled, this meant that Scottish Enterprise was able to reduce its overall salary bill by around &pound;180,000 per annum &ndash; and that saving started to accrue as soon as her appointment as Chief Executive took effect.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Futures Trust (SFT) is and will be involved in supporting NHSScotland on the use of private finance.</p>

  <p>SFT has already supported NHS Tayside on the Mental Health Project which recently reached financial close using the Non Profit Distributing model. NHS Lothian and NHS Borders have also been supported by SFT in the formation of the first hub Company in Scotland, which is a joint venture between the public and private sectors which will deliver a range of community based facilities for the public sector in South East Scotland.</p>

  <p>All NHS boards in Scotland will become involved in hub companies in their areas as other companies come on stream; hub North is expected to be established in December 2010 while hub East Central is due to go into procurement by the end of September 2010 with hub West and Hub South West to follow shortly afterwards.</p>

  <p>The most recent edition of Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland (GERS) provides estimates of Scottish tax receipts from 2004-05 to 2008-09. Between 2007-08 and 2008-09, GERS estimates that, including an illustrative geographical share of North Sea revenue, total Scottish tax revenue increased by &pound;2.8 billion (5.4%). Over the same period UK tax revenue is estimated to have fallen by &pound;14.9 billion (2.7%).</p>
