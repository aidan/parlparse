  <p>The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) draft single technology appraisal (STA) on Xolair does not constitute the Institute&rsquo;s formal guidance and the draft recommendations may change following consultation.</p>

  <p>NICE STA guidance does not apply in Scotland where the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) provides early advice on newly licensed medicines. In June 2006 and January 2007, the SMC issued advice to NHSScotland on the use of Xolair as add-on therapy to improve asthma control in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and above with severe persistent allergic asthma. The SMC did not recommend Xolair for use as the economic case was not demonstrated. This advice can be accessed at <a href="http://www.scottishmedicines.org" target="_blank">www.scottishmedicines.org</a>.</p>

  <p>The manufacturer of Xolair has made a further resubmission to the SMC and their updated advice is expected to be published on Monday, 8 October 2007.</p>

  <p>Exclusion categories are: died prior to receiving treatment, refused treatment, patient induced non-clinical delay, co-morbidities, clinical reasons and initially referred to another non-cancer speciality.</p>

  <p>(b) Information on the waiting times of cancer patients between referral and first treatment are collected centrally. These are collated to report performance against the target that &quot;the maximum wait from urgent referral to treatment for all cancers will be two months&quot;. Quarterly performance information against that target, broken down by NHS board and cancer type is available from the Scottish Executive website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/health/cancer/waiting-times" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/health/cancer/waiting-times</a>.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that cancer waiting times data are subject to continuous development and quality improvement.</p>

  <p>These improvements need to be taken in to account when making comparisons on quarter on quarter performance.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether, when determining questions of property deprivation for the purposes of calculating the cost of personal care, it will disregard property in cases where a home has been made over to a family member who has to live in a tied house due to their employment conditions and who has no other home in the event of their employment terminating.</p>

  <p>Local authorities take no account of property or any other assets in determining free personal care payments to people aged 65 or over whom they assess as needing residential care.</p>

  <p>The National Assistance (Assessment of Resources) Regulations 1992 provide the framework for local authorities to charge for care that they provide or arrange in residential care homes. The Scottish Executive provides local authorities with guidance on charging. It is for the local authority to decide in each case whether or not to disregard the value of a property in assessing the resident&rsquo;s contribution towards the cost of residential care, having regard to the guidance on the deprivation of capital and treatment of property. The regulations and the guidance include circumstances in which property must be disregarded.</p>

  <p>The Scottish House Condition Survey (SHCS) provides estimates of numbers of households affected by fuel poverty in each local authority area. We do not hold information for electoral regions or parliamentary constituencies.</p>

  <p>The following table shows the central estimate of the number of households which are estimated to be fuel poor in each of Scotland&rsquo;s 32 local authorities. The estimates come from combined 2003-04 and 2004-05 SHCS data. The fieldwork for these two survey years covers the period from October 2003 to September 2005. Because of the small sample size in each local authority the estimates lie within a fairly wide confidence interval.</p>

  <p>In addition, all NHS boards in Scotland provide a Child Health Surveillance Programme where children are offered routine reviews at various stages of their life. The majority of Boards record these reviews using the electronic child health systems, CHSP-Pre-School and CHSP-School. The latest available information from these systems on levels of obesity and overweight derived from height and weight measurements collected at routine health reviews is published for NHS boards participating in CHSP-School and CHSP-Pre-School at <a href="http://www.isdscotland.org/child_obesity" target="_blank">http://www.isdscotland.org/child_obesity</a>.

  <p>There has been a good response from private landlords to the requirement to apply for registration. Local authorities have a range of measures available to them to identify those who have not yet applied and ensure that they do so. It is also encouraging to note that some interests, such as local newspapers and mortgage lenders, are supporting the scheme by requiring proof of a valid application for registration from those seeking to let property.</p>

  <p>The Scottish government does not hold information on the number of landlords operating in Glasgow. The consultation paper on the implementation of private landlord registration estimated that, across Scotland, there were around 40,000 landlords. This was based on census data on the number of households living in the private rented sector and research on the average number of properties owned by each landlord. To date 93,837 applications for registration have been received, but this includes landlords who are required to apply in more than one local authority area. 11,696 applications have been made to Glasgow City Council.</p>

  <p>One of the benefits of the landlord registration scheme will be the provision of more accurate information about the number and profile of landlords in Scotland.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>We concluded in February 2007 that, while the Shetland proposal had potential wider implications for other local authorities, it was nevertheless reasonable to consider the specific Shetland proposal on its own merits.</p>

  <p>Communities Scotland will conclude its assessment of the proposal on receipt of a response from Hjaltland Housing Association on a suggested amendment to the proposal. Shetland Islands Council and Hjaltland Housing Association will be advised of the outcome as soon as possible thereafter.</p>

  <p>Consideration of this proposal has taken considerably longer than usual as a fundamental change to the rules for use of additional council tax income is being sought. That has involved more detailed consideration of the proposal itself and its potential wider implications.</p>

It is for the local authority to decide whether they or the applicant should bear the cost of making the application.</p>

  <p>Landlord registration has been a substantial new initiative for local authorities to handle. Procedures and staff have had to be put in place for:</p>

  <p>confirming application details with landlords and agents;</p>

  <p>invoicing those landlords or agents who have not paid online;</p>

  <p>compiling a list with other local authority services of landlords or agents whose applications they wish to review;</p>

  <p>approving and rejecting applications, and</p>

  <p>enforcement activity, in particular finding and chasing up landlords who have not yet applied for registration.</p>

  <p>Authorities have adopted different approaches to the task, depending on their internal governance and accountability structures, the department in which landlord registration is based, the extent of provision already in place for liaising with private landlords and the type of internal IT system in place. For example, some authorities require committee approval for decisions on registration of individual landlords, whereas in others most of the decision-making has been delegated to officials.</p>

  <p>All local authorities have made use of the central IT system for receiving applications and changes in landlords&rsquo; details, and use this data in issuing letters to landlords and agents. This is enabling the large number of applications (more than 93,000) to be handled, but as will be clear from the list above it does not entirely automate the process of granting approvals. There have been some difficulties with the system, for example in producing confirmation letters to send to landlords. Differences in local authorities&rsquo; own IT systems meant that they could not all use the application data in the same format. The Scottish Government has worked with the authorities and the system developers to bring forward solutions.</p>

  <p>A further factor in progress has been the sheer volume of applications. One of the benefits of registration will be to provide better data on the size and structure of the private rented sector. Prior to implementation, some 40,000 applications were expected on the basis of census data and research on the typical size of rented housing portfolios. In the event, more than twice this number of applications has been made, in part because of landlords holding property in more than one local authority and because some rented properties are jointly owned by two or more people, but in the main, it seems, because the number of landlords is much larger than estimated.</p>

  <p>A number of factors have therefore affected the rate at which applications for registration have been approved. Overall, however, we are disappointed with the rate of progress and wish to see it accelerate. We will continue to work closely with local authorities to support those which are experiencing difficulties.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The estimates include loans to home-movers taking out a loan to secure house purchase and loans to first-time buyers (including those exercising the right to buy their social rented property). The estimates exclude cash purchases and remortgaging activity. The estimates also exclude buy-to-let purchases and second-charge mortgages, as these transactions are not regulated by the Financial Services Authority.</p>

  <p>2. Data to April 2005 is based on the Survey of Mortgage Lenders (SML), grossed from a UK sample generally below 50% of all mortgage transactions. Data from April 2005 is drawn from the Regulated Mortgage Survey, which contains transaction-level data on approximately 85% of all new regulated mortgages issued in Scotland. RMS data is based on statutory Financial Service Authority returns.</p>

  <p>3. There is a significant drop from 2004 to 2005, both in terms of the volume of loans issued in Scotland, and the proportion of the UK total comprised by Scottish loans. CML indicates this may be due in part to a small number of lenders over-reporting Scottish data under the previous SML regime.</p>

  <p>3. Internal analysis indicates that the grossed figures for 2005-06 are likely to be accurate to around 4%.</p>

  <p>In terms of the principle of collective responsibility, under which the government operates, it does not disclose details of the internal processes through which decisions are made, including communications between ministers and the Law Officers and the deliberations of the Cabinet. This is a long-standing convention which is recognised in the provisions of the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002. I refer however, to the terms of the First Minister&rsquo;s statement to Parliament of 7 June (column 586 of the <em>Official Report</em> ) in which he offered a good deal of information on the matter and the turn of events.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive already provides funding for school meals and for Hungry for Success. Our priority is to ensure that healthy food is provided in schools. Public procurement law does not permit public bodies to favour local suppliers but by following guidance already issued by the Executive, local authorities can encourage local suppliers to compete for business.</p>

  <p>The majority of secondary schools already provide free drinking water. The Schools (Health Promotion and Nutrition) (Scotland) Act 2007 gives Scottish ministers the power to specify in regulations nutritional requirements for food and drinks in schools, and we are considering whether the regulations should include a requirement for local authorities to provide free drinking water in all their schools.

  <p>Funding for smoking cessation services is not currently ring fenced for specific priority groups such as young people. It is for NHS boards to assess needs locally and respond to the demand for cessation services for priority groups accordingly.</p>

  <p>NHS Smoking Cessation Services have received additional funding of &pound;2 million this year bringing total funding to a record &pound;11 million. Young people are already a priority group for cessation services and I expect boards to use part of the additional funding to provide support to young people wishing to quit. There are no plans to ring-fence funding specifically for underage smokers.</p>

  <p>Along with my Cabinet Secretary and ministerial colleagues, I will be in dialogue with a range of stakeholders over the summer to gather evidence and views on how we can use the strategic spending review to set spending plans that will enable us to fulfil our purpose and achieve our strategic objectives.</p>

  <p>In presenting statistics on suicides it is conventional to combine deaths classified as intentional self-harm (suicides) with those classified as events of undetermined intent. This is because the majority of the latter are likely to have been suicides. The following tables provide information on this basis.</p>

  <p>(a) The information requested in part (a) is not held centrally. In children it is difficult to establish true intent. Therefore it may be incorrect to attempt to derive numbers of &quot;attempted suicide&quot;.</p>

  <p>We have however provided data for hospital discharges for children under 16, which have been coded as either deliberate self-harm or undetermined intent. These are shown in the following tables.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Hospital discharges - children aged 0 to 15.</p>

  <p>2. Based on the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation.</p>

  <p>Up to six diagnosis (1 main, 5 secondary) are recorded on SMR01 returns. All six diagnoses have been used to select discharges for deliberate self harm and undetermined intent.</p>

  <p>The following codes were used from the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Other Health Related Problems, tenth revision (ICD10):</p>

  <p>Self Harm: X60-X84.</p>

  <p>Undetermined Intent: Y10-Y34.</p>

  <p>(b) In presenting statistics on suicides it is conventional to combine deaths classified as intentional self-harm (suicides) with those classified as events of undetermined intent. This is because the majority of the latter are likely to have been suicides. However, this assumption is known to be less valid for children, particularly those aged under 10. For this reason the following table shows the two categories separately and restricts the information on events of undetermined intent to deaths aged 10-15.</p>

  <p>MMR is the safest, most effective way to protect all children against the risks of Measles, Mumps and Rubella. The uptake of the MMR vaccination remains at a higher level than in recent times, but we will continue to monitor the level of immunisation. We would encourage all parents to consider immunisation in early childhood. It is still the safest and most effective way of protecting all children, and the wider community, against the risks of infectious diseases.</p>
