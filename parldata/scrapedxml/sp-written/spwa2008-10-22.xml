  <p>All retailers have a responsibility to comply with the law. This means they must exercise due diligence by taking all reasonable steps to avoid illegal sales. Guidance is available from local authority Trading Standards Services to help UK businesses involved in distance selling to exercise their legal obligations. This suggests, for example, that one of the simplest steps which may be taken is to restrict the sale of age restricted products to credit card owners as they must be aged 18 or over.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will continue to explore, including with the UK Government and other devolved administrations, ways to improve both the arrangements made by online retailers to avoid illegal sales and how compliance with the law is monitored by enforcement authorities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Flood Defence Asset Database contains details of some 70 flood prevention schemes constructed under the 1961 Flood Prevention (Scotland) Act. This database was completed in 2007.

  <p>Local authorities, who are responsible for maintaining these schemes, have access to the database to provide detailed information on the schemes within their area.</p>

  <p>In the local authority areas of North Ayrshire and Renfrewshire the following four schemes have been considered in terms of general condition and performance: Largs, Collier Street in Johnstone, Crosslee in Houston and Moredun in Paisley.

  <p>The NHS in Scotland has provided priority treatment for War Pensioners since 1953 and, in February 2008, this was extended to all veterans in Scotland, for health conditions related to their service. General practitioners and NHS hospital clinicians should give priority treatment for conditions related to military service unless there is an emergency case or another case demands clinical priority. All NHS boards have an appointed priority treatment champion tasked with monitoring appropriate implementation of this policy.</p>

  <p>All clinically significant blood infections, including Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, are reported to Health Protection Scotland on a weekly basis by NHS bacteriology laboratories, a national arrangement which has been in place since 1969. Antibiotic resistance will be monitored locally and nationally via the national roll-out to laboratories of automated sensitivity testing equipment, which is being funded by the Scottish Government. Immediate management of potential outbreaks of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an issue for the NHS board infection control team to address.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not monitor individual outcomes of enquiries to the Relocation Advisory Service, instead, overall assessment of the impact of the service is carried out through external evaluation. Since it was established in October 2004 there have been two evaluations of the service and a progress report on the Fresh Talent initiative, these can be found on the Scottish Government website.</p>

  <p>Figures for the infant death rate (the number of deaths in the first month of life, expressed per thousand live births) in each health board area are published annually by the General Register Office for Scotland (GROS). The figures for 1998, 1999 and 2000 are given in the tables numbered 1.3 in the Annual Reports of the Registrar General for Scotland for those years, copies of which are available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. numbers 4049, 7222 and 15009 respectively). The figures for each subsequent year are available from the GROS website, in the relevant years&rsquo; versions of Vital Events Reference Tables, Section 1, Table 1.3, which can be found via <a href="http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/statistics/publications-and-data/vital-events/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/statistics/publications-and-data/vital-events/index.html</a> .</p>

  <p>Care should be taken when interpreting rates and trends where there are a small number of deaths each year. For example, the rate would appear to double and then halve if the numbers of deaths in consecutive years were one, two and one.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government, in partnership with COSLA, is developing a Framework for Supported Employment to provide support to people with disabilities to secure and maintain paid employment in the open labour market. The framework will concentrate on supporting individuals who have a learning or physical disability and those with mental health conditions.</p>

  <p>A task group has been established to oversee the development of the framework.

  <p>In Scotland we have no inspectors general, but we have chief inspectors in several policy areas such as education, constabulary, prosecution, prisons and fire. There is currently no plan to extend this range of posts. Indeed, following the Crerar Review of regulation, audit, inspection and complaints handling, government and Parliament will be considering a range of options in the forthcoming months, to reduce the numbers of public service inspectorates. The government plans to make a statement soon.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recommends that everyone who works in health and social care should be vaccinated against seasonal flu. All staff within the NHS can access the vaccination for free from their employers. While the Scottish Government recommends that staff in other health and social care organisations are offered the flu vaccination, vaccination of these staff is ultimately a matter for the organisations and employers concerned.</p>

  <p>The Chief Professionals Officers of the Scottish Government, in their letter of September 2008, recommend that social care organisations should consider offering the influenza vaccination to staff.

  <p>80% of the total flu vaccination supply ordered for Scotland was available by mid October 2008 with 99% due to be delivered by the end of October 2008. The vaccination programme itself commenced on 1 October 2008 and many GP practices across Scotland have already commenced vaccinating the at risk population.</p>

  <p>The amount of flu vaccine ordered each year in Scotland is based on experience from previous years&rsquo; vaccine requirements for the at risk groups. There is nothing to indicate at this stage that the vaccine ordered for Scotland for this year will be insufficient to meet the requirements of the at risk population.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has launched a completely new marketing campaign for this year&rsquo;s flu season with newly designed marketing materials including posters and leaflets. A new television commercial has also been produced for this year&rsquo;s flu season. A pilot will also operate in two NHS board areas to investigate the impact of local practices writing to invite those under the age of 65 in at risk groups to attend for their free flu vaccination. The pilot and all marketing activity will be evaluated at the end of the flu season.</p>

  <p>Uptake of the flu vaccination by those aged 65 and over continues to be in excess of the 70% national target, and in the last two years has been around or in excess of the 75% World Health Organization target. Although we are currently therefore exceeding our target for this population, we are not complacent and will continue to employ a national call up letter and ensure that marketing activity remains inclusive of the 65 and over at risk population.</p>

  <p>Newly designed marketing materials supporting this year&rsquo;s vaccination programme highlight the importance of the vaccination to those who care for elderly people, particularly in the case of unpaid carers, who are entitled to the vaccination free of charge. The Scottish Government makes every effort to ensure that marketing materials leaflets are distributed to as widely as possible and currently distribute materials to more than 1,000 organisations supporting elderly people.</p>

  <p>From speaking to young carers and their representatives at the recent young carers festival, I am aware that there are a number of areas where services for this group of young people can be improved.</p>

  <p>For example, young carers often report experiencing a lack of understanding from staff within statutory agencies about what it means to be a young carer and how to best meet their specific needs. We will be looking to address this, and many of the other issues raised at the festival, in the young carers&rsquo; section of our revised carers strategy.</p>
