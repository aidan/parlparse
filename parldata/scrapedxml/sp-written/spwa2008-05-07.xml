  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many prosecutions have resulted from the test purchasing pilot scheme for the sale of alcohol to under 18-year-olds in Fife and how many of these were instigated after those being prosecuted had been reported for (a) one and (b) more than one offence of this type as a result of the pilot scheme.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-05-07.S3W-11730.r0" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Frank Mulholland QC" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa0507.htm#1">

  <p>The test purchasing pilot scheme carried out by Fife Constabulary tackled the sale of alcohol to children under 18 in a variety of ways:</p>

  <p>Advising licensees about ways to ensure compliance.</p>

  <p>Targetting premises that sell alcohol to children.</p>

  <p>Reporting all breaches to the Licensing Board.</p>

  <p>Prosecuting where appropriate.</p>

  <p>As a result of the pilot seven people (four licence holders and three employees) were prosecuted in relation to alcohol test purchasing failures at four separate licensed premises. The Procurator Fiscal was not barred from prosecuting where one failure only was reported to him and he took all the circumstances of each case into account in deciding what action to take. In the event, these cases involved two test purchase failures. The pilot&rsquo;s focus on educating and advising licence-holders clearly produced a failure rate of 17% which was low compared with rates in other jurisdictions.</p>

  <p>The government&rsquo;s proposals for a local income tax to replace the council tax are set out in the consultation document <em>A Fairer Local Tax for Scotland</em> as part of the on-going consultation exercise which closes on 18 July. The consultation will of course involve many individuals and organisations with an interest in how the local income tax will be collected and distributed. We will publish an analysis of responses to the consultation in the autumn and further detailed proposals will follow in due course.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-05-07.S3W-12610.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80379" speakername="Shona Robison" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa0507.htm#4">

  <p>Sound business continuity planning should be part of every organisation&rsquo;s day-to-day business. It is for each organisation to ensure that if one of the suppliers providing services critical to the operation of the organisation fails they have access to an alternative supplier.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are designated as Category 1 responders under the Civil Contingencies Act 2004, paragraph 2(1). As a consequence of that status, NHS boards have a statutory obligation to maintain plans to ensure so far as is reasonably practicable, that if an emergency occurs, they are able to continue to perform their functions. This planning should include consideration of the continuity of all essential supply chains, including fuel supplies.</p>

  <p>At a UK level, contingency plans do exist to ensure that as far as possible all essential services have priority access to fuel supplies if those supplies begin to run short. Planning for this and invocation of these plans is a matter reserved to the government in Westminster. Scottish Government will work closely with the Westminster Government in implementing these plans should it ever be necessary to invoke them.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The SPS is keen to ensure that employees should have a healthy balance between work and non-work life. All staff are required to seek permission from the organisation prior to undertaking secondary employment. Secondary employment includes self-employment and voluntary work. This approval is twofold; to ensure that the proposed working hours do not breach the terms of the Working Time Regulations, and that the proposed activity does not form a conflict of interest. The policy has been agreed by and is jointly signed by SPS management and the Trade Union Side.</p>

  <p>At present there are no plans to re-regulate the bus industry in Scotland. The Transport (Scotland) Act 2001 provides a framework which allows local transport authorities to enhance the provision of local bus services.

  <p>Scottish Government and local authorities are each responsible for managing the risks attaching to their own property and activities. Scottish Government itself is a sufficiently large body to be able to self insure its risks. As a result, it uses commercial insurance rarely, generally only where contractual commitments require such cover. Local government also uses a mix of commercial insurance and self insurance. The extent to which local authorities use insurance is a matter for them, and they will take into account the size and nature of any risk in relation to the resources of the authority in reaching a decision.</p>

  <p>Section 20(1) of the act gives a local authority the power to do anything that it considers is likely to promote or improve the well-being of its area and persons within that area, or either of those. It is for the local authority to decide whether any particular action would be likely to promote or improve the well-being of its area and/or persons in it.</p>
