  <p>The aim of the broadband pathfinder projects is to make affordable broadband available to the public sector in the Highlands and Islands and the South of Scotland through the aggregation of demand. The projects, which involve connectivity for health, schools and other local authority sites, are currently in the midst of the formal procurement process.</p>

  <p>The only other example of broadband related aggregated public sector procurement in which the Executive has an involvement is Angus.Net. Supported under the first round of the Executive&#8217;s Modernising Government Fund which was established to test innovation, Angus.Net is an innovative example of broadband related public sector procurement. It provides a model for a sustainable, shared, multi-agency telecommunications network across Angus. The organisations involved in Angus.Net include Angus Council, Tayside Police, Angus College and the University of Abertay.</p>

  <p>The Executive is currently using the UK broadband fund to support trials of a variety of different broadband delivery models suitable for remote and small communities. Additionally, it is developing measures under the Executive&#8217;s &#163;24 million broadband initiative to stimulate demand for broadband services generally and to subsidise the purchase by businesses and communities of appropriate technologies. An announcement to mark the official launch of the initiative is imminent.</p>

  <p>An independent and thorough review was carried out in 2001 to ensure that the regional selective assistance grant scheme (RSA) met the needs of businesses in Scotland. The review confirmed that RSA was both worthwhile and necessary, while highlighting a number of areas for improvement. The scheme has now been restructured to take account of the review recommendations and to strengthen its focus on growing Scottish firms.</p>

  <p>It may instructive to note that in February 2003, the Scottish Manufacturing Steering Group reported that perceptions of RSA not meeting the needs of manufacturers &quot;appear misplaced<em>&quot;</em> and that &quot;Investigation demonstrates that, in Assisted Areas, RSA should meet most manufacturers requirements.&quot;</p>

  <p>I have asked Dr Jon Hargreaves, Chief Executive of Scottish Water to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>While Scottish Water has reliable estimates of leakage and the impact on costs for certain areas, an overall estimate of the level of cost savings made by reducing leakage levels is not available at this time. Scottish Water is currently carrying out a comprehensive evaluation of the impact and scale of leakage on the water network by area which will quantify the impact of leakage on operational costs, as well as benchmark performance against English and Welsh companies and allow for targeted investment in those areas where active leakage control is proven to achieve operational and capital efficiencies. Any savings depend upon the cost to produce the water at a specific works as well as the cost to transmit the water to centres of demand and the capital and operating costs associated with reducing and maintaining leakage levels. These cost components vary for each water supply zone.</p>

  <p>I have asked Dr Jon Hargreaves, Chief Executive of Scottish Water to reply. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Approximately 95% of Scottish Water's water and sewerage mains network was mapped when Scottish Water came into existence on 1 April 2001. This information is currently on three separate Geographical Information Systems (GIS) software systems. A combined system has been developed and will be rolled out to all users by the end of September 2003.</p>

  <p>There remain some major issues with information about specific attributes, such as the type of material, pipe diameter, fittings details and precise location. As much of the network is decades old, installation details are no longer available. Where records do exist, they are in a variety of locations and formats, such as paper copies and work management repair records. Scottish Water aims to transfer all available information to the harmonised GIS system by December 2004 and the estimated value of this work is &#163;1.2 million.</p>

  <p>Further validation of GIS data is being carried out on an ongoing basis in co-ordination with other Scottish Water projects, such as leakage evaluations, mains rehabilitation, trunk main valve audits, drainage area studies and work management data capture efforts.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive <a name="QuestionText">what the restorative element of warnings for young offenders, referred to in <em>A Partnership for a Better Scotland</em>, will involve.</a></p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2003-08-05.18.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80053" speakername="Cathy Jamieson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-03/wa0805.htm#QuestionText">

  <p>We are working with the police and others to introduce a national programme of restorative police warnings. We plan to publish guidance to the police in the autumn. This guidance will set out how restorative principles should be applied and will provide examples of good practice.</p>

  <p>Evidence suggests that a restorative approach can make warnings more effective and may reduce re-offending. The restorative element of the warning will vary depending upon the offender, the offence and the impact on the victims. Typically, such an approach involves the young offender and other parties (e.g. his or her parents, the victim and victim supporter, police, community representatives etc) collectively resolving how to deal with the aftermath of the offence. In particular, it aims to involve the victim (either directly or with his or her views conveyed) and offender in discussing the implications of the crime and possible forms of reparation.</p>
