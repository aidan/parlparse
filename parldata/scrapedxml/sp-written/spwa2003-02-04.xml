  <p>The Scottish Executive has today published an <em>Organic Action Plan</em> . Copies have been placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 26285).</p>

  <p>The action plan sets out important new ways in which the Scottish Executive will support the sustainable development of the organic sector. It takes account of the expert views of the Organics Stakeholder Group, whose formation I announced last September.</p>

  <p>The action plan affirms our belief that Scottish organic products can grow in market penetration so that they can meet at least 70% by value of overall Scottish consumer demand for organic products which can be sourced in Scotland. It also looks forward to a doubling of the area of good quality agricultural land in organic conversion or production.</p>

  <p>To support this growth, the <em>Organic Action Plan</em> sets out important ways in which the Executive will support the organic sector's development. We are consulting on a package of measures including better payment rates for organic conversion, support for capital costs associated with organic conversion, and various ways in which we can offer continuing support for the environmental benefits of organic farming after the initial conversion period. On the marketing side, the action plan includes prioritisation of organic projects for grant assistance and support for the development of Scottish organic branding. We are commissioning ambitious research to help the development of the organic sector. We have accepted the challenge from the bill that the Scottish Executive should report annually on the delivery of its action plan and we will use that opportunity to make sure, year by year, that we are supporting the organic sector as effectively as possible.</p>

  <p>All councils in Scotland, including East Dunbartonshire, have received above inflation increases in grant funding in each year of the current spending review, 2001-04. Such increases will continue over the period of the next review. The total revenue grant support for East Dunbartonshire Council over the period in question is set out in the table. From April 2001 this includes resources specifically to expand respite services and we are currently agreeing with the council the outcome measures to be achieved in this area of service delivery. It is for the council to decide how best to use its total grant in order to provide services that meet local needs and priorities, including the provision of short breaks.</p>

  <p>There are no supervised residential accommodation places specifically designated for the use of sex offenders. Across Scotland there are approximately 100 hostel places funded under the 100% funding arrangements for criminal justice social work for the use of accused on bail or offenders either serving community sentences or on release from custody.</p>

  <p>Since 1997, Communities Scotland has provided new or refurbished accommodation for social rent or home ownership in the Paisley, Renfrew, Linwood and Johnstone areas of Renfrewshire. Within the Paisley area, investment has been targeted within social inclusion partnership (SIP) areas, Paisley town centre and areas where there has been identified housing need. In Renfrew, Linwood and Johnstone investment has been targeted in SIP areas or where there has been identified housing need for particular client groups.</p>

  <p>Variations of outcomes across the country are not necessarily indicative of inconsistency of approach, but instead reflect an appropriate response to local circumstances and offending behaviour, as well as, most importantly, the individual circumstances of each case.</p>

  <p>The aim of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service is to continue to provide a high quality service to the public. In pursuit of this aim, the service is currently undergoing a far-reaching programme of reform and renewal. New information systems are being rolled out as part of the modernisation of the service, and these will offer greater opportunity to area procurators fiscal to monitor trends and ensure continued consistency &#8211; not standardisation &#8211; of practice.</p>

  <p>None. Strathclyde Police did not pilot any juvenile safety orders in Hamilton. On 23 October 1997, Strathclyde Police in partnership with South Lanarkshire Council, introduced a Child Safety Initiative within three areas of Hamilton, returning children home who were out unsupervised on the streets at night. The initiative was subsequently extended to all areas of Hamilton.</p>

  <p>It is an operational matter for individual Chief Constables in association with their local authority, to determine whether such measures provide the means to effectively address issues of particular concern in their area. The initiative has not been adopted elsewhere in Scotland.</p>
