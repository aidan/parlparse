  <p>The introduction of interim Anti-Social Behaviour Orders (ASBO) through the current Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill will provide more immediate protection from anti-social neighbours. Breach of an interim ASBO will be a criminal offence punishable by up to five years imprisonment on indictment.</p>

  <p>This reinforces measures such as the "probationary tenancy" introduced by the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001, new grounds for eviction for anti-social behaviour and additional powers for the police to seize noise-making equipment introduced by the Crime and Disorder Act 1998.</p>

  <p>As well as promoting best practice in tackling anti-social behaviour, the Executive has allocated &#163;20 million over two years from 2004 on community wardens who will work with local people to build safe, strong communities and support enforcement by the police, local authorities and other agencies.</p>

  <p>The introduction of the annual Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland Award for Best Building in Scotland in 2002 which promotes good architecture in both private and public sectors has lessened the need for a further high profile Scottish based buildings award. Scottish public sector projects are also eligible for the annual Prime Minister's Better Public Buildings Award which is a UK-wide award scheme. The commitment to introduce an additional Scottish award for the best publicly-funded building remains under review, although I have no plans at present to launch the award in 2003.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has adopted the targets of the UK National Cycling Strategy, to double the number of bicycle trips made between 1996 and 2002, then double that figure by 2012. This is included in the <i>Programme for Government</i> for Scotland.</p>

  <p>In order to achieve this target, additional resources have been provided to Scottish local authorities from the Public Transport Fund, which can be used for improving local cycling facilities. The Executive has also made grants to the cycle charity Sustrans to develop the National Cycle Network (NCN) in Scotland, in addition to providing works through the Trunk Roads Cycling Initiative for trunk road sections of the NCN.</p>

  <p>The Executive chairs the Scottish Cycle Forum, which was set up to identify opportunities for improving the cycling environment within Scotland and for encouraging bicycle use, both as a means of transport and for leisure purposes.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the Executive&#146;s current travel awareness campaign, Learn to Let Go, aims to increase the number of journeys made by cycling, walking and public transport and to encourage more sensible use of the car.</p>

  <p>Guidance to medical professionals, <i>Managing Incidental Drug Misuse and Alcohol Problems in Mental Health Care Settings</i> , recommends that drug misuse is covered in assessments of patients with mental health problems. The <i>Guidelines on Clinical Management of Drug Misuse and Dependence</i> recommend that psychiatric issues should form part of assessments of patients seeking help with drug problems.</p>

  <p>Further guidance on developing integrated care services for drug misusers was published in October last year, and one of the aims of integrated care is to combine and coordinate all services to meet the assessed needs of drug misusers, including mental health aspects. We are also working with the Scottish Advisory Committee on Drug Misuse to look further into the needs of drug misusers with underlying mental health problems.</p>

  <p>Our <i>Know the Score</i> booklet on cannabis includes a description of the risks to mental health posed by this drug. The booklet has been given wide distribution. Anyone who is concerned about the effects of cannabis on mental health can also contact the free and confidential Know the Score Informationline to speak to trained operators.</p>

  <p>Article 6 of the 1985 Iberian Act of Accession refers to suspending, amending or repealing its provisions. Article 154.1 of the same refers to the fact that Chapter 4 applies to the fisheries sector. Neither of these articles in any way conflicts with the fact that, as stated in the answers given to questions S1W-31980, S1W-31981, S1W-31982 and S1W-31984, fisheries is a matter for Qualified Majority Voting, as stipulated by the Treaty establishing the European Community, Article 37.</p>

Our legal advice is that this date is valid as the expiration date of the regime defined in Articles 156&#150;164 of the Iberian Act of Accession.

  <p>The Prime Minister's initiative, launched in June 1999, aims to attract more overseas students to the UK. The Scottish Executive is involved with the funding and development of the strategy in partnership with other devolved administrations, UK government departments, British Council and Trade Partners UK. Measures to enhance overseas student recruitment as part of PMI include a three-year branded global marketing campaign, expansion of the Chevening scholarship scheme and streamlining visa and work regulations. A Scottish version of the brand logo and marketing materials has been developed for use by Scottish institutions and EducationUKScotland as part of the PMI strategy.</p>

  <p>In addition, EducationUKScotland (formerly Scottish Education and Training) is a sector-led body supported and funded by institutions in four sectors, including the higher education sector, and also by the British Council Scotland. The Scottish Executive maintains close links with EducationUKScotland. The organisation&#146;s main objective is to add value in the area of international student recruitment by promoting Scotland overseas and providing generic support for the work of Scottish institutions.</p>

  <p>In Scotland, the police, the Crown Office and the Procurator Fiscal Service are responsible for dealing with suspected offences.

  <p>It is anticipated that print publications from other states of the European Union would be imported on a UK-wide basis.

  <p>Ministers and officials hold regular discussions with colleagues in Whitehall departments about a wide range of waste-related issues, including the reform of the landfill tax credit scheme.</p>

  <p>As stated in the Chancellor's pre-Budget report 2002 Her Majesty's Government intends to reform the current Landfill Tax Credit Scheme. It is proposed that this will involve the establishment of a public spending scheme for sustainable waste management for approximately two-thirds of the monies raised as well as the retention of a smaller tax credit scheme for local community environmental projects.</p>

  <p>The Arbuthnott formula uses information about unemployment rates, the proportion of older people on income support, households with multiple indicators of deprivation and mortality rates among people under 65 as indicators of relative deprivation. This information, together with information about the age structure of the population and remoteness is used to determine the allocation of resources between NHS boards. It is of course the responsibility of NHS boards to ensure that the resources made available to them through this formula are then used to address the health care needs of their populations, including people living in relatively deprived areas.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mr Bob Millar, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Since 1997 Communities Scotland has invested &#163;42.205 million to provide 1033 new homes within the Renfrewshire Council area. Over &#163;20 million has been invested in Social Inclusion Partnership areas to provide 732 new or refurbished homes.</p>

  <p>Over the past 12 months Communities Scotland has been actively involved with Renfrewshire Council and members of local communities to develop Area Development Frameworks (ADFs) for a number of areas within Renfrewshire including Shortroods, Moorpark, Ferguslie Park and Foxbar. The ADFs will identify the need for funding resources from Communities Scotland.</p>

  <p>Communities Scotland has also been involved in appraising proposals for the NHP project in Johnstone which will see the development of both social rented housing and housing for sale in the Millar Street area of the town.</p>

  <p>In partnership with Renfrewshire Council and Williamsburgh Housing Association Communities Scotland is currently developing proposals for the regeneration of the Rankine Street area of Johnstone.</p>

  <p>The Executive will follow section 2 of The Education (Graduate Endowment and Student Support) (Scotland) Act 2001. Income arising from the graduate endowment will be included within the budget proposals in the relevant bill for the Budget Act, for the use of resources, and applied for the purposes of student support.</p>

  <p>The mechanical and electrical element of the design of the new Scottish Parliament building was part of the design competition, which was won by EMBT/RMJM Limited in July 1998. The advertisement for the competition for the Architectural Design Team was placed in the <i>Official Journal of the European Community </i> (OJEC) in February 1998 and shortlisted candidates were required to come forward with a proposed team, including mechanical and electrical engineers.</p>

  <p>I understand that an abbreviated version of the April 1998 version of the Parliament Building User Brief appeared on the Scottish Office Devolution website prior to the project transferring to the Parliament in June 1999. A section on general security issues was contained in that document which covered the security arrangements expected in the building. After reconsideration of the current security implications, I am of the view that no security information about the building should be made more generally accessible than absolutely necessary. I therefore cannot recommend that a copy of that information be placed in Scottish Parliament Information Centre. The Holyrood Project Team can make arrangements for individual members, with legitimate interests, to view the User Brief if required.</p>

  <p>Since the Parliament assumed responsibility for the Holyrood Project in June 1999, there have been a number of changes to the security section in the <i>Scottish Parliament Building User Brief</i> . For obvious security reasons, details of revisions to that section are treated on a confidential basis, and the information cannot, therefore, be provided as requested. All have had the aim of improving the protection the building offers, however, and enhancing the safety of members, staff and visitors to the Parliament. In particular, changes to the design specification, as supported by the various professional consultants to the project, take advantage of the latest security advice on the practical application of existing guidelines.</p>
