  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 sets out the general types of work that are eligible for grant. These grants are largely funded by Private Sector Housing Grant provided by Communities Scotland. This funding must be used for improving private housing, but it is for local authorities to decide priorities within their area when it comes to assessing individual applications for funding, in line with both local and national priorities. Local authorities have some discretion to determine the maximum cost of works upon which they will pay grant, either to set a maximum below the statutory limit of &pound;20,000, or to seek ministerial approval to exceed that limit in individual cases. The amount of grant awarded to applicants is determined by a national test of resources set out in legislation, primarily the Housing Grants (Assessment of Contribution) Regulations 2003.</p>

  <p>No Scottish councils have formally approached the Scottish Executive with proposals to merge with other councils. However, many councils across Scotland are looking into how they can work more closely together and integrate frontline and support services to benefit their communities and service users</p>

  <p>The main organisers of the President Clinton speech in Glasgow were A&amp;S Promotions and, as such, all discussions with representatives for President Clinton relating to the event, including the fee, were taken forward by them.

  <p>There has been a large increase in expenditure on electricity in 2005-06. This can be attributed to the fact that a two year fixed-price contract, which was set at a particularly low point in the market, expired in 2005-06. During the period of that contract energy markets were subject to a period of unprecedented volatility. Increases in oil and gas prices, political instability in key production areas and increased demand for energy all combined to force prices up. The Executive was protected from these changes during the period of the contract but the new contract which includes much increased rates reflects prevailing global market conditions.</p>

  <p>The energy costs incurred by other public sector bodies are not held centrally and could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.</p>
