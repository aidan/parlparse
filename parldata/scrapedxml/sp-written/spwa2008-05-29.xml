  <p>Disabled access is a matter which is reserved to Westminster. The Department for Transport&rsquo;s Access for All programme is investing &pound;370 million in stations throughout the UK over a 10 year period. Scotland&rsquo;s share of this investment is &pound;39 million.</p>

  <p>There are also a number of on-going access improvements being made to a range of Scottish railway stations that are being delivered by First ScotRail as part of their Franchise Agreement. All new stations or those undergoing major redevelopment, such as Aberdeen, are legally obliged to be Disability Discrimination Act compliant.</p>

  <p>The national outcomes, indicators and targets are listed in Annex A of the concordat between the Scottish Government and local government, which can be found on the Scottish Government website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/11/13092240/concordat" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/11/13092240/concordat</a> .</p>

  <p>Locally developed outcomes, indicators and targets aligned to the published national outcomes, indicators and targets will form the basis of individual single outcome agreements (SOAs) for councils in Scotland. We are currently in the process of agreeing the SOAs for 2008-09 with all 32 councils. It would not be appropriate at this stage of the process to comment on specific areas of focus within individual agreements, but we expect SOAs to reflect the priorities and agreed outcomes for each council and to include the relevant supporting indicators and targets. We aim to complete this process by 30 June 2008 and, subject to agreement with councils, all finalised agreements will be made publically available shortly thereafter.</p>

The Scottish Government&rsquo;s future funding priorities for Scots provision will be considered within the context of this audit and its outcome and I will, at that stage, examine how we can assist this extremely important sector of Scottish culture.</p>

  <p>The 140 day custody time limit in High Court cases can only be extended by the court, on cause shown, having given all parties an opportunity to be heard. The Scottish Government is satisfied that this arrangement safeguards the rights of the accused, as was Parliament when passing the Criminal Procedure (Amendment) (Scotland) Act 2004. In any case in which an extension of the period is sought, the decision is entirely one for the court.</p>

  <p>The evaluation of the High Court reforms published in February 2007 suggested that the proportion of cases in which an extension had been granted was remaining more or less constant following the amendments introduced by the 2004 act. Further information is given on pages 38-39 of <em>An Evaluation of the High Court Reforms Arising from the Criminal Procedure (Amendment) (Scotland) Act 2004</em>, published by the Scottish Executive in 2007, a copy of which is available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 42119).</p>

  <p>Scottish Court Service is able to confirm that the number of successful applications for extension of the 140 day period in 2007 was 487, but does not hold the information in the answer to question S3W-8959 on 4 February 2008. The 2007 evaluation referred to above found, in a sample, that the average length of extension after the reforms was 46 days. The average period, in a sample of cases, predating the reform was 57 days. These decisions are of course made by the courts on the merits of the individual case.</p>

  <p>Demolition orders on listed buildings can be issued by local authorities in their capacity as the Building Control authority and on this basis, no information on the subject is held centrally. Historic Scotland has no formal role in such orders but in practice will often be consulted by local authorities before demolition takes place.</p>

  <p>Listed building consent is also required for the demolition of a listed building and, as with building control matters, is dealt with by local authorities. Historic Scotland does have a statutory role in this process and must be notified by the local authority before such consents can be issued.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Royal Commission for Ancient and Historical Monuments for Scotland must be notified when listed building consent is granted for the demolition of a listed building in order that the commission may make arrangements for the building to be recorded before works commence.</p>

In partnership with Skills Development Scotland and other bodies we are delivering an approach to skills development which will meet the challenges Scotland faces now and in the future. This must be an approach that is not volume focussed or target driven but focuses on better matching supply and demand of skills interventions to maximise potential economic growth.</p>

  <p>Evidence from an evaluation on Modern Apprenticeships in Scotland carried out by Cambridge Policy Consultants showed that many non-traditional frameworks used by adults involve little added learning and therefore do not deliver value for money.</p>

  <p>Skills Development Scotland continues to work with training providers to ensure that no individual already undertaking training is adversely affected by the recent changes.</p>

  <p>We recognise that this change in approach will have the greatest impact on a small number of training providers who have traditionally received the majority of their income from public subsidy. However, early indications show that they are already seeking alternative forms of income rather than simply relying on public funding as their primary income source.</p>

  <p>Public investment must support the provision of the best training for individuals in Scotland. This will continue to provide many training providers with opportunities to work with the government in the delivery of its skills ambitions.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government supports health boards in their management of staff sickness absence in a variety of ways.</p>

  <p>Foremost amongst these is a coordinated strategy to improve the health and wellbeing of the NHSScotland workforce. This includes the innovative occupational health project known as OHXtra which is currently being rolled out across health boards. Work to date includes a wellness monitoring toolkit, mental health employment support, case management support and campaigns to address the problem of violence and aggression. In addition, Partnership Information Network policies are currently being reviewed in partnership with trade unions.</p>

  <p>With regard to the management of sickness absence itself, attention is currently being directed at promoting and extending the use of existing good practice rather than issuing further guidance. There is much being done within NHSScotland that can be held up as models of best practice but we have to ensure that all areas, staff groups and levels of management are indeed following best practice consistently. The Scottish Government has conducted a stock take exercise to identify examples of good practice in the management of sickness absence and followed this up in November 2007 by issuing a compendium of the best examples to all health boards. This work will continue. A specialist group (The Promoting Attendance and Managing Sickness Absence Group) has been established at national level with membership from NHS management, trade unions and the Scottish Government and has within its remit responsibility to identify, disseminate and promote good practice.</p>

  <p>Health boards produce attendance management plans and are required to demonstrate publicly through the annual review process and in their local delivery plans, that the issue has ownership at top management level and is being actively addressed.</p>

  <p>Sickness Absence rates for each of Scotland&rsquo;s 22 health boards are monitored and reported on regularly. Rates are currently falling and the most recent data shows an average rate for NHSScotland in March 2008 of 5.08%.</p>

  <p>More detailed analysis, for example by staff group or by type of absence is carried out for particular purposes but this is not collated centrally.</p>

  <p>A single system for measuring sickness absence has been applied within NHS Scotland only since April 2005, before which different approaches to calculating sickness absence were taken within individual boards.</p>

  <p>We need to be cautious about making comparisons with reported rates for other organisations. NHS Scotland has its own system which expresses total hours lost due to sickness as a percentage of total available hours and we have specific definitions for each of these which may not correspond with those used by other organisations. In a 24/7 organisation we need to be careful about when periods of absence start and finish. Whilst it is possible to compare NHS Scotland rates with those of other organisations we must always remember that we are not necessarily comparing like with like. This is the case even with the NHS in the rest of the UK where there are different processes for recording and reporting on sickness absence.</p>

  <p>The important thing is that we have a reliable and consistent measure within NHS Scotland which we can use to monitor and report on progress.</p>

  <p>Sickness Absence rates for each of Scotland&rsquo;s 22 health boards are monitored and reported on regularly. Yearly rates are available at:</p>

  <p>Some health boards have expressed an interest in carrying out more detailed analysis of the relationship at local level between postcode areas and sickness absence rates. This would allow possible correlations with deprivation statistics to be examined and is something that the Scottish Government might well support through the Promoting Attendance and Managing Sickness Absence group.</p>

  <p>We are working closely with the UK Government to close the loophole in legislation in respect of cross-border football banning orders. Legislation in the Westminster Parliament is required to close this gap and I have written to the Home Secretary requesting confirmation of when this legislation will be enacted. We will support the UK Government in promoting this legislation and shall, at the earliest opportunity, bring forward a legislative consent motion in the Scottish Parliament to enable football banning orders to be recognised and enforceable across the United Kingdom.</p>

  <p>The first set of national best practice indicators (BPIs) for public procurement in Scotland will be published today. The project is a significant step forward in the procurement reform programme and will be rolled out across the wider public sector.</p>

  <p>The BPIs were developed by a working group with representation from all parts of the public sector, including local authorities, health, higher education/further education and government agencies and non-departmental public bodies. The project will encourage procurement teams within public sector organisations to focus on the priority areas of efficiency, collaboration, compliance, skills and e-procurement with a view to delivering improved value for money and supporting more efficient, effective and coordinated service delivery.</p>
