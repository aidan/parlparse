  <p>The Scottish Executive has taken several measures at national level which will have the effect of encouraging take-up of further education. These include the development of an all-age careers service and the establishment of the Scottish University for Industry (SUfI). SUfI, through its learndirect branded services, promotes a range of routes to lifelong learning in the national press and broadcasting media.</p>

  <p>Scotland&#8217;s 46 further education colleges are autonomous bodies with a statutory responsibility for meeting local demand needs. These diverse needs are met by offering a large number of courses at different levels, in different modes (full-time and part-time), in a wide range of subjects. It is for colleges to advertise their prospectuses within the communities which they serve.</p>

  <p>Participation data for 1999-2000 shows that there were 434,435 enrolments in further education, in both colleges and higher education institutions, an increase of some 3 per cent over the previous year.</p>

  <p>There are currently no plans to introduce a specific fund for befriending and mentoring projects.</p>

  <p>However, the Executive have funded Volunteer Development Scotland (VDS) to work with NHSScotland to re-energise, enhance and develop the role and contribution that volunteers bring to the delivery of health services. Health boards and NHS Trusts have responded favourably to this work and are actively seeking new opportunities to develop the role of volunteers. Work with primary care providers has demonstrated that the NHS&#8217;s concept of volunteering can evolve from its traditional hospital-based service to an integrated service that can support a patient from home to hospital and back to home.</p>

  <p>In addition, and as indicated in the Scottish Health Plan, health boards are now required to develop access to independent advocacy services to support people in making decisions about their own health care.</p>

  <p>NHSScotland Trusts must comply with all statutes, standards, legislation and codes of practice in relation to waste management. Accordingly all NHSScotland Trusts have been provided with best practice management guidance to enable them to categorise, risk assess, segregate and operate clinical waste disposal procedures in keeping with the law and regulatory framework as monitored by the Health and Safety Executive and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. This guidance recommends the measures to be taken to control the risks of infection, both within the NHS Trust environment and also where the waste has to be uplifted and transported to off-site disposal facilities.</p>

  <p>These recommended standards ensure the risks of spreading infection or disease are minimal in each step of the disposal process.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the figures of (a) &#163;35 and (b) &#163;63, as originally set by the Debtors (Scotland) Act 1987 and revised by the Diligence Against Earnings (Variation) (Scotland) Regulations 1995 as the level of net weekly earnings below which no reduction in respect of earnings arrestments may be made, would be currently if they had been updated in line with (i) average earnings and (ii) prices.</p>

  <p>The threshold below which all earnings are exempt from arrestment is set in relation to benefits. The level of &#163;35 per week initially set out in the Debtors (Scotland) Act 1987 was approximately half way between the short-term supplementary benefit rate for a single person and that for a couple. The 1995 recalculation on the same basis used income support rates, which took the place of supplementary benefits. At current rates of income support the threshold would be &#163;70 per week. The level of the 1987 and 1995 thresholds if they had been based on (i) average earnings and (ii) prices would be as shown in the following table. The Executive has revised the thresholds as part of its on-going diligence review and intends to propose revisions in due course.</p>

  <p>We gave the committee a wide remit (including health and public order as well as licensing law). We therefore tried to secure a committee that combined a broad range of interests with a manageable size. We chose members with immediate expertise of the licensed and drink trades, and the operation of the current licensing arrangements. We chose members to cover public health and clinical medicine, policing, and legal and judicial affairs. We also chose members to represent the voluntary sector, and the interests of young people. The committee will doubtless take representations from a still wider range of individuals.</p>

  <p>The members of the committee are giving their time freely, but will receive travel and other reasonable expenses.

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS), to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>HM Prison Aberdeen will benefit from expanded in-prison addictions casework provision from late autumn 2001. Short-term post-release support &quot;throughcare&quot; by SPS will become available offering facilitation support to address their housing, employment, education and training, personal finance and health needs in the period leading up to and for 12 weeks after release.</p>

  <p>Additional addictions nursing support is being introduced this autumn and support from psychologists is also now being made available to the prison to further develop the quality of treatment.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>All prisoners have the right to send and receive mail and to use telephones. That right is subject to the provisions of part 7 of the Prisoners and Young Offenders Institutions (Scotland) Rules 1994 (as amended) which allow a wide range of restrictions to be imposed, primarily in the interests of good order and security and preventing criminal activity. The circumstances in which ordinary letters can be read by prison officers are set out in rule 51. Most of these restrictions apply equally to untried and convicted prisoners. Special provisions apply for legal and court correspondence. Prisoners&#8217; telephone calls can be logged, monitored and recorded under rule 54(2).</p>

  <p>Thirteen rail related projects have been supported by the Scottish Executive&#8217;s Public Transport Fund, and Freight Facilities Grants have been awarded to eight schemes which involve rail freight. The Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) has supported Edinburgh Crossrail through the rail passenger partnership fund, which has also contributed to funding for the re-opening of Beauly station.</p>

  <p>On 27 August I announced that the Scottish Executive is taking forward the Larkhall to Milngavie rail route project in partnership with Strathclyde Passenger Transport.</p>

  <p>The SRA&#8217;s incremental outputs statement (IOS) programmes will deliver network-wide infrastructure improvements. These include improvements at 40 stations initially throughout Scotland, and track and signalling projects planned in Fife, West Lothian and Ayrshire. Work on site is expected to start during the course of 2002.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has given a commitment that the Social Work Services Inspectorate will undertake an up-to-date assessment of arrangements for certification and registration every year through its annual report.</p>

  <p>The report also makes recommendations for action by local authorities, health boards and Trusts, health professionals and voluntary organisations. The Scottish Executive is consulting on these recommendations and will decide in the light of responses received what action is required to improve arrangements for assessing the needs of people with visual impairment.</p>
