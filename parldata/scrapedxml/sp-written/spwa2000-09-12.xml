  <p>It is not possible to disaggregate the contribution made to the Scottish Eating Disorders Interest Group by the NHS and other agency staff. This is an informal group of service providers, users of services and carers drawing local and national attention to eating disorder issues.</p>

  <p>The group has already supported a survey of services in Scotland for people with eating disorders. The results will be published in the Royal College of Psychiatrists Psychiatric Bulletin later this year.</p>

  <p>Local or national decisions on financial and other support for a care network can only be made following detailed consideration of the proposals, once finalised. Existing centres of specialist knowledge will contribute and the overall level of inpatient provision will follow consideration on how any network should develop.</p>

  <p>I expect the planning partners within each health board area to commission services for people of all ages with eating disorders, at all levels of severity, as dictated by local assessments of need. The aim generally is to improve access, break down barriers to smooth care progression, and focus existing expenditure to the best effect for patient care. For children and young people, the expanded inpatient unit at Yorkhill, and the new inpatient unit at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital, together with existing facilities, will contribute to the ambition of continuum of care.</p>

  <p>I have already announced a national census of staff availability, and a mapping of psychological therapies&#8217; service provision. Investment has also been made in developing comprehensive services providing psychological therapies in four health board areas. Potential beneficiaries will include adults with eating disorders. The aim is to achieve a realistic waiting time for patients in primary care, and secondary mental health services. The information and benefits flowing from both initiatives will inform future provision, staff training, service planning and organisation.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to reducing discards of all species. The new EC Technical Conservation Regulation, which came into force on 1 January this year, introduced new measures to reduce discarding. Furthermore, the Scottish Executive recently made regulations requiring the placement of square mesh panels in fishing nets as from 3 August and a reduction in net twine thickness applicable from March next year. These measures will reduce discards of juvenile haddock and whiting.</p>

  <p>Our policy is that the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) should move toward full recovery of the costs of regulation in line with the polluter pays principle. Charges are determined by SEPA at levels that enable it work towards cost recovery.</p>

  <p>At &pound;123, the annual charge, which covers the cost of periodic inspections for monitoring purposes, is considerably lower than originally proposed during public consultation on the Groundwater Regulations. A number of special arrangements have, nevertheless, been made in Scotland to ease the financial burden on farmers of the regulations. In particular, smaller farmers and crofters can share one set of charges by working collectively to dispose of spent sheep dip, thus reducing substantially the amount they pay each year. The annual charge was also waived in Scotland in 1999-2000 while SEPA determined the first tranche of applications.</p>

  <p>The Executive believes that community ownership is the most effective means of securing the step change in investment necessary to improve the condition of Scotland&#8217;s council housing and giving tenants a greater say in the ownership and management of their houses. Around &pound;170 million of the New Housing Partnerships programme has been earmarked for community ownership in the period up to March 2002 and the Chartered Institute of Housing has estimated this could attract some &pound;2 billion of investment.</p>

  <p>It will be for tenants to decide, in ballots, whether to support community ownership. In the meantime, there will continue to be significant investment in Scotland&#8217;s housing. A further &pound;200 million of the New Housing Partnerships programme is earmarked for development and regeneration projects. In addition, resources are made available for capital investment in council housing, for investment in new and improved housing by Scottish Homes, and for programmes such as the Warm Deal and the Rough Sleepers Initiative. During this year and next, a total of almost &pound;1.2 billion of the Executive&#8217;s budget has been allocated to housing programmes.</p>

  <p>The resources from the Public Transport Fund form part of the local authority non-housing capital allocation provision with local authorities issued with consent under section 94 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. Carry forward of sums allocated from the PTF is, generally, a matter for individual local authorities within the carry forward parameters that operate in relation to their mainstream capital programmes.</p>

  <p>Under the provisions made in the UK Transport Bill introduced on 1 December 1999, the Scottish Ministers will be able to issue directions and guidance to the Strategic Rail Authority for the franchise which provides passenger rail services that both start and end in Scotland, and non-binding advice for daytime cross-border services. Since the Bill has not completed its passage through Parliament at Westminster, the Scottish Ministers are not yet able to exercise these powers.</p>

  <p>In advance of legislation, however, the SSRA invited the Scottish Executive to contribute towards the current franchise replacement procedure for the East Coast Main Line. The non-statutory advice submitted by the Scottish Executive included strategic priorities for the route in Scotland but did not prescribe specific infrastructure enhancements or additions. It will be for the train operating company, in conjunction with Railtrack, to ensure the availability of the necessary infrastructure to meet the terms of the franchise.</p>

  <p>We will shortly be consulting on strategic priorities for Scotland&#8217;s railways as part of the process of developing directions and guidance for the Scottish passenger rail franchise. During this process we will give consideration to a wide range of issues, including capacity constraints such as those between Montrose and Usan.</p>

  <p>Training for young people in Scotland is delivered by Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise through the Enterprise Network. Co-ordinated activity is channelled through the Scottish Textiles Network, a body funded and supported by Scottish Enterprise, the key textiles LECs and Highlands and Islands Enterprise.</p>

  <p>There are currently 86 young people undergoing work-based training through the Skillseekers programme, six of whom are training towards Modern Apprenticeships. The Enterprise Network is actively promoting Modern Apprenticeships in order to raise both awareness and the profile of the training programme amongst young people, their parents and employers. The Executive has set the Enterprise Network a target to reduce the proportion of Skillseekers leaving the programme early. Ultimately, it is for employers across all industrial sectors to manage the labour market available to them.</p>
