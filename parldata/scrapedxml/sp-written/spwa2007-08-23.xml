  <p>No date has been set for when Shotts will be made fully accessible for people with disabilities.</p>

  <p>Under the Access for All programme, eight stations have so far been selected to receive funding to improve access for disabled people. These initial eight stations were considered to have a greater priority for investment than Shotts. However, Shotts railway station will be considered for funding, along with the remaining stations requiring access improvements, in the second phase of the programme. This second phase will start in 2009 and finish in 2014 and Transport Scotland will be consulting widely on this programme during 2008.</p>

  <p><em>The Future Development of Air Transport in the UK: Scotland</em> , published in July 2002, provided an analysis of the economic impact of airport development in Scotland in the context of establishing a UK-wide policy framework for the development of air travel to 2030. This national consultation, published by the Department for Transport (DfT) and the Scottish Executive, was the precursor to <em>The Future of Air Transport</em> , the Air Transport White Paper published by DfT in December 2003. The white paper, updated by a progress report published by DfT with Scottish Executive input in December 2006, sets out a policy framework for the development of air travel in the UK up to 2030 against which airport operators, airlines and governments can plan ahead.</p>

  <p>Under the Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005 a body must demonstrate it provides, or intends to provide, public benefit in order to pass the charity test. When determining whether a body provides public benefit the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator (OSCR) must have regard to how the benefit to the public compares to any private benefit or any disbenefit that may result from the activities of the particular body. The OSCR must also have regard to whether there are unduly restrictive conditions on obtaining the benefit the body provides.</p>

  <p>The interpretation of these statutory provisions in the discharge of its regulatory duty is entirely a matter for the OSCR, as an independent regulator. The OSCR has produced guidance on <em>Meeting the Charity Test</em> which includes information on how they will assess public benefit. This is available on their website <a href="http://www.oscr.org.uk" target="_blank">www.oscr.org.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>This Scottish Government is committed to re-examining the case for reinstating a ferry service between Campbeltown and Ballycastle. The Scottish Executive has also proposed that the appraisal consider the possibility of extending the service to Ayrshire. Such a change would increase the number of passengers and strengthen the business case for the services. The developments in Northern Ireland since 2001 may well make the carryings on the route significantly higher than previous estimates. This will all be examined as part of a new appraisal.</p>

  <p>It would therefore be premature to speculate on the likely level of subsidy required or the financial consequences. Further information will be made available as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>Dunoon Pier is owned by Argyll and Bute Council and the Council was responsible for the improvement works at the pier. The Scottish Executive&rsquo;s role was as a co-funder of the project. The council, the Scottish Executive and HITRANS contributed to the cost of the linkspan. I understand that no other organisation was asked to contribute towards the cost of the linkspan.</p>

  <p>This Executive is aware of the value for money issues regarding previous tender exercises for the Campbeltown to Ballycastle ferry service. I understand that Accountable Officer Directions were issued by previous Ministers to Executive officials in 2002 and 2005 because of officials&rsquo; concerns over value for money issues emerging from the economic appraisals undertaken at that time. In re-examining the case for reinstating the service a future appraisal will include value for money issues. Until such time as that appraisal has been completed it would be premature to speculate on whether there has been any change in circumstances.</p>

The action plan will set out how we intend to meet the target by December 2011.</p>

  <p>Officials in my department are undertaking work on estimates of the costs of introducing the whole journey 18-weeks target. This work is on-going. It is not planned to commission independent expert studies to investigate the practicalities and costs of introducing the target.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has considered introducing an arbitration bill to handle small claims out of court.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government intends to introduce an Arbitration Bill at the first appropriate legislative opportunity in order to reform and modernise the law on arbitration as part of its commitment to work with Scotland&rsquo;s legal community to take forward plans to create a Scottish International Arbitration Centre.</p>

  <p>Arbitration may not, however, be the most appropriate method of dispute resolution for small claims. The essence of arbitration is that it is a private procedure whereby parties agree to submit a dispute between them to a third-party, who often has special expertise or knowledge, and who will act as a private tribunal to produce a final and binding determination of the dispute. The parties pay for the services of the arbitrator (unlike a public court where the judge is provided by the state). The cost of arbitration can be high and this means that it is most commonly used by commercial concerns who value the speed, flexibility and confidentiality it offers.</p>

  <p>The disproportionate cost of litigation, particularly in cases of lower financial value, is one of the issues which Lord Gill&rsquo;s review of the civil courts will examine. We also expect that the small claims procedure in the sheriff court and the role of mediation and other methods of dispute resolution in relation to court processes will come under his scrutiny.</p>

  <p>We hope that when legislation to reform the law on arbitration in Scotland has been enacted, this may encourage industries and professions to set up their own low cost arbitration schemes to resolve disputes. Such schemes have already been set up by the Association of British Travel Agents, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Scotland and the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors in Scotland.</p>

  <p>These powers provide that an authority may not grant or renew a taxi licence unless they are satisfied that the vehicle is suitable in type, size and design for use as a taxi and that it is safe for that use.

  <p>NHS Ayrshire and Arran have recently appointed 11 consultants as a result of recent local recruitment campaigns and their consultant vacancy rate is falling. The Scottish Government continues to work with all health boards to reduce consultant vacancy levels and thereby increase the number of consultants in post. There are a number of initiatives currently in place to assist boards in this process, including:</p>

  <p>matching the career aspirations of doctors about to complete their training with current and expected consultant vacancies thereby improving the flow of information between doctors in training and health boards;</p>

  <p>providing funding, through an advance appointments scheme, to allow newly qualified consultants to take up post in tandem with the current consultant for a period of up to six months thereby easing the transition from doctor in training to consultant, and</p>

  <p>improving the advertising arrangements for consultant vacancies.</p>

  <p>Health boards now produce workforce plans which include demand predictions for all staff groups. These plans are used to help match workforce supply and demand at both a national and local level.</p>

  <p>NHSScotland is making excellent progress towards delivery of the waiting times targets announced in 2004 and scheduled to come into effect at the end of 2007. This is bringing benefits to patients across Scotland. However, we believe that performance improvement needs to go further to meet the expectations of patients and the public in Scotland. That is why we have announced our intention to introduce a target of a maximum 18 weeks from GP referral to treatment for delivery by the end of 2011.</p>

  <p>To achieve the performance improvements made to date, the NHS has invested in additional capacity, service redesign, extended staff roles, more productive equipment and more modern facilities and in training clinical staff. Expenditure by the NHS in Scotland in 2006-07 was &pound;10.1 billion, compared with &pound;8.86 billion in 2004-05. It is not possible to separate out the different components of this expenditure in relation to each of the waiting times targets or to other elements of service change and improvement implemented over the last three years. Audit Scotland&rsquo;s report <em>Tackling waiting times in the NHS in Scotland</em>, published in February 2006, concluded that &quot;all elective care makes a contribution to tackling waiting times and spending elsewhere in the health system can also affect waiting times indirectly. It is not possible to identify this spending separately.&quot;</p>

  <p>Planning authorities have powers provided under the Town and Country Planning legislation to take flood risk into account in determining planning applications and to refuse them if appropriate. If a proposal is likely to increase the number of buildings at risk of flooding, the legislation requires the authority to consult Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) who have a statutory duty to provide advice. If a planning authority wishes to approve an application contrary to SEPA&rsquo;s advice it has to be notified to the Scottish ministers who may decide to call it in for their own decision.</p>

  <p>The national policy regarding development at risk of flooding is contained in <em>Scottish Planning Policy (SPP)7 - Planning and Flooding</em>. Its central purpose is to prevent further development which would have a significant probability of being affected by flooding. In particular it says that built development should not take place on functional flood plains and identifies areas with an annual probability of flooding greater than 0.5% (1:200) as being &quot;medium to high risk&quot; where undeveloped or sparsely developed areas are generally not suitable for additional development. There are no plans to change these provisions.</p>

  <p>Argyll and Bute Council was responsible for the new breakwater and linkspan at Dunoon. Planning permission for the original breakwater scheme was granted through due process in consultation with Scottish ministers. The linkspan was a late addition to the breakwater scheme. It is my understanding that the council took the view that the new linkspan was &quot;permitted development&quot;. Consequently, the council concluded that the addition of the new linkspan to the original breakwater scheme required neither separate planning permission nor to be referred to Scottish ministers.</p>

  <p>The promoter has reported to the Scottish Executive that they did not use a benchmark cost/kilometre to calculate the capital costs due to the number of variables along the route. Instead, the promoter used a &quot;bottom-up&quot; approach which was based on calculating actual quantities for the construction components based on the preliminary design and applying the most applicable industry rates to these components. This methodology was widely accepted to be a more robust approach to the benchmark cost/kilometre figures used by the Strategic Rail Authority in estimating construction costs for new lines else where in the United Kingdom where there is insufficient information.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland commissioned Network Rail to undertake a study into the potential electrification of the Edinburgh to Glasgow rail route. This GRIP Stage 1 study included a summary of the key issues by engineering discipline, a high level programme and estimates of likely costs to +/- 50% quality. It was taken forward by Network Rail in consultation with Transport Scotland and was published in June 2007. Electrification of the Edinburgh to Glasgow line is now being considered as part of the wider work of improving reliability, reducing journey times and providing capacity for the expected continuing growth in rail passenger numbers on this route. First ScotRail and Network Rail are participating in this work. The results of this will be reported in September and will be considered as part of the Strategic Transport Projects Review.</p>

  <p>No. The current cost estimate, in the range &pound;295 million to &pound;395 million, is based upon the Milltimber Brae Option including costs for the Stonehaven Fastlink. The cost range gives a truer picture of the inherent risks and uncertainties associated with planning and constructing such a major piece of infrastructure. The final cost will not be known until tenders have been returned and the contract completed.</p>

  <p>The review of transport projects conducted in the early weeks of this government revealed that the previously announced completion date would not be achieved. The impact of the delay to the completion date may result in increased costs due to construction and tender price inflation. The final costs will not be known until tenders have been returned and the contract completed. Project out-turn costs are currently estimated to lie between &pound;295 million and &pound;395 million.</p>

  <p>As I stated in my answer to question S3W-1864 on 17 July 2007, further scoping work is underway and this will feed into the Strategic Transport Projects Review (STPR).

The STPR is due to report in summer 2008.</p>

  <p>The introduction of water metering to non-household premises was driven by customers&rsquo; responses to the former Executives&rsquo; <em>Paying for Water Services </em> consultation in 2004. It was clear at that time that customers considered metering as the fairest and most transparent method of paying for water services. The analysis of the consultation can be viewed at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/02/20671/52284" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/02/20671/52284</a> .</p>

  <p>An effect of this change will be that customers who use less water should attract a smaller charge. Future charge levels for customers will however depend on a number of factors. These include specific consumption patterns, rateable values (used to calculate the surface water drainage element of the bill), the steps that customers take to manage their demand on the public system, the wholesale charging scheme that Scottish Water will apply to licensed retailers and how these retailers decide to charge customers with the introduction of retail competition from 2008.</p>
