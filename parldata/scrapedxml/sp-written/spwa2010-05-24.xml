  <p>NHS Ayrshire and Arran is responsible for ensuring that Girvan Community Hospital is designed in accordance with the Disability Discrimination Act.</p>

  <p>The hospital was designed and planned to fully comply with the Building Standards (Scotland) Regulations, including relevant compliance with the Disability Discrimination Act. Its design specification included reference to five sets of relevant guidance on disability awareness and access issues, all of which were cross-referenced in the Health Facilities Scotland (HFS) Dementia Design Checklist.</p>

  <p>The checklist, produced in association with The Dementia Services Development Centre (DSDC) and for use across all healthcare premises, was published in 2007 &ndash; after the design process for Girvan Community Hospital was completed. HFS also produced a Dementia Audit Tool, in association with DSDC, in 2008.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are responsible for designing all primary care premises in accordance with the Disability Discrimination Act, as part of their wider accountability under the act for eliminating discrimination and promoting equality of access for disabled people including those with cognitive impairment. NHS Health Scotland provides guidance and training to boards on these issues, including Achieving Fair Access to cover access issues and staff attitudes to people with disabilities.</p>

  <p>Health Facilities Scotland, in association with The Dementia Services Development Centre, published guidance on dementia-friendly design in 2007 and 2008 for use across all healthcare premises including those operated by independent contractors.</p>

  <p>A range of professionals in each board are trained in auditing dementia-friendly design, and all boards have a team of accredited auditors to advise on the suitability of existing and new NHS facilities for people with dementia.</p>

  <p>The Fuel Poverty Forum has been monitoring the first year of the energy assistance package and has recommended changes in the course of the year, particularly around eligibility. The new managing agent contract also provided the opportunity to incorporate the lessons learned since the letting of the last contract. Consequently, the new managing agent contract sets a higher proportion of performance related payments allied to demanding performance indicators, than in the past.</p>

  <p>Between February and April of this year Scottish Government officials within the European Structural Funds Division undertook an informal consultation on post-2013 Cohesion Policy, including the future use of Structural Funds in Scotland. As part of the process the following meetings with stakeholders were held:</p>

  <p>25 February 2010: Meeting with MEPs, European Parliament, Brussels</p>

  <p>25 February 2010: Meeting with Scotland Europa, COSLA and Highlands and Islands European Partnership (HIEP), Scotland House, Brussels</p>

  <p>26 March and 13 April 2010: Meetings with European Policy Research Centre, University of Strathclyde, Atlantic Quay, Glasgow.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not record the incidence of Norovirus in care homes. However, care home service providers must notify any Norovirus outbreak to the relevant health board. Depending on the circumstances, the board may in turn notify Health Protection Scotland. How the data is collected and analysed are matters for HPS. More information can be obtained from their website, <a href="http://www.hps.scot.nhs.uk" target="_blank">www.hps.scot.nhs.uk</a> , or by contacting directly HPS at:</p>

  <p>All children with cystic fibrosis must receive care from a multi-disciplinary team of specialist doctors, nurses and AHPs, in line with agreed standards of care, wherever they live. The employment of clinical staff such as specialist nurses is a matter for NHS boards. We do, however, ask NHS boards to consider the role of specialist nurses as part of their plans to make sure that services meet the needs of people living with cystic fibrosis and all long-term conditions.</p>

  <p>NHS Lothian and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde have confirmed that its cystic fibrosis nurse specialists have recently started to undertake one shift a month working within the ward setting and this allows the opportunity to fulfil many aspects of their job description.</p>

  <p>The assimilation process of Agenda for Change is complete and all NHSScotland staff are being paid in accordance with the new system. Staff who were dissatisfied with their initial pay banding, however, had the right to request a review. School Nurses in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS Board area have accessed the review system.</p>

  <p>I understand that all the initial review panels in Glasgow have now taken place, and that, in some cases involving school nurses, review panels have not been able to reach agreement. The board has therefore decided to investigate this matter further. The board is very much aware of how important this is to staff and it is working hard to resolve the outstanding issues as soon as possible. Although I recognise that this further delay will be unwelcome for school nurses considering the time they have already waited, it is right that the board takes the time required to examine these issues properly.</p>

  <p>We have consistently put emphasis on taking each aspect of implementation of Agenda for Change forward in full partnership between employers and staff side because we believe that this is the best way of ensuring that outcomes are robust.</p>

  <p>Job title will not indicate a specific banding under the Agenda for Change system since job titles were often used quite generically previously. Rather it is the job description which is matched by a specially trained panel against a range of pre-existing job profiles. The job profile match will then indicate a pay banding. There are school nurse job profiles available at Band 5, Band 6 and Band 7 levels and the spread of these bandings in a given area will reflect how the board has chosen to organise this particular service.</p>

  <p>As with most other staff costs, the finance to cover the salaries of staff on the Agenda for Change system comes from NHS boards&rsquo; general allocations. All staff are already being paid under the Agenda for Change system and all back pay in respect of initial banding has already been passed to the staff concerned. Staff who were dissatisfied with their initial pay banding had the right to request a review. Where a review results in an increase in banding, this may result in that staff member receiving a further payment of back pay. However, as with a range of other minor fluctuations in costs, this is a matter which boards would manage locally as part of their ongoing financial management of services and not something on which the Scottish Government would collect data.</p>
