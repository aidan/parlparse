  <p>Dental schools in both Scotland and the rest of the UK see considerable educational benefit to undergraduate dentists visiting and working in a range of primary care dental services. Outreach education has already been established within the community dental service by Glasgow Dental School and Dundee Dental School are exploring how this could be extended to the General Dental Services through piloting such a development this year within Tayside. If this is successful, Dundee will make recommendations on how such schemes could be used more widely in the education and training of both dental students and students of dental hygiene throughout Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Directive concerns the placing of biocidal products in the market. It brings in an approval system for four categories of biocidal product &#8211; disinfectants and general biocides, preservatives, pest control agents and other biocides, such as anti-fouling agents and embalming fluids. It aims to provide a high level of protection for humans, animals and the environment and to harmonise the European market for such products. The regime covers both reserved and devolved issues. In that circumstance, I have agreed that implementation should be by GB Regulations. A copy of the Regulations, which have been laid before the UK Parliament, will be placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre.</p>

  <p>We shall lay today regulations to increase prescription and other National Health Service charges in Scotland from 1 April 2001. There will be a 1.67% increase in the prescription charge of 10p, from &#163;6.00 to &#163;6.10 per item dispensed.</p>

  <p>This is well within our commitment that NHS charges will rise by no more than the rate of inflation and means that prescription charges will again fall in real terms. This is the third successive year that the increase has been held to 10p.</p>

  <p>Prescription pre-payment certificates will go up from &#163;31.40 to &#163;31.90 (1.59%) for four months and from &#163;86.20 to &#163;87.60 (1.62%) for 12 months. The arrangements under which refunds can be obtained on the unused portion of certificates will be extended under the new regulations.</p>

  <p>Prescription charges are expected to raise around &#163;45 million for the NHS in Scotland in 2001-02.</p>

  <p>Charges for elastic stockings and tights, wigs and most fabric supports supplied through the Hospital Service will be increased similarly.</p>

  <p>The maximum patient charge for a single course of dental treatment begun on or after 1 April 2001 will increase from &#163;354 to &#163;360. Only about one in every 1,000 courses of treatment will attract the new maximum charge.</p>

  <p>We are committed to providing support for transport to and within remote communities in the Highlands and Islands. In relation to lifeline ferry services, revenue support to Caledonian MacBrayne to support services to the Western Isles and on the Clyde is at a record &#163;19.9 million in the current year. We are also paying &#163;11 million in Block Subsidy to P&amp;O Scottish Ferries in respect of its services to the Northern Isles. In relation to roads, last year&#8217;s Spending Review provided an additional &#163;70 million over the next three years to tackle the backlog of repairs to local roads and bridge maintenance, as part of the single allocations to local authorities. &#163;444 million is already committed to strengthening the trunk road network in 2000-02, and this will rise to &#163;512 million for the period 2002-04. A significant proportion of this investment in both local and trunk roads will flow into the Highlands and Islands.</p>

  <p>More generally, an extra &#163;60 million is being made available over the next three years to enhance transport in the Highlands and Islands following the Spending Review. This figure includes additional provision for Caledonian MacBrayne, Highlands and Islands Airports Limited, lifeline air services, grants for piers and harbours and the Rural Transport Fund.</p>

  <p>Scottish Opera has proved in recent years that it is capable of a standard of performance of international class. The productions of Das Rheingold at the Edinburgh Festival last year and of Madame Butterfly have been enthusiastically received by critics and public alike. In addition, its educational and outreach work has proved it capable of reaching out to a the widest possible audience. We should congratulate the company on this excellence and take pride that Scotland is the home of a company capable of delivering such quality.</p>

  <p>I am determined that the company should continue to play the role in the cultural life of Scotland set out in the national cultural strategy for our national companies. It will not be able to do that without significant support from the Scottish Arts Council.</p>

  <p>I have carefully considered the future levels of funding in the light of the circumstances of the company and of the competing pressures within the arts sector and taking into account the comments of the Scottish Arts Council. In preparing that advice, the council invited Sir Peter Jonas, formerly Chief Executive of English National Opera, to review the business plan. Among his observations was that in terms of the level of subsidy and staffing levels, Scottish Opera compares favourably with a number of other companies with which he is familiar.</p>

  <p>I have also taken account of the effects of the period of extreme financial difficulty and uncertainty faced by the company, which led to the emergency payments of &#163;2.1 million in November 1999. I am determined to avoid similar crises occurring again. It was evident at the time of that emergency support that a period of adjustment was necessary before the company would reach a position of financial stability. A new Chairman, a new board and new management team have taken a grip of the company and are addressing the formidable challenges in creating that stability. Nevertheless this year has not been easy, despite the considerable artistic success. In order to control its costs, the board took the difficult decision to go dark in the last quarter of this year when there have been no main scale productions.</p>

  <p>I have also taken particular account of the exceptional costs imposed on the company by the ambitious project to perform the Ring Cycle over this and the next three years. I firmly believe that this will be seen as an artistic triumph and bring great credit to the company, to the Edinburgh International Festival and to Scotland generally.</p>

  <p>I am therefore pleased to confirm that significantly increased resources will be available to the company in this and the next three years. In total, over these four years support from the Scottish Arts Council will amount to &#163;30.634 million. The annual grant for next year, and each of the subsequent two years will be &#163;7.473 million. The support in this year will ensure that the company enters the next three-year period in as stable a financial position as possible.</p>

  <p>This is a generous settlement, but it still imposes severe financial discipline on the company. It will have to seek cost savings and plan its future programme within strict financial constraints. The company now has the management and artistic team in place to ensure this and that it lives within its means and fulfils its potential.</p>
