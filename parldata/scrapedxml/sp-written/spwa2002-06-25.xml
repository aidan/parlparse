  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what information it has received about any proposed meeting between representatives of Highlands and Islands Airport Limited (HIAL) and Ryanair on 19 June 2002; what assistance it will provide to HIAL in order to ensure that there is a successful outcome to any such negotiations on the establishment of new routes from Highlands and Islands airports; in particular, whether it will provide any assistance in respect of landing charges, and what steps it will take to see the growth of air routes and passenger numbers within areas served by HIAL.</p>

  <p>The meeting between Highlands and Islands Airports Ltd (HIAL) and Ryanair on 19 <sup> </sup> June follows on from a meeting on 25 April about the possibility of the Irish carrier operating from HIAL airports. Meetings between HIAL and its users and potential users are a commercial matter for the airport operator.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is providing record levels of support to HIAL to maintain the airport infrastructure for essential air services in the Highlands and Islands. This support also allows HIAL to offer substantial discounts on landing charges for new services or increased frequencies which would lead to increased passenger numbers.</p>

  <p>The level of funding provided to police forces is now at record levels as are police numbers.</p>

  <p>It is an operational matter for the Chief Constable of Strathclyde Police to determine how to use the funding at his disposal to meet local needs and priorities within the Strathclyde area. I understand that initiatives are planned in both East and West Dunbartonshire during the summer months to provide an enhanced visible police presence in order to deter youth disorder and other aspects of criminal behaviour.</p>

  <p>In addition, under the previous challenge funding arrangements for CCTV and community safety we have partially funded CCTV projects in Clydebank Town Centre, Dumbarton Town Centre, New Bonhill, Bishopbriggs and a system covering Bearsden, Kirkintilloch, Lenzie and Milngavie, as well as youth shelters in West Dunbartonshire.</p>

  <p>On 31 October 2001 we announced details of a new Community Safety Partnership Award programme to supersede both the CCTV and Community Safety Challenge Competitions. The Programme will allow Community Safety Partnerships to secure, for the first time, sustained mainstream funding to be used solely for the purposes of taking forward their community safety agendas and to identify and address local priorities. For 2002-03 West Dunbartonshire Community Safety Partnership has been allocated a total community safety award of &#163;118,491.54 and East Dunbartonshire Community Safety Partnership have been allocated &#163;94,530.47.</p>

  <p>Substantial additional resources have also been allocated to the Dunbartonshire area to tackle drug misuse.</p>

  <p>Dunbartonshire Export Partnership is one of the 13 local export partnerships that cover the whole of Scotland, each of which plays an important role in focussing the trade development activities of the local enterprise company, local authority and Chamber of Commerce. They are responsible for enabling companies to reach a stage where they are ready to compete overseas and in financial year 2001-02 Dunbartonshire Export Partnership assisted six companies to trade overseas for the first time and 35 existing exporters to enter new markets.</p>

  <p>The assistance provided by Dunbartonshire Export Partnership is further augmented by Scottish Development International which leads the network of export partnerships and is able to offer additional support and services to companies including assistance through its network of overseas offices.</p>

  <p>One of a range of initiatives undertaken by Dunbartonshire Export Partnership is the establishment of an International Trade Forum in partnership with Scottish Enterprise Renfrewshire to make companies aware of the opportunities available in overseas markets. Meetings are held at six-weekly intervals alternately in Dunbartonshire and Renfrewshire. Each event provides an overview of market conditions and business practices they are likely to encounter in particular geographic areas.</p>

  <p>The publications <em>A Smart, Successful Scotland</em> and <em>A Science Strategy for Scotland </em> set out the Executive's programme for competitiveness and growth. Innovation within companies is a key component in this strategy and the Executive and UK Government provide a wide range of initiatives in this area.</p>

  <p>The Global Connections Strategy, launched in October 2001, set out the Executive&#8217;s aims for future international economic development activity. The strategy led to the creation of Scottish Development International and one of its key aims is to ensure that companies are able to realise the full benefits of trading in international markets. It provides generic and custom market research and knowledge to Scottish companies and delivers customised strategic market entry support. This covers a wide range of activities including the delivery of all government trade services in Scotland, tailored Market Assistance Programmes and assistance for companies on outward missions and attendance at exhibitions. In addition, Scottish Enterprise&#8217;s Global Companies Development Programme addresses innovation as part of its aim to support the deeper internationalisation of potential Scottish global organisations.</p>

This is the measure most commonly used to measure business births. It is not a complete picture as not all businesses register and not all registrations are start-ups, but it is a consistent series based on administrative data that provides a comparison over time and place.</p>

  <p>A number of initiatives are under way, or proposed, that are designed to eliminate or minimise atmospheric pollution. The Pollution Prevention and Control (Scotland) Regulations 2000 impose new, more stringent air pollution controls over a wide range of industrial sectors, phased in on a sector by sector basis between 2001 and 2007. In addition to imposing tighter controls over emissions of pollutants to the atmosphere, the regulations also introduce tighter controls over noise, vibration and odour emissions.</p>

  <p>Stricter controls on emissions from waste incinerators are currently being developed in line with the Waste Incineration Directive. The Executive aims to consult on this during the summer. Tighter controls covering industrial solvent emissions were introduced by directions given to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency in March 2002. It is proposed to extend these controls to cover additional industrial sectors following a public consultation later this year.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Environment Act 1995 requires local authorities to carry out a review and assessment of air quality within their areas, and take action where air quality objectives are unlikely to be met within a set timescale. These requirements are set out in <em>The Air Quality Strategy for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland</em>.</p>

  <p>The UK Small Cetacean Bycatch Response Strategy Working Group was set up last July to estimate levels of bycatch and identify practical, cost-effective ways of reducing them. The Scottish Executive, other government departments, conservation agencies and the Association of Sea Fisheries Committees are all represented.</p>

  <p>A range of mitigation measures aimed at reducing the levels of dolphin and porpoise bycatch is under consideration. The group plans to produce a UK Bycatch Response Strategy later this year. It is also reviewing a number of gear mitigation measures which, if successful, will be considered in the context of reform of the Common Fisheries Policy and, in consultation with stakeholders, for subsequent introduction in the fisheries concerned.</p>

  <p>The following table lists the one-stop clinics that are currently in place across NHS Greater Glasgow.</p>

  <p>It is for local NHS systems to plan, implement and manage services that best meet the needs of their local populations. I therefore suggest that North Glasgow University Hospital NHS Trust would be best placed to advise the member of any plans it has to introduce further one-stop clinics in the member&#8217;s constituency.</p>

  <p>During their training, GP Registrars (GPR) have regular case review within general practice and are supported by experienced trainers. This ensures that all patient encounters are learning experiences for the GPR.</p>

  <p>GPs, like other professionals, are expected to look at their own personal learning needs and the health needs of their patients and to seek training in specific areas accordingly. Guidance and assistance is available from NHS Education for Scotland (NES) via the postgraduate Directors of General Practice Education. Each GP already receives an annual Postgraduate Education Allowance to support an agreed amount of training. The appraisal process for GPs will, in the future, play a significant part in the needs assessment and satisfactory continuous professional development based on the needs of individuals and the service.</p>

  <p>There are numerous opportunities for GPs who identify dermatological conditions as one of their personal learning needs to access further training. In addition the recent establishment of NES will allow a co-ordinated, multi-disciplinary approach to training in this area.</p>

  <p>There are no plans for a Scottish equivalent of the Department of Health&#8217;s Action On Dermatology initiative. The Designed Health care Initiative is currently the main centrally driven mechanism for supporting service redesign in NHSScotland. This has led to the development of areas of expertise and experience throughout NHSScotland to support local service redesign activity in dermatology services, including the integrated rapid referral for skin cancer service in Lanarkshire and the redesign of dermatology out-patient services in Grampian.</p>

  <p>While I welcome any proposals that will benefit patients, NHS Greater Glasgow&#8217;s plans to centralise dermatology services are at present the subject of public consultation. It would not, therefore, be appropriate for me to comment on the proposals at this time.</p>

  <p>The campaign&#8217;s Driver Behaviour Strategy, which addresses the issues of speeding, drink and drug driving, seatbelt use and young driver safety, aims to modify unsafe and undesirable driver behaviours.</p>

  <p>Campaign initiatives include &quot;Foolsspeed&quot;, a long-term campaign which aims to change driver attitudes to speed and speed choice, while &quot;Don&#8217;t Risk It&quot; addresses drink driving. On 20 May the campaign launched a new television advert focussing on drug driving. The campaign has also produced adverts on the issues of seat belt use and young driver safety. It has made arrangements for publicity campaigns on all these issues in the current financial year.</p>

  <p>Road safety publicity undertaken by the campaign is evaluated to determine its effectiveness.</p>

  <p>Today we are announcing our response to schools modernisation proposals that we have received from 15 councils. We are also setting out how work will be taken forward on modernising the whole school estate across Scotland.</p>

  <p>This announcement builds on the joint statement agreed with COSLA at Balfron High School last October, and marks the beginning of the biggest ever school building programme in Scotland with a step change in the level of investment that will deliver an ultra-modern learning environment for the future:</p>

  <p>We will support PPP projects across 15 bidding authorities which will see the replacement or substantial refurbishment of around 300 schools. Details are set out in Table 1.</p>

  <p>We are supporting investment of &#163;1.15 billion to deliver this programme.</p>

  <p>We have invited further PPP bids later in the year and will make up to &#163;150,000 funding available to councils to assist them in preparing their Outline Business Case.</p>

  <p>We have established a joint School Estate Strategy Group with COSLA to progress work on local authorities&#8217; school estate plans, a survey of the condition of the school estate, and the development of a national strategy for improvement beyond that announced today.</p>

  <p>&#163;26.7 million will be allocated through the School Buildings Improvement Fund to fund immediate improvement and maintenance work in 2002-03; details are set out in Table 2, in addition to authorities&#8217; own spending on school buildings of around &#163;120 million.</p>

  <p>Table 1 shows the indicative level of PPP investment for which the Executive will provide revenue support in each council area:</p>

  <p>I am pleased to announce the publication today of the Executive&#8217;s Community Regeneration Statement, <em>Better Communities in Scotland: Closing the Gap</em> , which sets out how we intend to turn around deprived communities and create a better life for those living in them. While there have been many successful programmes in Scotland, the statement signals a number of important shifts in our approach to regeneration. Firstly, we intend moving away from funding isolated, project-based regeneration initiatives, which have limited impact. We will in future place regeneration within a wider strategic framework, which the community planning process provides. This will result in more cohesion between national, regional and local priorities, better targeting of resources, better quality of services in deprived areas, and more effective community involvement. Secondly, as a consequence of our new policy approach, we intend migrating social inclusion partnerships to community planning partnership funding and management over the next three to four years. Thirdly, we will place a higher priority on providing individuals and communities with the skills and confidence necessary to take advantage of opportunities and to play a full part in the life of their communities. Fourthly, we will put in place a more robust monitoring and evaluation framework that will allow us to measure progress much more effectively than we have done in the past. Together these proposals will make a significant contribution to closing the gap between deprived communities and the rest of Scotland. Copies of the Community Regeneration Statement are available from the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre.</p>
