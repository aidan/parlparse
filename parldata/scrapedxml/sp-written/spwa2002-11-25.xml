  <p>There are no plans to provide a further definition of &quot;reasonable adjustments&quot; for a sheriff court or any other public building. Given the wide range of disabilities and the disparate nature of each building this would not be practicable. Ultimately it will be for the courts to decide on how the legislation should be interpreted in individual cases.</p>

  <p>It is expected that liquid-based cytology (LBC) will be fully introduced into the cervical screening programme in Scotland by April 2004.</p>

  <p>To assist with the introduction of LBC the Scottish Executive has provided up to &#163;2.75 million for the set-up costs which consists of either the capital or first-year leasing costs of processing machinery and the associated training and proficiency costs. The on-going costs are part of the cervical screening programme funding which is the responsibility of NHS boards and trusts.</p>

  <p>At present cytoscreener staffing levels across Scotland are sufficient to meet the needs of the cervical screening programme. It is not anticipated that additional cervical screening laboratory professionals - above the agreed staffing levels - will be required as a result of introducing liquid-based cytology (LBC) into the cervical screening programme. It is expected that LBC will reduce the workload and improve laboratory smear reporting times.</p>

  <p>The introduction of LBC will be closely monitored by the NHSScotland Screening Programmes and the Scottish Executive Health Department.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer given to question S1W-19634 on 5 November 2001, in which I announced that the Registrar General had published his proposals from the consultation <i>Civil Registration in the 21st Century</i> . That consultation involved a wide range of organisations and encouraged responses from local authorities, registrars, churches, community councils, genealogists and others.</p>

  <p>The Registrar General's proposals included the possibility of requiring certain additional information to be given when registering a birth, death or marriage. He gave as an example the recording of the date of birth of parents when registering the birth of their child. This could facilitate family history searches at a later date. The Registrar General is considering this matter and an announcement will be made in due course.</p>

  <p>In the main the evaluations refer to the increased likelihood of detection of perpetrators; the ability of operators to spot potential incidents before they develop; clearer descriptions of perpetrators; accused being more likely to plead guilty if caught on camera; police confidence in the system, and calmer feeling in the town centres.</p>

  <p>Under existing legislation (section 1 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980), education authorities across Scotland must make provision for pupils with special educational needs, including dyslexia. It is therefore the statutory responsibility of the education authority to ensure that schools are adequately resourced, and that staff are properly trained to support pupils with dyslexia. Schools will use a range of strategies to support children according to each child&#146;s individual needs.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has issued guidance on educational provision and support for pupils with special educational needs, including dyslexia. The guidance, Circular ED 4/96 <i>Children and Young Persons with Special Educational Needs &#150; Assessment and Recording</i>, and the <i>Manual of Good Practice in Special Educational Needs</i>,<i> </i>has been disseminated widely, including to all local authorities and schools. Both documents are available in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. numbers 4386 and 3984). In addition, a number of local authorities issue guidance specifically on dyslexia to schools in their area.</p>

  <p>The information is not held centrally. As agricultural waste, plants harvested from GM crop trials would be exempt from waste management controls under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (as amended), and so would not generally be the subject of landfill license conditions. However, under the standard terms of the deliberate release consent issued by Scottish ministers under that act, disposal of harvested plants within the UK must be in a local authority landfill site under the assurance that the material will be incorporated in a manner to prevent growth into flowering plants.</p>

  <p>Professor Grant and the steering board that is leading this element of the public debate are currently preparing a detailed programme deploying the considerable amount of public funding that has been made available for this purpose.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive and the other UK administrations are committed to a meaningful debate that gets to the root of what matters to the public about the issues raised by the possible commercialisation of GM crops. We believe that the budget that has been provided is commensurate with this aim. The conclusions of the debate will be invaluable in assisting ministers when the results of the current farm-scale evaluations are considered and when future decisions on possible commercialisation need to be taken.</p>

  <p>NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (formerly called the Quality and Standards Board for Health in Scotland) will come into existence, subject to parliamentary approval, on 1 January 2003.</p>

  <p>NHS Quality Improvement Scotland will be created through the merger of five organisations: the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland, the Health Technology Board for Scotland, the Scottish Health Advisory Service, the Nursing and Midwifery Practice Development Unit, and the Clinical Audit and Resource Group. The combined budget of these organisations in 2002-03 is &#163;9.7 million and they employ around 105 staff.</p>

  <p>NHS Quality Improvement Scotland&#146;s budget for 2003-04 and 2004-05 is still to be determined. The board will assess any need for additional funding to undertake new tasks it has been asked to deliver.</p>

  <p>On training for GPs, at present, GPs are expected to look after their own personal learning needs to better provide for the health needs of their patients and to seek training accordingly. Guidance and assistance is available to GPs from NHS Education for Scotland via the Postgraduate Directors of General Practice Education.</p>

  <p>The training of other health care professionals is a matter for NHS trusts at local level to determine. The additional investment to implement the cancer plan has been used by some areas to support the development of training in palliative care for health care professionals, including nurses. The involvement of members of the primary care team in Managed Clinical Networks for palliative care will also help with awareness and training.</p>

  <p>Clinical Standards Board for Scotland cancer standards include the core standard that all health care professionals in cancer services undergo continuing education and training including the principles and philosophy of palliative care.</p>

  <p>Information is available from the Crown Office system about the number of cases received by procurators fiscal during the last three financial years that included charges under the section mentioned. Information is not available from that system in relation to the outcome of every such charge as only whole case outcomes are currently recorded.</p>

  <p>Some information is available from published Scottish Executive statistics about persons proceeded against and convicted where the main charge in the case was a contravention of the section mentioned. It should be noted that where a person is proceeded against for more that one crime or offence, only the &quot;main charge&quot; is recorded for Scottish Executive statistical purposes in these statistics. The main charge is that which is the most serious and receives the severest penalty. In addition, the information is collected by calendar year and is available for calendar years up to the end of 2000. It is not therefore possible to relate the Crown Office data on incoming cases to the Scottish Executive data on proceedings and disposals.</p>

  <p>The information described is provided in the following tables.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Local Government (Elections) Act 2002 allows ministers to extend successful pilots throughout Scotland by order. As only three pilots have been run to date, the Executive believes that it needs to secure more experience in order to determine best practice and decide whether all-postal voting should be extended to all local authorities. There are therefore no current plans to simplify procedures or give local authorities the right to decide whether council by-elections should be held by postal ballot only. The Executive has ensured that the process of applying to run a pilot is not arduous and that applications are dealt with quickly.</p>

  <p>Trunk road maintenance contractors are required to comply with the requirements of Chapter 8 of the <i>Traffic Signs Manual</i> , "Traffic Safety Measures and Signs for Roadworks and Temporary Situations", which includes the use of temporary mandatory speed limits. These speed limits are often necessary to protect the workforce and drivers during roadworks particularly when the available width for traffic is restricted by traffic cones. For this reason speed limits are often left in place when no work is being carried out, and we have no plans to alter procedures in such circumstances.</p>
