  <p>Cervical screening is and will remain an important part of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s strategy on reducing the burden of cancer through early detection for many years to come. The introduction of the Human Papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination programme is expected to have an impact on the prevalence of HPV, and so cervical cancer, amongst women in Scotland in the long term, and this may in due course lead to changes in the screening programme.</p>

  <p>The vaccination programme will not have an immediate impact upon the screening programme given that we will need to continue to offer cervical screening to those women who were out with the age range to receive the vaccine. We will continue to take account of epidemiological and surveillance information when taking decisions about the screening programme. The screening programme will also change as new technologies evolve such as automated imaging for cervical cytology and HPV testing.</p>

  <p>As a result of research into women&rsquo;s attitudes to screening, NHS Health Scotland will publish new information leaflets for women which will be sent with the women&rsquo;s invitation to screening. These will be available later this year. In addition, new leaflets which give more specific information for women attending for the first time and lesbian and bisexual women will be published.</p>

  <p>Of the 15,066 referrals to stage four in 2009-10, 1,825 households did not complete an eligibility survey. Of these:</p>

  <p>Six hundred and ninety-six referrals were cancelled because the managing agent was unable to contact the customer. Referrals were only cancelled after the managing agent had attempted four contact calls and issued a letter to the applicant requesting contact within a month;</p>

  <p>Two hundred and seven households referred were rejected at an initial screening on the eligibility criteria without having an eligibility survey undertaken, and</p>

  <p>Nine hundred and twenty-two households referred withdrew before completion of the eligibility survey. The table provides a breakdown of the reasons provided.</p>

  <p>Concessionary travel remains a priority for the Scottish Government. We have taken steps in the current financial year to support the efficiency and sustainability of the Scotland-wide free bus travel scheme for older and disabled people, through a package of reforms agreed with the bus industry following the publication of the review of the scheme, and the scheme will also be extended to injured service veterans from April 2011.</p>

  <p>It is primarily the responsibility of NHS boards to work with other key agencies to provide appropriate services for these groups in a holistic and integrated way.</p>

  <p>In 2007 the Scottish Government published the <em>Closing The Gaps</em> guidance to boards, with a series of recommendations including that local substance misuse and mental health services should have in place an agreed assessment tool to identify co-morbidity and enable the package of care to be matched to the range of needs.</p>

  <p>Both <em>Changing Scotland&rsquo;s Relationship with Alcohol: A Framework for Action</em> and Scotland&rsquo;s national drugs strategy <em>The Road to Recovery</em> recognises the need for better integration of services, to ensure that barriers to an individual&rsquo;s recovery - such as a mental health problem &ndash; are addressed in conjunction with treatment for drug and alcohol problems. This is a fundamental element of progress in the national health target HEAT A11 which includes an expectation that by 2013 90% of clients will wait no longer than three weeks from referral to treatment to appropriate drugs treatment to support their recovery. A referral to treatment time appropriate to alcohol treatment will be defined and incorporated into a refined target covering both drugs and alcohol by April 2011.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s food, health and education policies all contribute to successful delivery of our national outcomes that we live longer, healthier lives and improve the life chances for children, young people and families at risk. These are Scottish outcomes to address Scottish issues.</p>

  <p>Curriculum for Excellence will play an important part in promoting the health and wellbeing of children and young people. In particular, the food and health experiences and outcomes provide learners with a variety of opportunities to apply their knowledge and skills to plan and safely prepare dishes for a healthy balanced diet meeting their needs and those of others.</p>

  <p>We are also ensuring the new national courses involving catering, being developed under Curriculum for Excellence at SCQF levels 4 and 5, draw on the experiences and outcomes. This will ensure the key requirements of health and wellbeing, for example lifestyle, food and nutrition, are included in the new courses.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, all existing national courses that involve aspects of catering, such as college delivered SVQs, skills for work, HNCs and HNDs, already include elements of nutrition and healthy eating. This is either through specific units studied as an integral part of the course or by embedded clearly identifiable nutrition and healthy eating themes.</p>
