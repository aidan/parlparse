  <p>Financial support for farmers wishing to convert is already available through the Organic Aid Scheme. The Scheme provides payments for 5 years on a sliding scale. I expect to make regulations to set increased payments this Autumn.</p>

  <p>In addition we provide funding for an organic helpline operated by the Scottish Agricultural College.</p>

  <p>Financial support is already available through the Organic Aid Scheme (OAS) to encourage farmers to convert to organic farming methods. It is my hope that increased payment rates, which should be available by October subject to approval of this Chamber, will further stimulate organic production.</p>

  <p>In addition, priority has been given to organic projects under the Marketing Development and Marketing and Processing Grants Schemes administered by the Rural Affairs Department.</p>

  <p>In 1997 The Scottish Office commissioned consultants Deloitte &amp; Touche to examine future options for the provision of ferry services between Gourock and Dunoon. The report was received by the Government at the end of last year. One of the options was identified late in the research and the Government commissioned additional work to explore this more fully. This further material has now been received and I plan to make the reports publicly available soon.</p>

  <p>A study on the impact of changes in ferry fares was commissioned in 1998 by The Scottish Office and presented to the November 1998 meeting of the Convention of the Highlands and Islands. It was agreed that the Highlands and Islands Integrated Transport Forum be invited to consider the report in greater detail, including consideration of options for further study, and to report back to the Convention. The Forum&rsquo;s views are awaited.</p>

  <p>Revenue deficit grant, amounting to &pound;14.8 million for 1999-2000, is made available by the Government to enable Caledonian MacBrayne to keep fares as low as possible.</p>

  <p>There are no plans to build a Maybole bypass. However, &pound;2m has been spent on implementing village gateways, traffic calming and management measures in settlements along the A77. At Maybole work to install the village gateway scheme should be completed in September.</p>

  <p>Under the Water Industry Act 1999, it is for the Scottish Executive to appoint the Commissioner. The Executive will make the appointment in full accordance with the principles in the Code of Practice for Public Appointments. This means the Commissioner will be appointed on the basis of merit following an open recruitment exercise. An independent assessor will be closely involved in the exercise to ensure that all candidates are treated equally and their suitability for the post judged against the same criteria.</p>

  <p>No other bodies will be involved in the exercise. The Parliament's role will be to hold the Executive to account for the appointment. Subsequently, the Parliament will be able to hold the Commissioner to account for the manner in which he or she discharges the functions of the post, including the general function to promote the interests of water customers.</p>

  <p>Under the Water Industry Act 1999 the Water Industry Commissioner will appoint members to the three Water Industry Consultative Committees. The Scottish Executive expects the Commissioner to take up his or her appointment on 1 November, and to appoint Committee members as soon as possible after that date.</p>

  <p>The Commissioner in making these appointments will take into account guidance from the Executive, which will cover the detailed role of the Consultative Committees, and the principles to be observed in recruiting members of the Committees. The guidance will be published.<br /></p>
