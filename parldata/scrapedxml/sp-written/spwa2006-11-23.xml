  <p>The Standing Orders of the Scottish Parliament require all bills on introduction to be accompanied by a Financial Memorandum which sets out the best estimates of the administrative, compliance and other costs to which the provisions of the bill would give rise, best estimates of the timescales over which such costs would be expected to arise, and an indication of the margins of uncertainty in such estimates. The Financial Memorandum must distinguish separately such costs as would fall upon (a) the Scottish administration, (b) local authorities and (c) other bodies, individuals and businesses. These memoranda are freely available on the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s website.</p>

  <p>By way of comparable information on actual initial set up and annual costs after the Debt Arrangement and Attachment (Scotland) Act 2002 came into force, the annual cost for the year 2005-06 in the same categories as the Financial Memoranda is as follows:</p>

  <p>No. Secondary school class size data is not routinely collected. A special collection of S1 to S2 maths and English classes will be made as part of the 2007 school census to establish whether our target of reducing those classes to a maximum of 20 by August 2007 has been achieved.</p>

  <p>On 6 April 2006, the Minister for Justice announced that Scotland would participate in Firelink, the GB-wide procurement of a replacement radio system for the Fire and Rescue Service. In Scotland, the implementation timetable is split into Phase A (network resilience/infrastructure) and Phase B (installation of radio terminals etc). The headline dates for commencement and completion of Phase A are 4 January 2007 and 10 April 2008, and for Phase B they are 23 October 2007 and 17 February 2009.</p>

  <p>The Firelink supplier is O2 Airwave Ltd, which is also providing the Airwave radio system for all British police forces and ambulance services. Once all the new systems are in place, there will be inter-operability between all three blue-light services and with other emergency responders using Airwave.</p>

  <p>The total contracted cost for Firelink, the new radio system for the British Fire and Rescue Service announced by the Minister for Justice on 6 April 2006, is around &pound;400 million at today&rsquo;s prices. It is prudently estimated that the projected cost to Scotland over the initial ten-year life of the contract will be in the region of &pound;100 million, (inclusive of VAT, which is likely to be recoverable on most elements of the project).</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-28960 by Tavish Scott on 9 November 2006, whether the statement that &quot;any contract imposes obligations on the contractor and in the case of a &quot;public service contract&quot; these are public service obligations&quot; means that any and all obligations imposed by any public service contract may be regarded as public service obligations.</p>

  <p>As noted in the response to the answer to question S2W-28960 on 9 November 2006, the range of factors that can be specified in &quot;public service obligations&quot; is limited to those set out in Article 4.2 of the Maritime Cabotage Regulation. The obligations set out in a &quot;public service contract&quot; will generally include those factors set out in Article 4.2 and additional factors related to the delivery of the public service &ndash; such as quality &ndash; which are permissible only if a public service contract approach is used.</p>

  <p>Following Lord Sewel&rsquo;s commitment in 1997 that planning controls should be extended to marine fish farming, the Executive published the consultation paper <em>The Extension of Planning Controls to Marine Fish Farming</em> in 2000.</p>

  <p>In light of the provisions in the Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) Act 2003, a further consultation paper, <em>Extending Planning Controls to Marine Fish Farming</em>, was published in 2004. This was followed in October 2005 with a consultation paper entitled <em>Defining Marine Boundaries for Fish Farming, </em>which identified boundaries within which particular planning authorities would have responsibility for marine fish farming.</p>

  <p>Work has been on-going since then, including discussions with key stakeholders, to ensure a robust and workable planning system. Final primary provisions to bring existing fish farms into the planning system were included at Stage 3 of the Planning etc. (Scotland) Bill.</p>

  <p>The latest figures from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency show that in 2005-06 Scotland recycled or composted 24.4% of municipal waste, which means that we are well on track to meeting our target of recycling and composting 25% of municipal waste by 2006. Our next target is to recycle or compost 30% of municipal waste by 2008. In the longer term, we intend to go beyond 30%.</p>

  <p>We have a number of steps in place or proposed to improve our recycling and composting performance. These steps include:</p>

  <p>We have announced recently resources for improving recycling facilities for people living in tenements and flats.</p>

  <p>We intend to run trials on the collection of food waste from householders. Food waste makes up around 17% of the householder&rsquo;s bin.</p>

  <p>We have introduced simplified procedures for local authorities to bid to the Strategic Waste Fund (SWF) to support work by community recycling bodies, so long as this work does not cost the SWF more than &pound;150 per tonne of waste diverted from landfill.</p>

  <p>Some kerbside collection schemes run by local authorities are still being rolled out, after authorities secured funding from the SWF.</p>

  <p>We will work with local authorities, and other bodies such as REMADE Scotland, the Scottish Waste Awareness Group (SWAG) and the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), to ensure that best practice on recycling is shared amongst local authorities across Scotland.</p>

  <p>We intend to discuss with local authorities, and others, what improvements could be made to recycling centres to encourage recycling and re-use.</p>

  <p>We intend to discuss with local authorities, and others, what further improvements could be made to kerbside collections, by extending them to new areas or by adding further materials to the collections.</p>

  <p>We will continue to support work by SWAG on the co-ordination of the local Waste Aware Scotland campaigns, to ensure that householders know how to use their recycling facilities.</p>

  <p>We will continue to support work by WRAP and REMADE Scotland on the development of markets for recycled products.</p>

  <p>We will continue to support work by WRAP on the development of infrastructure to treat recycled or composted waste.</p>

  <p>We will continue to support work by WRAP and SWAG to provide home composting bins across Scotland, to reduce the amount of waste put out for collection.</p>

  <p>Clearly, before spending any resources we will wish to be satisfied that value for money is being obtained.</p>

  <p>The Executive is addressing road safety through a combination of engineering, enforcement and education.</p>

  <p>This includes close liaison with Transport Scotland, who are responsible for trunk roads, and local authorities who are responsible for road safety matters in their areas. In addition, the Executive through Road Safety Scotland actively engages with the police forces and a wide range of other parties to promote the road safety message throughout Scotland.</p>

Some local authorities chose to work with Remade Scotland on this. Remade Scotland intends to publish an analysis of their findings on local authority waste audits.
