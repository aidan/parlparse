  <p>The benefits of broadband to businesses are well catalogued. These benefits, which include reduced business costs and improved access to markets, can significantly boost the economy of the areas in which these businesses are located. Broadband also offers more opportunities for the current and future labour force of the area to develop their skills and knowledge. The Scottish Enterprise broadband website contains a list of case studies describing how broadband has benefited a wide range of organisations throughout Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive currently provides &#163;4.2 million annually to local authorities for nine Centres of Excellence in Highland, Aberdeen, Glasgow, Edinburgh, East Ayrshire, Fife, and East Dunbartonshire. These centres offer specialist provision in music, traditional Scottish music, dance, sport or modern languages.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Executive has set up a &#163;5 million trust fund, known as the Dewar Arts Awards, to support exceptionally talented young people across the arts in Scotland who have limited financial resources. The awards aim to foster excellence in the arts and offer talented youngsters from less privileged backgrounds an opportunity to develop their talent to the highest level.</p>

  <p>Under the Lottery Sports Fund, <strong></strong>sportscotland operate a Junior Groups Programme, designed to develop Scotland&#8217;s emerging talent to ensure international success in sport when the current crop of elite athletes have retired.

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s response to <em>Determined to Succeed: A Review of Enterprise in Education</em> (DtS) sets out our strategy for expanding the provision of Enterprise in Education (E in E). It puts local authorities (LAs) at the heart of delivery and, consequently, as the recipients of the majority of the &#163;42 million funding we have committed over the Spending Review 2002 period. The Executive will work with each LA to develop an E in E plan detailing how DtS will be delivered locally, and we have recruited specialist staff - with experience of education and business - to help in this process.</p>

  <p>The timing of LA E in E plans is the subject of a series of discussions my officials are undertaking with LA Directors of Education; they will have met all directors in the next few weeks. Additionally, against the background of our wish to encourage creativity in delivery, we have set aside a limited fund to support LAs wishing to develop innovative projects. LAs will also have access to a dedicated website outlining the products and services currently available to support enterprising and entrepreneurial activities. Our strategy does not envisage pilot projects, save for those LAs wish to propose for funding under the innovation fund.</p>

  <p>Within Scotland, we have a wide variety of publicly funded initiatives designed to help companies increase their investment in research and development. Each of these initiatives acts together, our intention is to provide a coherent pipeline of public sector support at every stage along the path from taking ideas from the university laboratory to full-scale production.</p>

  <p>By way of illustration, we have committed more than &#163;80 million of additional funding since 1999 through a variety of initiatives to support commercialisation of research with several specific and unique measures such as the Proof of Concept Fund and Scottish Higher Education Funding Council&#8217;s (SHEFC) Knowledge Transfer Grants to universities to promote commercialisation. There are plans to at least double this to &#163;12 million following additional resources provided by the Executive to SHEFC in SR2002. Various improvements have been made to the SMART and SPUR research and development support schemes launched on 1 April, including increased grant levels and reduced bureaucracy. The number of SMART and SPUR awards continues to increase year on year. We have made changes to our Regional Selective Assistance grant scheme to focus efforts across all sectors on higher value areas such as research and development. Business Gateway was launched on 14 July 2003, this will bring improved consistency and quality of support for all businesses across the Scottish Enterprise area. The &#163;450 million investment in Intermediary Technology Institutes over 10 years will make a further significant impact in this field.</p>

  <p>Companies in Greenock and Inverclyde have access to and are encouraged to make the most of this support.</p>

  <p>Section 63 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001 amended the Medicines Act 1968 and enables ministers to introduce new types of prescriber. To enable new types of prescriber to prescribe prescription only medicines would require amendment of the Prescription Only Medicines (Human Use) Order 1997. Both the act and the order apply across the UK.</p>

  <p>Extending responsibilities to new groups of health care professionals is a matter which is under active consideration by the UK Health Departments.</p>

  <p><em>Improving Health in Scotland &#8211; The Challenge</em> , published in May 2003, does not set targets for the reduction of specific risk factors such as atrial fibrillation, cholesterol levels or high blood pressure, but provides a strategic framework for action to promote a healthier lifestyle and behaviours that will reduce the risk of conditions such as stroke. <em>The</em> <em>Challenge</em> re-iterates the target, first set out in <em>Towards a Healthier Scotland</em> (1999), for reducing by 50%, between 1995 and 2010, deaths from cerebrovascular disease in people under 75.</p>

  <p>The stroke Managed Clinical Networks which are being developed in each NHS board area as a key part of our Coronary Heart Disease and Stroke Strategy have as one of their main aims the development of stroke prevention strategies.</p>

  <p>No separate funding is provided to NHS boards to pay for the treatment of patients who were residents of another NHS board area. Financial transfers normally take place between NHS boards to reflect the cost of such treatment. Information is not held centrally about the amounts transferred in this way.</p>

  <p>As with any proposals for significant service change or closure approved by NHS boards, I would only make a decision on whether to endorse the preferred option or not following careful consideration of the relevant local review.</p>

  <p>In the case of maternity service proposals, I would have to be satisfied that the preferred option is consistent with <em>A Framework for Maternity Services in Scotland</em> (February 2001) and the recommendations of the <em>Expert Group on Acute Maternity Services </em>(December 2002). These policy documents set out clear action points and recommendations intended to ensure that NHS Scotland provides modern, safe and sustainable maternity services that are appropriate to the needs of women and families in Scotland.</p>

  <p>That said, I hope to make a decision on this within the next few weeks.</p>

  <p>There are no specific guidelines; this is a matter of good clinical care. However, in May 2002, a &quot;best practice statement on nutrition &#8211; assessment and referral in the care of adults in hospital&quot; was issued by the Nursing and Midwifery Practice Development Unit. The best practice statement covers the following areas which includes reasons for the statement and how to demonstrate these are being achieved.</p>

  <p>Admission to hospital</p>

  <p>Nursing management of nutritional care</p>

  <p>Nutritional screening and documentation</p>

  <p>Criteria for nutritional referrals</p>

  <p>Education and Training</p>

  <p>NHS Quality Improvement Scotland has consulted on a Standard for Food Fluid and Nutritional Care in hospitals to help ensure that patients needs are met.</p>

  <p>Specific guidance on items of food and drink would be a matter primarily for local NHS systems who will consider the needs of people with special dietary requirements taking account of the individual needs of each patient.</p>

  <p>Information on NHS waiting lists is compiled and recorded on different bases in England and Wales and in Scotland, and the two sets of information are therefore not comparable.</p>

  <p>Waiting list figures for Scotland are published on a quarterly basis on the Information and Statistics Division website, at:</p>

  <p>http://www.isdscotland.org/isd/info2.jsp?pContentID=1170&amp;p_applic=CCC&amp;p_service=Content.show&amp;</p>

  <p>Waiting list figures for England are published on a monthly basis on the Department of Health website, at:</p>

  <p>http://www.doh.gov.uk/waitingtimes/index.htm</p>

  <p>Waiting lists are not an effective indicator of NHS performance. What matters to patients is how long they have to wait for treatment, not how many people are ahead of them. That is why we have set challenging national maximum waiting times targets in the clinical priorities of cancer and heart disease, as well as for all out-patient consultations and in-patient and day case treatment. By the end of this year no patient should wait longer than nine months for in-patient/day case treatment, falling to six months by the end of 2005. The NHS is making good progress towards achieving the nine month target.</p>

  <p>We are determined to address rising out-patient waiting times which are a stubborn problem for a number of reasons, including implementation of the New Deal for Junior Doctors and the European Working Time Directive. The Executive has included a commitment in the White Paper, <em>Partnership for Care</em> , and the Partnership Agreement, <em>Partnership for a Better Scotland</em> , that no patient will wait longer than 26 weeks for a first out-patient appointment following GP referral, by 2005.</p>

  <p>The National Waiting Times Unit is currently discussing and agreeing plans and local out-patient waiting times targets with NHS Greater Glasgow which will demonstrate the progress they are expected to make towards delivery of the 26 weeks target.</p>

  <p>To help NHS Scotland achieve the 26 weeks target, I launched the Out-patient Action plan on 13 June 2003. The Centre for Change and Innovation will drive forward the implementation of this plan through a co-ordinated programme of service redesign and the promotion and dissemination of good practice across NHS Scotland.</p>

  <p>Our strategy for ensuring that sustained reductions in waiting times are delivered for patients across Scotland was set out in <em>Partnership for Care - Scotland's Health</em> <em>White Paper</em> , which was published on 27 February 2003. We have made clear in our Partnership Agreement that reducing NHS waiting times is our key priority for the health service for the next four years.</p>

  <p>Challenging national maximum waiting times targets have been set for out-patient consultations and for hospital in-patient and day case treatment. In addition, specific maximum waiting targets have been set for the diagnosis and treatment of heart disease and cancer, and for access to a member of a primary health care team. The targets in relation to waiting for in-patient and day case treatment have been guaranteed to patients: if boards are unable to provide treatment within the maximum waiting times themselves, they will be obliged to arrange treatment elsewhere &#8211; either within NHS Scotland or with other providers. Each NHS board has agreed local targets with the National Waiting Times Unit which demonstrate the progress they are expected to make towards delivery of the national targets and guarantees in 2003-04.</p>

  <p>Increased support is being provided to NHS boards and trusts to reduce waiting times, by my department, and in particular the National Waiting Times Unit and the Centre for Change and Innovation, by for example:</p>

  <p>- introducing a new, national programme of service improvement and redesign;</p>

  <p>- leading work on capacity planning;</p>

  <p>- ensuring the Golden Jubilee National Hospital supports NHS boards by contributing appropriately to reducing waiting times for out-patient, diagnostic, day case and in-patient services;</p>

  <p>- booking spare capacity in the private sector to reduce the longest waiting times, where such action complements NHS boards&#8217; strategies for developing sustainable local solutions to tackle long waits, and</p>

  <p>- sharing examples of good practice across NHS Scotland.</p>

  <p>As outlined in the Global Connections Strategy, the Executive recognises the need to provide opportunity for all parts of Scotland. Scottish Development International is therefore charged with creating sustainable employment across a wide range of areas in sectors such as business and customer services at the same time as pursuing more specialist jobs in &quot;knowledge intensive&quot; functions such as research, design and development.</p>

  <p>Scottish Development International provides client companies with a range of location options that meet their needs. However, the location at which an investment is made is ultimately a decision to be made by the company concerned and attempts to persuade companies to locate in specific areas could prove counter-productive.</p>
