  <p>All patient identifiable electronic information exchanged between GPs and hospitals under the Electronic Clinical Communications Implementation programme must be transmitted on a private health service telecommunications network such as NHSnet which is dedicated to NHS purposes. Some health board areas have their own private secure networks which are able to link to NHSnet to allow messages to be transmitted on a UK basis. All networks (whether single GP Practices, hospital networks or health board level private networks) connecting to NHSnet must conform to the NHSnet Code of Connection which maintains the security and integrity of NHSnet.</p>

  <p>All NHS in Scotland computer-based systems are developed and operated under a published Security Policy and Security Standards.</p>

Comprehensive security measures are in place to protect against unauthorised alteration; update procedures are in place which forbid any updating of websites by a third party.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>While there is good evidence that sterilising tablets can help prevent the transmission of HIV, the picture is less clear in relation to hepatitis C; the provision of appropriate health education is therefore increasingly important in preventing the transmission of this virus.</p>

  <p>The Executive, through Scottish Enterprise Energy Group based in Aberdeen, is actively encouraging companies in Scotland to consider diversification into the manufacturing opportunities which are beginning to arise from renewable energy development. Our promotion of these developments will be further strengthened by our Renewables Obligation (Scotland); one of its aims is to assist the renewables industry to become competitive and thus to provide employment. A copy of our consultation paper on the Renewables Obligation (Scotland) has been placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>Various energy from waste technologies, including incineration of waste, have until now been classified as a form of renewable energy generation, and were included for support under the previous Scottish Renewables Obligation arrangements. Our consultation paper on a new mechanism to promote renewable energy in Scotland, the Renewables Obligation (Scotland), was issued on 30 November. One of issues on which we are seeking views is the question of qualifying renewable technologies, and in particular on the issue of energy from waste. A copy of the consultation paper is available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency of course licenses all waste incineration processes for pollution control purposes and these processes are subject to strict regulation.</p>
