  <p>At the end of 1999, the Oil and Gas Industry Task Force (now renamed Pilot) set up a Fabricators Support Group. This brought together the oil industry, Government, the fabricators themselves and other interested parties to develop an integrated approach to the ongoing difficulties facing the sector. The Scottish Executive and the Department of Trade and Industry are members of this group.</p>

  <p>We are continuing to work closely with the Fabricators Support Group, the Department of Trade and Industry, Fife Council and the local enterprise company on the implications of the recent announcement about the Kvaerner yard in Methil and to develop a long-term strategy for the future of this yard. The support group plans to put in place mechanisms to assist individuals to acquire new skills and employment opportunities.</p>

  <p>Scotland, and the UK, is free of <i>Gyrodactylus Salaris</i> (GS), and always has been, as a result of our strict health requirements, the work of the Fish Health Inspectorate and the natural barrier formed by the sea.</p>

  <p>We have agreed safeguard measures with the European Commission, prohibiting the importation of all live salmonids except from areas also recognised as free from GS.</p>

  <p>Although our scientific assessment is that the chances of the parasite being introduced are low, we are working with the wild fish and fish farming industries on additional measures to prevent the parasite entering the country and on action which could be taken if it did, and aim to issue a contingency plan later this year.</p>

  <p>*Patients whose health board of residence changed over the five-year period are counted separately under each health board but are counted only once in the Scotland total.</p>

  <p>Information about face-to-face consultations between GPs and patients is gathered centrally as part of the Continuous Morbidity Recording in General Practice (CMR) system. CMR data are obtained from a sample of Scottish General Practices whose population is broadly nationally representative. From this, national estimates of the number of patients seen by GPs can be calculated. Information is available centrally for the four-year period between January 1997 and December 2000. It is estimated that approximately 680 patients were seen by General Practitioners in Scotland during this period, in respect of systemic sclerosis. Information is not available by health board of residence.</p>

  <p>There is an unquantifiable element of double counting between these two sources, as many patients treated in NHS hospitals for systemic sclerosis will also be treated in General Practice.</p>

  <p>The purpose of Housing Revenue Account (HRA) capital receipts set-aside is to reduce the burden of debt being carried by local authorities and their rent payers. If set-aside were abolished, local authorities would be able to spend all their receipts on new housing investment. As a consequence housing debt would be increased and rents would rise to service the increased debt. It would be open to the United Kingdom Government to take into account any such increase in self-financed local authority expenditure in considering the level of grant to the Scottish Administration.</p>

  <p>Groups which have had a specific or substantial connection to purposes connected with the Act and its implementation include the following:</p>

  <p><u>Housing Interests Group</u></p>

  <p>The Housing Interests Group first met in June 1999. Its purpose was to discuss the Executive&#8217;s housing agenda, including the proposals in the Housing Green Paper and strategic issues for inclusion in the Housing (Scotland) Bill.</p>

  <p>The group is chaired by myself as Minister for Social Justice, and has included the following members in addition to officials from the Executive (other representatives of these organisations may also attend from time to time).</p>

  <p><u>Working Group on Single Social Tenancy; Short Life Right to Buy Working Group, and Working Group on Implementation of Part 2 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001</u></p>

  <p>A steering group was set up between February 2000 and May 2001 to oversee the production of a model tenancy agreement for the new Scottish secure tenancy envisaged by the Housing (Scotland) Bill.</p>

  <p>A short-life Right to Buy Working Group met between July and December 2000 to consider the implications and details of the various proposals contained in the Housing (Scotland) Bill which related to the right to buy.</p>

  <p>A Housing Bill Implementation Working Group was set up in June 2001 to oversee the implementation of the provisions of Part 2 of the Housing (Scotland) Act.</p>

  <p>All three groups are chaired and supported by Scottish Executive officials. The membership of each group is shown in the following tables. Where an organisation is listed, members serve or served in their capacity as representatives of that organisation and other representatives of these organisations may also attend from time to time.</p>

  <p><u>Single Housing Plans Group</u></p>

  <p>The Single Housing Plans Group (SHPG) was established in February 2000 with a view to taking forward the Housing Green Paper proposal for a single housing plan for each local authority area. Membership of the group, chaired by Professor Duncan Maclennan, comprised representatives from the Scottish Executive, Scottish Homes, COSLA, local authorities, the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations and the Chartered Institute of Housing. Following the submission of a report and series of recommendations to ministers, a smaller, more informal, working group, consisting of Scottish Homes, local authority, COSLA and Scottish Executive representatives, met in order to produce guidance on the preparation of local housing strategies and to oversee the local housing strategies pilot process. This group will continue to meet throughout 2001 and into 2002.</p>

  <p><u>Scottish Homes Steering Group</u></p>

  <p>To address the issues arising from the provision within the Act for the transfer of Scottish Homes&#8217; functions, staff and property to the Scottish ministers, a steering group was formed. Its members were senior Scottish Executive Development Department and Scottish Homes officials. Three sub-groups were established to look in detail at Finance, Structures and Staff, reporting findings to the steering group. A Transitional Issues Group was also established. This involved the Secretary of the Scottish Executive Development Department and the chief executive of Scottish Homes, and met to consider issues concerning the new executive Agency, for which the present board at Scottish Homes would have no competence to make decisions.</p>

  <p><u>Grants to Housing Associations</u></p>

  <p>The Act will give the Scottish ministers the power to withdraw grants under section 54 of the Housing Act 1988 from housing associations, and the Executive has made a commitment to set up a joint group with the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations to consider the effects of this.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that this figure is based upon the data which are held in the central statistical database and which were collected by the police at the time of the accident and subsequently reported to the Executive. It may differ from any figure which the local authority would provide now, because it does not take account of any subsequent changes or corrections that the local authority may have made to the statistical information, for use at local level, about the location of each accident, based upon its knowledge of the road and area concerned.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has plans to undertake improvements identified for a number of sections on the A85 between Lochearnhead and Lix Toll. These include schemes to improve visibility and road realignment at bends. The new Operating Company, BEAR Scotland Ltd, has been instructed to progress the design of the schemes this year. Implementation of the schemes will be progressed subject to availability of funds and other competing trunk road priorities.</p>

  <p>In addition, a review of verge safety fences has been undertaken on the A85 and two sites at Glen Ogle have been identified for treatment. The work will be subject to competitive tender and is programmed to be completed this financial year.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether, in light of the statement by the UK Minister for the Environment on Newsnight on 3 July 2001 that toxic fly ash from incinerators that is used in construction materials could be a hazard to human health and his subsequent instruction to the Environment Agency to determine where such materials have been used, it will direct the Scottish Environment Protection Agency to do the same.</p>

  <p>Fly ash from incinerators is classified as special waste under the Special Waste Regulations 1996 and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) must be notified prior to all movements of the waste. The transportation and disposal of special waste is carried out under strict conditions and documented in consignment notes. The Executive has no plans to direct SEPA to undertake any separate investigation into how special waste from incinerators is used.</p>

  <p>Bottom ash from incinerators is relatively inert and, therefore, capable of being recycled provided this is carried out in accordance with a Waste Management Licence issued by SEPA. The Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has commissioned a risk assessment covering the implications for health and the environment from using bottom ash from incinerators in road construction, and I await the outcome of that study with interest.</p>

  <p>The Parliament is not able to provide figures on the percentage of its documents that are printed on recycled paper. However, the Parliament uses paper produced in an environmentally friendly way for most of its printing and publishing.</p>

  <p>Paper provided for use in photocopiers, fax machines and printers is a mixture of 100% recycled paper and virgin paper. Printer, fax paper and light use photocopiers use paper made up from 100% de-inked post &#8211; consumer recycled waste. It is of high quality and is easy to recycle. The dust generated from the use of recycled paper could effect the operation of heavy use photocopy machines. As a result heavy use photocopiers are supplied with virgin paper. The virgin paper comes from trees in Scandinavia planted specifically for paper production. For every tree felled, two are planted.</p>

  <p>At least 75% of the paper constituents used for headed paper, compliment slips etc, are made from 100% de-inked post consumer waste.</p>

  <p>Paper used for Parliament publications produced by The Stationery Office, although not made from recycled materials, carries the Nordic Ecolabel for low emissions during production and is 100% recyclable.</p>
