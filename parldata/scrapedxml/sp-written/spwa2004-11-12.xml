  <p>Winds in excess of 39 miles per hour are classified by the Met Office as gale force. Winds of such force are, however, not necessarily critical to the ability of aircraft to take off or land. Other factors such as the type of aircraft and wind direction are also relevant. While for example a gale force cross wind would prevent a fixed-wing aircraft from talking off or landing, helicopters, such as those available under the arrangements with the Air Ambulance Service preferred provider, would not be so affected by such winds. If the weather conditions were of such severity to prevent the contracted air ambulance aircraft from flying, the ambulance service will call upon the services of the Coastguard or the Ministry of Defence.</p>

  <p>The Executive is addressing climate change through its Scottish Climate Change Programme (SCCP). The policies in the SCCP cut across a number of different policy areas and, whilst the main driver of each policy may not necessarily be climate change, all will deliver greenhouse gas emissions reductions. For example, in the transport budget there has been a significant shift in the relevant proportion of departmental spending directed to public transport such that it will make up 70% of transport spending over the period of our ten year investment plan. Given that climate change is but one of the benefits arising from such expenditure programmes, it is not possible to identify a specific climate change component.</p>

  <p>As part of the Spending Review, the Executive looked at the performance of all portfolios in delivering sustainable development, of which climate change is a key element, and their plans for taking it forward in their work over the next three years.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive welcomes Edinburgh&rsquo;s success in being granted the title: City of Literature in the UNESCO Creative Cities Global Alliance. The Edinburgh World City of Literature project aims to work with UNESCO to identify potential partner cities in the developed and developing world. Through a network of world cities of literature, Edinburgh will set out to promote international exchange between writers, readers, literature organisations and publishers. Scotland will benefit from these exchanges in the resulting higher profile for Scottish literature and the potential increase in cultural tourism. In addition, the project aims to provide a focus and co-ordination for literary activity, to encourage greater participation at all levels of Scottish society, and to attract new initiatives to Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has awarded the project &pound;20,000, but, as yet, no decision has been taken on future funding.</p>

  <p>Information on the number of dentists is collected via the annual census, on 30 September, the latest of which is correct at 30 September 2003. On this date, there were 36 dentists employed in community and hospital dental services and 131 general dentists in NHS Fife.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for the overall provision of NHS dental services in an area rests with the NHS board. When an NHS board considers that the existing general dental service provision is insufficient to meet the demands of the local population, and no independent general dental practitioner is available to fill the gap, approval can be sought from Scottish ministers to appoint salaried dentists.</p>

  <p>Currently, workforce planning arrangements are being developed at local, regional and national levels. Individual NHS boards are reviewing and identifying the way in which local health services, such as dentistry, are provided. The staffing implications of these reviews will be factored into these mechanisms.</p>

  <p>The national Curriculum Guidelines 5-14, for English language currently advise that Scottish texts should be actively sought and used in classrooms, the aim being to foster a sense of personal and national identity through pupils' experience and study of Scots writing and Scots songs and through their conscious awareness and use of Scots language. The guidelines for Social Subjects (History), Expressive Arts and Personal and Social Development stress the importance of maintaining a focus on the Scottish context</p>

  <p>There is, however, no statutory curriculum in Scotland and responsibility for the delivery and content of the curriculum rests with individual education authorities and headteachers who must assess the needs of their pupils and design an appropriate curriculum.

  <p>The Housing Improvement Task Force reported in 2003 on policy issues concerning the quality of private sector housing stock in Scotland. That report identified that although the Scottish house buying and selling system has a number of strengths, there were nevertheless a number of ways it could be enhanced, particularly in relation to incentives for property maintenance. The task force recommended that the Scottish Executive pilot a single survey system for buying and selling that would give potential buyers better information on house condition and encourage greater attention to that aspect of ownership. That pilot is in progress. It aims also to test whether the single survey is an appropriate means of addressing the problems of so-called &quot;multiple surveys&quot; that are a feature of some market areas and whether the inclusion of a valuation within the single survey will act to discourage the setting of misleadingly low upset prices that can be frustrating for house buyers.</p>

  <p>The proposed housing bill would include powers for ministers to make the provision by sellers of the single survey and any additionally defined information mandatory, should this be deemed appropriate in the light of the pilot.</p>

  <p>The task force also considered issues around blind bidding and the setting of closing dates, but concluded that action to enforce alternatives to these conventions would be heavy-handed and out of proportion to the problems identified. The Executive accepted these conclusions and has no plans to introduce mandatory alternatives such as open auctions or fixed prices.</p>

  <p>The SSDT is an independent statutory body whose constitution, procedure and powers are set out in schedule 4 to the Solicitors (Scotland) Act 1980. As an independent body, the tribunal is responsible for its own proceedings and Scottish Ministers have no powers to instruct the tribunal.</p>

  <p>The Master Policy protects the interests of consumers by providing professional indemnity insurance for Scottish solicitors against claims of negligence and claims arising out of any alleged dishonest, fraudulent, criminal or malicious act or omission.</p>

  <p>Some aspects of the master policy are under review at present. In the report of its inquiry into regulation of the legal profession, the former Justice 1 Committee expressed concern about delays reported by some complainers in receiving a settlement from the master policy. The committee recommended that the Scottish Executive should examine ways in which the master policy could be made subject to external regulation. We will issue a public consultation paper at the end of the year on the follow up to the committee&rsquo;s report. The master policy is also currently the subject of a competition investigation by the Office of Fair Trading.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally by Scottish Court Service. The list of safeguarders maintained by Sheriff Clerks derives from the panel of safeguarders maintained by local authorities under the Children (Scotland) Act 1995.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Law Commission Report on <em>Title to Sue for Non-Patrimonial Loss (SLC</em> <em>187</em> ) was published on 8 August 2002. It made a number of recommendations for changes to the categories of persons who are able to sue for non-patrimonial loss.</p>

  <p>Recommendation 10 of the Report was that the <em>Damages (Scotland) Act 1976 </em>should be amended to provide that:</p>

  <p>&quot;(a) any person who, immediately before the deceased's death, was the same-sex cohabitant of the deceased should be entitled to sue for patrimonial and non-patrimonial loss; and</p>

  <p>(b) "same-sex cohabitant" (for the purposes of title to sue for non-patrimonial and patrimonial loss) should mean any person who was living with the deceased in a relationship which had the characteristics, other than that the persons are of the opposite sex, of the relationship between husband and wife.&quot;</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has agreed that this recommendation should be implemented and that is being done through provisions contained in Schedule 28, Part 4 of the <em>Civil Partnership Bill</em> which is presently before the United Kingdom Parliament.</p>

  <p>The other recommendations for change contained in the report are still under consideration, and no decisions have yet been taken as to their implementation.</p>

  <p>The provisions for continuing support for less favoured areas (LFA) for the period 2007-13 are included in the new Rural Development Regulation. Discussions on a draft of this Regulation have started in Brussels and we are closely involved with these.

  <p>Since July 2003, podiatry is a protected title. This means that all podiatrists must have undergone the minimum of a three-year undergraduate degree programme or an honours degree. Successful completion of the education programmes leads to registration by the Health Professions Council (HPC). The HPC is an independent, UK wide regulatory body responsible for setting and maintaining standards of professional training, performance and conduct of the professions it regulates. Registration is also a condition of employment. It is an offence to practice as a podiatrist while unregistered and anyone who does is subject to prosecution. The education programmes are quality assured by the Quality Assurance Agency to make sure that graduates are fit to practice.</p>

  <p>Non-registered professionals who have used the now protected title prior to July 2003 must undergo a &quot;grandparenting&quot; process. This means that they must have been engaged in the lawful, safe and effective practice in the profession they wish to be registered in for a period of three out of the last five years. If they fall short of this they must demonstrate that they have undergone additional training and experience that satisfies the HPC that they have the requisite standard of proficiency for admission to the register.</p>

  <p>The Invitation to Tender for Enhanced Addictions Casework Service is currently out to tender. The contract will commence in July 2005. The aims of an Enhanced Addiction Casework Service are to:</p>

  <p>Encourage current and former substance misusing prisoners to access addictions treatment in prison;</p>

  <p>Provide addictions assessment relevant to the needs of the population and the substance of misuse;</p>

  <p>Include prisoners in devising and agreeing their individualised care plan;</p>

  <p>Give prisoners access to a relevant range of interventions (treatment and care activities) dependent on their sentence length;</p>

  <p>Emphasis the importance of consistency and continuity of care, both in and out of prison setting including the transitional care period, and</p>

  <p>To minimise the dangers of reduced tolerance levels on release from prison.</p>

  <p>An intervention monitoring system is in the process of being developed. This will enable reporting of key performance outcomes on a monthly basis. This will be monitored locally by addictions co-ordinators at establishment level and nationally by a contracts manager based within the Rehabilitation &amp; Care Directorate at SPS HQ. The views of service users will also be evidenced through qualitative audit systems.</p>
