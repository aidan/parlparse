  <p>: Section 64(1)(e)(i) requires designated religious charities to have an organisation in which internal authorities exercise supervisory and disciplinary functions in respect of the charity. It is for the organisation itself to determine how it wishes to structure itself to meet this requirement and for OSCR to determine whether the supervisory and disciplinary structures are sufficient to allow registration as a designated religious charity. There is no preset definition of &quot;authorities&quot; in this context.</p>

  <p>: <em>Building a Better Scotland: Efficient Government &ndash; Securing Efficiency, Effectiveness and Productivity</em> has a table on page 4 similar to table 4.1 of the Gershon report insofar as cash-releasing savings are concerned.

Table 4.2 outlines a substance list of job cuts and here in Scotland we do not believe that this is the correct way to approach this issue. We will not be producing a similar table. It does not have a table similar to table 4.2 of the Gershon report. The Scottish Executive has not set a target for job reductions in the civil service or wider Scottish public sector and does not propose to publish a table similar to that of table 4.2 in Sir Peter Gershon&rsquo;s report.</p>

  <p>We have currently identified &pound;650 million of recurring annual cash-releasing saving from within the DEL in 2007-08, which is 2.53% of the Scottish Executive DEL for 2007-08.

  <p>: Estimates for the number of economically inactive people are taken from the Labour Force Survey. As the Labour Force Survey is based on a sample of the population all estimates are subject to sampling error. Due to this sampling error it is not appropriate to present the estimates as exact figures and the estimates are therefore rounded. The level to which the data are rounded (i.e. thousands) is decided by the Office for National Statistics, who conduct the Labour Force Survey.</p>

  <p>: The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) introduced a national system of postal citation and countermand for civilian witnesses in summary trials in the District Court and the Sheriff Court in September 2003.</p>

  <p>In the 12 months to August 2004, COPFS issued 54,968 successful postal citations and 51,136 postal countermands. Each successful postal citation avoids the police tracing the witness to serve a citation in person.</p>

  <p>COPFS is planning to extend the use of postal citations for civilian witnesses in solemn cases in the Sheriff Court in 2005 and for civilian witnesses in the High Court in 2006.</p>

  <p>These figures are calculated for each sentence length group as follows: (average daily population*365)/(number of receptions).

  <p>: Representations have been received from COSLA, local authorities and a range of other external stakeholders about funding for Supporting People. The Scottish Executive is committed to ensuring a fairer distribution of resources across Scotland and to ensuring that efficiency improvements are achieved with this funding, but I have listened carefully to the concerns raised by COSLA, local authorities, providers and other stakeholders about the pace of redistribution originally proposed.</p>

  <p>I am therefore making an additional &pound;3.4 million available to increase transitional support to &pound;20 million and slowing down the rate of redistribution so that change is manageable locally. I am also allowing councils to carry forward resources from the current year into 2005-06 to further ease transitional pressures.</p>

  <p>The revised allocations to local authorities for 2005-06 to 2007-08 which I am announcing today soften the impact of the redistribution process very considerably. This will help protect crucial Supporting People-funded services that vulnerable people rely on to live independently in their communities. I can assure third party providers and representatives of the different clients helped by Supporting People we will be issuing guidance to local authorities and tracking the impact of these budget changes very carefully, both to ensure that the expected efficiency gains are delivered, but also that any funding changes don&rsquo;t disproportionately affect any one type of provider. We look forward to discussing this guidance with COSLA and a range of other stakeholders shortly.</p>

  <p>Table of revised allocations for Supporting People from 2005-06 to 2007-08:</p>

  <p>Graduate recruitment to initial teacher education is very strong. For example, in 2004 universities recruited over 80% more students to PGCE maths courses and over 50% more to PGCE English courses than in 2003.</p>

  <p>In addition, we will launch a teacher recruitment campaign early in the New Year. We will highlight the very favourable salaries, conditions of employment, induction arrangements, and career development and progression opportunities that teachers in Scotland now enjoy.</p>

  <p>: The beauty of our countryside is a major attraction for all of our visitors to Scotland, but particularly those who come for a walking holiday. That part of the market alone is worth around &pound;400 million a year. Under the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003, the establishment of Core Paths will make large parts of the Scottish countryside more accessible, and enhance the attractiveness of our landscape to our visitors.</p>
