  <p>Section 64 of the Adult Support and Protection (Scotland) Act 2007 amends the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 (the 1968 act) to make explicit that where a local authority has, following an assessment of an adult&rsquo;s needs, concluded that the adult requires any community care service, but is not capable of making decisions about the service, it may take any steps which it considers necessary to help the adult benefit from the service.</p>

  <p>A local authority has a duty under the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000 to apply for a court order where that is necessary for the protection of the property, financial affairs or personal welfare of the adult.</p>

  <p>Guidance to support local authorities in the use of their powers was issued on 30 March 2007 and is available at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Justice/Civil/awi/latest-news/ccd5-2007" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Justice/Civil/awi/latest-news/ccd5-2007</a>. The Scottish Government has no plans to review section 64 itself, but will monitor local authorities&rsquo; use of their powers and duties under the 1968 and 2000 acts.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises the invaluable contribution that unpaid carers make to Scottish society and the importance of training in helping carers to cope with their caring role. That is why we have said we will initially focus our efforts on carer training, as well as carer centre support, respite and support for young carers.</p>

  <p>As a signal of our intent, we have announced the allocation of &pound;200,000, spread over this year and next, to expand piloting of carer training. We are working in partnership with the National Carer Organisations in taking this forward.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Princess Royal Trust for Carers is currently being funded by the Scottish Government to develop standard training materials for unpaid carers to help them to cope better with their caring role.</p>

  <p>At a local level, NHS Carer Information Strategies will also improve carer training. In line with the minimum requirements of these strategies, NHS boards must demonstrate the person-centred delivery of training for carers, covering advice on physical and emotional wellbeing. This should include demonstrations on moving and handling techniques, where appropriate.</p>

  <p>These strategies are now in place in every health board. They will be monitored annually to ensure that local support for carers, including the provision of carer training, continues to improve.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is still considering the future of the policy on location of public sector jobs and we have not yet determined how we will handle the location reviews begun but not completed by the previous administration.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally. The Scottish Government holds details of the decisions taken by the previous administration under its relocation policy on how many posts were considered for relocation in each location review. Due to changes in organisational structures, the number of posts that have subsequently been located in different localities do not correspond exactly with the number of posts reviewed.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive when it will make a decision about the future of the following community justice pilot schemes: community reparation orders, bail with electronic monitoring, first instance supervised attendance orders and structured deferred sentences.</p>

  <p>The evaluation of the Community Reparation Order (CRO) pilots indicates that the penalties were not well understood or used, and we have therefore decided that the funding for the CRO pilots should stop at the end of December. The government remains committed to the principle of reparation, and as part of the review of community penalties we are currently considering the way in which reparative sentencing options as a whole are structured, with a view to proposing a more straightforward structure that will be simpler to understand and more attractive to sentencers.</p>

  <p>Independent evaluation of the electronic monitoring of bail pilots showed that this particular model of oversight while on bail was little used and of limited effectiveness. We have therefore also agreed that funding of the electronic monitoring of bail pilots should stop at the end of December. We believe that work currently under way to strengthen bail supervision will give a more effective and more widely used set of options for the courts.</p>

  <p>In order to allow the respective evaluations to be finalised, we have decided that funding for the Structured Deferred Sentences pilots should continue until the end of March 2008 and funding for first instance Supervised Attendance Orders should continue for a further 12 months, until the end of October 2008.</p>

  <p>Scottish Executive funding to tackle antisocial behaviour is supporting community wardens in every local authority area in Scotland. It is for each local authority to decide how best to allocate funding across all their antisocial behaviour services, including community wardens, based on local needs and priorities. Future funding for antisocial behaviour services will be considered as part of the forthcoming spending review.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the well-established legal principles are for setting down Scotland&rsquo;s maritime boundaries and share of the continental shelf, as referred to in section 3.5 of <em>Choosing Scotland&rsquo;s Future: a National Conversation</em> .</p>

  <p>The legal principles are set out in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). This governs the maritime boundaries between nation states that have a coastline, including the continental shelf. Under the Convention coastal states exercise sovereignty over their territorial sea which they have the right to establish up to a limit not exceeding 12 nautical miles from their coastal baseline. Coastal states also have sovereign rights to explore and exploit the continental shelf, which extends beyond their territorial sea. Article 76 of the Convention sets out the definition of the area of continental shelf that can be claimed and Article 83 sets out the manner in which states can agree the boundary between their respective areas.</p>

  <p>There is regular dialogue between officials in the Scottish Government and a variety of UK government departments in relation to marine issues. In relation to the UK Marine Bill, it is the Marine Directorate who lead on engaging with Whitehall, and as indicated in my answer to question S3W-3981 on 18 September 2007 there is regular discussion of the legislative proposals in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs&rsquo; Steering Group, which officials from the UK Department of Transport also attend. I am also actively engaged in dialogue with UK Ministers about the UK Marine Bill and the potential for further devolution of powers. I raised this for the first time when I met with ministers from the UK Government and the other devolved administrations in June.All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website the search facility for which can be found at <a href="../../../webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a> .</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will seek to promote the richness and diversity of the languages spoken in Scotland in their different forms. Good progress is being made in a number of areas of language activity and promotion within Scotland and we intend to build on and strengthen this. The submissions to the previous administration&rsquo;s consultation on a strategy for Scotland&rsquo;s languages have been useful and helpful but Scottish ministers have no current plans to respond to these nor to develop or consult on a single strategy for all the languages spoken in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Decontamination of brownfield sites is supported by our strategic objectives for a greener, wealthier and fairer Scotland and especially our commitment to work with local authorities to achieve more sustainable places where people can enjoy quality living. &pound;18.2 million has been made available in 2007-08 to assist local authorities to carry out their responsibilities for dealing with contaminated land, some of which comprises brownfield sites earmarked for redevelopment.

  <p>We will work with partners to tackle the issues around the digital divide and ensure all citizens benefit from the opportunities technology can bring, including rural areas.</p>

  <p>For example, we are looking at ways of extending broadband availability to the less than 1% of households experiencing difficulties with broadband access. For those without access to a computer at home, the Library Service&rsquo;s People&rsquo;s Network and Learndirect Scotland learning centres provide access to computers and learning support across all areas of Scotland, and both offer outreach services to rural communities.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what information it has on the condition of machair grassland habitats designated under domestic and European nature conservation law, particularly unique arable machair sites, and what plans it has to further the conservation and management of such areas.</p>

  <p>The Site Condition Monitoring programme undertaken by Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) assesses the condition of all sites protected under European Directives and those notified under domestic legislation. 53% of machair features were assessed as being in favourable condition. Of the SSSIs where arable and associated fallows form a significant contribution to the designated machair (i.e. Uists and Berneray only), 20% were in Favourable Condition and 80% in Unfavourable Condition.</p>

  <p>SNH reports that the reasons for this vary markedly between arable and non-arable sites. For arable machair sites, the most serious issues are thought to stem from a reduction in the number and diversity of flowering plants in the arable crop coupled with greater cultivated patch size. The former is believed to be linked to the use of herbicides, but other factors such as plough depth, the move towards higher yielding grain varieties and the use of inorganic fertiliser may also be having an impact.The Scotland Rural Development Programme (SRDP) (which we expect to secure European Union approval later this year) contains specific prescriptions to support the beneficial management of machair on designated sites and in the wider countryside. The SRDP also contains further options for managers of machair, including the Crofting Counties Agricultural grant Scheme, the Less Favoured Areas Support Scheme and support to produce Specialist Plans which could be used to encourage beneficial management of the habitat.Scottish Natural Heritage (in partnership with RSPB Scotland) is funding preliminary work to scope the potential for a bid under the recently launched EC LIFE+ funding mechanism for a project to assist in planning conservation and management of machair habitats. This work is at an early stage but the outputs will form the basis against which future funding options may be considered.</p>

  <p>Following the work of the Falls Prevention Group, the Scottish Government published guidance earlier this year for health boards, Community Health Partnerships and others on actions to prevent falls by older people and improve bone health.</p>

  <p>The guidance is available on the Scottish Government website at<br /> <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/care/OlderPeopleCare/fallsgroup" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/care/OlderPeopleCare/fallsgroup</a>.</p>

  <p>Research evidence indicates that up to 30% of falls amongst community-based older people could be prevented through comprehensive multidisciplinary assessment.</p>

  <p>Statistics relating to electricity generated from renewable sources in Scotland are published by the Department for Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. The most recently published figures are available at <a href="http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file34201.pdf" target="_blank">www.berr.gov.uk/files/file34201.pdf</a> . Figures for 2006 are due to be published during September 2007. Currently, generation from wind and wave are combined so that confidential information about individual sites is not disclosed.</p>

  <p>There has not to date been a detailed estimate of the level of generation from individual renewable technologies. However, the Marine Supply Obligation (MSO) which is part of the Renewables Obligation (Scotland) previously set an illustrative path to achieving 75MW of wave and tidal power by 2015. The new government believes wave and tidal power has a more significant contribution to make and we are currently considering measures to support the further expansion of this sector.</p>

  <p>The replacement of High Mill Primary School in Carluke is a matter for South Lanarkshire Council which has a statutory responsibility to provide and maintain school buildings.</p>

  <p>There are several procurement options open to public sector procuring bodies and it is their responsibility to assess which is most appropriate for any investment they are undertaking. As regards the Scottish Futures Trust, work on the design aspects is underway and we believe it will be able to deliver better value arrangements for major public infrastructure projects.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it considers that 1.07% of failed tests for lead in consumer tap samples, shown in Table 3.4c of Drinking Water Quality in Scotland 2006, is too high.</p>

  <p>Lead is not normally present in water leaving water treatment works but it can be dissolved from old lead pipes that are sometimes present in older properties. Non-compliance with the lead standard therefore reflects the presence of lead plumbing in older properties rather than the quality of the water in the public supply. In order to reduce consumers&rsquo; exposure to lead in drinking water and to bring the quality of drinking water at the consumer&rsquo;s tap into line with Scotland&rsquo;s obligations under the Drinking Water Directive (98/83/EC), Scottish Water has embarked on an extensive programme to install treatment to minimise the uptake of lead from domestic plumbing in areas where there may be high numbers of properties with old lead pipes. The figures published for 2006 show an improved situation over those found in 2005 (1.20%) and the trend towards full compliance with the relevant lead standard in the Water Supply (Water Quality) (Scotland) Regulations 2001 is being closely monitored by the Drinking Water Quality Regulator for Scotland (DWQR).</p>

  <p>The Private Water Supplies (Scotland) Regulations 2006 continue the role of local authorities set out in the Water (Scotland) Act 1980 and the previous Private Water Supplies (Scotland) Regulations 1992 to regulate private water supplies as part of their wider public health role. The overriding objective of the 2006 Regulations is to ensure the provision of clean and wholesome drinking water to those using such supplies.</p>

  <p>Where a supply fails to meet the water quality standards for drinking water as set down in the 2006 Regulations the local authority will advise the owners and users of the private water supply of appropriate remedial action they should take to improve their supply.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises the financial implications of the 2006 Regulations for some rural communities and businesses and a non-means tested Grant Scheme, administered by local authorities, was introduced at the same time as the 2006 Regulations to assist individuals and businesses invest in new equipment to improve their private supply.</p>
