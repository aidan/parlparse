<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-07-07.6.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80097" speakername="Peter Peacock" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0707.htm#4">

  <p>The staffing and management of individual schools in Aberdeenshire is a matter for that authority. The Scottish Executive is committed to a teaching workforce of 53,000 by 2007. To enable local authorities to achieve this objective additional funding of &pound;18 million in 2006-07 and &pound;44 million in 2007-08 has been provided for the employment of teachers. Before local authorities receive funding for 2007-08 they will be required to commit to a number of teachers which will in total achieve our target. I recently decided that a further &pound;14.5 million of central resources would also be distributed through the National Priorities Action Fund for the employment of additional teachers this year.</p>

  <p>A national teacher workforce planning exercise is carried out annually which helps to ensure that sufficient numbers of teachers are available in all subjects. The latest survey of vacancies from February 2006 shows that only 245 full-time equivalent posts (0.5% of staff complement) were vacant for over three months. In Aberdeenshire only 13.9 full-time equivalent posts (0.6% of staff complement) were vacant for over three months.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has considered the European Route of Industrial Heritage (ERIH) project to link sites of significant industrial archaeological heritage and whether it is considering developing, or supporting the development of, a Scottish &quot;themed route&quot; comparable with those being developed in Wales, England, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.</p>

  <p>Historic Scotland is aware of this cultural route. Under development since 2001, it was launched in October 2005. Three Scottish anchor points are already identified on this route: Dundee Heritage, New Lanark and the Scottish Mining Museum. These three partners may wish to add other related sites to the route. Historic Scotland has given advice in the form of suggested sites and themes. Leadership of the route is by the partners and the individual anchor points.</p>

  <p>As it is an international digital route a single theme would not be purely Scottish but of course a strong Scottish component can be threaded through each one.</p>

  <p>While we can and do review individual grant schemes (a) to ensure that they continue to meet their aims, and (b) to ensure that they remain within budget, the Scottish Executive currently has no plans for a wider review of its strategies for the allocation of grant funding.</p>

  <p>Each grant scheme is designed to meet a particular need. In some instances there is a need to limit the number of applications awarded grant so as to ensure that the approved budget for the measure is not exceeded. This is usually a key aspect of overall grant scheme budgetary control and is supported by objective assessment processes and transparent rules to govern the basis on which some applications will be accepted and others not.</p>
