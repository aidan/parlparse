  <p>The Scottish Government are very conscious that children who have a parent in prison may have additional support needs in terms of section 22 of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995.</p>

  <p>Some steps we have taken so that these needs can be highlighted are:</p>

  <p>1. The Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2009 strengthened the 2004 Act which placed a duty on education authorities to identify, meet and keep under review the additional support needs of all pupils for whom they are responsible, and to tailor provision to their individual needs.</p>

  <p>2. New guidance for social workers was published on 24 December 2010, which specifically advises report writers to consider the impact on children and other family members of certain community disposals and especially custody.</p>

  <p>3. The Minister for Children and Early Years hosted a meeting with representatives from Families Outside, Action for Children, Barnardos, SCCYP (Scotland&rsquo;s Commissioner for Children and Young People) and Children in Scotland to discuss suggested ways forward on 25 January 2011 and officials are currently developing mechanisms to help identify children with specific support needs.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the remit of the Scottish Education Quality and Improvement Agency will be.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2011-03-08.S3W-40318.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80381" speakername="Michael Russell" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-11/wa0308.htm#3">

  <p>I am pleased to confirm the remit and purpose of the new agency.</p>

  <p>Core Purpose and Strategic Priorities</p>

  <p>The new agency is to be established as a key national body supporting quality and improvement in Scottish education by:</p>

  <p>leading and supporting the implementation of Curriculum for Excellence;</p>

  <p>increasing the capacity for self-evaluation and self-improvement amongst education providers and practitioners;</p>

  <p>promoting high quality professional learning and leadership;</p>

  <p>identifying and stimulating innovation, sharing successful approaches widely with others;</p>

  <p>providing independent external evaluations of the quality of educational provision at individual provider, local authority and partners, and national levels, and</p>

  <p>supporting the development and implementation of policy at National Level.</p>

  <p>Values and Operating Principles</p>

  <p>The new agency will work in partnership alongside the full range of bodies and organisations active in the field of Scottish education, from local authorities to further and higher education, third sector and parent groups, according to their own statutory and other duties and capabilities. It will:</p>

  <p>focus on delivering value and enhanced capacity to front-line providers and practitioners.</p>

  <p>promote and support a climate of ambition that maximises effective local developments and implementation.</p>

  <p>be capable of providing consistent, flexible and proportionate support, based on the presumption that the majority of educational establishments are well run organisations, not in need of major intervention;</p>

  <p>have the capacity to intervene strongly wherever there is evidence that education providers are not ensuring satisfactory quality and standards through their own action;</p>

  <p>be characterised by an ethos of trust, partnership openness, excellence, and accountability, and</p>

  <p>be driven by end-user accountability, and committed to the continuous improvement of the quality of its own services.</p>

  <p>Activity</p>

  <p>The agency will inherit the full range of functions currently being undertaken by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) and Learning and Teaching Scotland (LTS):</p>

  <p>It will assume responsibility from the Scottish Government Learning Directorate for aspects of activity supporting Continuing Professional Development at national level;</p>

  <p>Ministers, on the advice of Scottish Government policy departments, will continue to set policy and strategy for the public sector and the education system at a national level, including the broad framework of policy for scrutiny and inspection in each sector;</p>

  <p>The agency will take over responsibility for the Curriculum for Excellence Management Board and Excellence Groups from October 2011, or when all major policy decisions have been agreed;</p>

  <p>The agency will collate and analyse intelligence and data from all its support and improvement activities in Scotland, and knowledge of effective international practice. Other evidence and analysis functions will sit as currently with the Scottish Government;</p>

  <p>On the formation of the agency on 1 July, there will be a seamless continuity in the operation of the various programmes run by these entities;</p>

  <p>The continuous improvement of these programmes will be driven over time by the senior team and staff of the agency to best meet the strategic priorities set out above, and</p>

  <p>Future changes in the agency&rsquo;s activity and the timeframe for its implementation will be determined in concert with key delivery partners as appropriate.</p>

  <p>Ethos</p>

  <p>In order to most effectively fulfil its remit, the new agency will aim to be:</p>

  <p>flexible, non-hierarchical, with open lines of communication throughout the organisation, and people coming together to work on specific projects according to their skills, interests and abilities;</p>

  <p>expert in relationship management and the facilitation of highly effective collaborative partnership working, within and beyond the education sector, Scotland-wide and internationally, and</p>

  <p>evidence-based, and capable of rapid, flexible response, but not rule bound and heavily bureaucratic.</p>

  <p>Benefits</p>

  <p>The key benefits to accrue from the establishment of the agency are:</p>

  <p>a single point of contact for the range of support services currently offered;</p>

  <p>improved flows of information, knowledge and skills between review activity and support activity that builds on existing local arrangements;</p>

  <p>closer integration of the provision of support services among the organisations being brought together;</p>

  <p>more proportionate, streamlined and flexible use of resources, to deliver against an over-arching strategy;</p>

  <p>extension of the principle of earned autonomy and trust, enabling establishments to determine - with their natural partners - their own strengths/opportunities/development areas where they have demonstrated their ability to manage their development effectively, and</p>

  <p>the opportunity to make full use of the experience and skills of staff coming into the organisation.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Football Association has received significant funding from sportscotland in each of the last four years to support the implementation of the sport&rsquo;s development plan. The level of investment is an operational matter and I have asked the chief executive of sportscotland, Stewart Harris, to provide the detailed information requested.</p>

  <p>In the three years from 2008-09, the Scottish Football Association was awarded &pound;2.535 million direct from the Scottish Government to deliver a wide range of football opportunities as part of the Cashback for Communities programme. A further &pound;2 million has been provided from the Cashback for Communities programme to sportscotland to help support the delivery of quality facilities in communities across Scotland.</p>

  <p>Guidance regarding the Health Plan Indicator (HPI) was contained in <em>A New Look at Hall 4, The Early Years, Good Health for Every Child,</em> launched on 18 January 2011.</p>

  <p>The criteria for allocation of the HPI should be based on the assessed need of the individual child and family.</p>

  <p>The Health Plan Indicator should continue to be recorded on the Child Health Surveillance Programme &ndash; Pre-school (CHSP-PS) system. Work is ongoing to ensure this system supports practitioners in light of the changes.</p>

  <p>The HPI should relate to the assessed needs of the child and family. The guidance makes clear the need for flexibility in the allocation of the HPI as well as the need to revisit the assessment as child and/or family circumstances change.</p>

  <p>The review needs to be flexible to meet the needs of the child and family. Although it is anticipated that a registered Public Health Nurse &ndash; Health Visitor will lead the review process, it is for NHS boards to decide locally how the reviews can be carried out most effectively depending on the individual child and family circumstances, and who the most appropriate health professional is to carry out that review.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers have set the Keeper of the Registers of Scotland the financial target of delivering 3% increasing cash-releasing efficiencies in each year of her department&rsquo;s 2011-14 corporate plan.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Keeper has set the following registration and customer service performance targets, which Scottish Ministers endorse:</p>

  <p>Where it is in the Keeper&rsquo;s power and is legally appropriate to:</p>

  <p>Complete the registration of Sasine writs within an upper limit of 40 days. 80% will be completed within 20 days.</p>

  <p>Complete the registration of Dealings with Whole carried out as Automated Registration of Title to Land (ARTL) transactions within 24 hours.</p>

  <p>Complete the registration of Dealings with Whole that are not carried out as ARTL transactions and standard First Registrations within an upper limit of 120 days. 80% will be completed within 60 days.</p>

  <p>Record all applications for registration on the application record within one working day. (Entrance on the application record safeguards the rights of applicants until the registration application is determined.)</p>

  <p>As part of the continuing strategy to deal with older, complex casework, where it is in the Keeper&rsquo;s power and is legally appropriate, to:</p>

  <p>Complete pre-1 April 2011 First Registration casework by 31 March 2012.</p>

  <p>Complete pre-1 July 2012 First Registration casework by 31 March 2013.</p>

  <p>The group has met four times since it was established in May 2010 and has submitted its report to me, a copy of which is available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib number 52551).</p>

  <p>I am grateful to the group for its constructive advice and pragmatic assessment of the value of each of the 15 recommendations in Paddy Tomkins&rsquo; report and Scotland is safer because of the work already underway as a result of the report. This work will help inform future decisions about fire and rescue capability in Scotland. The Scottish Government supports the conclusions of the group that the majority of the recommendations be accepted and should be progressed by the relevant agency; which will help strengthen Scotland&rsquo;s inland water rescue capability.</p>

  <p>The recommendations which have been identified for further work include:</p>

  <p>Exploration of the implications for Scottish stakeholders of the adoption of the Water Accidents and Incidents Database.</p>

  <p>Discussion with relevant stakeholders about the development of inland water rescue asset registers.</p>

  <p>Designated strategic lead for delivery of inland water safety messages across Scotland.</p>

  <p>Implementation of these recommendations will help build on the work which has already been undertaken in the past year to promote safety messages - such as the Ready Winter pages of the Scottish Government website - and the provision of financial support to projects to improve Scotland&rsquo;s resilience to flooding events, such as the development of the Scottish Flood Forecasting Service.</p>

  <p>The full text of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s response to the recommendations in Paddy Tomkins&rsquo; report is available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 52550).</p>
