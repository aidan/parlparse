  <p>Prior to 2003-04, although information was collected on the reason for exclusion, different categories were used and it is impossible to identify those excluded for &quot;Substance misuse &ndash;alcohol&quot;.</p>

  <p>The 2006-07 figures are the same as those previously published on 4 November 2008 in the answer to S3W-16845.</p>

  <p>We are publishing today a policy statement on our plans for the next census, which we propose will be held on 27 March 2011. Census information is widely used by central and local government and others, in planning future policy and service delivery, as well as by businesses, academic researchers and community groups of many kinds. There is no other source of comparable information, particularly for small areas and population groups.</p>

  <p>The Registrar General for Scotland is responsible, under the Census Act 1920, for taking the census in Scotland and plans are already well in hand, based on consultation with users of the statistics, community groups and others. There will be a rehearsal of these preparations in March 2009 in Lewis, Harris and West Edinburgh, following which Parliament&rsquo;s approval of the proposals will be sought in early 2010.</p>

  <p>The document has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 47152).</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises the valuable contribution that community media can make to fostering a sense of community identity and cohesion, and bringing people together. We are currently taking forward the Scottish Broadcasting Commission report, which recognises the contribution that both community radio and local television make.</p>

  <p>In addition, Highlands and Islands Enterprise can support community media initiatives under its Strengthening Communities remit and Scottish Enterprise can also assist community media through its remit of supporting business growth and developing a competitive business environment.</p>

  <p>The 2008-11 local government settlement allocates &pound;5.298 million each year for money advice. We will also be providing an extra sum of around &pound;1 million over three years, from Barnett consequentials from the pre-Budget report, to expand face-to-face advice capacity.</p>

  <p>We also fund national infrastructure for the sector - training and consultancy to help advisors deal with more complex cases.</p>

  <p>We are committed to rolling out the Scottish National Standards for Information and Advice Providers in the money advice sector.</p>

  <p>We help fund National Debtline. We are also funding Citizens Advice Direct, which provides advice by telephone and email, rather than the traditional face-to-face model of bureaux to progressively increase its coverage from its beginnings in Glasgow to the whole of Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is increasing financial inclusion and is working with the UK Government, local government and key stakeholders, through initiatives such as financial champions, to ensure money advice services meet the needs of all sections of the community including those from minority ethnic and faith communities<em>.</em></p>

  <p>The identification of traders acting illegally is a matter for local authorities under consumer protection powers reserved to the UK Government. However, as part of its work to support local authorities in their implementation of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, the Scottish Government is exploring options for facilitating a &quot;trusted trader&quot; framework across Scotland. The aim of such a framework would be to ensure that homeowners needing to carry out work to their home had access to basic information on reliable traders, mainly through their local authority trading standards department.</p>

  <p>We had no formal discussions with any external stakeholders about our proposals prior to the publication of the Scottish Government Response, to the final report of the Committee of Inquiry on Crofting, because no small farmer needs to be worse off as a result of our decision to focus the scheme on crofters.</p>

  <p>Small farmers who are not crofters are currently eligible for grants under both the Crofting Counties Agricultural Grants Scheme and the Rural Priorities part of the Scotland Rural Development Programme. In future they will continue to be eligible for support on the same financial terms under Rural Priorities. Or, it they wish to retain access to both schemes, they will need to convert their landholdings to crofting tenure.</p>

  <p>Exercise Cauld Craw will take place in late April and May of 2009. This exercise, based on a pandemic influenza scenario, will practice generic capabilities, (such as crisis decision making and the maintenance of essential services) that apply to any major emergency. It will also evaluate the ability to respond to challenges (such as the provision of high volumes of personal protective equipment for use by NHS staff) which are specific to a human health emergency.</p>

  <p>Exercise Cauld Craw is aimed primarily at the Scottish Government itself. It will also involve several multi-agency Strategic Co-ordinating Groups (SCGs) and NHS boards. It will take lessons from Exercise Winter Willow which was led by the UK Government in 2007 and which also involved a number of SCGs and NHS boards.</p>

  <p>The Countryside (Scotland) Act 1967 provides statutory powers for the designation of national long distance routes. In the past Scottish Natural Heritage has been able to provide some financial support for these projects. Going forward, local authorities will have the opportunity to make funds available as they develop access opportunities in their areas in line with their single outcome agreements and with their core path plans.

  <p>We are fully committed to ensuring that forestry continues to provide a wide range of economic, social and environmental benefits for the people of Scotland. In conjunction with the forestry sector, Forestry Commission Scotland is working to a strategy which sets out clear objectives for key themes covering climate change, access and health, business development, timber, environmental quality, biodiversity, and community development. Woodland expansion is central to all these themes. We have made significant funds available under the SRDP for forestry and we are currently consulting on options aimed at further enhancing forestry&rsquo;s contribution to climate change.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3M-17628 by Shona Robison on 6 November 2008, what interim measures are being put in place to protect patients and health care professionals and inform them about venous thromboembolism until the review of Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) Guideline 62 is published.</p>

  <p>As an interim measure until the publication of the revised SIGN Guideline 62, the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) and the Chairman of NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (QIS) wrote to NHS Boards in January 2008, asking them to adopt a standard patient information leaflet on the prevention and management of DVT. NHS QIS is conducting a follow-up exercise and is expected to report to the CMO later this month on NHS boards&rsquo; progress.</p>

  <p><strong>In addition, in April 2007 the Scottish Government provided Lifeblood, the Thrombosis Charity, with funding to develop a general information leaflet on DVT and to promote awareness of thrombosis. This leaflet was distributed to all general practices across Scotland.</strong></p>

  <p>The action being taken to mitigate against cross infection from these devices is to ensure regular and effective cleaning. All NHS boards have decontamination policies for patient equipment detailing when and how items should be cleaned, and more specifically that patient equipment should be cleaned prior to use on another patient. The implementation of policies relating to the decontamination/cleaning of patient equipment is monitored by the charge nurse who will ensure staff in her/his area are aware of procedures and how these should be applied.</p>

  <p>Health Facilities Scotland (HFS) have co-ordinated a scientific study into the effectiveness of copper-impregnated mops in two NHS Scotland boards. This was a preliminary study and the results were not conclusive in establishing how effective copper solution is at removing organisms responsible for healthcare associated infections. HFS are in the process of carrying out further research into the potential benefits of this technology.</p>

  <p>It should be made clear that the majority of bank staff, over 35,000, have already been assimilated. Of those staff left to process, boards are generally prioritising substantive staff because, once these staff are assimilated, bank workers will be able to be transferred to Agenda for Change relatively quickly. Boards will have more resource available to conclude the process for bank workers once the more complex substantive staff have been assimilated.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of its international framework, whether the Scottish Government will consider making representations in favour of modifying EU procurement law to allow public bodies within its responsibility to determine what products their contractors supply in order to avoid supporting companies that openly disregard human rights, for example by depleting regional water resources to the detriment of a population, by acting to limit workers&rsquo; freedom of association, or by subcontracting so as to benefit indirectly from child labour.</p>

  <p>Public bodies are free to decide what types of products they wish to purchase, but EU law generally requires that they avoid referring to particular manufacturers or to products of a specific make or source or to a particular process when framing the technical specifications to which those products must conform. Companies tendering for public contracts are generally required to disclose any convictions and EU law already allows public bodies to consider excluding from competition any tenderer who has committed a criminal offence or act of grave professional misconduct in the course of their business. Guidance on this has been provided by the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Procurement Directorate in <em>Social Issues in Public Procurement</em> document. Against this background we do not intend to make representations to the European Commission.</p>

  <p>On 8 December 2008 there were 163 patients cared for at the State Hospital. The planned capacity for the redeveloped facility will be to accommodate up to 140 patients.</p>

  <p>Only those for whom a transfer is assessed as appropriate and safe will move to other services. Medium secure accommodation and other relevant services will deliver the forecast numbers by the 2011 commissioning date.</p>

  <p>The UK nominations for new World Heritage Sites until 2011 have already been announced. These are as follows:</p>

  <p>2009 - Pont-cysyllte Aqueduct, North Wales</p>

  <p>2010 - Darwin at Downe, Bromley - will be resubmitted for consideration</p>

  <p>2011 - the Monkwearmouth and Jarrow Monastic Sites, Sunderland.</p>

  <p>The UK is restricted to making one nomination a year, and in 2008 the Antonine Wall was successfully nominated. Historic Scotland on behalf of the Scottish Government has contributed to the consultation document on World Heritage in the UK issued by the Department for Culture Media and Sport, and will continue to work with government departments across the UK as the policy develops. The Scottish Government is committed to fulfilling its obligations under the World Heritage Convention.</p>
