  <p>The South Lanarkshire Community Learning Strategy Partnership has been allocated &#163;912,000 over three years to 2004 to help raise levels of adult literacy and numeracy. The partnership has submitted an action plan and subsequent mid-year report which estimates that almost 5,000 adults will be helped during this time.</p>

  <p>There is no specific target on young adults, although people with limited initial education, particularly young adults, are highlighted as one of seven priority groups.</p>

Where the RRU is dispatched then it is backed up by the first available accident and emergency ambulance.</p>

  <p>These response times concern the performance of the emergency ambulance service following the introduction of priority-based dispatch. This system was introduced into the south east of Scotland from 1 August 2002 and is scheduled to be rolled out across Scotland by 2004. The information requested is not yet available. Officials in the Scottish Executive Health Department are currently in discussion with the Scottish Ambulance Service about the frequency to which performance information should be published.

  <p>No, amnesic shellfish poisoning is a matter of public health. Its existence increases the need for further conservation of scallop stocks, and I am persuaded following extensive consultation that technical conservation measures are the best way of achieving such conservation. However, I do intend to consider carefully the points made to and by the Rural Development Committee before finalising and laying the statutory instrument in question.</p>

  <p>Beattie Inclusiveness projects are managed and delivered by Careers Scotland. Working in partnership with local agencies (statutory and voluntary), they aim to help young people (16 to 24 years) with additional support needs progress to education, training and employment. Inclusiveness projects are Scotland-wide (12 projects &ndash; Scottish Enterprise; one &ndash; pan Highlands and Islands Enterprise).</p>

  <p>New Futures Fund projects are managed by the Enterprise Networks and delivered through a range of agencies (statutory and voluntary) who specialise in working with specific client groups but who do not have an employability dimension. They target people (16 to 34 years) seriously disadvantaged in the labour market who are not job ready or not seeking work but who can move in that direction with the right support. New Futures Fund projects are Scotland-wide (72 projects &ndash; Scottish Enterprise; nine projects &ndash; pan Highlands and Islands Enterprise).</p>

  <p>The Executive has been fully involved in the UK-wide Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and we are committed, along with the other UK administrations, to the Asset Recovery Strategy. The new legislation strengthens the powers of the courts to confiscate criminal assets, and it introduces new powers of civil recovery and taxation which will greatly assist efforts to recover cash and other assets gained through criminal activity. The cash seizures and money laundering elements of the act will be implemented in late December this year, and most of the remaining provisions will be implemented in February 2003.</p>

  <p>We are strengthening the Criminal Confiscation Unit in the Crown Office, and we are establishing a new Civil Recovery Unit, so that we can make full use of the powers available in the new legislation. A multi-agency money laundering unit has also been created within the Scottish Drug Enforcement Agency to investigate and intercept suspicious financial transactions.</p>

  <p>The outcome of this skills and capacity building will be that we are able to seize increased amounts of criminal assets to redistribute them to good causes. We have already paid &#163;250,000 from recovered assets to Greater Glasgow NHS Board to support the costs of additional addiction services for the Glasgow homeless. The First Minister has also announced a further award of &#163;180,000 to assist family support groups across Scotland, which are helping the families of drug misusers. Future awards will depend on the amounts we collect from forfeitures and confiscations.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>Under the provisions contained in Part IV of the Trade Union and Labour Relation (Consolidation) Act 1992, employers must notify the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, in writing, if they intend to make 20 or more redundancies within a month. The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) therefore hold information on those intended redundancies that fall within the scope of the act. However, individual companies cannot be identified as the information is potentially commercially sensitive and is treated in the strictest confidence by DTI. Nor is it known how many of the notified redundancies actually took place.</p>

  <p>Since Richard Roberts Knitwear entered its consultation period, officials at Scottish Development International and Scottish Enterprise Ayrshire have been in close, regular contact with senior management at the company. A number of options were discussed with the company, including the possibility of financial support to help keep the facility open.</p>

  <p>The company has, however, now taken the decision to close the factory. The majority of redundancies will take place on 17 December. In order to support the employees to find new jobs, support was offered to the company under the Executive&rsquo;s PACE (Partnership Action for Continuing Employment) framework. The PACE services will be in place from 18<sup> </sup>November and are likely to include sessions by JobcentrePlus, Careers Scotland and the Inland Revenue along with North Ayrshire Council Welfare rights and the Small Business Gateway.</p>

  <p>When I welcomed the publication of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Royal Society and Lessons to be Learned reports in July, I undertook to respond to their conclusions and recommendations by the end of the year and to make them available to Parliament. I am pleased that it has been possible to respond sooner than expected and I have today written to the Convenor of the Parliament's Rural Development Committee providing a copy of the Executive's response. The document has also been placed in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 24750) and is available on the Scottish Executive website.</p>

  <p>The Executive has responded positively to the conclusions and many recommendations in these reports. The response marries up with steps the Executive has already taken to reduce the risk of future outbreaks and is very focussed around three main themes:</p>

  <p>keeping out infectious agents of exotic disease;</p>

  <p>reducing livestock vulnerability by reforming industry practice, and</p>

  <p>minimising the impact of any future outbreak.</p>

  <p>It is my intention to take the recommendations forward in partnership with stakeholders reflecting the way in which Scotland was able to eradicate foot-and-mouth disease within three months. These positive working relationships were highlighted in particular by the Lessons to be Learned report and it is important that these are built on for the future.</p>

  <p>The Information and Statistics Division (ISD) compiles and publishes a large number of key health indicators for Scotland and these are presented on ISD Online, SKIPPER and in the Performance Assessment Framework, for example. These publications have developed through time to meet the needs of key stakeholders for health information. Many of the OECD indicators are reflected in these outputs.</p>

  <p>The ISD contributes to the OECD compendium of statistics through the submission of data to the Office of National Statistics (ONS) for publication by the OECD as country level comparisons. The ISD also contributes to the regional breakdowns of health indicators which are published by the ONS in Regional Trends and periodically in UK Geographic Variations in Health.</p>

  <p>Requests to resource the development of major new statistical outputs for the home countries, such as a more extensive regional comparison similar to the OECD, can be made through the user/provider consultation process for national statistics.</p>

  <p>Currently there are no dedicated units for mother and child admissions. However, at the discretion of clinicians and NHS trusts arrangements can be made locally in individual cases.</p>

  <p>Our guidance on post-natal depression services highlights the consideration that should be applied by service providers to the immediate, proven, benefits of joint admission arrangements for the mother and child and ultimately to the wider family. NHS boards and trusts are responsible for organising local or regional post-natal depression services against the published guidance.</p>

  <p>To inform further the assessments of need and best practice we have funded an audit over the next two years of primary and secondary care post-natal depression services in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive guidance is available in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 24358).</p>
