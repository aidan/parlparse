  <p>Because the Scottish Ambulance Service has achieved its relevant financial targets in recent years there is no annual debt to write off. The internal arrangements that the ambulance service makes for funding different parts of its operations are matters for the chairman and the board, subject to the service continuing to meet its performance targets agreed with the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>In addition, we made a further &pound;5.4 million available to fire authorities to assist with pensions costs during 2002-03. I have also authorised the release of a further &pound;16.8 million during this financial year to assist with the implementation of the June 2003 pay and modernisation agreement. It is for the fire authorities to determine the use of these funds in delivering an effective and efficient service to their communities.</p>

  <p>However, local authorities have a duty under the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons (Scotland) Act 1972 to publish general information about the services they provide.

  <p>There are already robust provisions for monitoring the incidence of disease in Scotland, at both local and national level. The Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health monitors infectious diseases through its Scottish Infectious Disease Surveillance System and NHS National Services Scotland monitors the incidence of cancers via the Scottish Cancer Registration Scheme.</p>

  <p>In response to concerns in the past about the possible effects of Hunterston power station and the health of the local population, Ayrshire and Arran NHS Board commissioned an independent, multi-agency investigation into cancer rates and radioactivity, which reported in November 1999. This investigation included Hunterston power station and the surrounding area. This independent investigation found no statistically significant excess of cancer levels among local people and no excess radiation hazard presented by Hunterston.</p>

  <p>More generally, the principal independent expert advisory committee for the UK Government and devolved administrations, on the health effects of radiation is the Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment (COMARE). COMARE has already been asked to advise on which, if any, nuclear installations in Great Britain have incidences of childhood cancer and leukaemia in their vicinity that are significantly outside the distribution seen nationally. COMARE is therefore considering the geographical distribution of childhood cancer to see how the pattern of cases around nuclear installations compares with the national pattern. A report on this work is expected to be published early in 2005.</p>

  <p>The management of the spread of infection is complex and visitors are as likely to bring infection into hospitals, unknowingly, as to carry it away after a visit. Making hand hygiene compulsory for visitors would be difficult to enforce. We expect NHS boards to offer hand hygiene advice, particularly in the context of outbreaks or for infected patients in isolation. The Chief Medical Officer has issued Top Tips which guide visitors on how to help reduce the spread of infection.</p>

  <p>Yes. Membership includes representatives from the Scottish Consumer Council, Citizens Advice Scotland, the Office of Fair Trading, and the legal professional bodies, as well as academic researchers and representatives of the Scottish Executive. Membership of the group is consistent with its remit which requires specialised expertise to cover the consumer, economic, socio-legal and legal services market issues under consideration. The main role of the group is to ensure that the research fully explores the issues set out in its remit, which together with the minutes of its meetings is available at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Justice/Civil/17822/19316" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Justice/Civil/17822/19316</a> .</p>

  <p>The research undertaken under the auspices of the Group has sought evidence from other organisations with an interest in the relevant issues: and the Executive will of course take into consideration any further relevant submissions put forward.</p>

  <p>Officials from the National Archives of Scotland (NAS) completed the cataloguing process in February 2004 in accordance with NAS business objectives.</p>

  <p>The relevant documents were transferred to Crown Office in March 2004 in order that they could be reviewed in detail by Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service officials to allow me to determine what of the material can be released in its entirety, what can be released in an edited format to &quot;anonymise&quot; data and what is unsuitable for release.</p>

  <p>The review and editing process has been a lengthy, complex and detailed one, necessitating the removal from documents of the names of living individuals and replacing with individual designations, such as &quot;Witness 1&quot; or &quot;Child A&quot; to preserve anonymity but ensure that the edited documents would still makes sense to any reader. Removing an individual&rsquo;s name may, in some documents, not preserve anonymity, so it is also necessary to consider whether redaction of names is sufficient in each case. It will not be possible for each and every document to be released, even in an edited manner.</p>

  <p>The process is nearing completion and it is anticipated that material will be available to the public at NAS in early 2005.</p>

  <p>We expect to be in a position to bring the rights of access established by Part 1 of the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 into effect in the early part of 2005. Before then we intend to issue guidance to local authorities under section 27 of the act on the discharge of their functions with respect to access rights. A draft of this guidance will be laid before the Parliament shortly. Also, we are currently consulting on a draft order to be made under section 8 of the Act that would bring woods and forests within access rights. Such an order can only be made if approved by resolution of the Parliament.</p>

  <p>Our intention is that access rights will be in effect in good time to allow a major publicity and educational campaign to be mounted to alert the public and land managers to the implications of the new access arrangements, and to their responsibilities under the act, prior to the main period of countryside recreational activities starting around Easter.</p>

  <p>None. No criminal charges have been brought against patients for prescription charge evasion in Scotland. There has been one criminal case involving four charges of fraud perpetrated by altering prescription forms and one criminal case involving four charges of fraud perpetrated by obtaining drugs using false identities. Both cases were led by the police, with support provided by investigators from NHSScotland Counter Fraud Services. Civil penalty charges may be imposed on patients who are found to have evaded NHS charges, including prescription charges.</p>

  <p>The SPS is keeping the situation under review and where practicable is moving low supervision prisoners to other Scottish Prison Service establishments. The SPS is currently spending the equivalent of &pound;1.5 million per week to provide new and refurbished accommodation to alleviate overcrowding and to make the Estate &quot;fit for purpose&quot;.</p>

  <p>The Executive has provided local authorities with &pound;1.4 billion this year for the provision of community care, building on the record levels we have invested in social care over recent years. Respite is a key service that helps people with support needs and their carers. In recognition of this, over the last three years &pound;22 million has been provided to authorities specifically to increase respite provision. Total provision for services to support carers, including respite, has risen four-fold from &pound;5 million in 1999-2000 to &pound;21 million in 2004-05. Our Partnership Agreement builds on this historically high investment through a commitment to ensure that local authorities in Scotland continue to deliver existing levels of respite each year. Authorities must determine how all of the resources available to them are used, in order to meet local needs and priorities. We will be monitoring the overall increase in respite provision achieved for these additional resources but we do not hold information on specific services provided by individual authorities.</p>

  <p>The Executive&rsquo;s overall aim has been to increase access to respite for users and carers and we will continue to work with key stakeholders to deliver that. An Executive/local authority-led working group is currently looking to improve the data available on respite provision both at a local and national level. To do that we need to create a more standardised definition of respite services for use by local authorities. This is a complex area but one we are working to resolve.</p>

  <p>Funding allocated to national voluntary organisations under Section 9(1) of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 increased to &pound;1.6 million in 2004-05. The majority of voluntary organisations received funding awards for three years.</p>

  <p>In addition to this funding, specific grant funding of &pound;5.5 million has been made available to local authorities to improve the quality of social work service provision and the management of that provision by increasing the availability of training for relevant staff may be shared with their voluntary sector partners.</p>
