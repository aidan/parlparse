  <p>The criteria for being regarded as an NHS committed practice, in respect of the payment of certain allowances, are that the dentists within a practice have to:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>provide general dental services to all categories of patients;</p>
<p>have an average of 500 registered NHS patients per dentist, of which at least an average of 100 per dentist must be fee paying adults, and </p>
<p>have average gross earnings of &pound;50,000 or above per dentist.</p>
<p>To continue to be regarded as an NHS committed practice a practice has to continue to meet the above criteria but must also maintain or increase its NHS patient profile.</p>
</blockquote></p>

  <p>Failure to continue to meet the above criteria will result in the practice no longer being regarded as NHS committed. Where a practice has exceptional reasons for not continuing to meet the criteria this will be taken into consideration.</p>

  <p>The criteria for being regarded as an NHS committed practice for the enhanced rate of the general dental practice allowance is contained in Determination XIV of the Statement of Dental Remuneration. Dentists were provided with an outline of the new NHS commitment criteria in the October edition of the Scottish Dental News. I provided further details in my letter to dentists of 29 November. Full guidance on the introduction of this allowance was issued to NHS boards, Practitioner Services of NHS National Services Scotland and dentists in NHS: 2005 PCA(D)11, issued on 29 December 2005, a copy of which is available on SHOW at: <a href="http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/sehd/pca.asp" target="_blank">http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/sehd/pca.asp</a> .</p>

  <p>No, NHS Argyll and Clyde&rsquo;s capital plan was not over-committed at the time of transfer to NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. NHS Argyll and Clyde reported an underspend of &pound;8.5 million in 2005-06. This has been apportioned in 2006-07 between NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (&pound;7.25 million) and NHS Highland (&pound;1.25 million) on advice provided by NHS Argyll and Clyde on project slippage. From 2002-03 the capital allocations to NHS Argyll and Clyde, NHS Greater Glasgow and NHS Highland were as follows:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to improving access to health and education services though a number of means:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>by ensuring, through planning, that schools and hospitals are served by a range of transport modes, including public transport;</p>
<p>by giving grant assistance to voluntary groups and organisations to provide community transport services in the more remote areas of Scotland, where there are no scheduled public transport services, or where they are very limited;</p>
<p>by providing guidance on the statutory responsibilities of education authorities to provide school transport, and importantly</p>
</blockquote></p>

  <p>the Transport (Scotland) Act 2005 requires Regional Transport Partnerships to draw up Regional Transport Strategies which will strengthen transport provision in their regions. These strategies will be at their best when they work in genuine partnerships with education and planning authorities, health boards and between constituent councils.</p>

  <p>The Executive and <strong></strong> sportscotland will be contributing &pound;49.5million (&pound;28.8million Exchequer and nearly &pound;21million from the Lottery Sports Fund) to the ten projects approved at Stage One of the National and Regional Sports Facilities Strategy. As stated in my answer to S2W-26373, the allocation to each project will be confirmed on approval of the related Stage Two application, the first of which is nearing approval.</p>

  <p>The three main reasons for changes in timescale can be summarised as:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>1. By virtue of their size, there are planning complexities which take time to work through (local consultation, traffic impact assessments etc).</p>
<p>2. Again, given the scale of these projects, the procurement process, including advertising through OJEU for design teams and contractors, adds time to the project programme. This is difficult to estimate at the outset and it is only after these projects are developed beyond the initial concept that it is possible to make a realistic estimate of completion dates.</p>
<p>3. &pound;50 million is a substantial contribution to the Strategy but the projects will cost some &pound;230 million in total and it takes time for the local authorities, in some cases working with partners, to put together full funding packages.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>*The precise amount of Exchequer and Lottery Sports Fund allocation to each project will be determined as the programme rolls out.</p>

  <p>1. Building for Sport Programme for elements of the project that were not eligible under the NRSFS</p>

  <p>2. Following the bid to bring the 2014 Commonwealth Games to Glasgow, the City of Edinburgh Council agreed to remove the velodrome element from their Hunters Hall project and agreement has been reached with Glasgow City Council for it to be added to the East End project.</p>
