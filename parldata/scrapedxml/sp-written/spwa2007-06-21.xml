  <p>This government believes that asylum seeker children have the same rights as other children. Ministers are currently examining what the Scottish government can do to ensure that the welfare and needs of asylum seeker children are paramount.</p>

  <p>The details of the March 2006 agreement with the Home Office were included in a Home Office press release in March 2006. They are as follows:</p>

  <p>the introduction of enhanced criminal record checks for front-line immigration enforcement staff working across the UK;</p>

  <p>the creation of a new post of Regional Director for Immigration in Scotland, with responsibility for co-ordinating and managing immigration arrangements in Scotland as part of a broader UK development;</p>

  <p>increasing the numbers of failed asylum seekers who leave the UK voluntarily through the enhanced voluntary returns package;</p>

  <p>a provision in the Police and Justice Bill for the independent inspection of the immigration service, and</p>

  <p>a review of family removals processes by the Home Office.</p>

  <p>working with the Scottish Executive on using the concept of a lead professional who takes responsibility for coordinating information from various health, education, police and social care representatives, which can then be provided to the Immigration Service to help it take informed decisions on the management and timing of the removal of failed asylum seeking families with children, and</p>

  <p>the introduction of new arrangements to handle complaints against immigration officers throughout the UK.</p>

  <p>We will hold the Border and Immigration Agency (BIA) to account for each and every element of that agreement, and will press for further progress where that it is required to advance and promote the interests of children, families and communities in Scotland affected by these issues.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for delivery of the outstanding strands of the agreement lies mainly with BIA and limited progress has been made since the previous administration reported to Parliament in March of this year.</p>

  <p>For example, the lead professional arrangements will not begin until the BIA &quot;case resolution&quot; review of legacy cases starts, which is expected to be in September. We will continue to work with BIA and Glasgow City Council to ensure the arrangements operate smoothly from the start.</p>

  <p>We will report to Parliament when key measures such as the enhanced background checking of all staff involved in family removals and the legislation to permit inspection of the removal process have been fully implemented.</p>

  <p>The central heating and Warm Deal programmes have already provided free central heating for 83,000 homes and free insulation for 317,000 homes in Scotland. The majority of these free installations have benefited people over 60 years of age.</p>

  <p>A formal review of the <em>Fuel Poverty Statement</em> is not required until August 2010. The contract for the delivery of current programmes runs till March 2008. I am open to suggestions as to how the effectiveness of these programmes in combating fuel poverty can be improved in future.</p>

  <p>If there is no gap between the completion of a degree and the start of a professional diploma course, and all other qualifying criteria are met, the individual may be eligible for an on-going exemption from council tax for the full period of study. However, if there is a break between the degree finishing and the diploma beginning (for example over the summer months), the individual may be liable for council tax in the intervening period. In this case, if relevant qualifying criteria are met, the individual will again become eligible for a council tax exemption when the diploma course begins.</p>

  <p>At present contemporary music will continue to be supported by the Scottish Arts Council which has a variety of grant funding that is available to musicians and music events.</p>

  <p>Contemporary music will also be supported this year by the Scottish Music Futures Fund of &pound;500,000, as announced in February 2007 by the then Deputy First Minister. This Fund was set up to support the commercial development and promotion of Scottish music talent. Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) is administering the fund for the whole of Scotland, in partnership with Scottish Enterprise and the Scottish Arts Council.</p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise and HIE are also helping SAC fund the formation and establishment of the Scottish Music Industry Association.</p>

  <p>The landscape of public sector delivery is crowded. As the Cabinet Minister for Finance and Sustainable Growth indicated on 24 May 2007, we intend a wide ranging review of this landscape so that we can, if necessary, make changes that both create efficiencies but more importantly improve the service provided to our customers - whether they be land managers, individuals, businesses or communities.</p>

  <p>To support this review, I held a meeting on 19 June 2007 with nine of the public sector bodies, including SEPA and SNH, sponsored by the Rural Affairs and Environment portfolio and asked them to draw up proposals to deliver a single rural and environmental delivery service, capable of implementation within a year. The aim is to build a simpler, more efficient delivery service, operating as a single body, but without any change in legislation. It should give better protection for the environment without unnecessary red tape or complexity.</p>

  <p>We also intend to involve stakeholders directly in the design process and to investigate options for improving alignment with local authority and other bodies outside the Rural Affairs and Environment portfolio.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive places great importance on Scotland&rsquo;s relationship with Europe. Careful consideration is currently being given to a strategy on Scottish Executive engagement with Europe which will set out how the Executive intends to secure a stronger voice in the EU by improving direct contact with the European Commission, develop closer relations with other Parliaments and press to take the lead in the EU fisheries negotiations. The Scottish Executive will announce details of its proposed strategy later in the year. The Executive is keen to see parliamentary scrutiny of EU legislative proposals reformed to improve the implementation and post implementation monitoring of European legislation so as to reduce burdens and ensure that the legislation introduced suits Scotland.</p>

  <p>Fire hydrants are installed by Scottish Water for the fire and rescue services. Any decision to undertake and fund research into the design of a vandal-proof locking mechanism for fire hydrants is a matter for Scottish Water and individual fire and rescue services.</p>

  <p>In particular areas of Glasgow, trialling of lockable hydrant caps has been undertaken, and new methods of protecting hydrants will continue. However, it has to be recognised that there is a fine balance to be struck between completely securing hydrants against vandals, and ensuring the fire and rescue services and water workers have the access they need. Previous actions taken by the city-wide partnership involving Glasgow City Council, the police, fire and rescue services and Scottish Water in hot spot areas has resulted in a reduction in such incidents.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is disappointed with the overall progress thus far and wants to see faster progress in the registration of private landlords across Scotland.</p>

  <p>The following table shows the number of applications for registration by private landlords and letting agents received by each local authority and the number of applications approved, as at 18 June 2007. Landlords and agents are required to register in each authority where they own or manage property, so these figures include multiple registrations for some individuals or organisations.</p>

  <p>Research into renewable energy is carried out at a number of institutions in Scotland. The Intermediary Technology Institute for Energy is able to include renewable energy in its research and development programmes, and renewable and other forms of clean energy will also be a focus of the proposed Energy Technologies Institute when it commissions research.</p>

  <p>There are no specific proposals at present for a centre for renewable energy research at Hunterston.</p>

  <p>I intend to convene a meeting with stakeholders as soon as possible to discuss issues around Scotland&rsquo;s representation on the world sporting stage. As part of this discussion we will consider the feasibility of a Scottish Olympic team. Once these discussions have taken place, I will be in a better position to estimate the costs of transferring athletes on UK programmes into a Scottish Olympic team. Scots already contribute to the funding that the UK Government provides to cover many of the costs of Olympic athletes through the tax system.</p>

  <p>The 2001 Census found that 20% of the Scottish population reported having a long-term illness, health condition or disability. The Scottish Household Survey 2005 showed a total of 18% of the population reporting a disability or long-term illness or both.</p>

  <p>We have no plans to make representations to Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government on this issue.</p>

  <p>The term &quot;Scottish Government&quot; can already be used to denote the Scottish Executive, which, in terms of Section 126 of the Scotland Act 1998, comprises the Scottish ministers and junior ministers appointed under Section 49 of that act, as well as the administration&rsquo;s civil servants. Indeed, it is often used informally, simply to promote understanding, as a readily understood description of what the Scottish Executive does.</p>

  <p>There is a legal obligation for students who became liable for the Graduate Endowment on or before 1 April 2007 to pay it and the Student Awards Agency for Scotland will continue to pursue those who have not paid.</p>

  <p>The aim of the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s annual teacher workforce planning exercise is to broadly match the supply and demand for teachers. Vacancies occur throughout the academic year. In order to make early progress on our early year and class size commitments I recently announced that authorities would be provided with additional funding to enable them to employ an additional 300 teachers.</p>
