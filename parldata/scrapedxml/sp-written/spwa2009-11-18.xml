  <p>In April 2008, the Scottish Government and COSLA made a joint commitment to community empowerment which culminated in the launch of the Community Empowerment Action Plan earlier this year.</p>

  <p>In relation to community councils, a Scottish Government Community Council Working Group (CCWG) was invited to identify expanded roles and responsibilities for community councils. They found that many, in discussion and agreement with their local authority, already undertook a variety of roles and responsibilities, including directing a portion of local spend, for example arranging minor repairs of certain local authority amenities, control of common good funds and community hall management/maintenance. However, in order for this to be more widespread, the capacity of community councils would require strengthening.</p>

  <p>As part of their remit, and to address the development of capacity, the CCWG produced a <em>Model Scheme of Establishment of Community Councils</em> and <em>Code of Conduct for Community Councillors</em>. Adoption of these documents is key to the building of capacity as they will help to establish greater consistency of operational arrangements and a culture of accountability.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is also funding a series of Community Council Pilot Projects. In partnership with COSLA and the Association of Scottish Community Councils (ASCC), we have developed to date three out of six and another three are in train. The pilots will focus on budget management, potential asset management and community council elections.</p>

  <p>Along with our key partners therefore, we are continuing to raise the profile and effectiveness of community councils throughout Scotland to enable them to build their capacity and to allow them to engage as key participants in local decision making and delivery.</p>

  <p>The working group has spent the last 18 months considering the issues in its remit, all of which centred around the removal of nuclear weapons from Scottish soil. The group&rsquo;s remit and its membership are listed in its report. The group met five times between April 2008 and April 2009. Minutes of each of these meetings have been placed on the working group section of the Scottish Government website. A final editing meeting took place on 22 June 2009.</p>

  <p>The total cost of running the working group was &pound;392.30. Group members were not paid expenses or reimbursed for their time.</p>

  <p>The government is grateful to the group for the degree of scrutiny and rigour that it has brought to the issues and the report will inform ongoing work on the National Conversation.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has today published both the working group&rsquo;s report and the Scottish Government&rsquo;s response. They are available on the Scottish Government website at:</p>

  <p>The responsibility for ensuring that staff in a fire and rescue service follow instructions, including the service&rsquo;s standard operating instructions for dealing with incidents, lies with that service.</p>

  <p>The Operational Assessment of Service Delivery review carried out by the Scottish Fire and Rescue Advisory Unit in 2008 identified that each service in Scotland had its own regime for reviewing incidents to learn lessons including debriefs.</p>

  <p>We would therefore expect that any failure to comply with standard operating procedures would be picked up by the service concerned during their debrief process and lessons learned implemented.</p>

  <p>The subject matter of the Race Relations Act 1976 (as amended) is reserved to the UK Government. Any change to such legislation is therefore a matter for the UK Government. Interpretation of race relations legislation is a matter for the tribunals or courts. The Deputy First Minister wrote to Ruth Kelly MP, then Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government on 26 June 2007, raising the concerns of Scottish Gypsies/Travellers around legal status. We have not had any response to that letter.</p>

  <p>However, the Scottish Government recognises Gypsies/Travellers as minority ethnic communities and we have stated this in our <em>Race Equality Scheme </em>and <em>Race Equality Statement </em>published on 8 December 2008. Therefore, for all practical purposes, Gypsies/Travellers count alongside all Scotland&rsquo;s minority ethnic communities in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s work to tackle racism and promote race equality. We also encourage other public bodies to adopt this approach.</p>

  <p>The exact number of patients who have myasthenia gravis in Scotland is not available centrally, however an estimate of this can be provided from a sample of Scottish General Practices. It is estimated that the number of patients who consulted a member of the practice team for myasthenia gravis in Scotland during 2005-06 to 2007-08 is 1,039.</p>

  <p>The majority of patients with myasthenia gravis are more likely to be treated in a primary care setting. A national estimate can be provided based on the number of patients consulting a general practitioner or practice-employed nurse for myasthenia at general practice participating in Practice Team Information (PTI). The PTI data are obtained from a sample of Scottish General Practice &ndash; the sample covers the full range of age, sex and deprivation classes existing in Scotland. The PTI sample is only representative at national level, so NHS board-level estimates cannot be provided.</p>

  <p>Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) has earmarked &pound;25 million for developing the Beechwood site in Inverness because of the wider economic benefits it sees for the region. Any applications for funding at other UHI Millennium Institute sites would be considered by the Scottish Funding Council (SFC) and HIE on a case-by-case basis. SFC and HIE are currently finalising a package of support for UHI as part of a prioritised development plan which UHI wishes to take forward. This includes match funding for infrastructure projects at Thurso and Oban which, when combined with European Regional Development and UHI funds, will result in an investment of around &pound;10 million.</p>

  <p>The SFC has also allocated UHI higher education formula capital funding of &pound;7.4 million for the period 2008-09 to 2010-11, and it is a matter for UHI to allocate this to its academic partners.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether a family home gaining protection under provisions of the draft Home Owner and Debtor Protection (Scotland) Bill could be put at risk in the case where sequestration follows a trust deed, due to the action of an objecting creditor or the trust deed proposal failing later in the process.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-11-18.S3W-28827.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80306" speakername="Fergus Ewing" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa1118.htm#8">

  <p>If measures contained in the Home Owner and Debtor Protection (Scotland) Bill were introduced, it would be possible for sequestration to follow a trust deed where either it fails to become protected due to the action of an objecting creditor or as a result of the trust deed failing later in the process. This is no different from the current legislation.</p>

  <p>Currently, the family home is at risk in all protected trust deeds and all sequestrations. The debtor would not be worse off under the provisions in the Home Owner and Debtor Protection (Scotland) Bill.</p>

  <p>By allowing a trust deed which excludes specific assets, in particular, the family home to become protected, the Home Owner and Debtor Protection (Scotland) Bill will introduce protection for the family home in those cases where exclusion is appropriate and does not disadvantage the creditors.</p>

  <p>Not all protected trust deeds will exclude the family home. This proposal will allow insolvency practitioners to assess the amount of the equity in the family home at the beginning of the trust deed and calculate its net worth to the general body of creditors after all costs are met. Where the equity is negligible or where the trust deed will produce a fair return to creditors from other assets or contributions, the trustee will have the flexibility to propose a trust deed to creditors which excluded the family home. The proposal in the bill does not change the ability of creditors to object to the trust deed. If creditors object, the debtor is no worse off than before and can suggest an alternative trust deed or apply for sequestration where the family home would be included.</p>

  <p>This measure will make use of the knowledge and professionalism of insolvency practitioners by allowing them to guide debtors into solutions that are better targeted to their circumstances. The debtor will know at the outset that their home is safe from unsecured creditors, as long as they continue to comply with the terms of their trust deed. However, failure to comply may result in their sequestration and their home would be at risk.</p>

  <p>In accordance with the Sewel Convention, the UK Parliament does not legislate with regard to devolved matters in Scotland without the consent of the Scottish Parliament.</p>

  <p>This is an important part of the devolution settlement, which acknowledges the special constitutional position of the Scottish Parliament and the democratic mandate conferred on this Parliament by the people of Scotland. In the view of the Scottish Government, the Sewel Convention will remain an essential part of the constitution of the UK for as long as the UK Parliament retains its current powers and functions in relation to Scotland.</p>

  <p>In the normal course of business, legislation on devolved matters should be scrutinised and determined in the Scottish Parliament. There may however be situations in which it is helpful and appropriate for legislation dealing with devolved matters to be taken forward at Westminster.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to assessing opportunities of this kind on their merits and to working closely and constructively with the UK Government, on a case-by-case basis, to deliver legislation which best meets Scotland&rsquo;s needs. The Scottish Government is equally committed to working with the UK Government to pursue opportunities to extend devolved competence.</p>

  <p>The formal consent of the Scottish Parliament is required in relation to all proposals for Westminster primary legislation on devolved matters, including alterations to devolved competence, in accordance with Chapter 9B of Standing Orders.</p>

  <p>Within the legislative programme announced today by the UK Government, we have identified and agreed a number of potential opportunities to legislate for the benefit of Scotland on matters that are within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament or which alter legislative or executive competence.</p>

  <p>The UK bills which we currently expect to give rise to Legislative Consent Motions (LCMs) in the Scottish Parliament cover:</p>

  <p>Bribery &ndash; to modernise the law on bribery by creating two new offences covering the bribery of foreign public officials and corporate liability for negligently failing to prevent bribery.</p>

  <p>Crime and Security - to extend regulation of the private security industry in Scotland in a manner which is consistent with analogous new provisions for England and Wales.</p>

  <p>Energy &ndash; to support movement by the UK to a low carbon economy, including through the funding of up to four Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) commercial-scale demonstration projects.</p>

  <p>Financial Services - to promote stability, efficiency and competition in financial markets, including through the provision to the public of advice and education in relation to financial matters.</p>

  <p>Flood and Water Management - to ensure clarity in relation to the regulation of cross border reservoirs, in the context of measures to better protect England and Wales from flooding.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will, in due course, lodge memoranda and motions for these bills, once they have been introduced in the UK Parliament. It will then be for the Scottish Parliament to determine whether to give or withhold consent.</p>

  <p>In addition, three UK bills are being carried over from the 2008-09 session. LCMs for these bills have already been lodged in the Scottish Parliament.</p>

  <p>Child Poverty &ndash; to provide statutory underpinning for the UK commitment to eradicate child poverty by 2020, and to place new duties on Scottish ministers in relation to the Scottish child poverty strategy; the new Child Poverty Commission (CPC), and the appointment of a commissioner to the CPC.</p>

  <p>Constitutional Reform and Governance - to place management of the Civil Service on a statutory basis and place a reporting duty on the First Minister in relation to the employment of Special Advisers. The bill also revokes the devolution of competence which enabled the Scottish Parliament to legislate in relation to human rights claims against the devolved administrations (&quot;Somerville&quot;). It maintains the effect of that legislation and extends similar arrangements to Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>

  <p>Equality &ndash; to revise and extend the law on discrimination and to enable Scottish ministers to make regulations to assist disabled people in the adaption of common parts of buildings. A Scottish Government consultation on the extension to Scotland of a further socio-economic duty concluded on 26 October 2009 and will inform consideration of this aspect to the bill.</p>

  <p>It is possible that further opportunities to legislate for Scotland by means of Legislative Consent Motion may occur in connection with other UK bills, including private member&rsquo;s bills. Any additional proposals of this kind, together with any relevant amendments to the government bills listed above, will be drawn to the attention of the Parliament as they arise, in line with the requirements of Standing Orders.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-11-18.S3W-28979.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80340" speakername="Richard Lochhead" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa1118.htm#17">

  <p>The Scottish Government supports the LEADER approach of local projects determined by local decision making. In relation to the proposed change to the delivery mechanism for community facilities support to LEADER, Local Action Groups (LAGs) support the strategic direction but have made representations concerning certain practical issues.</p>

  <p>My immediate aim is to support applicants and potential applicants. As a transitional arrangement, to ensure continuity of support for delivery of community facilities, new applications should continue to be submitted through the Rural Priorities framework. Appropriate procedures for handling these applications are currently being worked up by officials. Applicants who have already submitted applications through Rural Priorities will not require to submit a fresh application.</p>

  <p>The amount of funding to transfer and the timing has yet to be determined. It is intended that any funding transferred would be added to the current LEADER allocation. There is currently no intention to change the process under which LAGs administer LEADER funding.</p>

  <p>I also wish to address some of the match funding concerns of applicants during the current economic position and help get more good projects off the ground. I have therefore decided to increase the potential funding support available from LEADER for new projects from up to 50% to up to 90% from 1 January 2010. LAGs will still maintain the discretion to vary the rate as they see fit. Projects that have already been approved will not be able retrospectively to apply for an increased rate. I have decided that, initially, this increase should operate for a trial period of one year.</p>

  <p>All local authorities publish Local Housing Strategies (LHSs). They supplement their LHS with an annual Strategic Housing Investment Plan (SHIP), which sets out how they plan to prioritise for delivery of objectives set out in their LHS. These are the key documents for setting out priorities for Affordable Housing Investment Programme (AHIP) at the local level. The SHIPs provide the basis for targeting the AHIP and aid prioritisation where there are competing demands on resources. Any potential project for sheltered and very sheltered housing units would require to be identified through this process.</p>

  <p>As part of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s AHIP, we fund a range of provision for clients with particular housing needs. These include the provision of sheltered and very sheltered housing, the provision of supported accommodation and adaptations to allow people to stay in their own home when circumstances change. These new homes are generally required to meet Housing for Varying Needs standards, which ensure that the housing is designed to allow it to continue as far as possible to meet the changing needs of the occupant.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government also supports the Telecare initiative to enable people to live at home for longer as their needs change, and the Supporting People Demonstrator projects (through the Scottish Government Joint Improvement Team).</p>

  <p>The information is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968, as amended by the Community Care and Health (Scotland) Act 2002 (&quot;the 2002 Act&quot;), gives substantial and regular carers, whether or not the carer is a child, the right to request an assessment of their ability to care. The Children (Scotland) Act 1995, as amended by the 2002 Act, gives substantial and regular carers of a child with disabilities, whether or not the carer is a child, the right to request an assessment of their ability to care.</p>

  <p>The guidance on NHS Carer Information Strategies requires that they include measures to identify and support young carers. The strategies are funded by &pound;9 million over three years.</p>

  <p>The Carers Strategy for Scotland, which will include a substantial &quot;lift-out&quot; section on young carers, will highlight good practice in the carrying out of young carers&rsquo; assessments. It will promote the dovetailing of assessments under the <em>Getting it Right for Every Child </em>approach with young carer assessments. The strategy will also promote the identification of young carers, and support to young carers, in schools and other mainstream services. The strategy will be published in 2010.</p>
