  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, given the reported number of alcohol-related admissions, cirrhosis and deaths in the lowest two socioeconomic groups, what it has done to determine whether the individuals concerned have spent a lifetime in these groups or arrived in these groups as a result of excess alcohol consumption.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2011-03-09.S3W-39868.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80379" speakername="Shona Robison" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-11/wa0309.htm#1">

  <p>The Scottish Government does not hold any information relating to the socioeconomic history of those individuals who currently reside within the two lowest socioeconomic groups. To obtain this information would require longitudinal data that tracks individuals, their consumption and whether they have been admitted to hospital due to their alcohol use. There is currently no such data available in Scotland.</p>

  <p>We know that too many Scots across all socioeconomic groups are drinking too much, putting the health and well-being of themselves and their families at risk. That is why we are committed to providing preventative and specialist services for all those with alcohol problems, no matter what their socio-economic status.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises that there is no single measure which will help change Scotland&rsquo;s relationship with alcohol. That is why we have placed a whole population approach at the heart of our Alcohol Framework - an approach that can make a genuine cultural and attitudinal shift in the way all socioeconomic groups view, and consume alcohol in Scotland. Policies targeted at the population as a whole can have a protective effect on vulnerable populations whilst also reducing alcohol misuse across the whole population.</p>

  <p>This is why the Scottish Government remains committed to minimum pricing, as we believe that it would be an effective, efficient, targeted and proportionate measure that would make a real impact on consumption and harm across society.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2011-03-09.S3W-39869.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80396" speakername="Nicola Sturgeon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-11/wa0309.htm#1">

  <p>The updated <em>Sheffield Alcohol Pricing Model for Scotland</em> (published in April 2010) is based on actual 2008-09 price distribution data of off-trade alcohol in Scotland. Scottish survey consumption and off-sales price distribution data is not collated on an annual basis making it impossible to construct a robust time-series from 2005-06 to 2009-10. Survey consumption estimates are required to estimate the potential impact of any changes in price on health and other outcomes.</p>

  <p>The model does not extend to an analysis of the effect of price changes to real wages as the level of detail for wage data which would be required for the Sheffield model (at the individual level) is not available.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government remains open to new ideas and innovations. New and emerging technologies were included in a consultation that the Scottish Government ran in early 2010. The consultation was based on recommendations stemming from the independent report of the Burial and Cremation Review Group, whose remit was to look at existing death certification, burial and cremation practices in Scotland with a view to updating the law relating to burial, cremation and cemeteries, much of which dates back over 100 years.</p>

  <p>The Certification of Death (Scotland) Bill, introduced into the Scottish Parliament in October 2010, has been &quot;future-proofed&quot; to allow for new methods of disposal to be chosen in the future. There remains a requirement for any private company or crematorium facility to obtain approval that any new method of disposal meets the requirements of the law in general, including, for example, planning and environmental legislation.</p>

  <p>Scottish Government is aware of the work being undertaken by the Department of Health regarding cancer awareness and early diagnosis. The Scottish Cancer Taskforce, which oversees the commitments outlined in <em>Better Cancer Care: an Action Plan, </em> is already undertaking some work to increase early awareness of signs and symptoms of all cancers amongst both members of the public and the medical community, for example, through the early referral guidelines for general practitioners.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Public Services Ombudsman (SPSO) provides an independent and impartial service for handling complaints about public services in Scotland and no direct discussions have been held about specific complaints. Where the SPSO upholds a complaint, the complaints reviewer will issue a decision letter and follow up with the organisation to make sure that any recommendations made are carried out.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are expected to implement the recommendations made in the ombudsman&rsquo;s monthly reports and to take all necessary steps to ensure that similar circumstances do not recur.</p>

  <p>The ombudsman&rsquo;s reports and boards&rsquo; responses are considered by the Scottish Government<em> </em>to ensure that all necessary action and learning takes place at local and national level.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government fully recognises the importance of good quality care for patients in all clinical settings. Ensuring the quality of care for individual patients is the responsibility of NHS boards. There are a number of national initiatives to support NHS boards to improve the quality of care patients receive.</p>

  <p>We are also providing the centre with funding to support the delivery of &quot;Take Note&quot; &ndash; the national advocacy service for children and young people who may need support, including representation, when they are appealing to the Additional Support Needs Tribunal for Scotland.

  <p>Section 64 (6) (a) of the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 requires Scottish ministers to publish a report setting out the measures that they intend to take to reduce emissions from living accommodation. This requirement has already been fulfilled by the publication in October 2010 of the Energy Efficiency Action Plan and in November 2010 of the draft Report on Proposals and Policies. Both reports include information on current and planned policies to reduce emissions from living accommodation and to improve the energy efficiency of our homes and communities.</p>

  <p>Section 64 (6) (b) of this act requires Scottish ministers to set out when they intend to make provision in respect of certain aspects of the use of regulation making powers under section 64, within 12 months of their commencement. This report will be published by the end of March 2011.</p>

  <p>The new Additional Support Needs National Advocacy Service will be delivered by a partnership between Barnardo&rsquo;s and the Scottish Child Law Centre.</p>

  <p>Barnardo&rsquo;s, which submitted the application on behalf of the partners, was informed that the application had been successful on 15 October 2010. A short introductory meeting was held with Barnardo&rsquo;s and the Scottish Child Law Centre on 21 October 2010 to provide feedback on the application, meet key individuals who would be involved in delivering the service and discuss key actions in disseminating information. The Scottish Government was represented by Rachel Sunderland.</p>

  <p>Meeting participants recognised that whilst it was important to move quickly in establishing the new service it was essential that information remained confidential until all applicants had been informed of the outcome. A timetable for disseminating information was therefore provisionally agreed and key contacts identified in the event of further queries. Discussion also focused on the importance of ensuring minimal disruption in the service provided to parents and young people during the transition to the new national advocacy service. It was agreed that early meetings between Barnardo&rsquo;s, the Scottish Child Law Centre and organisations currently providing advocacy would be helpful.</p>

  <p>For the 2007-13 period, European Structural Funds in Scotland comprise four programmes: the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) in each of the Highlands and Islands and in Lowlands and Uplands programming areas.</p>

  <p>The programmes have been &quot;interrupted&quot; not &quot;suspended&quot;. An &quot;interruption&quot; is a temporary arrangement, whereas a &quot;suspension&quot; is of a more permanent nature.</p>

  <p>Individual projects are not affected by the suspension of payments to the Scottish Government by the European Commission. The interruption refers to the reimbursement of Structural Funds payments by the Commission to the Scottish Government. The Scottish Government will continue to meet all eligible claims by projects.</p>

  <p>The ERDF programmes were officially interrupted by the European Commission on 22 December 2010 and this was the point at which the Scottish Government was formally made aware that funds were going to be temporarily withheld.</p>

  <p>The ESF programmes were officially interrupted by the European Commission on 15 February 2011; again, this was the point at which the Scottish Government was formally made aware that funds were going to be temporarily withheld.</p>

  <p>The European Commission imposed the interruptions as, in its view, the Scottish Government had not carried out sufficient management and control checks prior to its payment declaration in December 2009.</p>

  <p>The European Commission has confirmed that the interruptions will be lifted when the Scottish Government provides sufficient evidence that an increased level of management and control checks have been undertaken.</p>

  <p>The interruption process, whilst temporary in nature, takes time to resolve. To ensure that this is progressed, the Scottish Government provided the European Commission with additional evidence on the 17 February 2011 and again on 23 February 2011.</p>

  <p>We intend that a complete response to the interruptions will be sent to the Commission by Easter. Subject to the Commission&rsquo;s timetable, it is anticipated that the interruptions will be lifted by the summer.</p>

  <p>Immunological conditions such as lupus are covered in the trainee GP curriculum and are assessed as part of the GP e-portfolio, a training resource overseen by the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP).</p>

  <p>Existing GPs are contractually committed to an annual educational appraisal and to developing their own learning needs. If a GP has recognised lupus as a learning need, this should form part of their Personal Education Plan.</p>

  <p>We are committed to improving the quality and accessibility of information that is available to people and their carers throughout their care journey, both to raise awareness of individual conditions, and to support their effective diagnosis and management. We recognise the importance of this approach in relation to lupus, given its higher prevalence in women from minority ethnic backgrounds.</p>

  <p>NHS Inform is our nationally co-ordinated approach to the provision of health and health service information. It is intended as a first point of contact for trusted quality assured health information for the public, patients and carers in Scotland.</p>

  <p>NHS Inform provides information on the symptoms, diagnosis and treatment of lupus which can be accessed at <a href="http://www.nhsinform.co.uk/health-library/articles/l/lupus/introduction.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.nhsinform.co.uk/health-library/articles/l/lupus/introduction.aspx</a>.</p>

  <p>Consumer Focus Scotland has produced a DVD which provides information in a variety of languages on how to access the health service. This is also available via <a href="http://www.nhsinform.com" target="_blank">www.nhsinform.com</a>.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government Equalities and Planning Directorate is leading on the development of a national Translation, Interpreting and Communications Support Strategy, in partnership with NHS boards, to improve the provision of accessible information and communication support services for speakers of different languages, people with literacy problems and people with other communication difficulties.</p>

  <p>We are always willing to consider proposals for providing pump-priming funding for Managed Clinical Networks.</p>

  <p>Effective management of lupus relies on the expertise of many specialists, including rheumatologists, nephrologists, dermatologists, neurologists, gastroenterologists, respiratory physicians and cardiologists, and their respective supporting investigative and administrative teams. Clinicians from across Scotland have therefore formed the Scottish Lupus Exchange (SLEx). It brings together the clinicians in the various disciplines to ensure that, through working collaboratively, people living with lupus receive the care and support they need as close to home as possible. The SLEx could well form the core of a lupus Managed Clinical Network, with suitable third sector representation.</p>

  <p>We have provided pump priming funding to support the development of a rheumatology Managed Clinical Network in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. While its initial focus will be on Rheumatoid Arthritis, we expect that, over time, its work will extend to other conditions, including lupus.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what changes it has made to the approach to child heath development since the publication of Fair Society, Health Lives: The Marmot Review in February 2010.</p>

  <p>The Marmot report was based on a review for the Department of Health on health inequalities in England but the Scottish Government is also committed to giving children in Scotland the best possible start in life and has identified, and is already tackling in Scotland, many of the issues raised in the Marmot Review.</p>

  <p>The <em>Early Years Framework</em> was published in December 2008, in recognition of the key importance of the early years of life in determining life chances and outcomes, including health outcomes. Along with <em>Equally Well</em> and <em>Achieving our Potential,</em> it forms part of a coherent approach to addressing disadvantage and breaking the intergenerational cycles of inequalities.</p>

  <p>The <em>Early Years Framework</em> highlights the importance of all national and local agencies, the third sector and independent sector working together to deliver improved outcomes for our children.</p>

  <p>In June 2010, we published the review of <em>Equally Well</em>, the report of the Scottish Task Force on Health Inequalities. This review reported on the implementation of <em>Equally Well</em>, the <em>Early Years Framework</em><strong> </strong>and<strong> </strong><em>Achieving our Potential - </em>the government&rsquo;s framework for tackling poverty. In relation to child health development the review recommended that an early years pathfinder approach should be established to promote the integration of front-line services, taking a whole-systems approach to implement rapid change in a community planning partnership area. The review also stressed the importance of NHS boards ensuring the provision of healthcare and health improvement services to looked after children and agreed to endorse the Looked After Children and Young People Strategic Implementation group programme of work to build greater cooperation between partners and a shared sense of responsibility for the outcomes of looked after children. In addition, the review agreed on the importance of developing the focus on health and wellbeing in the Curriculum for Excellence, and also noted the importance of literacy and numeracy skills in increasing young people&rsquo;s long-term prospects.</p>

  <p>Within the measurement framework for the <em>Healthcare Quality Strategy</em>, a set of high-level outcome indicators is being developed to provide evidence of progress towards the three over-arching Quality Ambitions. Work is underway to include in this set an indicator relating to Early Years.</p>

  <p>In January this year we launched <em>A New Look at Hall 4 - The Early Years &ndash; Good Health for Every Child</em> which recommends that: all children should have a Named Person; all children should have a Health Plan Indicator &ndash; Core or Additional &ndash; by the age of six months; a 24-30 month review should be carried out for all children; and health improvement materials should be promoted to provide parents/carers with appropriate and tailored information.</p>

  <p>We also launched a refreshed <em>Framework for Maternity Care</em> together with outcome focused evidence into action guidance for NHS boards in January this year. These are in line with the recommendation in the Marmot review that universal services should be appropriate and proportionate so as to address the social gradient nature of antenatal health inequalities and the emphasis on the importance of improving access to healthcare amongst those groups who most need it but often benefit least from it.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the <em>Maternal and Infant Nutrition Framework</em> was also launched which has an emphasis on maternal nutrition for the first time and the importance of good nutrition in providing the best start in life.</p>

  <p>NHS boards identify, via an alert on their accident and emergency (A&amp;E) information systems, patients who are frequent attenders (this includes mental health presentations). They may then undertake one or more of the following steps:</p>

  <p>request a psychiatric assessment to be undertaken by the mental health team while the patient is in the department &ndash; this could be undertaken by the liaison service, crisis service or community mental health team.

  <p>No specific guidance has been issued. However, we recognise the importance of partnership working to improve employability and job opportunities for all those with a mental health problem, including veterans.</p>

  <p>We are currently funding NHS Health Scotland to deliver a range of mental health improvement initiatives across Scotland through the <em>Scottish Centre for Healthy Working Lives.</em> These programmes are designed to encourage employers to recognise the importance of positive mental health and wellbeing and the impact that it has on overall productivity, as well as promoting the benefits of a positive workplace culture by highlighting how good procedures and practices can both prevent staff developing mental ill-health and support those who may already be suffering from mental ill-health. More information can be found at <a href="http://www.healthyworkinglives.com/" target="_blank">http://www.healthyworkinglives.com/</a>.</p>

  <p>The Employability Learning network is a cross government initiative supporting local employability partnerships and wider Community Planning partners to improve how employability is delivered throughout Scotland. A website <a href="http://www.employabilityinscotland.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.employabilityinscotland.com/home.aspx</a> has been developed as a practical guide for anyone involved in employability in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government, through the Scottish Mental Health and Employment Network, produced leaflets tailored for individuals, employers and health professionals on their roles and responsibilities as well as support available in helping people experiencing mental health illness who wanted to return to work.

  <p>Prescription charges will be abolished on 1 April this year, subject to the will of the Scottish Parliament. Whilst children are themselves already exempt from paying prescription charges, we estimate that around 600,000 adults living in families with an annual income of less than &pound;16,000 will benefit from the abolition of prescription charges when they collect prescription medication.</p>

  <p>In addition, West Lothian Council has recently been given permission to re-allocate &pound;40,000 of its Bathgate TCRF award towards technical CCTV infrastructure, following the recommendations of a feasibility study which ruled out the sustainability of a wi-fi system in the town centre. Moray Council has been given permission to re-allocate &pound;60,000 underspend towards public realm improvements. And Glasgow City Council has been given permission to re-allocate &pound;30,000 of underspend towards cleaning the fascia of Govan underground station.</p>

  <p>We are carrying out an update exercise over the course of this month and will continue to monitor project progress until all the remaining committed TCRF monies are spent.</p>

  <p>It is the role of the governing body, in this instance, Snowsport Scotland, to ensure that skiers and snowboarders are aware of the protection benefits of helmets when participating in their sport. The International Ski Federation strongly recommends the use of helmets for recreational skiing, and Snowsports Scotland supports this advice. Helmets are already compulsory in competitions.</p>
