  <p>There is no official poverty line as poverty is a multi-dimensional concept which relates to more than just income alone.</p>

  <p>The households below average income series reports numbers of households below various relative and absolute low income thresholds, both before housing costs (BHC) and after housing costs (AHC). The main thresholds reported are 60% of the median of the relevant household income (BHC or AHC) for Great Britain. The relative threshold is 60% of median GB income in the current year; the absolute threshold is 60% of median Great Britain income in 1996-97, uprated to remove the effects of inflation. The thresholds are based on equivalised income (see below), and therefore the monetary value of the thresholds varies according to the composition of the household. The following table presents the monetary values of these main thresholds for a selection of household types.</p>

  <p>Note: 1. The relative threshold compares against median income in the same year. The absolute threshold compares against median income in the baseline year, 1996-97, up rated to remove the effects of inflation.</p>

  <p>In order to allow comparisons of living standards between different household types, income is adjusted to take into account variations in the size and composition of the household in a process known as equivalisation. Further information can be found about equivalisation in the Department for Work and Pensions <em>Households Below Average Income, An analysis of the income distribution 1994-95-2003-04</em> publication <a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/hbai/hbai2004/contents.asp" target="_blank">http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/hbai/hbai2004/contents.asp</a>.</p>

  <p>Values for other household types can be calculated using the equivalence scales variants which are set out in Appendix 2 of DWP&rsquo;s publication: <a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/hbai/hbai2004/pdf_files/appendices/appendix_2_hbai05.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/hbai/hbai2004/pdf_files/appendices/appendix_2_hbai05.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p>NHS treatment for unintentional injuries may be provided in a number of health settings including general practice, minor injury departments, A&amp;E departments and as an in-patient in a hospital. Data available nationally at a level of detail that would allow the cause of the injury (e.g. road traffic accident) to be identified are only available for those patients admitted as an in-patient to a hospital. In general, it is likely that patients admitted to hospital will have a more serious injury than those treated in general practice, minor injury departments or within A&amp;E departments.</p>

  <p>Information on the number of those admitted as an in-patient to hospital in the period 1998-99 to 2003-04 by NHS Board of Residence is shown in the following table.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-08-02.S2W-17800.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80018" speakername="Malcolm Chisholm" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa0802.htm#11">

  <p>The Independent Expert Group suggested a &quot;precautionary approach&quot; should be adopted for mobile telecommunications technology and made 34 specific recommendations. The Government response to the recommendation of the Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones and Health was issued at the same time as the publication of the report in May 2000, and is still available on the Department of Health website: <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/PublicationsAndStatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidanceArticle/fs/en?CONTENT_ID=4009677&amp;chk=OoEUlX" target="_blank">http://www.dh.gov.uk/PublicationsAndStatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidanceArticle/fs/en?<br /> CONTENT_ID=4009677&amp;chk=OoEUlX</a> .</p>

  <p>Precautionary advice was also subsequently issued in leaflets that provided information for the public about mobile phone technologies. Two leaflets, <em>Mobile Phone Base Stations</em> and <em>Health and Mobile Phones</em> were published jointly by the Department of Health, the Scottish Executive, the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Executive, and are still available.</p>

  <p>Many of the recommendations of the expert group could be considered as precautionary advice, and were directed at Government, industry and the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB - now the Radiation Protection Division of the Health Protection Agency). A number of measures were put in place to meet these recommendations. These measures were described, and progress on implementing them was reviewed by the NRPB in the publication Mobile Phones and Health 2004 (Volume 15 No 5 2004). This publication is also available from the web at:</p>

  <p>National Planning Policy Guideline 19: Radio Telecommunications mentions specific measures, including:</p>

  <p>Emissions from mobile phone base stations to meet the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) guidelines for public exposure as expressed in the limits set in the EU Council recommendation of 12 July 1999 on the limitation of exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields.</p>

  <p>Creation of a national database giving details of all base stations and their emissions. The database was established and maintained by the Radiocommunications Agency and is now managed by Ofcom and is accessible to the public via the Ofcom website: <a href="http://www.sitefinder.radio.gov.uk" target="_blank">http://www.sitefinder.radio.gov.uk/</a></p>

  <p>An independent audit of emissions around base stations (masts) to give the public confidence that base stations do not exceed the ICNIRP public exposure guidelines. The surveys were initially undertaken by the Radiocommunications Agency and again have been transferred to Ofcom. All measurements so far show emissions to be at most hundreds of times below the ICNIRP guidelines and usually thousands of times below these levels. Further information is available on the Ofcom website: <a href="http://www.ofcom.org.uk/advice/telecoms_ifc/telephony_con_guides/mob_phone_base_stat" target="_blank">http://www.ofcom.org.uk/advice/telecoms_ifc/telephony_con_guides/mob_phone_base_stat/</a></p>

  <p>Commissioning a comprehensive programme of further research on health matters. The Mobile Telecommunications and Health Research Programme has been running for several years now and further information is available at <a href="http://www.mthr.org.uk" target="_blank">www.mthr.org.uk</a>.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-08-02.S2W-17801.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80018" speakername="Malcolm Chisholm" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa0802.htm#11">

  <p>The answer to question S2W-17800 on 2 August 2005 referred to the recommendations of the Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones (IEGMP), the Government response and how the former have been reviewed by the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB &ndash; now the Radiation Protection Division of the Health Protection Agency).</p>

  <p>The IEGMP recommendations were either for Government, industry or the NRPB and were essentially practical, achievable measures that were voluntary and not statutory. As far as we are aware, from contact with the relevant interests, the agreed precautionary measures in relation to masts/base stations, following on from the Government response to IEGMP, are being adhered to.</p>

  <p>The main issue for many communities with regard to precautionary measures will be whether the emissions from a mobile phone mast/base station meet the recommended International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) guidelines for public exposure as expressed in the limits set in the EU Council recommendation of 12 July 1999 on the limitation of exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields. As the answer to S2W-17800 indicated, the audit by Ofcom shows emission levels to be hundreds or thousands of times lower than the guideline levels. It would be open to individuals or communities to fund their own survey of emissions from a particular mast if Ofcom were unable to add it to their audit programme.</p>
