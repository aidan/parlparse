  <p>There are no Scottish Executive estimates of the number of guns illegally held in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Firearms legislation is reserved and we will continue to work with the UK Government to safeguard the public against gun crime. Chapter 8 of the Criminal Justice Bill currently before the UK Parliament contains provisions to tighten further the law in relation to illegal firearms. The recent firearms amnesty which took place between 31 March and 30 April 2003 resulted in 3,993 firearms being removed from circulation in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The independent valuations of the council housing stock in Western Isles and Argyll and Bute have not been finalised and it would not be appropriate to provide an estimate of the value at this stage.</p>

  <p>Shetland Islands Council and Shetland Homes issued a joint statement in September 2002 indicating that they did not wish to progress the stock transfer that they had been pursuing at that time. Discussions are continuing between the Executive and Communities Scotland and the council regarding the future of its housing stock.</p>

  <p>In his letter of 7 April 2003 to the Lord Advocate, Mr McKie set out new information which he considered was relevant to his belief that there had been an attempt to pervert the course of justice in connection with the perjury case against his daughter Shirley McKie. The information was passed to the Complaints and Discipline Branch of Strathclyde Police, who carried out the investigation on behalf of the Lord Advocate. There was nothing in this letter to indicate that he was in possession of any further relevant information in addition to that detailed in the letter. It was not, therefore, considered necessary to interview Mr McKie.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive provides funding directly to local authorities in this area. It is providing &#163;9 million in 2003-04 to support local authorities to prepare and implement accessibility strategies under the Education (Disability Strategies and Pupils&#8217; Educational Records) (Scotland) Act 2002. Accessibility strategies plan to improve access, over time, to the curriculum, to the physical environment and to school information for pupils with disabilities. Funding will increase to &#163;17 million in 2004-05 and 2005-06.</p>

  <p>Inclusion programme funding is also available to local authorities, which have been allocated &#163;20 million in 2003-04, &#163;25 million in 2004-05 and &#163;25 million in 2005-06. This funding helps to support additional costs of including children with special educational needs, who may have disabilities, in mainstream schools.</p>

  <p>This is in addition to the substantial general capital resources which authorities have at their disposal for work on school buildings, including improvements to access and facilities, according to authorities&#8217; priorities. These resources include the capital allocations under which authorities spend in the region of &#163;125 million a year on school buildings, and the schools fund capital grant for improvements to the school estate amounting to &#163;36.7 million in the current financial year and rising to &#163;76.7 million in 2004-05. The Scottish Executive has also announced financial support for authorities for school public private partnerships projects with a capital value of &#163;2 billion which will contribute to the replacement and refurbishment of schools across Scotland, including appropriate access requirements.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether, as stated by COSLA, any regeneration opportunities for housing, commercial and industrial developments are being adversely affected in Glasgow due to funding difficulties encountered by Scottish Water in providing water and waste removal services and, if so, what plans it has to address planning and co-ordination issues between its departments and Scottish Water.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2003-11-04.15.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80032" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-03/wa1104.htm#13">

  <p>As my answer to question S2W-3243 on 3 November 2003 makes clear, record levels of funding are being made by Scottish Water to begin redressing decades of underfunding.</p>

  <p>The Executive is currently working with a range of stakeholders to formulate future investment plans for Scottish Water. To this end, a working group has been established as part of the wider Quality and Standards III process. It includes representatives from Scottish Water, COSLA, Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the building industry, and officials from a number of areas within the Executive. Among other issues, it is seeking to improve collective understanding of the nature and scale of such constraints, and to develop options to address constraints.</p>

  <p>Dealing with constraints as they arise is of course an operational matter for Scottish Water. Scottish Water is working very hard with all local authorities and its environmental regulator to ensure that all parties have a much better understanding of those areas affected by development constraints, and to look creatively for technical and other options for resolving these issues.</p>

  <p>The main allocations of funding to local authorities and health boards do not allocate resources specifically to tackle deprivation, although relative deprivation between areas is one of the factors used to construct the formulae.</p>

  <p>However, there are several Executive funding streams that target aspects of deprivation. These include funding for social inclusion partnerships, the changing children&#8217;s services fund, the rough sleepers initiative, health improvement fund and education maintenance allowances.</p>

  <p>The Executive is currently evaluating the effectiveness of early years policies, including the expenditure on specific programmes such as Sure Start and the Changing Children&#8217;s Services Fund that have a strong social inclusion element.</p>

  <p>More generally, the Executive is considering how to improve its collection and presentation of information on cross-cutting priorities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is working with a number of partners including schools and Volunteer Development Scotland to develop guidance for schools which are developing volunteering programmes for their pupils. This guidance will encourage and support good practice and will provide advice on ensuring there are sound procedures in place to ensure that pupils are safe and can enjoy a positive experience of volunteering. The guidance is being developed in the context of the National Priorities in Education and the Executive&#8217;s commitment to teach children and young people the responsibilities and duties of citizenship.</p>

  <p>In addition, we promote an active role for pupils in developing the ethos of their schools. The Discipline Task Group report <em>Better Behaviour &#8211; Better Learning</em> (2001) made 36 recommendations. Among these was a recommendation that schools promote buddying and mentoring schemes by which older pupils volunteer to support their younger peers and receive training and support to do so. Local authorities&#8217; reports to the Executive on implementation of <em>Better Behaviour &#8211; Better Learning</em> shows implementation of this recommendation has been positive throughout Scotland. Authorities will continue to be encouraged to support these initiatives within their programmes to promote positive behaviour, for which the Executive provides &#163;10 million a year.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is also developing a strategy to support volunteering through a strategic framework for volunteer development in Scotland. This will progress support for volunteering as a cross-cutting issue for policy development and implementation, including the promotion of volunteering among young people through school and community settings. Publication is expected early in 2004.</p>
