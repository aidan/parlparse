  <p>In addition to the Domestic Abuse Service Development Fund, details of which I announced on 27 October 1999, there are other sources of funding for domestic abuse projects. For example, a number of projects are being funded through the Social Inclusion Partnerships that target issues concerning violence against women. In the current financial year &pound;982,940 has been allocated for such projects. Local authorities financial settlement is the most generous for seven years with spending set to rise by &pound;840 million over the next three years to 2001-02. Next year local authority spending (GSE) is set to rise by 3.6% with the total available for Social Work Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE) rising by nearly 4%.</p>

  <p>The Healthy Homes Initiative reflects our commitment to tackling dampness and is a national priority for housing investment. Under our programme substantial resources are available through capital allocations to local authorities for their own stock and for improvement and repairs grants in the private sector. New Housing Partnerships will also result in significant improvements in stock condition. The Warm Deal is central to the Initiative and 100,000 low-income households will benefit during the lifetime of this Administration.</p>

  <p>As indicated in my reply of 29 October to Duncan Hamilton (S1W-2026), the projected expenditure for future years cannot be predicted with any accuracy because the number and demands of the cases handled by the Office determine costs.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has plans to amend the Sheriff Courts (Scotland) Act (1971) to ensure that in establishing and maintaining such Courts, due regard is paid to &quot;the desirability, the expense and inconvenience occasioned to those directly involved&quot; as is required of local authorities in connection with District Courts in the Local Government (Scotland) Act (1994).</p>

  <p>I have no plans to propose amendment of the legislation. Any proposals to change the current arrangements for the provision of Sheriff Courts would require to be approved by the Parliament. Before bringing the appropriate Order before the Parliament, Ministers would carefully consider the full implications for Court users and communities of any proposed change in arrangements.</p>

  <p>Under the terms of the Parole Board (Scotland) Rules 1993, the Board considers cases of long term and adult mandatory life prisoners in private. The purpose of the Board's consideration is to establish whether the release of a prisoner on licence is acceptable in terms of risk to the public. The Board does not consider how long a prisoner should serve on grounds of punishment and deterrence. If the family of a victim so request, they will be told when a prisoner is to be considered for release by the Board. The family may also submit their views for consideration by the Board. I have no plans to change these arrangements which allow the views of the families to be considered.</p>

  <p>When the Board is sitting as a Tribunal to consider whether a designated life prisoner should be released, it may authorise any person to attend a hearing. This is a matter for the Tribunal to consider in relation to an individual case and I have no plans to change this arrangement.</p>

  <p>We fully appreciate the significance of Scotland&#8217;s shipping heritage and have to date designated up to five historic wrecks lying in Scottish waters under the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973. Though the responsibility of conservation of historic vessels lies with their owners, Historic Scotland, an Agency of the Scottish Executive, can give practical advice on conservation issues and will shortly be publishing a policy paper on the protection of underwater archaeology.</p>

  <p>The Ministry of Defence, emergency services, local authorities and health boards have well established procedures in place for any kind of emergency occurring at submarine bases. These are regularly rehearsed, reviewed and revised to take account of any new threats or issues. Specific responsibility for addressing Y2000 computer issues in relation to the Trident base is, however, a matter for the Secretary of State for Defence.</p>
