  <p>The report concerned was produced by the Ambulance Service Association and is based on statistical evidence from Ambulance Services in England and Wales between 1991-92 and 1994-95. In Scotland the occupational health and safety service strategy <i>Towards a Safer Healthier Workplace,</i> which was published in December 1999, makes clear that NHS in Scotland organisations must develop policies aimed at reducing costs associated with OHSS issues, including sickness absence, injury benefits claims, and early retirement costs due to illness, accidents and injury.</p>

  <p>Our aim is to provide security of employment and to retain experienced officers in useful employment within the service.</p>

  <p>The Joint Future Group has identified and agreed a list of measures which all local authorities, health boards and NHS trusts should put in place to deliver effective, integrated services and has set deadlines by which this should be done. We are currently consulting on the group&#8217;s report.</p>

  <p>The Scottish health plan, <i>Our National Health</i>, published on 14 December, commits the Executive to introducing the Joint Future Group&#8217;s recommendations on joint resourcing and joint management, and to legislating if necessary to remove any remaining barriers to joint working between the NHS, social work and housing departments.</p>

  <p><i>Our National Health</i> also makes clear that local authorities will have a strong voice on the new Unified NHS Boards through membership of the boards. It also commits NHS Boards to joint planning with local authorities in their areas, so that health planning and community planning are integrated. The Health Plan commits NHS Boards to work with local authorities and other partners to understand and respond to the needs of patients and communities, to improve the health of their communities and to deliver healthcare and other related services.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive will monitor the progress of NHS bodies and local authorities in working together at local level to make these developments happen.</p>

  <p>Through its Digital Scotland initiative, the Scottish Executive is working towards pervasive and affordable access to the web for people in Scotland. We are committed to achieving universal access to the web by 2005. We are promoting digital inclusion in Social Inclusion Partnerships, including establishing a network of locally based ICT champions and supporting ICT facilities, in consultation with local communities and partners.</p>

  <p>Specific actions to ensure all people may take advantage of the opportunities that ICTs present are the Community Access to Lifelong Learning (CALL) programme and the learndirect<i> </i>scotland initiative.</p>

  <p>The CALL programme is funded by the New Opportunities Fund. CALL has been established to engage more adults in learning at a community level by developing support for ICT access to information and learning opportunities. Some &#163;23 million has been earmarked for spending in Scotland.</p>

  <p>People need to learn how to use new technology effectively if they are to feel comfortable with it and reap the benefits it offers. To that end, anyone, anywhere in Scotland can now get access to learning at a time and a place to suit them. The Executive&#8217;s flagship for lifelong learning &#8211; learndirect<i> </i>scotland - has been operational since October, simplifying access to learning at all levels. Through its services anyone aged 18 or over can also register for an Individual Learning Account to help them pay for the learning they do. Discounts of 80% are available for basic IT skills courses to help adults grasp and exploit the opportunities that ICT presents.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to major improvements in the ICT infrastructure in schools. Over &#163;80 million has been made available to Scottish local authorities to develop the National Grid for Learning in schools which will ensure that all school pupils will have access to computers, the Internet and e-mail. Internet access is already available in 49% of primary schools and 97% of secondary schools, compared to 22% and 73% in 1998, and all schools will be connected by 2002.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is also looking at how to provide broadband links to Scottish schools, so that pupils and teachers everywhere in the country will be able to benefit from equal access to e-mail, videoconferencing, high-quality educational materials and other resources and services.</p>

  <p>In February 2000, Henry McLeish launched a series of initiatives to accelerate the uptake of e-commerce by Scottish businesses. These were the First Steps into E-Commerce workshops, Digital Advantage workshops, Ecomm2000 consultancy packages, a national e-promotion campaign and the creation of a Director of E-Commerce at Scottish Enterprise. Scottish Enterprise also runs a Winners at the Web competition to highlight examples of best practice, organises high profile events such as E-Commerce week and offers advice and signposting through its own website. Highlands and Islands Enterprise offers a similar range of assistance including advice, seminars and workshops.</p>

  <p>The Executive was involved in the establishment of 10 local support centres in Scotland which provide the delivery mechanism for these initiatives. Most are now integrated within the Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise networks.</p>

  <p>The 1999 report for Dundee City Council examined a range of pollutant levels around the site of the former incinerator at Baldovie, which closed in 1996. The report concluded that there was no evidence of gross pollution associated with the plant. The new incinerator at Baldovie, which began operating last year, is regulated by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA).</p>

  <p>Monitoring of the site at and around the incinerator at Baldovie is carried out by a specialist firm for the plant operator. The Scottish Executive is satisfied that the Scottish Environment Protection Agency ensures that the correct methodology is used for taking these measurements and that the firm undertaking the work is suitably qualified. Monitoring at Baldovie shows that dioxin levels are well within the limits imposed in SEPA&#8217;s authorisation.</p>
