  <p>Aggregates tax is a reserved matter and falls under the responsibility of HM Treasury. I am content that planning and environmental controls are adequate for quarrying. These include a range of enforcement powers available to planning authorities if extractions are taking place without the benefit of planning permission. If materials are being sold commercially without payment of the aggregates tax, then this is a matter for HM Customs and Excise.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is developing a Scottish public records strategy which will take a fundamental look at existing legislation, guidance, standards and practices relating to Scottish public records, together with the roles and functions of the key stakeholders and how they are resourced. As a first step, officials are making arrangements to hold a series of informal workshops with representatives of key stakeholders (public authorities, users of records and archives, records managers and archivists, etc). The first of these will take place in November and the outcome of the workshops will form the basis of a formal consultation exercise in 2004.</p>

  <p>When completed, the strategy will<em> </em>set out measures for managing Scottish public records in the 21st century, ensuring that the appropriate records are kept, maintained, preserved and are accessible to the public. It will seek to improve the quality and consistency of records management and archive arrangements across the public sector. This should help to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of authorities, enabling them to meet their legal and other obligations more easily. The strategy will also seek to promote archives and improve their accessibility. Interest in genealogical tourism and historical research has been growing significantly in recent years, with benefits for the Scottish economy generally. Efficient and comprehensive archive services are essential to meet this demand.</p>

  <p>Over 90% of patients&#8217; contact with the NHS begins and ends in primary care. An effective and efficient primary care service is essential for the health needs of the people of Scotland. The new GMS contract will help to improve the range and quality of services available to patients through a number of measures.</p>

  <p>Resources will increase by 33% over three years. That means an extra &#163;142 million being invested in primary care. GPs will have extra money to offer a range of enhanced services which should mean that patients will find it easier to access more services nearer their home, instead of being required to travel to the local hospital for treatment.</p>

  <p>With the introduction of a quality and outcomes framework, practices will be encouraged and incentivised to provide a first class service. High achievement against the quality standards will bring high financial rewards to practices and improved standards of care to patients.</p>

  <p>Patients will also have the opportunity to express their views about the services provided by the practice as part of this quality framework, creating further incentives for improvements in patient care.</p>

  <p>A patient service guarantee ensures that patients will continue to be offered at least the range of services they currently receive under the existing contract. Health boards will be under a duty to ensure that the full range of primary medical services is available for people in its area. So if a practice wants to opt out of a service, the board will have to ensure that patients still have access to that type of treatment.</p>

  <p>The practice based contract will help develop the multi-disciplinary approach that we are already seeing in parts of Scotland. GPs, nurses, pharmacists, health visitors and a range of allied health professionals will pool their skills to provide better services in their local communities.</p>

  <p>Finally, the new Scottish allocation funding formula has been specifically designed to ensure a fairer resource allocation based on the needs of patients.</p>

  <p>As I announced on 6 October 2003, GP prescribing of portable oxygen will be introduced in April 2004. The timing of its introduction is designed to ensure that an effective means of supply and distribution will be in place to meet the needs of all patients in Scotland who can benefit.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, a study is to be undertaken to consider the possible benefit to patients of alternative methods of supply and distribution of portable oxygen. Additionally, consideration is to be given to the possible benefits of making conservation devices available on the NHS in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Patients can respond better and perhaps faster to treatment if their mental health needs are addressed alongside their physical needs. A Scottish Needs Assessment Programme 2002 report, <em>Liaison Psychiatry and Psychology</em> (Bib. number 29705), underlined the importance we attach to identifying the whole person needs of all patients in this regard. With this in mind and as part of their training, all NHS professionals receive training in working with confused patients, including those with Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. Local health systems lead on all aspects of in service training.</p>

  <p>Carers are key partners in the care of the people they look after.

  <p>Like any major organisation, NHSScotland sees the management of risk as an important issue. Within the NHS there are a number of types of risk, such as clinical, non-clinical, financial, systems, business and project and these risks are assessed and managed in different ways. For example, clinical and non-clinical risks are managed through the Healthcare Risk Management Standards established by the Clinical Negligence and Other Risks Indemnity Scheme (CNORIS) and, to a lesser extent by the Generic Clinical Governance Standards introduced by NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS). Work is currently under way for these standards to be integrated into a single set to be managed by NHS QIS.</p>

  <p>Regular appraisal of risk and assessment of NHS bodies against the CNORIS/NHS QIS risk management standards is an important aspect for NHSScotland mitigating its exposure to risk. However, as risk falls into differing categories, no register of the top 20 risks in NHSScotland is maintained centrally.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no plans to put such infrastructure in place itself.

  <p>CHARIS is a joint initiative by the Hannah Research Institute and the Scottish Agricultural College, set up with funding support from the Scottish Executive and Scottish Enterprise to deliver research, technology and advisory services for the Scottish food industry.</p>

  <p>The detailed business plan for the initiative envisaged a substantial increase in commercial income, which would offset the planned reduction in Scottish Executive funded research, on account of the substantial body of research already funded in this area by the Executive, and a reduced requirement for further publicly funded research.</p>

  <p>SEERAD has provided CHARIS Food Research with funding of &#163;1 million, &#163;0.9 million and &#163;0.8 million in 2001-02, 2002-03 and 2003-04 respectively. For 2004-05 and 2005-06 planned funding is &#163;0.6 million and &#163;0.4 million respectively.</p>

  <p>Non-profit-making sports clubs in Scotland are able to receive 80% mandatory rate relief if they register as charities with the Inland Revenue. Local authorities have discretionary powers to top up this relief up to the maximum 100%. Sports clubs that do not meet the requirements for mandatory rate relief are eligible for up to 100% discretionary rate relief from their local authority; this is fully funded by the Scottish Executive. Sport clubs which occupy premises with a rateable value of &#163;10,000 or less are eligible for between 5% and 50% small business rate relief.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is taking action on several fronts to tackle the illegal use of lead solder. These include:</p>

  <p>working with the Scottish and Northern Ireland Plumbing Employers&#8217; Federation to reiterate that the use of leaded solder on drinking water plumbing is illegal, and to discourage the practice;</p>

  <p>working with Scottish Water to strengthen their byelaws which enforce the ban on the use of lead solder in all buildings supplied by the public water supply (though stiffer penalties and an improved monitoring regime);</p>

  <p>asking the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health to undertake further research to assess the scale of the problem and the impact of measures taken to date;</p>

  <p>looking at how the new building standards system proposed for 2005 might also encourage proper plumbing practice through the Building (Scotland) Act 2003, and</p>

  <p>providing information and advice to the public on the safe use of drinking water, for instance the &quot;Be Water Wise&quot; leaflet.</p>

  <p>The Executive has issued one default order to Scottish Water under regulation 14 of the 1994 regulations.</p>

  <p>The order was issued because one of the previous water authorities had failed to comply with a number of completion dates given in previous undertakings to Scottish ministers, leaving the Executive with no option but to invoke the default order provisions in regulation 14.</p>

  <p>Two waste water projects (Meadowhead/Stevenson/Inverclyde) and Dalmuir; and Rothesay were involved. In all cases, the revised compliance dates were achieved.</p>

  <p>For the financial year 2004-05, the recommendations at 6.5, 6.6, and 6.8 will be considered by Scottish Water and the Water Industry Commissioner as part of that year&#8217;s charges scheme. With regards to recommendation 6.7, the current transitional household reduction scheme was set up to help households adjust to increased charges. It will come to an end in March 2004. Issues of affordability for domestic customers will continue to be addressed through the link to council tax band and associated discounts.</p>
