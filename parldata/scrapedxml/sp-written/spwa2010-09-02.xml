  <p>Scottish Government officials have had a number of telephone discussions and a teleconference with officials in the Department of Work and Pensions regarding changes to the Independent Living Fund.</p>

  <p>The Minister for Housing and Communities raised this issue when he met with the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Disabled Peple, Maria Miller on 29 July 2010.</p>

  <p>I have also written to Maria Miller, explaining the Scottish Government&rsquo;s concerns and we are due to discuss this matter on 16 September 2010.</p>

  <p>1. Financial Information for 1997-98 to 1998-1999 was not recorded in the level of detail which was used from 1999-2000. Table <strong> 11.1</strong> of the Scottish Transport Statistics: No 27 - 2008 Edition provides details of the expenditure on transport within the Scottish ministers&rsquo; responsibility, and expenditure on transport controlled by local authorities. The latter gives a figure which includes Cycling Walking and Safer streets expenditure but does not break it down further. The publication is available to view on the Scottish Government website:</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-35491 on 2 September 2010. The sustainable level of UK public sector net borrowing, expressed as a percentage of GDP, will vary throughout the economic cycle. However, over the long term, the sustainable level of public sector net borrowing will be determined by a number of factors including the country&rsquo;s long-term economic performance, the existing stock of public sector debt, and the cost of financing additional borrowing.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-35366 on 27 July 2010. The Scottish Government believes UK public sector net borrowing should be returned to a sustainable level at the earliest opportunity. The timeframe over which this should be achieved will depend on the strength and speed of the economic recovery. All tiers of government should therefore be focussed on supporting the recovery and promoting economic growth. This is the most effective means of ensuring that public sector borrowing can be returned to pre crisis levels. In contrast, the austerity measures proposed by the new UK Government risk undermining the recovery and doing further damage to the public finances by cutting public spending too fast and too deeply.</p>

  <p>The long-term level of sustainable public sector net borrowing depends on a number of factors including the country&rsquo;s long-term economic performance, the existing stock of public sector debt, and the cost of financing additional borrowing. It is important to consider all three of these factors when considering fiscal policy and long-term sustainability. For example, net borrowing will vary throughout the economic cycle with borrowing rising in response to economic downturns and subsequently falling once the economy has recovered. Balancing these trends over the economic cycle ensures that the stock of debt remains at a sustainable level. Given the uncertain economic outlook, there is a real risk that the new UK Government&rsquo;s plans for fiscal consolidation will cut public spending too fast and too deeply. This may undermine the recovery and do further damage to the public finances in the long term.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government originally intended to publish an Energy Efficiency Action Plan (EEAP) for Scotland in 2008. However, a mandatory commitment to publish an EEAP, and set and report on energy efficiency targets, was subsequently included in the Climate Change (Scotland) Bill in late 2008, with the intention that the EEAP would be developed once the bill was enacted. This provided the statutory reporting framework which we believe energy efficiency requires.</p>

  <p>Due to the requirement to undertake a full and active consultation on the plan, and subsequently analyse responses, it was not possible to meet a further intended publication date of 2009 after the Climate Change (Scotland) Act came into force.</p>

  <p>It was anticipated that the final plan would be published in late spring 2010 and a draft document was developed accordingly. However, in light of the establishment of the Short Life Working Group on Annual Emissions Targets, and given the role which energy efficiency will play in meeting these targets, it was considered inappropriate to publish the plan until new targets have been agreed.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, several actions within the draft document are already being taken forward.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government measures the business start-up rate as the number of businesses registering for VAT and/or PAYE per 10,000 resident adults.</p>

  <p>In 2008, Scotland&rsquo;s business start-up rate was 38 per 10,000 resident adults compared to a rate of 54 for the UK. Historical VAT registration data dating back to the 1980s shows that the Scottish rate has persistently been below that of the UK. However, there are regional differences in the business start-up rate across the UK and within Scotland, with some areas in Scotland performing well against parts of the UK.</p>

  <p>Progress has been made to close the gap with the UK over recent years. Businesses registering for VAT/PAYE in Scotland increased by 15.2% between 2002 and 2008 &ndash; compared to a UK increase of 11.4%. Excluding London, the UK increase was only 7.9% over the period.</p>

  <p>There are many factors that have an impact on business start-up rates &ndash; including fiscal and tax policy, regulation, the rate of GDP growth, employment, business confidence and cultural/motivation factors. Many of these are out-with the direct control of the Scottish Government.</p>

  <p>For example, the Government Economic Strategy makes clear that the Scottish Government believes in making the &quot;case for Scotland to have fuller, and eventually full, responsibility for tax raising and public spending, utilising this to make Scotland the lowest taxed part of the UK, dropping corporation tax significantly below the UK level.&quot; Thereby making Scotland a more attractive destination for business in general, but also for business start-ups.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s role is to provide policies, frameworks and resources to NHS boards to enable clinicians and service planners to deliver high quality, safe and sustainable services to local communities. It is a matter for NHS boards to plan for and provide services to meet the assessed needs of their resident population, irrespective of age or clinical condition. This applies to management of obesity, including the provision of bariatric surgery.</p>

  <p>Recent initiatives and reports issued to support NHS boards and clinicians to deliver effective care for overweight and obese adults and children include: Preventing Overweight and Obesity in Scotland: A Route Map Towards Healthy Weight; the SIGN guideline on Management of Obesity, and the national roll out of the Counterweight Programme approach to managing weight in primary care.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) assesses newly licensed medicines for clinical and cost-effectiveness and provides advice to NHS Boards. Where the SMC has accepted a newly licensed medicine, NHS boards are expected to make it (or its equivalent) available in accordance with the clinical needs of patients.</p>

  <p>The majority of medicines reviewed by the SMC are medicines for conditions where alternative treatments already exist. Whilst NHS boards are expected to follow SMC advice, the implementation of these SMC accepted medicines is subject to local NHS board decision.</p>

  <p>There is the facility for the SMC to designate an innovative medicine for a condition where there are no other treatment options as &quot;unique&quot;. In the event that a &quot;unique&quot; medicine was accepted by SMC, NHS boards would be required to introduce it to an agreed national programme.</p>

  <p>Guidance setting out the policy framework with regard to the introduction and availability of newly licensed medicines in the NHS in Scotland was issued to NHS boards on 17 May 2010. A link to the guidance is attached <a href="http://www.sehd.scot.nhs.uk/mels/CEL2010_17.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.sehd.scot.nhs.uk/mels/CEL2010_17.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p>The Patients Rights Bill will not embody a right to access a certain treatment or medicine. The bill deals with general principles about how healthcare should be delivered. It does not give rights to specific treatments or medicines, or for specific conditions.</p>

  <p>The national waiting time standard for a CT scan is six weeks. This is a maximum waiting time. Latest waiting time statistics published on 31 August showed that no patient had waited more than four weeks for a CT scan.</p>

  <p>Most stroke patients will require to be admitted to hospital immediately and will not wait for the start of their treatment. Stroke is a clinical priority for NHSScotland. NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS) has published updated clinical standards for stroke which include standards for access to a specialist stroke unit, CT scanning and the administration of thrombolysis. We expect NHS boards to implement the stroke standards with a view to improving the standard of stroke care for all patients.</p>

  <p>The National Advisory Committee for Stroke (NACS) will continue to closely monitor NHS boards&rsquo; performance with implementing stroke standards through the Scottish Stroke Care Audit and will draw boards&rsquo; attention to those aspects of services where good progress has been made and those where improvements are required.</p>

  <p>No. There is no reason to believe that such a request will be necessary. The terms of reference of the Inquiry do not include a timeframe in which the chairman is expected to report and such a request would not be in keeping with the statutory provision that the conduct of the Fingerprint Inquiry is for the chairman to direct.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what ministerial consideration is given to the potential cost of public inquiries before setting them up; which ministers were involved in the decision to set up the Fingerprint Inquiry, and what projected cost was given to them when making their decision.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-09-02.S3W-35968.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80341" speakername="Kenny MacAskill" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa0902.htm#18">

  <p>Ministerial considerations of cost or any other relevant matter will differ substantially in accordance with the nature and specific characteristics of the circumstances for which public inquiries are under consideration.</p>

  <p>For Inquiries established under the Inquiries Act 2005, considerations will include the provisions of Section 17, which require that the proceedings and conduct of an Inquiry are for the chairman to determine, and that in making any decision as to the procedure or conduct of an inquiry the chairman must act with regard also to the need to avoid any unnecessary cost. Further ministerial considerations of the potential cost will be associated with any decisions to issue determinations under Sections 39 and 40 of the 2005 act.</p>

  <p>In relation to the Fingerprint Inquiry, the Cabinet Secretary for Justice considered the key preliminary matters including the Inquiry&rsquo;s terms of reference and the appointment of a Chairman in June 2007, following the commitment to establish a judicial public inquiry, made by the Scottish National Party in May 2007 in the published document <i>It&rsquo;s time to look forward - the first 100 days of an SNP government.</i></p>

  <p>Following preparatory work, the Fingerprint Inquiry was established on 14 March 2008, on which date the terms of reference and Sir Anthony Campbell&rsquo;s chairmanship were announced.</p>

  <p>In relation to the projected costs of the Inquiry, I refer the member to the answers to questions S3W-11621 on 15 April 2008 and S3W-11870 on 24 April 2008.

  <p>A ministerial determination under Section 40(4) of the 2005 Act was announced on 5 June 2008, following which a provisional budget estimate of &pound;3.5 million was provided to ministers by the Inquiry team in October 2008. The final estimated cost of just over &pound;4 million was announced in April 2010, following completion of the public hearings.</p>

  <p>The successful Design, Build, Finance and Maintenance (DBFM) Contractor is required to obtain appropriate private finance to fund the activities of the DBFM Contract. The cost of capital will form part of each consortium&rsquo;s bid, and therefore the expected cost of capital is commercially confidential. The DBFM contract is the principal source of finance for the project, and will be managed using Not for Profit Distributing principles. DBFM payments will be made by the Scottish Government over a thirty year period following the opening of the railway. In addition, the Scottish Government has spent to date &pound;52 million on land purchase, advanced works and development costs.

  <p>The Scottish Government is currently evaluating tenders received for work to update the carbon calculator tool and hopes to award the contract in the next month. If this is the case, the research project should be completed before the end of the year and publication of results, along with updating of the tool, would take place in January 2011.</p>

  <p>Uptake of free school lunches by virtue of tax credit system is formally monitored through the annual <i>School Meals in Scotland Survey</i> . Results from the last one were published in June 2010 and can be accessed through the following link:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2010/07/06095048/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2010/07/06095048/0</a>.</p>

  <p>We do not have a single process planned for monitoring the P1 to P3 free school meal commitment. Councils have been invited to decide how best they will meet the additional targeted 20% progress towards this commitment. That progress may be achieved in a number of different ways as suits local circumstances. COSLA and the Scottish Government are currently working with local authorities to establish a suitable means of assessing authorities&rsquo; progress in this area in the context of their delivery across the package of commitments agreed with COSLA earlier this year, including progress on class sizes.</p>
