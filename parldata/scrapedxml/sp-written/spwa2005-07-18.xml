  <p>The recorded crime statistics collected centrally do not distinguish crimes against businesses. The Executive&rsquo;s definition of &quot;business crime&quot; is &quot;all crime and disorder committed by or against business and this includes retail crime&quot;. This mirrors the definition used by the Home Office in their Crime Reduction Toolkit for Business and Retail Crime. However, the Safe City Centres Initiative is not exclusively about reducing business crime. It is also about tackling quality of life issues such as graffiti, fly-posting, vandalism and antisocial behaviour, all of which can have a detrimental effect on those who work, live and visit our city and town centres.</p>

  <p>The recorded crime statistics collected centrally do not distinguish crimes against businesses. Research into business crime across Scotland was undertaken and published in 1999 ( <i>Counting the Cost &ndash; Crime Against Business in Scotland</i> . Bib. number 3925).

  <p>The Scottish Fingerprint Service (SFS) and the Police Information Technology Organisation (PITO) have carried out and continue to carry out assessments of fingerprint identification techniques.</p>

  <p>A benchmarking exercise on two Automatic Fingerprint Recognition systems was carried out by the SFS and PITO in 2004. Both systems recorded a 98.5% accuracy rate. The quality of a fingerprint mark is at its best between the ages of 16 and 50, and it is recognised that occupational or leisure activities can scar the fingers to the extent that a detrimental effect on accuracy can result for some people.</p>

  <p>Work on developing iris (rather than retina) and facial recognition systems has been carried out by the United Kingdom Passport Service (UKPS) and PITO. Data about fingerprint, iris and facial identification accuracy, which is specific to the UKPS work, is included in the UKPS Biometrics Enrolment Trial Report. This is available at:</p>

  <p>The transfer of prisoners from Scotland to Northern Ireland is undertaken by Reliance Custodial Services. The Northern Ireland Prison Service is responsible for the transfer of prisoners to Scotland. 12 prisoners have transferred from Scotland and six prisoners from Northern Ireland since 1 April 2000. Records are not available prior to this.</p>

  <p>The transfer of prisoners between Scotland and countries outwith the UK is the responsibility of the receiving jurisdiction, and is undertaken by SPS for prisoners returning to Scotland.

  <p>Experience from other Olympic Games, for example those held in Sydney, shows clearly that the games bring significant benefits to tourism in all areas of the host country. Scotland stands to benefit from the raised tourism profile which the UK as a whole will enjoy from the staging of the Olympic Games in London.</p>

  <p>More specifically, Scotland will also benefit from visitors coming here to see the part of the Olympic football tournament which is intended to be held at Hampden Park. There will also be opportunities to encourage competing nations to base training camps in Scotland in the run-up to the Olympics.</p>

  <p>The 2012 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games in London will be an inspiration to our young athletes to develop their potential with the goal of competing for Team GB under home conditions, in front of home spectators, in the best facilities for training and competition.</p>

  <p>Other benefits for sport will include an upgrading of the UK&rsquo;s stock of facilities for training and competition; and the opportunity to stage major events pre- and post-Games In addition, football supporters and others in Scotland will have the opportunity to see matches in the Olympic football tournament played at Hampden Park.</p>

  <p>The Executive gave its support to the London bid to host the 2012 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games because we believe that staging the world&rsquo;s biggest and most prestigious sporting event in the UK &ndash; which could feasibly only be staged in London - will give an enormous boost to sport throughout the UK. We also recognise that the London Games will have potential benefits for Scotland in terms of business, tourism, cultural and educational opportunities, which we will seek to maximise.</p>

  <p>The First Minister wrote to Barbara Cassani, the then Chairman of London 2012 Ltd, in November 2003 to express the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s support for London&rsquo;s bid.</p>
