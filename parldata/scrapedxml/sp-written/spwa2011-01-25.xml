  <p>Under the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000, it is incumbent on the medical practitioner primarily responsible for the medical treatment of an adult to complete a section 47 certificate once they have established that the adult is incapable in relation to a decision about the medical treatment in question. Part 5 of the act, and certification under section 47, should not be used as justification for the administration of unwanted, unnecessary or potentially harmful medication whether such medication is given covertly or otherwise. Subsection 47(7) of the act prohibits the use of force or detention, unless it is immediately necessary in the circumstances.</p>

  <p>Covert medication is permissible in certain, but limited, circumstances: for example, if it is required to safeguard the health of an adult who is unable to consent to the treatment in question and where other alternatives have been explored and none are practicable. A revised code of practice on part 5 of the act was published by the Scottish Government in October 2010 and can be found on its website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2010/10/20153801/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2010/10/20153801/0</a>. The Mental Welfare Commission has published guidance on this issue: <em>Consent to Treatment</em> and <em>Covert Medication - a legal and practical guide </em>are both available on the Mental Welfare Commission website at:</p>

  <p>Care home operators are responsible, as part of the package of care provided to residents, for medication supervision and support. It is the responsibility of each patient&rsquo;s GP to ensure that medicines prescribed for each patient are appropriate. There is a provision for NHS boards to contract with community pharmacies to provide advisory services to residential homes. Each board negotiates local payments for these services.</p>

  <p>As the member is aware, there are no national prescriptions for the number of subjects pupils should be examined for in S4. The precise number and range of qualifications on offer, as well as when they are taken, will be a decision for schools to take in consultation with learners and parents. Schools will take into consideration how they can provide a variety of options to suit the needs of the learner rather than treating all S4 pupils as a uniform cohort. Several models developed by schools to illustrate emerging thinking on how the senior phase (S4-S6) could be delivered are available on the Curriculum for Excellence website, including school models which illustrate how five to eight subjects can be taken.

  <p>The Scottish Government rejects that view. Learners in Scotland have benefitted from a wide range of high-quality resources to support the learning and teaching of history which have been developed and approved in consultation with the history profession. The History in Curriculum for Excellence Group, established in 2008, informed the development of the excellent Scotland&rsquo;s History online resource launched in October 2009 and resources on the new Higher History have been welcomed. Support from the Heritage Education Forum, Scran, Glow and other developments in recent years have made available resources and exciting learning experiences in and out of school across Scotland.</p>

  <p>Resources are kept under constant review and the History Excellence Group is developing further guidance for teachers and schools to provide learners with a more coherent experience of history from early years to senior phase as part of Curriculum for Excellence.</p>

  <p>The organisation of schools is a matter for local authorities and head teachers. As more schools organise on a faculty basis, there has been a decrease in the number of principal teachers of history. This is not unique to history and advice from HM Inspectorate of Education suggests that principal teachers are seeking appropriate advice and collaborating with colleagues to plan courses that are coherent, relevant and engaging, with an appropriate place for history in the curriculum.</p>

  <p>In Scottish education, we encourage leadership at all levels. There may not be a principal teacher in history but that does not mean that there is nobody leading the subject.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what its position is on concerns expressed in the Royal Society of Edinburgh&rsquo;s <em>Advice Paper (11-01): The Teaching of History in Scottish Schools</em> that there is an insufficient balance of subject knowledge taught in some schools.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government rejects that conclusion. Curriculum for Excellence aims to raise standards for all young people through a more flexible, coherent and enriched curriculum. It is for schools and local authorities to ensure they get the right balance of subject knowledge within broad curricular guidance and drawing on available resources.</p>

  <p>Practitioners are empowered to make teaching of history relevant and engaging drawing on local, national and international contexts while maintaining a focus on changes that have shaped Scotland. The curriculum encourages deeper learning which may involve a smaller number of topics and the History Excellence Group is working to produce further guidance for teachers and schools to provide learners with a coherent experience of history from early years to senior phase.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises the important role of extracurricular reading in the literacy development of young people. Our Literacy Action Plan, launched in October, sets out our vision to raise standards of literacy for all, from the early years through to adulthood. The plan recognises the importance of reading as a valued activity from an early age, and the social, educational, and familial benefits of reading in the home. We will continue to work with our partners to support measures to develop Scotland as a literate, reading nation.</p>

  <p>Within Curriculum for Excellence, reading is a key focus of the development of literacy skills, and the associated guidance indicates that young people should have opportunities to experience reading for enjoyment and interest at all stages.</p>

  <p>Through the Scottish Book Trust (SBT) early reading experiences are encouraged by the Bookbug book-gifting scheme, which includes the provision of a free book to all children in their first year of primary school. For financial year 2010-11, we have provided SBT with &pound;1.05 million towards this scheme.</p>

  <p>The Home Insulation Scheme (HIS) provides intensive promotion of a range of energy efficiency programmes and related support to householders on the door-step in specific areas to assist in tackling climate change and fuel poverty and increase Carbon Emissions Reduction Target investment in Scotland. In addition to insulation measures, HIS ensures that households in targeted areas are also systematically offered:</p>

  <p>Energy efficiency advice linked to Home Energy Checks;</p>

  <p>Benefits and tariff checks to increase incomes and tackle fuel poverty (through the Energy Assistance Package (EAP));</p>

  <p>Heating systems and other measures (through EAP, where households are eligible), and</p>

  <p>Interest free loans for more expensive energy efficiency measures, for example, in hard to treat properties.</p>

  <p>There were 14,416 installations of Home Insulation Scheme insulation measures in the period to 5 December 2010. Reports providing an overview of all Home Insulation Scheme activity, including referrals to other programmes and support are published monthly on the Energy Saving Trust website at <a href="http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk" target="_blank">http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>(b) 3,020 households had at least one insulation measure installed that was partly paid for under HIS.</p>

  <p>These figures are based on delivery as at 5 December 2010, within HIS areas funded from 2009-10 budgets. A household may have had both a partly paid and a fully paid measure installed; if so, the household will be counted in both of the above figures.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-27381 by Alex Neil on 24 September 2009, what proportion of contributions toward the cost of insulation measures in rented accommodation under the Home Insulation Scheme in 2009-10 was received from (a) tenants and (b) landlords.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>No client contribution is required for loft insulation top-ups provided under the Home Insulation Scheme. In the case of virgin loft and cavity wall insulation, if the tenant of a private landlord is within a priority group under the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT) scheme then no client contribution is required.</p>

  <p>Client contributions are required for virgin loft and cavity wall insulation measures where the household is not in a priority group under CERT. These contributions are collected by installers and while a sample of payments is checked for audit purposes information on the extent of client contributions is not systematically collected from installers by the managing agent.</p>

  <p>The anticipation is that private landlords will normally pay any financial contribution towards the cost of insulation measures in cases where such a contribution is required. However, the tenant would be given the option to pay this contribution if the landlord refused to do so.</p>

  <p>The Home Insulation Scheme (HIS) achieved its target of ensuring that all dwellings in the identified areas were visited and free or discounted loft and cavity wall insulation measures and other services, where appropriate, offered to those households which it was possible to contact after three visits.</p>

  <p>Our draft report on proposals and policies sets out a series of milestones for Scottish homes. This includes for every home to have loft and cavity wall insulation, which is cost-effective and technically feasible by 2020.</p>

  <p>Installers under the HIS are contractually obliged to comply with British and European insulation standards and best practice guidelines.</p>

Includes enabling fund to assist in installation costs, e.g. loft clearance, reduction of installation costs in island areas. Does not include funding for insulation measures funded under CERT or from householder contributions.</p>

  <p>2. Covers central managing agent staff and IT.</p>

  <p>The remainder of the HIS 2009-10 budget has been allocated to support delivery costs (48%) which covers the costs incurred by the Energy Saving Scotland Advice Centres in providing and managing teams of energy assessors to engage with households living in the 180,000 houses in the HIS areas covered by the 2009-10 programme in order to generate uptake of insulation measures and provide services on the door step. This included the delivery of services such as energy efficiency advice, home energy checks and referrals to a range of energy efficiency and fuel poverty programmes. The remaining 7% of the budget is allocated to provision of other energy efficiency measures, including loans.</p>

  <p>All private sector households in Home Insulation Scheme (HIS) areas are eligible to receive free loft insulation top-ups. Households will be offered such insulation if their homes require it and are suitable to take this measure.</p>

  <p>Eligibility for virgin loft and cavity wall insulation within HIS areas is determined by the UK Government&rsquo;s Carbon Emissions Reductions Target (CERT) scheme. Under that scheme, households assessed as priority are generally eligible for free virgin loft and cavity wall insulation. Some households in larger properties may be asked to pay a charge for excess meterage. Households are priority under CERT if they are in receipt of certain benefits or over 70 years of age. Other households are assessed as able to pay and therefore eligible for measures at reduced cost. Households will be offered such insulation if their homes require it and are suitable to take this measure.</p>

  <p>Based on analysis of activity in HIS areas supported under Scottish Government 2009-10 budgets, approximately 38% of households in those areas would be assessed as priority under CERT criteria, with the remaining 62% regarded as being able to pay. On a pro-rata basis, this would indicate that approximately 70,000 households in HIS areas would be assessed as a priority case under CERT, with the remaining 110,000 households being classed as able to pay for these measures.</p>

  <p>These figures should be regarded as a rough estimate only as it is not known whether or not the profile of households that engaged and is reflected in this analysis is fully representative of the household profile in the area as a whole.</p>

  <p>Loft and cavity wall insulation, which is prioritized under the UK Government&rsquo;s Carbon Emissions Reductions Target scheme is the main focus of insulation measures under the Home Insulation Scheme (HIS) and is not appropriate for many hard-to-treat homes. However, within HIS areas, owners of hard to treat properties have been offered support to install such measures where these are appropriate. For example, properties that are of solid brick or stone walled construction, or those with timber frame cavities, are normally regarded as hard to treat, but may require measures such as loft insulation. On this basis, 32% of HIS insulation measures have been installed in hard to treat properties.</p>

  <p>Owners of hard to treat properties in HIS areas have also been assisted in a range of other ways, including through energy efficiency advice, benefits and tariff checks to increase incomes and tackle fuel poverty (through the Energy Assistance Package), heating systems and other measures (through the Energy Assistance Package, where households are eligible) and interest free loans for more expensive energy efficiency measures.</p>

  <p>Initial cost estimates were based on a small scale re-development of the existing facilities budgeted at approximately &pound;2 million. This was based on an upgrade of the existing facilities at the Osprey Car Park. This would significantly have reduced car park capacity and caused disruption to business.</p>

  <p>The current forecast for the new Glentress Peel Project stands at &pound;8.5 million. This final forecast cost for the project includes the purchase of the new 12 acre site, the design and build of four new purpose built sustainable buildings (caf&eacute;, bike shop, service building with offices and meeting rooms including a woodfuel heating system, wildlife viewing with interpretation, changing, showers and toilets), additional car parking and significantly improved access from the A72. The project is within the approved budget and timetable.</p>

  <p>There are no plans for the CHI to be a compulsory field in the proposed revised medical certificate of cause of death. Certifying doctors will be asked to provide the number where it is available to them to help with the efficient management of their patient&rsquo;s record.</p>

  <p>That answer referred to the Care Information Scotland helpline, the Scottish Helpline for Older People and the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Home Energy Scotland Hotline.</p>

  <p>These helplines are well aware their users often do not have access to the internet, and target their advertising accordingly. They advertise their helpline numbers through leaflets and posters distributed and displayed in public places such as libraries, GPs surgeries, and other community settings; through their own publications and mailings; and through awareness raising by attending local events and in talks to the likes of older people&rsquo;s groups.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Helpline for Older People is in every Yellow Pages directory in Scotland (directories have different categories, so advertisements appear under Advice and Information or Counselling or Helplines). The Home Energy Scotland Hotline has current broad coverage over radio and TV, and over 100,000 Scottish households are being sent letters promoting its phone number in 2010-11.</p>
