  <p>The Scottish Government is working closely with the police and other enforcement agencies on security planning for the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games. This includes potential issues which may arise not just during games time but from the build programme itself.</p>

  <p>With construction work already underway, there have been no trafficking issues identified. At this time, there is no intelligence to indicate human trafficking and vice will be an issue linked to the games. Should any instances arise, partner agencies will co-ordinate positive enforcement action and provide support to victims.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, given that the Metropolitan Police has invested &pound;600,000 in a specialist team in the five Olympic boroughs to combat an expected surge in trafficking, whether specific resources have been allocated to the identification and support of women trafficked to Glasgow for the 2014 Commonwealth Games during the construction phase and games fortnight.</p>

  <p>The Strathclyde Police 2014 Games Planning Team includes officers that are responsible for planning the security surrounding the construction programme, and their remit includes considering the potential for human trafficking. These officers can seek support from specialists at the Strathclyde Police Vice and Anti-Trafficking Unit and at the Scottish Crime and Drugs Enforcement Agency.</p>

  <p>There is currently no intelligence indicating that either human trafficking or vice crime will be particularly associated with the 2014 Commonwealth Games. Should any instances arise, partner agencies will co-ordinate positive enforcement action and provide support to victims.</p>

  <p>Data on recorded crime is based on an aggregate return and cannot be interrogated on details of the perpetrator. It is therefore not possible to break the above data down further to separately identify off-licenses.</p>

  <p>The original membership of the Public Health Institute Scotland (PHIS) Group which led the first world leading needs assessment of people on the autism spectrum evolved to become the national Autistic Spectrum Disorder Reference Group. Members of the group were selected as they were regarded as leaders in the field from practice and academia.</p>

  <p>The membership is currently being reviewed by the group in conjunction with the Scottish Government to ensure that the needs of people with autism are being addressed. Examples of recent additions include representatives from the COSLA and the Association for the Directors of Social Work (ADSW) as it is recognised that local authorities play a vital role in enhancing the quality of life for people with autism.</p>

  <p>Funding was allocated to all health boards from 2008-11 as part of CEL 36 (2008) which aimed to improve the nutrition of women of childbearing age, pregnant women and children under five in disadvantaged areas, including increasing exclusive breastfeeding rates. It was for individual NHS boards to decide how this funding should be used throughout their area to support this work.</p>

  <p>Total funding of &pound;1,297,723 was allocated to NHS Tayside as part of CEL36 (2008). A proportion of this funding has been used to develop trained breastfeeding support workers to work in the most deprived areas of each Community Health Partnership, to establish a breastfeeding clinic to support women with complex breastfeeding challenges and to establish a breastfeeding caf&eacute;.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not hold this information centrally.</p>

  <p>There are many providers who offer various levels of British Sign Language (BSL) training in a variety of settings in Scotland, and these organisations and individuals have different accreditation bodies, such as the Scottish Qualifications Authority, Signature and the British Deaf Association. The examination statistics are not collected by the Scottish Government, however, this information would be held by these accrediting bodies.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has funded a training initiative through Heriot-Watt University for Deaf BSL tutors to teach BSL. Since 2007, 18 deaf tutors have undertaken these courses: 10 graduated from the first Training of Trainers (ToTs) course in 2007, and a further eight are currently completing and due to graduate from the second ToTs intake in 2011.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has also funded the &quot;Building Bridges&quot; project, a work-based route to BSL interpreter training in Scotland through the Scottish Association of Sign Language Interpreters (SASLI). It is anticipated that their 10 apprentices on this programme will graduate at the end of March 2011.</p>

  <p>Extensive human papilloma virus (HPV) type-specific testing is a relatively recent development. As yet there is no data to allow any changes over the past five years to be evaluated. However, in many countries, including Scotland, the normal prevalence of HPV in unvaccinated populations has been estimated and published within the scientific literature.</p>

  <p>The prevalence of HPV varies by age and the prevalence and distribution of genotypes varies by severity of HPV-related disease.</p>

  <p>In a study of cervical cancers diagnosed in Scotland, HPV was detected in 88% of invasive cervical cancers tested. Of these: 64% were type 16; 20% type 18; 6.5% type 45; 5% type 31; 3% type 33. All other specific types were detected in less than 1% of samples, aside from type 6 which was detected in 1.2%, but in all cases was as a co-infection with another High Risk HPV type. Overall 10% of HPV infections detected were within a multiple infection.</p>

  <p>In unvaccinated populations of women with normal cervical cytology overall prevalence of HPV varies according to age. In a large study in the North of England HPV prevalence with High Risk (oncogenic) types of HPV varied from 22.3% in 20 to 29 year olds to 5.8% in 50 to 64 year olds.</p>

  <p>With respect to HPV genotypes - a meta-analysis of studies from around the world compared HPV types in 1 million women with normal cytological findings. This included 21 studies from northern Europe, eight of which were from the UK. The findings showed that overall prevalence of HPV among 97,242 Northern European women of all ages was 10%. Within Europe the most prevalent subtypes were 16; 31, 18, 39, (33,66), 6, (45, 52, 51,58). (Brackets indicate HPV types with equal prevalence.)</p>

  <p>Within Scotland a study of 3,444 women attending screening in one NHS board found that among 3089 women of all ages (&lt;25 to &gt;55) with normal cytology 12.7% were positive for HPV. 8.3% had a High Risk type identified; 6.5% a Low Risk type. 4.5% of women with normal cervical cytology were infected with multiple HPV types. The most prevalent HPV types among these women with normal cytology were: 16; (18,51), 31, 52, 45, 73, 59, 56, 33, 58, 39 with other types each identified in less than 1% of samples. (Brackets indicate HPV types with equal prevalence).</p>

  <p>A range of information materials are available to support the human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination programme. Consistent messages are provided across these materials that the vaccination will only protect against two strains of the virus and that girls should attend for cervical screening when they reach the appropriate age.</p>

  <p>Every girl who attends for vaccination will be provided with a leaflet before she is vaccinated. These leaflets, which are also available on the vaccination programme website say:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.fightcervicalcancer.org.uk" target="_blank">http://www.fightcervicalcancer.org.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>&quot;The HPV vaccine is designed to protect against the two types of HPV that can cause 70% of the cases of cervical cancer.</p>

  <p>&quot;The vaccine does not protect you against all other types of HPV, so you will still need to start going for regular cervical screening when you&rsquo;re 20 years old. The combination of immunisation and cervical screening offers the best possible protection against cervical cancer.&quot;</p>

  <p>In addition to this, the information materials available to support the Cervical Cancer Screening Programme also make clear that girls who have had the HPV vaccination programme still need to attend for screening. These are available at:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to ensuring that all children and young people with additional support needs receive the education and support they require to achieve their maximum potential in life and legislation has been put in place to support this policy.</p>

  <p>The Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 places a duty on local authorities to meet the additional support needs for all children for whose school education they are responsible, including children in Gaelic medium education, and to tailor provision according to their individual needs. The 2004 act provides the legal framework which underpins the system for identifying and addressing the additional support needs of children and young people who face a barrier, or barriers, to learning. It aims to ensure that all children and young people are provided with the necessary support to help them work towards achieving their full potential. It also promotes collaborative working among all those supporting children and young people and sets out parents' rights within the system.</p>

  <p>The Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2009, which came into force on 14 November 2010, amended and strengthened the 2004 act and clarifies, among other things, the definition of additional support by specifying that it is not limited to support provided in an educational environment.</p>

  <p>The provision for children with additional support needs in Gaelic medium education is matter for local authorities. A number of authorities have employed Gaelic medium classroom assistants who can assist with any additional support needed in the classroom.</p>

  <p>A joint review process is in place for Local Housing Strategies, involving Scottish Government and local government officials. Each strategy is reviewed against a number of criteria, including the extent to which fuel poverty, energy efficiency and climate change have been addressed. We expect most local authorities will publish the review of their Local Housing Strategy on their websites, and we are discussing detailed publication arrangements with COSLA. To strengthen climate change coverage in Local Housing Strategies and further help local authorities meet the duties they have as public bodies under the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 the Scottish Government and COSLA will shortly be issuing additional guidance.</p>

  <p>The domestic abuse toolkit is a framework developed to aid Sheriffs Principal and local criminal justice partners shape how they handle domestic abuse cases in their area. The toolkit therefore helps inform local practice and training, and as such, we would not expect there to be ongoing training on its particular use.</p>

  <p>In each of Scotland&rsquo;s six sheriffdoms, police officers and legal staff receive training on the joint domestic abuse protocol which sets out to identify best practice and obtain consistency of approach in the investigation, reporting and prosecution of cases. In addition, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service provide specialist domestic abuse training for legal staff, Victims Information and Advice staff and precognoscers.</p>

  <p>There are three further crimes/offences for which drugs may be a contributory factor causing death by careless driving when under the influence of drink or drugs, driving a motor vehicle while unfit through drink or drugs and being in charge of motor vehicle while unfit through drink or drugs. We are not able to identify the number of such crimes/offences specifically relating to drugs and as such have not included these figures in the table.</p>

  <p>There is no national strategy for equal access to counselling in schools as there is already a comprehensive framework in place to make sure learners with additional support needs including social, emotional or mental health needs, short or long-term, access appropriate support in partnership with relevant agencies, under the Additional Support for Learning (Scotland) Act 2004 as amended.</p>

  <p>Under Curriculum for Excellence, every learner is entitled to support, from universal support which starts with ethos, climate and relationships within a learning environment which is inclusive and fair, to targeted support. Support and health and wellbeing are responsibilities for all staff. All learners should have frequent and regular opportunities to discuss learning with a key adult who has a holistic overview of progress and personal development and all staff are responsible for establishing open, positive and supportive relationships across whole school communities where learners feel listened to and secure in their ability to discuss sensitive aspects of their lives. Support depends upon personalised planning; an understanding of anti-discriminatory, anti bullying and child protection policies, and knowledge of steps to be taken in any given situation, including appropriate referral and multi agency delivery where appropriate, to meet individual needs. This may include counselling in school if appropriate.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has considered or will consider mechanisms to replace the duty on local authorities to provide energy efficiency under the Home Energy Conservation Act 1995 with a duty to set targets for and report on carbon emissions reduction and fuel poverty eradication in all housing in their area.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2011-03-14.S3W-40134.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80370" speakername="Alex Neil" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-11/wa0314.htm#23">

  <p>The question of what should replace the reporting duties of local authorities in relation to action to improve the energy efficiency of housing stock in their area under the Home Energy Conservation Act 1995 (HECA) was considered as part of the consultation on the Energy Efficiency Action Plan. This reflected the new context following introduction of the Climate Change Act and the need significantly to increase impetus and focus in delivering energy efficiency. Most respondents said they did not want HECA to remain as a distinct duty on local councils, and half of the respondents supported moves to address energy efficiency in housing through Local Housing Strategies (LHSs). Existing guidance on Local Housing Strategies includes advice on setting targets for the eradication of fuel poverty. In line with the response to the consultation on the future of HECA, since 2007 we have been developing our strategic approach, while aiming to reduce the burden of reporting on local councils.</p>

  <p>We will shortly publish, jointly with COSLA, supplementary guidance (<em>Supplementary Guidance on Addressing Climate Change in Local Housing Strategies</em>) which will further support councils in taking action on energy efficiency, assisting them to fulfil the duties they have as public bodies under the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009. This guidance follows HECA in placing on councils the responsibility for setting targets and monitoring progress at local authority level, but goes further by encouraging them to link action on energy efficiency with related strategies to improve the quality of housing stock in their area, and by providing them with advice on the range of powers, duties, resources and information at their disposal to help them to do this.</p>

  <p>Half of all respondents favoured the alternative mechanism of incorporation into the Local Housing Strategy and Single Outcome Agreement processes. 21% supported the retention of a HECA duty while 29% made other suggestions or comments.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Private Rented Sector Strategy Group considered this issue and acknowledged that there is a need to improve energy efficiency across all sectors including the private rented sector. It concluded that regulation of energy efficiency standards in the private rented sector should be looked at alongside the owner occupier sector and this was reflected in its final consultation recommendations report published in December 2009.</p>

  <p>Regulation will be pursued using the powers available under the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 and a report will be published by the end of March 2011 setting out when Scottish ministers intend to make provision in respect of various sections in the act.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will also continue to work with Energy Saving Trust to encourage voluntary action by landlords to improve energy efficiency measures.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s draft Report on Proposals and Policies sets out how its emission reduction targets can be met each year to 2022, including the expected contribution from homes and communities. These proposals and policies do not centre on the achievement of an average standard in all homes. Rather our approach focuses on promoting the most cost-effective and beneficial approaches to meeting the emissions required in each sector.

  <p>Our woodland creation targets are mainly achieved through grant support under the Scotland Rural Development Programme together with the Forest Leasing Scheme and some direct planting undertaken by Forestry Commission Scotland.

  <p>Medical practitioners, and this of course includes anaesthetists, have been assessing capacity for the purposes of Part 5 (Medical treatment) of the Adults With Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000 (the 2000 Act) since that act came into force. Anaesthetists have training on assessing capacity as part of their training to become a doctor so are not specifically required under the 2000 Act to undertake additional training, in terms of signing medical treatment certificates. In practice, it is more likely that an anaesthetist would be working under the authorisation of another medical practitioner in terms of section 47(3) of the 2000 Act, which gives power to any other person who is authorised by the person on whom authority has been conferred to carry out medical treatment and who is acting on his behalf under his/her instructions or with his/her approval or agreement.</p>

  <p>When the 2000 Act was amended in 2006 to extend the scope of the range of healthcare professionals who can issue a section 47 certificate of incapacity, to include certain other healthcare professionals such as dentists, the need for additional training for these professionals was recognised. Scottish Ministers were therefore given powers to prescribe requirements that would need to be met by all of these additional healthcare professionals before they could issue certificates. The Adults with Incapacity (Requirements for Signing Medical Treatment Certificates (Scotland) Regulations 2007 therefore require other health professionals such as dentists to have completed and passed the course entitled Adults with Incapacity: Part 5 Amendment &ndash; Assessment of Incapacity for Health Professionals. This course was piloted by Edinburgh&rsquo;s Napier University, who hope, dependent on demand, to run this course again 16 May 2011.</p>

  <p>A four-year surveillance research project of the epidemiology of Foetal Alcohol Syndrome in Scotland, for which the Scottish Government is providing funding, began on 1 April 2010. The findings and analysis of the results will be published in a scientific paper at the end of the project in 2014. We would anticipate that the results will also be presented to the Scottish Paediatric Society, the British Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Neonatal Society, and the British Association for Community Child Health, the Royal College of Paediatrics Research and the European Society of Paediatric Research.</p>

  <p>The judgement concerned the correct interpretation of section 2(2)(aa) of the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Act 1993. This provision was introduced into the 1993 Act by section 1 of the Convention Rights (Compliance) (Scotland) Act 2001. Section 2(2) (aa) governs how judges should set the punishment part of a discretionary life sentence and Orders for Lifelong Restriction.</p>

  <p>The effect of the judgement is that section 2(2)(aa) has been interpreted as operating in a way that will mean that a discretionary life prisoner and Order for Lifelong Restriction prisoner may receive a punishment part of their sentence below the level that they would receive if they had received a fixed length sentence for the same offence. In his opinion within the Appeal Court judgement, Lord Justice General states that:</p>

  <p>&quot;&hellip; I have&hellip; come, with regret, to the view that, however unsatisfactory it may appear as a matter of comparative justice, Parliament has given statutory effect to an arrangement under which an indeterminate prisoner will, or at least may, become first eligible for consideration for parole at an earlier stage in his sentence than an equivalent determinate prisoner&quot;.</p>

  <p>The judgement applies only in cases where prisoners have received a discretionary life sentence or have been made subject to an Order for Lifelong Restriction. The judgement does not affect any convicted murderers as they receive a mandatory life sentence.</p>

  <p>As a result of the judgement, some prisoners may be able to apply for parole earlier than had previously been the case, but the parole board will still be required to consider whether the public needs to be protected from the prisoner. If the parole board considers that the public should be protected, the prisoner will remain in prison.</p>

  <p>With the detail of the judgement now available, we are considering what primary legislative change may be needed to address the issues raised by the judgement. Such legislative change would be for the administration in place after the May elections to decide upon.</p>

  <p>It is for local authorities and NHS boards to determine and design services in response to local priorities and clinical need.</p>

  <p>Under the Additional Support for Learning (Scotland) Act 2004 as amended, education authorities are required to identify, meet and keep under review additional support needs of all children for whose education they are responsible, including those with social, emotional and mental health difficulties, and to tailor provision according to individual needs. Appropriate agencies, which include NHS boards, are required to assist a local authority in the exercise of any of its functions under the act. In addition, under Curriculum for Excellence, all learners are entitled to support. Again, support should be tailored to individual needs and circumstances, and delivered in partnership with relevant agencies, rather than through one type of universal provision such as counselling.</p>

  <p>We have been working with NHS boards to ensure that there is a mental health link worker or properly articulated link system between schools and child and adolescent mental health (CAMH) specialists and the development of a web-based toolkit <a href="http://www.handsonscotland.co.uk" target="_blank">http://www.handsonscotland.co.uk</a> aimed at improving the confidence of teachers and others in responding to the mental health needs of children.</p>

  <p>Under Curriculum for Excellence, every learner is entitled to support, from universal support which starts with ethos, climate and relationships within a learning environment which is inclusive and fair, to targeted support. Support and health and wellbeing are responsibilities for all staff. All learners should have frequent and regular opportunities to discuss learning with a key adult who has a holistic overview of progress and personal development and all staff are responsible for establishing open, positive and supportive relationships across whole school communities where learners feel listened to and secure in their ability to discuss sensitive aspects of their lives. Support depends upon personalised planning and knowledge of steps to be taken in any given situation, including appropriate referral and multi agency delivery where appropriate, to meet individual needs. This may include counselling in school if appropriate.</p>

  <p>In support of identifying and referring on pupils with mental health needs, NHS boards should make available a named health link person to every school, or a properly articulated link system between schools and Child and Adolescent Mental Health (CAMH) specialists.</p>

  <p>Integrated care pathways seek to ensure that local multi-agency agreements are in place to join up all the available help. NHS Quality Improvement Scotland have developed standards for doing this in Scotland which are currently out for consultation across all agencies.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government, through the implementation of the 2005 Children and Young People&rsquo;s Mental Health Framework for Promotion, Prevention and Care have been encouraging NHS boards and partners to improve the networks between professionals within the children&rsquo;s workforce, and to improve the skills of the non specialist workforce (such as school based professionals) in identifying a range of children&rsquo;s metal health problems, and in responding appropriately in offering and securing the right help.</p>

  <p>We have been working with NHS boards to ensure that there is a mental health link worker or properly articulated link system between schools and child and adolescent mental health (CAMH) specialists. In support of this a web based toolkit <a href="http://www.handsonscotland.co.uk" target="_blank">http://www.handsonscotland.co.uk</a> aimed at improving the confidence of teachers and others in responding to the mental health needs of children has been developed.</p>

  <p>We have supported NHS QIS in the development of draft standards for integrated care pathways which are currently out for consultation. Implementation of the standards will ensure that local arrangements are in place which support school based professional to better recognise when children are in need of specialist help and to refer on quickly after these children have been identified.</p>

  <p>We are investing an additional &pound;12.5 million in specialist CAMHS in the three years from 2009. This has grown the specialist workforce by 25% between the end of 2008 and the end of 2010. This is enabling specialist CAMH services to respond quicker to children who need the service.</p>

  <p>Since <em>The</em> <em>Mental Health of Children and Young People: A framework for Promotion, Prevention and Care</em> was published, delivery partners in NHS boards, local authorities and the voluntary sector have made significant progress.</p>

  <p>Awareness of child and adolescent mental health in schools has been improved by, amongst other things, a Scottish Government commitment encouraging the establishment of explicit links between schools and child and adolescent mental health specialists as well as the development of a web-based toolkit aimed at improving the confidence of teachers and others in responding to the mental health needs of children.</p>

  <p>Our work with NHS boards and their partners in implementing the framework highlighted a need for further expansion of the workforce capacity and are addressing this. We are allocating &pound;6.5 million over three years to increase the number of psychologists working in specialist Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) with &pound;1 million having been allocated in 2009-10, &pound;2 million being allocated in 2010-11 and &pound;3.5 million being allocated in 2011-12.</p>

  <p>We are also making available &pound;2 million each year to help NHS services enhance intensive community services (Tier 3 and 4) and to help reduce the need for children and young people to be admitted to hospital. This investment will also support our referral to treatment waiting time target for specialist CAMHS which means by March 2013 no one will wait longer 26 weeks from referral to treatment.</p>

  <p>*Note: Excludes payments for general practioner (GP) trainees when in practice as payment is made through NES GP Payroll.</p>

  <p>Under the reshaping the medical workforce policy it has been agreed that salaries for training posts which have been disestablished as part of the project will be returned to NHSScotland boards to help to fund trained doctors to replace trainees. In the financial year 2010-11 NES has transferred a total of &pound;682,692 from the NES baseline to NHS boards baseline for disestablished posts, although a number of these will be for Fixed Term Specialty Training Appointment (FTSTA) posts rather than specialty training (ST).</p>

  <p>The National Reshaping the Medical Workforce Project Board, after extensive consultations, made recommendations to me about reductions in specialty trainee intake numbers for 2010 and 2011. A reshaping Working Group has been set up to help boards plan to reach their agreed target training establishments for each specialty and to track which posts are lost and what is put in their place. Boards which lose trainee input will receive the salary for the post to invest in replacement.</p>

  <p>NHS Fife made the decision to provide a minor injuries service at Victoria Hospital during out of hours periods in the interests of ensuring patient safety, avoiding the uncertainty involved in the previous contingency arrangements about when and from where full emergency services would be provided, and to establish the new single site working patterns that will be required when emergency services move to Victoria Hospital in early 2012 after completion of the major building project. The earlier problems were not caused by withdrawal of training numbers but by recruitment issues and gaps in rotas/lack of locums.</p>

  <p>There are no plans to disestablish posts at first or second year level. For 2011 the planned reduction in Specialty Training posts is 49. Reductions in future years will depend upon the rate at which current trainees complete training and will be in line with Scotland's needs. There will be further consultation before any future reductions are announced.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government works to identify and deliver the reinforcement and further development of Scotland&rsquo;s grid network that will connect and transport Scotland&rsquo;s energy potential, deliver a low carbon generating mix and ensure security of future energy supply.</p>

  <p>Our Second National Planning Framework highlights a range of energy generation, infrastructure and grid developments of national importance to Scotland. Proactive use of our powers on spatial onshore and offshore planning and consenting has resulted in a step change in planning, consenting and developing Scotland&rsquo;s energy future.</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2009/07/02105627/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2009/07/02105627/0</a>.</p>

  <p>We work closely with UK, EU Governments, the GB system regulator Ofgem and transmission system operators in a number of strategic groupings envisaging future gird network at UK and EU level; including the Electricity Networks Strategy Group on future onshore and offshore GB reinforcement, and EU level groupings on future interconnected grid development in the Irish and North Seas.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not hold detailed information on levels of committed and planned grid investment. This is a regulated activity by Ofgem and the three transmission system operators (National Grid Electricity Transmission Limited, Scottish Hydro Electric Transmission Limited and Scottish Power Transmission Limited). Decisions on specific grid projects and investment plans are part of this regulated process.</p>

  <p>The transmission system operators are responsible for developing their networks in line with their licence obligations. The revenue network companies can earn in doing so is determined by the regulatory &quot;price control&quot; process. This process provides the companies with future revenue levels and incentives to take forward efficient investment and running their systems.</p>

  <p>The transmission system operators develop projects to upgrade and reinforce transmission infrastructure within their area based on their assessment on what is required to run their network in an efficient manner. They submit these proposals to Ofgem for assessment and funding approval. Ofgem considers cost, and other factors such as need, for the electricity networks investment proposals put forward by network companies.</p>

  <p>The current transmission price control process (a Retail Price Index based process) runs from 2007-12. In that period Ofgem has agreed the transmission system operators can invest &pound;3.8 billion in grid and network development. Detail is at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.ofgem.gov.uk/Networks/Trans/Archive/TPCR4/Pages/TPCR4.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.ofgem.gov.uk/Networks/Trans/Archive/TPCR4/Pages/TPCR4.aspx</a>.</p>

  <p>In addition, on 25 January 2011 Ofgem also announced a &pound;95 million investment package over the next two years to increase the capacity of Scotland&rsquo;s power networks. Detail can be found at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.ofgem.gov.uk/Pages/MoreInformation.aspx?file=ScotlandUpgrade25012011.pdf&amp;refer=Media/PressRel" target="_blank">http://www.ofgem.gov.uk/Pages/MoreInformation.aspx?file=ScotlandUpgrade25012011.pdf&amp;refer=Media/PressRel</a>.</p>

  <p>This price control period has been extended to 2013 as Ofgem transitions to an output performance-based approach to regulate energy networks. This RIIO model (Revenue = Incentives + Innovation + Outputs), covering eight year periods, will set regulatory price controls beyond 2013.</p>

  <p>The two Scottish transmission licensees are required by their licence obligations to assist National Grid, as System Operators of the National Electricity Transmission System, in preparing detail on the timing and scope of planned grid investment (as opposed to funding). Specific detail is available in the resulting &quot;Seven Year Statement&quot; at <a href="http://www.nationalgrid.com/uk/Electricity/SYS/current/" target="_blank">http://www.nationalgrid.com/uk/Electricity/SYS/current/</a>.</p>

These notices advised members of the public to submit representations to <a href="mailto:energyconsents@scotland.gsi.gov.uk">energyconsents@scotland.gsi.gov.uk</a> , which is the enquiries email address for the Energy Consents and Deployment Unit (ECDU).

The only exception is that those post offices which received funds under the 2010-11 scheme will not be eligible to apply again. Application forms have been published online today and we will be contacting all eligible sub-postmasters to encourage them to apply.

  <p>If it is identified that an adult prisoner may need speech and language therapy as part of their case management or clinical care a referral for consideration can be made to the NHS board where the prison is located.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Prison Service has a contract with NHS Forth Valley for the provision of a speech and language therapist to assess and provide appropriate support for young offenders referred by staff in HMYOI&rsquo;s Polmont and Cornton Vale.</p>

  <p>The publication of the final report of the Fingerprint Inquiry is not a matter for ministers, it is a matter for the inquiry chairman.</p>

  <p>However, should the chairman decide to publish during the dissolution of the Parliament, there is no impediment in law to the publication of the final report of the Fingerprint Inquiry in that period.</p>

  <p>Section 26 of the Inquiries Act 2005 requires the report to &quot;be laid by the Minister, either at the time of publication or as soon afterwards as is reasonably practicable, before the relevant Parliament or Assembly.&quot;</p>

  <p>If the chairman decides that the report is to be published when the Parliament is dissolved, it could reasonably and practicably be laid before the Parliament when Parliament reconvened.</p>

  <p>A strategic environmental assessment (SEA) of the National Renewables Infrastructure Plan (N-RIP) was undertaken, in accordance with the Environmental Assessment (Scotland) Act 2005, and the Environmental Report was published for consultation in September 2010. The purpose of the SEA was to identify potential environmental effects and measures for their mitigation, and to ensure that this information is made available when decisions are made by site owners to progress individual sites contained within the N-RIP. In this way, it was considered that the SEA would assist site developers and investors by providing information about the potential environmental issues pertaining to the development of the individual sites, and how they can best be overcome.</p>

  <p>A considerable amount of work is currently being undertaken on the potential environmental effects of offshore wind, wave and tidal renewable energy in Scotland and across the UK.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is working with other regulators, scientific bodies and industry to deliver a co-ordinated environmental research and monitoring programme to tackle gaps in knowledge and facilitate the commissioning of research projects to inform the licensing process and ensure good environmental data is available to planners, regulators and developers.</p>

  <p>The current work programme consists of 19 ongoing research projects which are carried out by a range of organisations including Marine Scotland Science and research institutes. The total funding for these projects is &pound;1.3 million, of which just over &pound;1 million has been provided by the Scottish Government.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is working with the Natural Environment Research Council to develop a series of three new research projects which address aspects of the environmental interactions of marine renewable energy developments.</p>

  <p>Mitigation can be identified at the strategic level through the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) and Habitats Regulations Appraisal (HRA) processes. The Scottish Government has undertaken a strategic SEA and HRA for offshore wind energy in Scottish Territorial Waters. An SEA for marine renewables (wave and tidal) was undertaken in 2007. Work is currently beginning on an Appraisal of Sustainability for marine renewables which will refresh the 2007 SEA and also include a strategic level HRA. Further detailed assessment and identification of appropriate mitigation measures for individual developments must be made at the project level.</p>

  <p>The Survey, Deploy and Monitor policy, which is currently being developed by Marine Scotland and SNH, will provide a pragmatic, risk based approach to allow the deployment of renewables and will be a key tool to facilitate the delivery of initial demonstration projects. In addition, research and the demonstration strategy are focused on tackling environmental issues.</p>

  <p>The licensing process delivers mitigation by ensuring that any licence issued for relevant activities has appropriate conditions. Any conditions put in place with regard to a licence would be enforced by Marine Scotland.</p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise created the National Renewables Infrastructure Fund (N-RIF) to support, where necessary, development of port and near-port manufacturing locations for offshore wind turbines and related developments including test and demonstration activity, with the overall aim of stimulating an offshore wind supply chain in Scotland. This reflects the priorities highlighted in the National Renewable Infrastructure Plan and recognised the potential need for public funding to act as a catalyst in attracting vital capital investment to support these locations to attract major manufacturing projects. There is no intention at present to broaden the eligibility for funding from N-RIF.</p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise is currently in discussion with a number of port and harbour bodies to assist them in identifying potential business opportunities in support of the operation and maintenance of future offshore energy developments. Servicing and maintenance operations are more likely to require to be located close to the operating site for logistical reasons. This would not rule out support where a strong case can be made for other forms of public intervention.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government strongly encourages wind farm developers to use the guidance and calculator provided by the publication <em>Calculating carbon savings from wind farms on Scottish peat lands - A New Approach</em> to estimate carbon payback time when submitting applications for developments on peat lands. Where the application is for over 50 MW the consent of the Scottish Ministers is required. This publication is available from the Scottish Government website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/06/25114657/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/06/25114657/0</a> .</p>

  <p>Improvements to the calculator are currently being carried out to factor in impacts on forestry, which will allow developers to estimate carbon payback time. The effects of clear felling on payback time will depend on a number of factors including the characteristics of the model of wind turbine and the surrounding forestry, and the nature and extent of any replanting of felled forestry which may be planned. It is anticipated that an improved calculator will be published in May.</p>

  <p>Where woodland removal is proposed the Scottish Government&rsquo;s second National Planning Framework (NPF2) and Scottish Planning Policy (SPP) state a presumption in favour of protecting woodland resources. The SPP states &quot;Woodland removal should only be allowed where it would achieve significant and clearly defined additional public benefits. In appropriate cases compensatory planting may form part of the balance. The criteria for determining the acceptability of woodland removal and further information on the implementation of the policy is explained in the Control of Woodland Removal Policy.&quot; This policy, and associated guidance, are publicly available from <a href="http://www.forestry.gov.uk/woodlandremoval" target="_blank">http://www.forestry.gov.uk/woodlandremoval</a>.</p>

  <p>The separation between wind turbines and trees depends on many factors, including local topography; the ambient wind regime; the size and type of turbines, and the height and species of tree - as such there is no standard distance. It has been amply demonstrated that turbines can successfully be installed in Scottish forests with minimum disruption and with enhancement of habitats such as at Whitelee near Glasgow.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is fully supportive of the EU Small Business Act, which complements our Government Economic Strategy and Purpose. The Scottish Government welcomes the European Commission&rsquo;s intention to review the Small Business Act as a helpful opportunity to examine progress made to embed the principles and implement its specific measures.</p>

  <p>While we have not undertaken any formal evaluation or assessment to quantify the cumulative impact of the range of measures under the Small Business Act, it is important to identity what more needs to be done to ensure momentum is maintained to further improve the EU business environment for SMEs. We will take account of any new ideas or approaches that emerge in due course from the review.</p>

  <p>This is primarily a matter of contractual law and civil enforcement between those who own and those who use such private car parks. There is also significant case law that applies in Scotland. For example, the High Court concluded in 1992 that wheel clamping on private land amounted to theft and that the demand for payment of a release fee amounted to extortion. We therefore have no plans for further regulation.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is very supportive of the Prince&rsquo;s Scottish Youth Business Trust&rsquo;s (PSYBT) Revolving Loan Fund. This provides young people with access to loans of up to &pound;5,000 to set up in business and offers a valuable aftercare service to successful applicants from a large number of volunteer business people across Scotland. PSYBT is particularly concerned with creating opportunities for disadvantaged young people. In 2009-10 and 2010-11, the Scottish Government, through Scottish Enterprise, enhanced the resources available to PSYBT by investing &pound;200,000 per annum in the Revolving Loan Fund. It has also recently successfully secured ERDF to provide a tailored package of coaching and mentoring assistance to 1,700 young people over the next three years.</p>

  <p>Under the auspices of Financial Services Advisory Board (FISAB), work has already been undertaken, including desk based research and consultation with a number of key stakeholders, looking at the microcredit market in Scotland and considering whether gaps exist. With regard to youth microcredit, the Prince&rsquo;s Scottish Youth Business Trust (PSYBT) is seen as the main provider of support to young people and there is currently no evidence to suggest further provision is necessary.</p>
