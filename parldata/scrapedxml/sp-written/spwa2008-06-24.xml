  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-11560 on 17 April 2008. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can found at <a href="../../../webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a> .</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has taken steps to improve opportunities for asylum seekers and their families in areas which are currently within our remit. For example, we announced in August 2007 that the children of asylum seekers would have the same access to higher and further education as Scottish children. The regulations came into force on 1 December 2007.</p>

  <p>The successful applications to the Race, Religion and Refugee Funding Stream 2008-11 will be announced shortly. This will include a number of projects aimed at improving opportunities for asylum seekers and their families such as increasing employability and facilitating access to services.</p>

  <p>The Serious Organised Crime Taskforce aims to identify priorities for tackling serious organised crime in Scotland by making recommendations to Scottish ministers; sharing best practice; improving co-ordination between the law enforcement agencies, and making proposals for legislation and other measures to tackle serious organised crime.</p>

  <p>There have been a number of announcements of recommendations and priorities following taskforce discussions. For example, we have already announced our intention to bring forward proposals for offences of directing or being involved in organised crime; that we are reinvesting a proportion of proceeds of crime back into asset recovery work; that I have written to the Home Secretary with suggestions for strengthening the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and we have drawn attention to some recent successes by the agencies involved in tackling organised crime. Copies of the news releases are available at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases</a>.</p>

  <p>We will publish our proposals for legislative change when it is appropriate to do so.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is keen to see Gaelic medium education promoted throughout Scotland and for access to be for all families with an interest. The day-to-day promotion of Gaelic medium education is largely a matter for Scottish local authorities and for B&ograve;rd na G&agrave;idhlig.

  <p>Nine NHS boards have indicated that they are either providing 50% support for the services provided by Scottish Motor Neurone Disease Association (SMNDA), or are in the process of developing an agreement.</p>

  <p>As I said in my letter to Chief Executives in July 2007, I would wish all NHS boards to formalise their working arrangements with voluntary organisations such as the Scottish Motor Neurone Disease Association which provide services and staff. This is in line with our policy on engaging with the third sector, as set out in <em>Better Health, Better Care</em>.</p>

  <p>The grant allocation at the beginning of each financial year is a single figure which includes provision for all relevant elements of the Affordable Housing Investment Programme (AHIP). In addition to the provision of affordable housing for rent this includes an allocation for grant mechanisms providing low cost home ownership (LIFT) and Grants for the Physical and Social Environment. The allocation for affordable housing for rent is not recorded separately.</p>

  <p>The grant allocation for the Affordable Housing Investment Programme for each year since 2003-04 for the local authorities requested is in table 1 below. This shows the allocation in constant terms. Table 2 provides details of the total homes approved for development over the same period for all tenures.</p>

  <p>Planned expenditure for 2008-09 by local authority area is set out in the answer to question S3W-13606 on 30 May 2008. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at:</p>

  <p><a href="../../../webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a>.</p>

  <p>Over the period 2008-11 the government will be providing investment of over &pound;1.5 billion for affordable housing across Scotland. &pound;493 million in 2008-09, &pound;566 million in 2009-10 and &pound;591 million in 2010-11. Taking into account the local government settlement this is 19% more than planned by the previous administration for 2005-08. Over the period 2008-11 the government aims to deliver more than 21,500 new affordable homes nationally which is in line with levels of approvals achieved for 2005-08 despite increasing costs. These will be split 6,000 in 2008-09, 7,100 in 2009-10 and 8,400 in 2010-11.</p>

  <p>Details of the programme split by local authority for 2009-10 will be available nearer the time.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-06-24.S3W-14169.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80349" speakername="Stewart Maxwell" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa0624.htm#7">

  <p>The grant allocation at the beginning of each financial year is a single figure which includes provision for all relevant elements of the Affordable Housing Investment Programme (AHIP). In addition to the provision of affordable housing for rent this includes an allocation for grant mechanisms providing low cost home ownership (LIFT) and grants for the physical and social environment. The allocation for affordable housing for rent is not recorded separately.</p>

  <p>The grant allocation for AHIP for each year since 2003-04 for the local authorities requested is in table 1 below. This also shows the allocation in real terms.</p>

  <p>Planned expenditure for 2008-09 by local authority area is set out in the answer to question S3W-13606 on 30 May 2008. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at:</p>

  <p><a href="../../../webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a>.</p>

  <p>Over the period 2008-11 the Scottish Government will be providing investment of over &pound;1.5 billion for affordable housing across Scotland. &pound;493 million in 2008-09, &pound;566 million in 2009-10 and &pound;591 million in 2010-11. Taking into account the local government settlement this is 19% more than planned by the previous administration for 2005-08. Over the period 2008-11 the Scottish Government aims to deliver more than 21,500 new affordable homes nationally which is in line with levels of approvals achieved for 2005-08 despite increasing costs. These will be split 6,000 in 2008-09, 7,100 in 2009-10 and 8,400 in 2010-11.</p>

  <p>Details of the programme split by local authority for 2009-10 will be available nearer the time.</p>

  <p>The number of anti-depressants prescribed in 2007-08 increased by 7.7% between April 2007 and March 2008.</p>

  <p>This is an expected and direct consequence of changes to the Quality and Outcomes Framework under which general practitioners are remunerated, which encourages the identification and treatment of depression.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government, working with NHS boards and other partners, is developing greater availability of psychological therapies and self-help approaches in line with the evidence base for effective treatment of depression.</p>

  <p>We believe that over time this will help achieve our target to reduce the annual rate of increase of defined daily dose per capita of anti-depressants to zero by 2009-10 and put in place the required support framework to achieve a 10% reduction in future years.</p>

  <p>This is an operational matter for NHS 24.</p>

  <p>NHS 24 is almost seven years into a 10 year contract with British Telecommunications (BT) for the delivery of the organisation&rsquo;s telephony infrastructure and service. As part of the delivery of this service, NHS 24 and BT are in constant discussions about the ongoing operation and improvements which can be made to both the service provided by BT and the contract.</p>

  <p>NHS 24 operates a low rate 08454 number. This means that no matter which operator the caller uses when phoning from a landline, the caller only incurs a minimal cost. As every caller would have their own operator and subsequently a call package or contract tailored for their use, no single value for a call to NHS 24 can be given, although NHS 24 does cover the more substantial part of the cost.</p>

  <p>Similarly the cost of calls to NHS 24 from mobile phones are dependent on the call tariff levied by the caller&rsquo;s specific network operator. NHS 24 have a policy of calling mobile phone users back if they have insufficient credit on their phones to cover the time period necessary for their call to NHS 24.</p>

  <p>Every NHS board, including NHS 24, is subject to a process of public review and scrutiny as part of the annual review process. The forthcoming annual review of NHS 24, covering the 2007-08 period, will take place on Tuesday 12 August 2008.</p>

  <p>In addition, NHS 24 publishes a regular chief executive&rsquo;s report on it&rsquo;s website. This report reviews the performance of NHS 24 on a range of targets and indicators.</p>
