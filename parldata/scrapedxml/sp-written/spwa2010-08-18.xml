  <p>During the last three complete financial years, the Scottish Government has directly supported renewable energy research and development activity and the total amount spent is as follows:</p>

  <p><table width="25%" border="BORDER" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#CCCCCC">
<tr>
<td width="57%" align="center" valign="top">Financial Year</td>
<td width="43%" align="center" valign="top">Spend</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td width="57%" valign="top">2009-10</td>
<td width="43%" align="right" valign="top">&pound;1,042,641</td>
</tr>
</table></p>

  <p>This expenditure was principally made under the Wave And Tidal Energy Support Scheme (WATES), and has supported investment including Aquamarine, Wavegen and ScottishPower Renewables.</p>

  <p>A wide range of organisations receive financial support from the Scottish Government and provide additional investment in renewables research and development, including Scottish Enterprise (SE), Highlands and Islands Enterprise and The Carbon Trust.</p>

  <p>One example is the SE Wave And Tidal Energy: Research, Development and Demonstration Support<em> </em>(WATERS) scheme. On 6 July, this year, &pound;13 million of support to five marine energy projects through the WATERS scheme was announced.</p>

  <p>This does not include support given indirectly via our Universities through organisations including the Scottish Funding Council and Research Councils UK.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has no current plans to review publicly funded energy efficiency and environmental performance advisory bodies. We are however planning as part of our approach to the Low Carbon Economy to develop a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of energy and resource efficiency advice to business.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government funds both the Energy Saving Trust (EST) and the Carbon Trust, to provide energy efficiency support across all sectors. EST provide advice to householders and small businesses through the Energy Saving Scotland advice network, while the Carbon Trust support larger companies and the public sector.</p>

  <p>We also fund the Zero Waste Scotland programme which delivers a range of initiatives to help businesses, local authorities, consumers and the third sector to reduce waste, recycle more and use resources sustainably.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many operations and treatments have been carried out in the independent health care sector on behalf of NHS patients in each of the last 10 years.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-08-18.S3W-34007.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80396" speakername="Nicola Sturgeon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa0818.htm#2">

  <p>As described in the answer to question S3W-21983 on 27 March 2009 the information relating to the activity undertaken for NHS patients through independent hospitals is known to have been under-reported in the past. Since 2007 steps have been taken to improve the recording of this activity. Given these concerns with data quality, which go back a number of years, it is not possible to provide a meaningful trend from the centrally collected statistics.</p>

  <p>Table 1 shows the number of records received by ISD relating to discharges from independent acute hospitals. Table 2 shows the number of records received by ISD from the joint NHS/independent facility at the Scottish Regional Treatment Centre (SRTC) at Stracathro Hospital. The SRTC was established in January 2007 and was provided by the independent sector provider Netcare. This contract expired in January 2010 and the Centre is now managed by NHS Tayside.</p>

  <p>As the figures in table 1 demonstrate, interpretation of these figures should be made with caution given the considerable variation in the number of recorded discharges year on year.</p>

  <p>When this Government came to power we ceased direct central funding for independent sector activity. Prior to 2007 approximately &pound;15 million per annum was provided from central funding to support independent sector activity in Scotland. In the latest year for which data is available (2008-09), approximately &pound;10 million was spent by the NHS, compared to the &pound;15+ million expenditure prior to 2006-07.</p>
