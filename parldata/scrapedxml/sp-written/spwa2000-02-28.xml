  <p>The Scottish Executive is currently funding a national development project on adult literacy that will produce good practice guidelines for practitioners. As part of that project, a survey was carried out last year of the pattern and nature of provision by education authorities to meet adults' literacy and numeracy learning needs. The survey report will be issued to the education authorities - as agreed at the time of the survey - as soon as it is printed, sometime next month.</p>

  <p>The project is scheduled to complete its work this summer with a report to the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>I have received representations from various sectors of the farming industry expressing concerns about a pesticides tax. These views have been made known in correspondence and, more recently, at meetings I have had with arable farmers.</p>

  <p>I am concerned that any pesticides tax should not encourage farmers to use cheaper and less effective pesticides, possibly in greater quantities than those currently used. I am also concerned that such a change would adversely affect the quality of some crops. It will be important to ensure that any tax proposals which may emerge do not result in such perverse effects which would benefit neither farmers nor the environment.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has received written or oral confirmation from Franz Fischler, European Commissioner, that compensation for costs to the pig industry as a result of BSE of &pound;5.26 per pig would breach European rules on state aid.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-02-28.5.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80155" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa0228.htm#2274">

  <p>Approaches to the European Commission are generally conducted through MAFF after consultation, where appropriate, with the devolved agriculture departments in the UK. Accordingly, the Scottish Executive has not separately received any communication from Franz Fischler on whether compensation for the pig industry would breach European rules on the state aid.</p>

  <p>UK Government officials have explored the possibility of a pig offal disposal scheme with the European Commission. In principle, Community rules might permit the payment of state aid in this area but there appears to be limited scope to frame a sensible and worthwhile scheme which satisfies the strict EU guidelines and meets the requirements of the industry. The Commission will certainly not sanction any scheme which fails to meet the rules; and we could not contemplate paying an illegal aid. The rules preclude the payment of operating aids, i.e. subsidies that are simply aimed at improving producers&#8217; position in the market.</p>

  <p>There is no evidence to support the quoted figure of 16-18 million corncrakes. The internationally accepted method of calculating the corncrake population is by numbers of singing males. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) currently indicates a global corncrake population which fluctuates annually between 1.6 and 3 million singing males.</p>

  <p>Funding from Scottish Natural Heritage to encourage farmers and crofters to manage land in a manner that meets the needs of the corncrake is shown below.</p>

  <p>Many Borders textile companies, particularly those specialising in cashmere, achieved good sales growth last year. However, competitive pressures continue to grow in this sector and future prospects will therefore depend largely on companies positioning themselves most advantageously in the specialist markets in which they excel. Scottish Borders Enterprise is undertaking particular initiatives to help companies become more competitive and, with its recently launched website, is helping to market Borders textiles worldwide. Borders textiles companies also benefit from a broad range of support measures available from the Scottish Executive across Scotland.</p>

  <p>Now that the map of full and transitional eligibility for Objective 2 status in the new Programming round has been approved in principle by the Commission, Plan Teams in each area representing the locally-based partnerships have been working to complete draft Single Programming Documents (SPDs). I am pleased that each Plan Team has today published for consultation draft SPDs. Copies of each have been placed in SPICe.</p>

  <p>At this stage each draft SPD reflects the emerging consensus among the locally based Partnerships and I have not as yet formed a considered view on them. I shall be keen to consider the responses to consultation and to have discussed the matter with the European Committee before reaching a final view on the text to be submitted to the Commission.</p>

  <p>In reaching my final view on the plans for each area I will want to see that each plan reflects the needs of the area as well as wider policy objectives. I am therefore pleased that each Plan Team has reflected in its programme the priorities of the Scottish Executive, especially in relation to economic development, social justice, sustainable development and equal opportunities, alongside European, UK and local priorities. I am also pleased that each plan aims to ensure maximum economic and social impact and effective strategic review. There is also an important focus on helping areas of need wherever they are situated in both full and transitional areas.</p>

  <p>There is no central policy on the disposition of beds for particular types of patient.</p>

  <p>The majority of acute orthopaedic and trauma patients are elderly patients with fractured hips who often have other medical complications. In addition to available beds, optimum care for these patients is dependent primarily on the provision of the appropriate mix of suitably qualified staff.</p>

  <p>The disposition of beds and staffing among the different specialities and hospitals is for agreement between the clinicians and managers at local level, looking always for the options that provide optimum care for patients.</p>

  <p>The Orlit house type was designated as defective under the Housing Defects Act 1984. The Act provided financial assistance for the owners of defective houses bought from a public sector authority before 26 April 1984.

  <p>The new student support scheme, including the Graduate Endowment, will be introduced in academic year 2001-02. The details of the new scheme will be subject to consultation. However, the proposal is that the new arrangements should apply only to those who begin their course in or after 2001. Students who are currently in the system, and those who begin in academic year 2000-01, will continue under the present arrangements until they complete their programme of study. They will not be required to pay the Graduate Endowment and will not have access to the new support package.

  <p>The Scottish Executive has a range of plans to encourage cycling and walking.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive held a major conference on cycling on 6 December, at which I emphasised the important part cycling has to play in an integrated transport policy, and the wider benefits it brings, notably for health.</p>

  <p>On 21 December, I launched <i>Cycling by Design</i>. These are the first comprehensive design guidelines for cycling infrastructure to be published by any central government department in the United Kingdom and take Scotland to the fore in implementing the UK National Cycle Strategy.</p>

  <p>I also intend to commission a full evaluation of the recent Cycle Challenge Scheme under which the Government awarded some &pound;625,000 to 37 separate cycle projects in Scotland. The outcome of the evaluation will help to identify where resources may be used to best effect in the future.</p>

  <p>On walking, I intend to develop guidance for our local authorities on the role walking can play as a mode of transport.</p>

  <p>The provision of cycling and walking infrastructure in Scotland is a matter for the roads authorities - the Scottish Executive for trunk roads and the local authorities for other roads. It is for them to determine their priorities within the context of their expenditure plans and programmes. In respect of trunk roads I have endorsed the Trunk Road Cycling Initiative and have also strengthened it financially by raising its original value of &pound;5 million to almost &pound;6 million. This is being used to provide cycling infrastructure related to the trunk road network. Estimates for future work are at present under preparation.</p>

  <p>Our guidance to local authorities on the development of their Local Transport Strategies made clear that they should produce local walking and cycling strategies as part of their overall transport strategy. In addition, cycling and walking projects are eligible for support from the Public Transport Fund provided they meet the criteria established for the operation of the fund.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive provides local authorities with a block allocation for expenditure on a number of services. It is for each local authority to consider the priority to be given to cycle training, in terms of all the services for which it is responsible, and to allocate resources accordingly. These arrangements give local authorities flexibility to determine what measures are required to meet local needs and circumstances. Accordingly, the Scottish Executive has no plans to provide funding specifically for cycle training.</p>

  <p>Information about the level of funding of cycle training by individual local authorities is not available centrally.</p>

  <p>I understand that Railtrack is currently working with Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive to assess options for providing a rail link to Glasgow Airport. A rail link to Edinburgh airport has also been examined a number of times.</p>

  <p>A total of &pound;18.3 million has been made available by the Executive for the Freight Facilities Grant scheme in Scotland over the next three years. This scheme provides capital grants to assist companies to take freight off the roads and on to rail and inland waterways. To date the Executive has received no applications or notes of interest for grants for rail freight links to airports.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive, through the forthcoming Transport Bill, intend to provide local authorities with the power to require the setting up of joint ticketing arrangements where they conclude that existing provisions are inadequate.</p>

  <p>Some public transport operators already offer pricing initiatives and we would expect other operators to recognise the commercial benefits in terms of increased patronage and revenue generation. Such initiatives should have regard to competition legislation. No representations have been made to the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions on joint ticketing or pricing initiatives.</p>
