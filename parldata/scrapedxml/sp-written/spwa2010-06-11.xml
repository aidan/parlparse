  <p>I understand that this question relates to pre-five education in East Ayrshire. I have had no meetings in my role as Minister for Children and the Early Years specifically to discuss this issue.

  <p>The Scottish Government has to date received two letters from parents regarding the Jacaranda Nursery in East Ayrshire.

  <p>While I wish to ensure that all children have access to high quality pre-school services, decisions on local services are for local authorities to plan and deliver to meet the needs of local families.

  <p>(a) Curriculum for Excellence is a curriculum for all young people, wherever they are learning.</p>

  <p>All young people are entitled to opportunities to develop skills for learning, skills for life and skills for work. This includes the development of practical skills and an understanding of the world of work.</p>

  <p>Those entitlements will drive the range of opportunities available to young people across all types of learning, including in special education.</p>

  <p>(b) Curriculum for Excellence remains the overarching framework for learning for those young people who have left special education. The Get Ready for Work programme provides a national work-based training framework for 16 to 19-year-olds who require tailored support in order to access employment. The focus of this intervention is on offering generic work skills rather than training for specific employment sectors and is tailored to meet the needs of the individual, including those who have left special education, and reflect local economic drivers.</p>

  <p>In addition, some vocational courses are available at further education colleges which have been designed specifically for young people who have recently left special education.</p>

Some staff are encouraged to return to work on a phased basis, with reduced workloads. This can reduce the overall time that staff are absent from work. Return to work plans give staff and line managers clear information on expectations during this period. Staff on sick leave are offered the services of the staff welfare officer and the Employee Assistance Programme, as well as support from HR.</p>

  <p><span lang=""><strong>Alex Neil: </strong>We welcome the report <em>Has Devolution Delivered for Women?</em> and anything which raises the importance of women&rsquo;s representation in politics.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">Scottish Government is supportive of increasing women&rsquo;s involvement in politics at all levels. We fund organisations, such as the Scottish Women&rsquo;s Convention and Engender, to encourage and empower a diverse range of women to become involved in the decision-making that impacts on their lives. They also work towards equal representation of women in government and public life.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">Ministers regularly promote the fact that, since devolution with increased numbers of women in the Scottish Parliament, issues of particular concern to women, such as violence against women, have risen in profile. They also warn against complacency because gains can be lost.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">Political parties have themselves the ability to take steps to increase women&rsquo;s representation in elected bodies such as the Scottish Parliament and local councils. For example, the Sex Discrimination (Election Candidates) Act 2002 ensures that single sex shortlists are permissible, and section 106 of the Equality Act 2010 will, when commenced, allow the UK Government to require political parties to publish information on the diversity of their candidates at Scottish Parliament elections.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">Political parties will have different approaches to the representation of women and may not all agree with taking specific measures to address under-representation. However, the current provision enables action to be taken, but does not require it of any political party.</span></p>

  <p><span lang=""><strong>Jim Mather: </strong>No consideration has been given to abandoning plans for further Homecoming events. On 25 May the independent evaluation of Homecoming Scotland 2009 was published by the leading economic and social development consultancy, EKOS. This research showed that Homecoming Scotland 2009 had been a huge success, attracting 95,000 additional visitors to Scotland and generating &pound;53.7 million in additional tourism revenue for Scotland, exceeding the &pound;44 million target by 22 percent. Given the success of last year&rsquo;s celebrations it makes strong economic sense to repeat the concept and a second Year of Homecoming will be staged in 2014, in the year that Scotland hosts the Commonwealth Games and the Ryder Cup and that marks the 700th anniversary of the Battle of Bannockburn.</span></p>

  <p><span lang=""><strong>Alex Neil: </strong>The Scottish Government is planning to spend &pound;48.8 million in 2010-11 to continue helping first time buyers in particular to access home ownership through the Low-cost Initiative for First Time Buyers (LIFT).

  <p><span lang="">the New Supply Shared Equity scheme </span></p>

  <p><span lang="">As well as funding housing associations to provide new homes, the New Supply Shared Equity scheme now also includes a new innovative trial being funded in partnership with private developers.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">In terms of this guidance, the constituent parts of the Scottish Government including Executive Agencies, must keep their asset portfolios under constant review with a view to disposing of surplus assets, i.e. property deemed non-essential in the context of not required for operational purposes in the medium to long-term, as quickly as possible.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">Before selling on the open market, any surplus property must be offered to other parts of Scottish Government and executive agencies under what are known as &quot;trawl procedures&quot;. These procedures ensure that all relevant business areas within Scottish Government are not required to compete on the open market for land already owned by Scottish ministers.</span></p>

  <p><span lang=""><strong>Kenny MacAskill: </strong>In my answer to question S3W-33743 on 1 June 2010, I made clear that the Scottish Government is absolutely committed to delivering 1,000 additional police officers in our communities by April 2011. The Scottish Government is providing the funding and I expect chief constables to continue to deliver on that commitment. At 31 March 2010 there were 17,409 police officers in Scotland.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">I also made clear in my statement to Parliament on 19 May 2010 that the extra funding provided specifically to recruit 1,000 extra officers should not be used for any other purpose. This message was conveyed to the chief constables when I met them on 18 January 2010, supported by civil servants. The President of the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland, Chief Constable Pat Shearer, has made it clear in his own statement issued on 18 May 2010 that:</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">&quot;Civil servants acting in their official capacity and in support of the Minister, advised that the funding had been made available specifically for the purpose of enhancing front line policing services.&quot;</span></p>
