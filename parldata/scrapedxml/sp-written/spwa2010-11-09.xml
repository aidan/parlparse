  <p>The Scottish Government has taken a number of initiatives to overcome barriers to entry into agriculture. In 2007 I asked the Tenant Farming Forum to consider what needed to be done to reduce the barriers to entry. We have responded positively to the forum&rsquo;s proposed package of measures. For example, we are currently placing an order before the Parliament agreeing to six out of the forum&rsquo;s eight proposed amendments to the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act. These measures are aimed at encouraging the release of more land into the farm tenancy market.</p>

  <p>To help overcome the financial barriers to entry, we also provide a range of funding support through the Scotland Rural Development Programme for young new entrants to farming and crofting. This includes a dedicated measure providing interest rate relief on a commercial business development loan and an establishment grant, together worth up to &pound;47,945, as well as a 10 per cent enhancement on capital grants for business development projects.</p>

  <p>We also support industry initiatives aimed at helping new entrants to acquire the business and other skills needed to be successful in farming and crofting.</p>

  <p>For the future, new entrant representatives sit on our stakeholder group set up to consider priorities for the next Common Agricultural Policy period (2014 to 2020), to ensure that the interests of new entrants are fully taken into account in the development of policies and measures for the next period.</p>

  <p>Since 2007 the number of limited duration tenancies and short limited duration tenancies have increased by 25 per cent and 35 per cent respectively.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Government are working with the Tenant Farming Forum to achieve leasing arrangements that will encourage the letting of more agricultural farm land by landowners in Scotland to tenant farmers. We are consulting on a draft order under provisions in the Public Services Reform (Scotland) Act 2010, to the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Acts of 1991 and 2003, based on proposals from the Tenant Farming Forum.</p>

  <p>Some of these changes will help to reduce unnecessary costs to landowners of providing agricultural farm land for tenant farmers, which can be significant (and therefore reflected in the rent), arising from the current agricultural tenancy legislation.</p>

  <p>Also, amongst other measures to support new entrants to farming, the Scottish Government was the first administration in the UK to introduce a dedicated new entrant&rsquo;s support measure through an interest rate relief subsidy of up to &pound;27,397 under the Scottish Rural Development Programme.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is continually analysing and testing the latest evidence on crime prevention both nationally and internationally to inform policy development and decision making. Officials liaise widely with researchers, partner organisations and government counterparts throughout the UK and abroad to share expertise and to ensure appropriate business, planning, education and other community safety interests are represented.</p>

  <p>We have provided funding of over &pound;770,000 over the three years 2008-11 for the Scottish Business Crime Centre to raise awareness of business crime, and support businesses to combat it. The main function of the centre is to provide practical advice to the business and commercial sectors on how to develop business crime reduction and prevention strategies, and aims to reduce business crime.</p>

  <p>We also work closely with the police-led Violence Reduction Unit (VRU) to identify, develop, promote and coordinate best practice in police work to tackle violent crime with record levels of investment into the VRU, in addition to &pound;500,000 for the &quot;No Knives Better Lives&quot; youth engagement campaign launched in March 2009.</p>

  <p>Together with these partners and others we are collecting and sharing evidence of best practice which, along with record police numbers, has led to the lowest levels of recorded crime in 32 years.</p>

  <p>Following the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s ratification of the Budget (Scotland) Act on 3 February 2010, which formalised the Scottish Government&rsquo;s reluctant decision to cancel the Glasgow Airport Rail Link (GARL) branch line works; and in accordance with the requirements of the: Scottish Public Finance Manual (SPFM); the Scottish Government undertook an internal trawl of all of its Departments and Agencies to ascertain whether there was any other legitimate use that the land, previously acquired under compulsory powers for the GARL project, could be put to. The internal trawl concluded that there was no other use for the land and consequently it was deemed to be &quot;surplus to requirements&quot;. Therefore in accordance with the statutory obligations of the Glasgow Airport Rail Link Act (2007) &ndash; Section 44 Application of Crichel Downs Rules was applied.</p>

  <p>We have been in consultation with the following parties in order to comply with the requirements of the SPFM and Crichel Down rules:</p>

  <p>Previous land owners</p>

  <p>District Valuation Office</p>

  <p>Land agents</p>

  <p>Legal advisors</p>

  <p>The Scottish Parliament has been informed of the intention to dispose of land, purchased under Compulsory Powers and subsequently deemed &quot;surplus to requirements&quot;, and I would refer the member to the answer to questions: S3W-31078 on 4 February 2010; S3W-32289 on 19 March 2010; S3W-33248 on 23 April 2010; and S3W-33171 on 22 April 2010. Answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="../../../Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx</a>.</p>

  <p>The discussions that we have had with the previous owners of the land acquired using compulsory powers is set out in the following table:</p>

  <p>NHS boards are responsible for providing NHS services in accordance with national and local priorities and in line with the health needs of the population. Decisions regarding the care of individual patients are a matter of professional judgement for the clinician responsible for the patient&rsquo;s care.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s current policy in relation to NHS provision of complementary or alternative medicines, including acupuncture, is that these may offer relief to some people suffering from a wide variety of conditions, and it is open to NHS boards in Scotland to make such services available based on an assessment of needs within their respective areas</p>

  <p>Guidance was issued to NHS boards in August 2005, to remind them that this option is open to them. The letter, NHS Circular HDL (2005) 37, is available at:</p>

  <p>We believe that the recent changes to Support for Mortgage Interest will increase the number of home owners in Scotland facing financial difficulty and, potentially, at risk of repossession. However, we have put in place a number of measures to protect home owners in Scotland who are at risk of repossession.</p>

  <p>Firstly, we provide funding for the provision of debt advice, to try and help people in financial difficulty at an early stage. Secondly, we operate the Home Owners&rsquo; Support Fund, which includes the Mortgage to Rent and Mortgage to Shared Equity schemes, for those who are at risk of repossession and are unable to trade down. Home owners receiving support from UK schemes, and who are still at risk of their homes being repossessed, are entitled to apply for assistance. Thirdly, we have implemented the Home Owner and Debtor Protection (Scotland) Act 2010, which ensures that all repossession cases are subject to court scrutiny (except in cases of voluntary surrender); requires lenders to show in court that they have considered every reasonable alternative to repossession; and allows home owners to be represented in court by approved lay representatives.</p>

  <p>Performance improvement is a part of the duty of best value which, alongside an obligation to report on performance, is a requirement of local authorities under the Local Government in Scotland Act 2003. The Accounts Commission is working on behalf of the Scottish Government with local authorities to further develop the duty through the roll out of Best Value 2 audits.</p>

  <p>In terms of timing, I understand that further engagement is underway between management and staff on the proposals, and that the outcome of these discussions will inform the next steps and associated timeframe. Should any resulting proposals be considered major service change, they must be subject to formal public consultation and, ultimately, ministerial approval.</p>

  <p>Bus operators are required to inform local transport authorities of service changes 14 days prior to notifying changes to the Traffic Commissioner. This allows local transport authority officers time to spot errors in timetables or maps and advise operators of required changes that need to be made prior to submission of the application to the Traffic Commissioner. Operators are required to inform passengers of service changes 21 days prior to changes coming into effect. There are no current plans to amend this process.</p>
