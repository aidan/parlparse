  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many offences of selling alcohol to under-18s have been detected in the last 12 months as a result of the national roll-out of the test purchasing of alcohol; how many of these have resulted in (a) prosecution and (b) conviction of licensees operating (i) on-sales and (ii) off-sales premises as defined by the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976, and how many prosecutions for these offences are pending.</p>

  <p>Information available from police forces indicates that between December 2007 and January 2009, 187 reports to the Procurator Fiscal involving alcohol test purchase operations were made, four of which concerned on-sale premises.</p>

  <p>The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) case management system does not identify which reported contraventions of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976 concerning the sale of alcohol to under-18s arose from alcohol test purchasing operations. In the last year for which figures are available, April 2007 to March 2008, 619 charges under the provisions of the 1976 Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976 concerning the sale of alcohol to under-18s were reported by the police.</p>

  <p>To assist with a review of the operation of test purchases, a COPFS study in 2008, using information available from police forces, looked at 69 cases known to involve test purchase of alcohol and identified the outcomes of those cases as at June 2008 as follows.</p>

  <p>Schools are addressing indiscipline, including alcohol-related issues, through their learning programmes and also through the opportunities for learning and support that they provide for young people. <em> Curriculum for Excellence</em> will make a significant contribution, and this government is working with partners nationally and locally within this context to improve substance misuse education (covering alcohol as well as tobacco and drugs) in schools.</p>

  <p>This government is also funding the Positive Behaviour Team to work with local authorities and schools to promote and support the implementation of the most effective strategies for managing behaviour in schools. This includes whole school approaches which create a positive ethos and culture of respect and responsibility; prevent and resolve conflict, and address more serious indiscipline or additional behaviour needs.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government provides funding to NHS boards to tackle alcohol misuse and it is for each board, working with its partners, to determine which services and programmes should receive funding according to identified need.

  <p>The Scottish Government is generally supportive of community partnership activity to tackle alcohol misuse and considers that this can play a valuable role in reducing alcohol-related harm and under-age drinking, as well as tackling anti-social behaviour.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is not involved in the negotiations taking place at local authority level on equal pay. These are matters for local authorities as independent corporate bodies. However, I am aware that written evidence provided by COSLA to the Equal Opportunities Committee on 7 October 2008 states that 26 local authorities had implemented, or were extremely close to implementing, local single status and grading structures and that the remaining local authorities were moving towards implementation and were at an advanced stage.</p>

  <p>No decisions have been made on which applications should receive a share of the &pound;25 million to encourage council house building. Applications are being assessed jointly with COSLA at present using the following principles:</p>

  <p>The council has the ability to manage the new stock effectively.</p>

  <p>The council has prudential borrowing capacity and/or uses other financial resources.</p>

  <p>The required subsidy for any proposed development from the Scottish Government will be less than &pound;25,000 per home.</p>

  <p>The area has housing need and the new homes will contribute to the council meeting its 2012 homelessness target.</p>

  <p>The council can demonstrate that it has well developed plans to ensure delivery of the proposed new housing.</p>

  <p>The skills of our medical specialists are world-renowned and we are prepared to offer their expertise if needed. Some of Scotland&rsquo;s hospitals may be able to receive patients from Gaza who require specialist care and I welcome the willingness of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and NHS Lothian to respond positively to requests for assistance with medical casualties, if need be. However, the number of casualties and which facilities could be used would be dependent on the clinical priorities of the patients concerned.</p>

  <p>Our general approach is to work through Scottish-based Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) which are involved in humanitarian work in Gaza, and have a presence on the ground there. This is necessary to allow clinical assessments and evaluation to be carried out in determining whether patients are suitable for treatment in Scotland, and would benefit from coming here, as opposed to being treated in the region or in a neighbouring country.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive which criminal charges against young people under-16 are regarded as appropriate for prosecution rather than reference to the children&rsquo;s hearing system and for what reasons.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-02-05.S3W-20253.r0" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Frank Mulholland QC" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa0205.htm#13">

  <p>There are four categories of case which must be jointly reported to the Reporter to the Children&rsquo;s Hearing and the Procurator Fiscal for discussion and therefore considered for prosecution.</p>

  <p>Where a child is under the age of 16 years, and, after discussion with the reporter, the decision is taken for the Procurator Fiscal to deal with the child, Crown Counsel&rsquo;s instructions must be obtained before proceedings are commenced. Where a child is in custody and the Procurator Fiscal considers that immediate solemn proceedings are justified, the child can be placed on petition and the matter reported to Crown Counsel within three days for instructions. Prosecution of a child under 16 can only proceed in certain categories of cases and on the general or specific instructions of the Lord Advocate. The categories are as follows:</p>

  <p>1. Offences which require by law to be prosecuted on indictment or which are so serious as normally to give rise to solemn proceedings on the instructions of the Lord Advocate in the public interest.</p>

  <p>2. Offences alleged to have been committed by children aged 15 years or over which in the event of conviction oblige or permit a court to order disqualification from driving.</p>

  <p>3. Offences alleged to have been committed by persons of over 16 years, who are under the supervision of a Children&rsquo;s Hearing and this are children as defined in section 93(2)(b)(ii) of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995.</p>

  <p>4. Breaches of antisocial behaviour orders allegedly committed by children aged 12 to 15 years (although there is a presumption that the Reporter will deal with these cases).</p>

  <p>The categories are further defined as follows:</p>

  <p>Category 1</p>

  <p>Offences which require by law to be prosecuted on indictment fall under two</p>

  <p>Heads:</p>

  <p>1. common law offences which are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the High Court of Justiciary namely treason, murder and rape, and</p>

  <p>2. statutory offences for which the statute only makes provision for prosecution on indictment or for a penalty on conviction on indictment - for example, contraventions of the Firearms Act 1968, Section 16, 17(1) and (2), and 18(1), the Road Traffic Act 1988, Section 1, and the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995 Section 5(1).</p>

  <p>Offences of culpable homicide, attempted murder, assault to the danger of life, sodomy, assault and robbery involving the use of firearms, attempted rape, incest and related offences (contrary to the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995 Sections 1-3) are offences which are normally indicted in the High Court of Justiciary.</p>

  <p>Other offences which may fall into this category as being those normally prosecuted on indictment are assault to severe injury or permanent disfigurement, assault with intent to rape, serious assault and robbery (in particular involving the use of weapons other than firearms), assault with intent to rob involving the use of firearms, fire-raising and malicious mischief causing or likely to cause great damage to property or danger to life, all Misuse of Drugs Act offences involving possession of Class A drugs and possession with intent to supply and supply of any controlled drugs.</p>

  <p>It should be emphasised that only offences which are normally prosecuted on indictment are to be reported to the Procurator Fiscal.</p>

  <p>Category 2</p>

  <p>This category applies exclusively to children aged 15 years or over. Children will be prosecuted for this type of offence only if the Procurator Fiscal considers that it would be in the public interest to obtain a disqualification which would still be in force when the child became 16 and that in the event of conviction it was likely that the court would impose such a disqualification. Minor Road Traffic Act offences carrying a liability to discretionary disqualification should not normally be reported.</p>

  <p>Category 3</p>

  <p>There is no restriction on the forum for the prosecution of children of or over 16 years of age who can be proceeded against in the district court.</p>

  <p>Category 4</p>

  <p>There is a presumption that the reporter will deal with these cases, following discussion with the Procurator Fiscal. Therefore, cases where 12 to 15-year-olds have been charged with a separate offence (section 9(3) of the Antisocial Behaviour etc (Scotland) Act 2004) should not be reported to the Procurator Fiscal unless the separate offence falls to be reported under another part of these Directions. However, children will only be prosecuted where the offending behaviour accompanying the breach is serious.</p>

  <p>When reporting to procurators fiscal cases against adults in which it is alleged that a child also committed the offence (not being an offence specified in categories 1 to 3) along with the adult, the report should state that a copy of the report has been sent to the reporter for action in respect of the child. The police should not include the child offender as a subject in the police report to the Procurator Fiscal.</p>

  <p>I meet regularly with Directors of Education at meetings arranged with the Association of Directors of Education in Scotland (ADES). These provide an opportunity for dialogue on progress and implementation of policy for education in Scotland. Such meetings have included our joint Dunkeld partnership events in April and October 2008, and ADES&rsquo; own conference at Cumbernauld last November.</p>

  <p>NHS Lanarkshire have confirmed that the clinical decision area is used predominantly for patients who have been assessed by a clinician and diagnosed as fit for discharge. During times of peak activity a very small number of accident and emergency patients, who are likely to be discharged, are moved to this area. Accident and emergency activity accounts for less than 5% of all patients in this area. All of these patients would previously have been triaged and seen by clinical staff and would be subject to the four hour target. The most common reason for patients using this area from accident and emergency is whilst they are awaiting results of diagnostic tests that take four hours or more for accurate processing.</p>

  <p>The basis of the decision acknowledges the key role that cleaning and other services play in the delivery of clinical services. The Scottish Government therefore believes that NHS Scotland staff should be responsible for the direct delivery of these services thus removing or reducing scope for complexity at the interface between contractor and the NHS.</p>

  <p>It is clear that when cleaning services are provided by NHS staff, it is easier to manage them and they can be better integrated. That means better patient care, a more seamless joining up of services and the ability to vary such services within hospitals, particularly cleaning services, when required.</p>

  <p>The basis of the decision was to ensure better patient care, a more seamless joining up of services and the ability to vary cleaning and other services within hospitals when required. Our health boards are responsible for demonstrating value for money through sharing best practice, benchmarking with others and delivering on performance targets. The main cost element in the provision of cleaning services is staff and for some time now the rates of pay and other terms and conditions whether provided in house are broadly comparable.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to answer to question S3W-16361 on 25 September 2008, for more detailed information. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at:</p>

  <p>Under the current programme for child health screening and surveillance, outlined in <em> Health for All Children (Hall 4)</em> issued as guidance to NHSScotland in 2005, it is recommended that children receive a pre-school vision screen (at three to five years of age). Where a pre-school vision screening programme is not in place, it is recommended vision testing is undertaken in primary 1.</p>

  <p>Some NHS boards use local systems to record vision screening results and therefore data for these boards are not available centrally. Information on pre-school and primary 1 vision checks is available for NHS boards which record results on the national child health systems. The latest available information on the percentage of children in primary 1 who received a vision check prior to school entry or in primary 1 is for school year 2007-08 and is shown in table 1 by local authority area. NHS boards are at different stages of implementation of pre-school vision screening and this may have affected the coverage figures in some areas whilst these programmes are put in place.</p>

  <p>The grading system is an operational matter for the Care Commission. It does not of course replace any of the statutory requirements or the provisions of the National Care Standards. It enables the Care Commission to exercise its responsibilities in a proportionate way.</p>

  <p>The grading system was introduced in April 2008, and applies to all the care services that the commission regulates, including day care of children. It was piloted with 170 care services across the spectrum of regulated services in 2007.</p>

  <p>The grading system is part of the commission&rsquo;s three-year Regulation for Improvement Project. Following widespread public consultation, the Project was a substantial component of the Care Commission&rsquo;s 2006-09 Corporate Plan, which received ministerial approval in March 2006. Its aim was to achieve targeted and proportionate regulation of care in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Ministers have received regular progress reports on the Project at their routine six-monthly meetings with the Care Commission&rsquo;s Convener and Chief Executive.</p>

  <p>The provision of rail services to Reston and East Linton is not one of the priced options secured under the ScotRail franchise extension. However, the option to operate additional services between Edinburgh and Dunbar is part of the franchise extension consultation being carried out by Transport Scotland. If implemented, that option will trigger a study into the feasibility of a Dunbar hourly service and this will also examine the possibility of further services.</p>

  <p>In considering the provision of new stations, ministers must balance the desire to attract new users against the impact on network capacity, and the needs of existing passengers whilst taking account of value for money and affordability.</p>

  <p>We have agreed with COSLA that local authorities will provide an additional 2,000 respite weeks in 2008-09, an additional 6,000 weeks in 2009-10 and an additional 10,000 weeks in 2010-11.

  <p>The power for the Scottish Government to borrow set out in section 66 of the Scotland Act 1998 makes clear such borrowing is for use on a temporary basis to cover the Scottish Government&rsquo;s cash requirements if that becomes necessary for any reason.</p>

  <p>No such requirements have arisen since devolution and consequently the powers have not been used, nor have any applications been made to the Secretary of State for Scotland or the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Given the nature of the power as it stands, it would not be possible to use it to borrow in order to invest in public capital works in Scotland or support resource expenditure in excess of expenditure limits set by the Treasury.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government continues to believe that Scotland&rsquo;s government should have the ability to borrow and this would require legislative change.</p>

  <p>To date there has been no official meetings with the Secretary of State or Chancellor of the Exchequer to discuss the topic although the Scottish Government has requested meetings with the Chancellor of the Exchequer on a number of occasions to begin the process of securing further fiscal powers for Scotland.</p>
