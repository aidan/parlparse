  <p>It is for Chief Constables to decide how best to tackle operational issues taking account of local guidance and also local needs and circumstances. Forces know the importance of using experienced interviewing officers and of developing in-force training, with the purpose of providing an atmosphere of care and concern, and will seek to ensure that victims of child prostitution are treated with tact and sympathy. While the Executive has not issued specific guidance to the police in this area, a working group chaired by the Scottish Executive is currently considering issues relating to young runaways and children abused through prostitution.</p>

  <p>Children should not be involved in prostitution and it is important that proper prevention, protection and re-integration strategies are in place to deal with this where it occurs. Children do not enter prostitution willingly. Their involvement is usually the result of coercion or deception. The police fully recognise that those who are responsible for the abuse and coercion of children in this way should be rigorously investigated and prosecuted. It is for individual Chief Constables to decide how best to tackle any operational issues, taking account of local needs and circumstances. A working group chaired by the Scottish Executive is currently considering issues relating to young runaways and children abused through prostitution.</p>

  <p>The new "Golden Hello" package which will be introduced on 1 August includes grants of up to &#163;10,000, based on the amount of NHS work they undertake, to dentists establishing new vocational training practices and offering a training place. Vocational training surgeries must be built and equipped to high standards and must comply with all health and safety requirements.</p>

  <p>Funding of infection control procedures are incorporated in the fee scale system where dentists receive payments for each item of service given on each patient. The British Dental Association Advice Sheet "Infection Control in Dentistry" is used as the model of good practice in primary care dental practices.</p>

  <p>Over the last three years the Executive has given improvement grants to general dental practices. These are for purposes of patient safety and access and to address the requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act. The sums involved are:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has commissioned a number of domestic abuse related research projects but none specifically into the prevalence of domestic abuse amongst people with disabilities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive's <em>National Strategy to Address Domestic Abuse</em> and its associated Action Plan, which were published in November 2000, provide a comprehensive and wide-ranging strategy that involves a number of policy areas. The strategy is an inclusive one and embraces and recognises the specific needs of different categories of victims including people with disabilities. A budget of &#163;4.5 million was allocated over three years to assist in the implementation of the Action Plan.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Needs Assessment Programme (SNAP) report on <em>Domestic Violence</em> (1997) gave an overview of research, which shows that women are more likely to report domestic abuse during pregnancy and that the majority experience repeated acts of violence. The research also indicates that domestic abuse increases in severity and frequency during pregnancy and is directed both at the mother and at the foetus.</p>

  <p>The Confidential Enquiries into Maternal Deaths in the UK (2001) report <em>Why Mothers Die 1997-1999</em> was jointly commissioned by the Chief Medical Officer of the Scottish Executive Health Department, the National Institute of Clinical Excellence and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety for Northern Ireland. The report indicates that about 30% of domestic violence starts during pregnancy. It states that of the 378 women whose deaths were reported between 1997-99, 45 (12%) voluntarily reported violence during pregnancy to a health care professional.</p>

  <p>Audit of NHS Board strategies for maternity services indicates that 11 NHS boards provide post qualifying training on domestic abuse, one was considering developing a training programme and in another analysis of midwives' training needs was under way. Of the remaining NHS boards, one has a domestic abuse strategy in place and one has not as yet indicated their position on domestic abuse training. Several NHS Boards refer to multi-agency working to tackle domestic abuse.</p>

  <p>National guidelines for health care workers on responding to domestic abuse, shortly to be issued for public consultation, recommend that education and training on domestic abuse be available to all health service staff.</p>

  <p>We do not make public the identity of subjects and organisations that take part in Scottish Executive commissioned research without first obtaining their consent. We do not have this consent from the schools that took part in the Programme for International Student Assessment. Assurance about anonymity is normally important in securing continued co-operation for research projects. The random stratified sampling procedure used by the contractors who carried out this study for the Scottish Executive ensured that the sample was representative and that it contained schools of varying sizes.</p>

  <p>As is its standard practice, Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) provided consultees, including community representatives, with all the scientific evidence relevant to the selection of the Sound of Barra as a possible Special Area of Conservation during it's consultation between September and December 2000.</p>

  <p>I have no evidence that SNH has withheld any of the relevant information. SNH has also firmly refuted the allegation in its submission to the Petitions Committee.</p>

  <p>Information in support of site designation was provided on request by the Sea Mammal Research Unit.

  <p>Whether the Council working group meetings are determined as continued meetings or separate meetings depends upon the meeting in question. If a meeting runs over two days and deals with the same topic on both days it would be considered to be the same meeting. However, in other cases different meetings on consecutive days come under the same generic topic but could actually be different working groups on each day (or indeed on the same day). These would be considered to be separate meetings.</p>

  <p>At the meeting of the Council of Ministers on 11 June, it was decided that total allowable catches will be adopted for some deep sea species. It was also agreed that a permit system should be introduced for vessels landing deep sea species. Some details of the permit arrangements, based on technical information, remain to be settled in the Management Committee. These include the amounts of deep water species, per trip and per year, that vessels ought to be allowed to catch and retain on board, tranship or load, without having to have a permit. The UK will participate fully in these discussions, as well as preparing to return to the substantive issues in the review of the management of deep-water species envisaged for 2005.</p>

  <p>The Commission's proposals for the management of the deep water fishery involved both total allowable catches and licensing (effort control). On 6 June, the Council Secretariat circulated the Spanish Presidency compromise proposal for discussion at the Council on 11 June. This also included both elements. On 10 June, Commissioner Fischler said publicly in London that he would not support the Presidency's compromise. On 11 June, during the Council meeting, the Presidency produced a further compromise proposal containing minor changes. The Commission decided to support this further compromise. The Commissioner did not give us any forewarning, though of course the UK was always aware that Commission support for a compromise solution could enable that solution to be adopted by qualified majority. The UK maintained its opposition because we did not think the changes made the proposal any less unacceptable.</p>

  <p>Information regarding activity and costs is not currently collated across sectors in a disease programme manner. Existing acute activity can be translated into Healthcare Resource Groups by the Information and Statistics Division, which allows activity groupings into main disease groups such as cancer and coronary heart disease. However, nothing similar can currently be done with information relating to services carried out in the community or primary care settings. A National Steering Group is currently being established which will look at developing a whole system approach to this, with a view of identifying activity, and costs, in recognised disease profiles.</p>

  <p>No such research has been undertaken or commissioned by the Scottish Executive nor do we believe such research is needed.

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not hold information of this type. This is essentially a matter for the company, the researchers and the individual volunteers involved in the study.</p>

  <p>The Bayer company has, however, confirmed that eight adult volunteers were exposed to the pesticide azinphos methyl in a laboratory study designed to determine the "no adverse effects level" for this material by looking for short-term changes in cholinesterase activity. The study was carried out in Scotland by a contract research organisation and was overseen by an independent ethics committee.</p>

  <p>I understand that this question relates to a study carried out by a contract research organisation in Scotland in which eight healthy adult volunteers were exposed to the organophosphate pesticide azinphos methyl. The study was based on an "ascending-dose protocol" wherein the dose to volunteers was increased from very low levels to those at which the first signs of changes in acetylcholinesterase were observable.

  <p>People with mental health problems may be referred to local smoking cessation services which should provide motivational support. Nicotine Replacement Therapy and Zyban are also available on prescription. In addition a smoking cessation "pathway" for patients has recently been established in the State Hospital at Carstairs.</p>

  <p>The Executive is aware that people with mental health problems may need additional help to enable them to stop smoking. ASH (Scotland) and HEBS are presently working up proposals to pilot smoking cessation services specifically for people with mental health problems who wish to quit.</p>

  <p>As at 31 May 2002, there were 38 patients approved for transfer to alternative care. 31 had waited more than three months since clinical agreement had been reached. Given that individual recommendations must be considered in each case, information on average length of wait for a transfer is not routinely collected.</p>

  <p>The policy on the care and treatment of mentally disordered offenders remains as set out in Management Executive Letter 1999(5), the key objective of which is that patients receive care and treatment appropriate to their needs, taking into account the safety consideration.</p>

  <p>A range of provision is proposed including the State Hospital and the existing and planned local forensic psychiatric accommodation and services. NHS Boards are at different implementation stages with a local forensic unit already established in Edinburgh and a planning application lodged in Glasgow. Plans are also being developed for other units and services in line with the published policy.</p>

  <p>State Hospital patients are entitled to access the full range of services provided by the Hospital according to their clinical needs, which are assessed on a regular basis. Movement of patients between care settings is a matter for clinical decision involving the referring and receiving clinical teams. Once agreed, individual transfers can take time depending on the arrangement to be put in place at the receiving facility or service. Patients who are the subject of an agreed transfer but for whom a place cannot immediately be arranged will of course continue to receive care within the State Hospital.</p>

  <p>Consignia, post offices and postal services are reserved matters. The Executive can only assist post offices to achieve devolved purposes.</p>

  <p>The Scottish National Rural Partnership's Report <em>Services in Rural Scotland</em> identified innovative approaches to service provision in rural areas and offered recommendations on how providers, including Consignia, might work with rural communities to identify and achieve their realistic service needs. In response to a recommendation, the Executive is facilitating meetings exploring the possibility of a joint pilot project involving Consignia and other service providers to test the "Community Mall" concept, which, it is envisaged, would improve the economic viability of core services.</p>

  <p>As part of a broad strategy aimed at providing support for communities in deprived urban areas, ministers are currently considering ways in which post offices located in these areas might be assisted. I will provide further details of this initiative shortly.</p>

  <p>The pilot of "Your Guide", a project which may have an impact on post offices including those in rural and deprived urban areas, was undertaken in Leicestershire and Rutland. Its purpose is to provide on a one stop shop basis, access to customers for a range of official transactions, information and advice. This is largely delivered through kiosk based applications supplemented by leaflets, telephone helplines and face to face contact. An interim report has been published and this is being evaluated by Scottish Executive officials. A final report is expected in the near future. The Scottish Executive is continuing to work closely with the Department of Trade and Industry and Consignia in relation to the possibility of a national roll out of the project.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many road traffic accidents there were on (a) the A725 and (b) the A71 in (i) 2000 and (ii) 2001 in each local authority area and how many fatalities and serious injuries there were in each case.</p>

  <p>Data about injury road accidents are collected by the police and reported to the Scottish Executive using the STATS 19 statistical report form. These returns cover only road accidents in which one or more people were injured: they do not cover damage only accidents.</p>

  <p>The table gives the numbers of road accidents which were identified in the STATS 19 returns as occurring on (a) the A725 and (b) the A71 in the specified years, and the associated fatalities and serious casualties. The information is broken down by local authority area.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that the statistics given in the table are based upon the data which are held in the central statistical database and which were collected by the police at the time of the accident and subsequently reported to the Executive. They may differ from any figures which the local authorities would provide now, because they do not take account of any subsequent changes or corrections that local authorities may have made to the statistical information, for use at local level, about the location of each accident, based upon their knowledge of the roads and areas concerned.</p>

  <p>The annual allocation to local authorities of consent to incur capital expenditure is a general consent for expenditure on their non-housing capital programmes, including education. The consent is distributed amongst authorities on the basis of a formula agreed with COSLA, and is neither programme nor project specific. Within that framework, it is for the authorities to specify the materials to be used for particular school building projects and purposes.</p>
