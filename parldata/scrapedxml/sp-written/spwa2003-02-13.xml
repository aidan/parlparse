  <p>Any assessment of the impact of the recent proposals to reform the CAP is dependent upon the detail of the provisions. Much of this is only becoming available in on-going working group discussions in Brussels.</p>

  <p>My main concern is that decoupling, which breaks the link between subsidy and production, could lead to a decline in farming activity in certain sectors, notably suckler beef, with adverse effects for rural economies. Also, the proposals for modulation and degression would discriminate against Scotland&#146;s farmers and perpetuate the problem of the UK and Scotland&#146;s historically low share of rural development funding.</p>

  <p>We support the principle of CAP reform, but I will continue to press the case for improvements to the package of proposals as it now stands.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not publish by local authority area data on the incidence of violence and anti-social behaviour because variations in recording between authorities make it difficult to make reliable comparisons.

  <p>Improving public access to clear and reliable information on the environment is a core part of the Scottish Executive's commitment to environmental justice.</p>

  <p>As I explained in the answer given to question S1W-29496 on 25 September 2002, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) has been allocated additional resources over the three-year period covered by the 2002 spending review. The resources include funding to enable the agency to implement plans for a comprehensive online pollution inventory.</p>

  <p>SEPA will launch such an inventory within a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment that will allow data to be presented against an interactive map background and searched by location information (including postcode) in August 2005. This will represent the most significant development in providing public access to environmental information since the establishment of public registers in the early 90s. The inventory will comply with the requirements of the Aarhus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters. The precise activities required to report and the pollutants (with associated thresholds) featured will be subject to detailed consultation. An integral feature of SEPA&#146;s plans will be the involvement of key stakeholders.</p>

  <p>As a first step, SEPA will provide online access to Scottish European Pollutant Emission Register (EPER) emissions, initially in tabular form by the end of May 2003. They will be presented in GIS form by the end of August. SEPA will also publish electronically water quality maps in June 2004.</p>

  <p>As already stated in previous questions, the public private partnerships (PPP) route is one of a number of procurement methods available for investment in the public sector. PPP will only be chosen over the conventional route when it can be shown to provide better value for money.</p>

  <p>PPP is governed by EU Procurement Regulations which already require an open and inclusive approach. The General Agreement on Trade in Services applies worldwide and its policy of liberalisation is not inconsistent with the rules under which PPP is procured.</p>

  <p>The two property registers in Scotland, the General Register of Sasines and the Land Register of Scotland, are maintained by Registers of Scotland. Deeds of transfer recorded in the Sasine Register, which is a register of deeds, generally contain the consideration (price) paid for the property. Similarly, in the case of the Land Register, which is a register of title, the consideration paid for a property, if shown in the deed of transfer, will be reflected in the title sheet for that property. Information on any property in the two registers is publicly available, the relevant charge being &#163;2 plus VAT for the Sasine Register and &#163;4 plus VAT for the Land Register.</p>

  <p>Many businesses and individuals have a need for comparative house price data. Registers of Scotland has responded to this demand by offering a low-cost online service called Land Register Property Prices, details of which are available on the Registers of Scotland website. This allows a search for the very latest sale prices of any property that has been registered in the Land Register in Scotland. A search can be made of Land Register counties by street or postcode, and spans a maximum of six months, depending on how long a county has been operational in terms of the Land Register. Results are e-mailed or posted out, the charge for this service being &#163;4 plus VAT.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-17603 by Mr Jack McConnell on 14 September 2001, what progress is being made in assessing the need for swimming facilities for pupils and what action arising from the review of swimming provision may result in the provision of such facilities to children in Aberdeenshire.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2003-02-13.27.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80243" speakername="Nicol Stephen" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-03/wa0213.htm#19">

  <p>The audit of current swimming provision I announced on 24 May 2001 is now complete and copies of the report have been placed in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 25875) and will shortly be distributed to all local authorities. Learning and Teaching Scotland has been commissioned to identify barriers to provision and suggest effective solutions to overcoming these barriers. This will provide valuable advice to local authorities and schools and a report of this work will be available later this year.</p>

  <p>In June 2002, local authorities were invited to bid for Quality of Life funding for initiatives aimed at supporting children and young people and improving the local environment. Seventeen local authorities decided to allocate almost &#163;2 million for swimming provision in a range of proposals. Aberdeenshire Council received &#163;300,000 for exercise promotion which included swimming. A further &#163;180 million of Quality of Life funding has been allocated to local authorities over the next three years. Local authorities have been invited to submit proposals by 20 February and swimming lessons are eligible for funding under this scheme.</p>

  <p>Of course, swimming is part of the physical education curriculum which is currently being reviewed under my chairmanship. I believe that all children should be given the opportunity to learn to swim, and improve that ability, whether through home or school opportunities. I will be asking all local authorities to review the information provided in this report and to consider whether swimming lessons could be extended, for example through bids under the Quality of Life Fund.</p>

  <p>Inverclyde Council, Strathclyde Passenger Transport, Network Rail and the Scottish Executive are making good progress on a number of transport projects in Inverclyde. Negotiations on the A78 West Station Bridge should be complete soon. Preparation work continues on the A78/A770 Cloch Road scheme and we expect that the scheme will be ready to go to tender in the summer.</p>
