  <p>New accident and emergency units and non-emergency vehicles are introduced into the fleet each year as part of the ambulance service&rsquo;s vehicle replacement programme.</p>

  <p>Since 2002-03, the Scottish Ambulance Service has been enhancing its service to patients by rolling out its priority based dispatch system across Scotland, whereby those patients with the greatest need receive the quickest response. In addition to these accident and emergency ambulances, the ambulance service has 46 vehicles which are used as rapid response vehicles. These vehicles are manned by a paramedic who responds to Category A life threatening calls, mostly in urban areas, and treats the patient until an ambulance arrives.</p>

  <p>As well as the rapid response units, first responder schemes have been set up across some of the more remote and rural areas of Scotland. These schemes are staffed by volunteers trained by the ambulance service to provide patient care in serious cases until an ambulance arrives. Currently there are around 30 first responder schemes in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Cochlear implantation is designated and funded as a national specialist service provided at two sites in Scotland: Crosshouse Hospital in Ayrshire (adults and children) and Edinburgh Royal Infirmary (adults). The number of patients waiting at each site is set out in the table. The numbers have not been broken down by NHS board of residence because patient confidentiality could be compromised, given the small numbers involved.</p>

  <p>The number of cochlear implants carried out each year is expected to continue at around 50, split approximately equally between children and adults.</p>

  <p>I have asked Dr Paul Stollard, Chief Executive of the Scottish Building Standards Agency (SBSA), to answer. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The duty to comply with the Building (Scotland) Regulations 2004 lies with the owner or, in some cases the tenant, who is carrying out the work for which a building warrant is required. It is the responsibility of all local authorities, as verifiers of the system of building standards, to enforce the provisions of the Building (Scotland) Act 2003 and the SBSA will be monitoring the authorities on their performance.</p>

  <p>This information is not available centrally. Prescription of the anti-TNF drugs should be undertaken by consultant rheumatologists specialising in their use. Data on drugs dispensed in hospitals are not available centrally. Centrally collected data relate to prescribed items dispensed in the community by community pharmacists and dispensing doctors. These data are not patient specific.</p>

  <p>The Food Standards Agency advises me that currently there is no requirement for countries outwith the EU to have a permanent feed ban in place prohibiting the feeding of processed animal protein to livestock kept for the production of food. The Commission requirement for all meat imports to be accompanied by health certification attesting that a feeding ban of mammalian protein is in place and effectively enforced will come into force by 1 July 2007.</p>

  <p>Currently, meat imported into the EU must be accompanied by a health certificate declaring that the product is free from Specified Risk Material (SRM) and mechanically recovered meat and that the method of slaughter used prevents contamination from SRM. The removal of SRM is the primary health safeguard and removes over 99% of infectivity. Imports of meat from designated low-risk BSE countries are exempt from this requirement.</p>

  <p>The information requested is given in the table <em>Average Available Staffed Beds by NHS Hospital and Specialty Group 1998 - 2005</em> . A copy of which has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 37985).</p>

  <p>The table shows information on average available staffed beds. This indicates the average daily number of beds, which were staffed and were available for the reception of in-patients and day cases. Borrowed and temporary beds are included; beds in day bed units are excluded.</p>

  <p>The Executive does not set target numbers for beds. These are local planning decisions taken by NHS boards who have the information necessary to make the correct judgements.</p>

  <p>There are good reasons for reductions in bed numbers. These include:</p>

  <p>Medical advances continue to reduce lengths of stay associated with many planned procedures, and some are now routinely carried out in a few hours without the need for any overnight stay.</p>

  <p>Numbers of in-patient beds do not include beds in dedicated day surgery units. 64% of elective admissions are day cases where there is no need for an overnight bed.</p>

  <p>NHSScotland is making better use of available beds. Average bed occupancy has risen from 78.5% in 1997-98 to 81.7% in 2004-05.</p>

  <p>Occupational and personal pensions are reserved matters under the Scotland Act 1998 and are the responsibility of the UK Government. However, Scottish ministers have the devolved responsibility for making regulations to establish and maintain public pensions schemes in Scotland, subject to the approval of HM Treasury. The Scottish Public Pensions Agency (SPPA) administers the Scottish Teachers and NHS Superannuation Schemes on the Scottish ministers&rsquo; behalf.</p>

  <p>Following the UK Government&rsquo;s proposals in 2003 for public service pension reforms based on establishing a normal pension age of 65, the SPPA (in conjunction with unions and employers in Scotland) arranged public consultations on pension reform proposals for teachers and the NHS in Scotland. These consultations were completed in spring 2005. The SPPA, with other administrators of the public service pension schemes across the UK provided information to the UK Government on views and option costs following these consultations. The agency also attended meetings of the UK Public Services Forum in an observer capacity.</p>

  <p>In taking forward the pension reform proposals in Scotland, the SPPA will now be discussing the implications of the agreed forum principles with representatives of teaching and NHS unions and employers and assessing the financial implications for each scheme. Further consultation is planned, once initial proposals have been agreed with unions and employers. The UK Government has already said that it expects the overall level of savings from increasing pension ages to be comparable to that previously assumed. The framework requires each scheme to work within a cost envelope which will be set out at an early stage of negotiations.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive recently launched a <em>National Strategy for Development of the Social Service Workforce: A Plan for Action 2005-2010</em> . This strategy sets out what is already happening, as well as what now needs to be done, and by whom, to develop a competent, confident and valued social service workforce. This includes those working with older people. Funding was also announced to support implementation of the strategy. This can be found at:</p>

  <p>Other activity supports training the workforce. Providers of care services regulated by the Care Commission under the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001 are required by regulations to ensure that their employees receive training appropriate to the work they are to perform and to give suitable assistance for the purpose of obtaining further qualifications appropriate to their work. The National Care Standards also provide further guidance on staff training requirements where appropriate.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Social Services Council, established under the same act, is the regulatory body for the social service workforce. To register with the Council, workers will be required to meet conditions. These include meeting the qualifications criteria for the job they are doing, as set by the council. Registration of the workforce is being carried out in phases. The next groups of workers to be registered are managers of adult care homes and managers of adult day care services. Registration of these workers will commence in 2006.</p>

  <p>The subsidies are determined by a formula using daily closing portfolio value multiplied by a subsidy rate. This rate comprises three elements - the margin which is fixed for the life of the contract; the RPI interest rate which changes annually, and the one-month LIBOR interest rate. On this basis, no original total subsidy amount was agreed and no definitive outstanding amount can therefore be determined.</p>
