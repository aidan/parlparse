  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it, or any of its agencies, provided any financial support in connection with the bid for the new Inverness to Birmingham air route; what funding it will make available for the next three years; how much funding has been provided to date, broken down by individual payments; to whom such payments have been made, and what funding was provided prior to the awarding of the route in order to secure it.</p>

  <p>Support was provided for the Inverness to Birmingham service by Highlands and Islands Airports Ltd and the Interim Route Development Fund (IRDF), the details of which are commercially confidential. Investment from the IRDF goes to the airport operator to enhance the discounts it offers on landing charges for new direct air services, and no payments were made prior to the commencement of this service.</p>

  <p>Separately from the IRDF, Inverness and Nairn Enterprise is providing assistance towards the training of pilots based in the Highlands and Islands.</p>

  <p>The Permanent Secretary has introduced management changes to strengthen and sharpen the capacity of the machinery of government to support ministers when they work collectively.

  <p>The group charged with horizon scanning is a sub-group of the existing management group, chaired by the Permanent Secretary and including some members of the management group. It will be supported by the strategy unit, which has been drawn from the previously existing policy unit. No additional costs are incurred for this group. The performance and innovation unit will consist of ad hoc teams established on a project by project basis charged with taking forward specific studies to deliver options for policy or delivery improvement. The additional cost of establishing and servicing this unit is expected, given its ad hoc working arrangements, to be small, but cannot be estimated precisely at this stage. A senior figure with appropriate experience, probably gained at least partly in the private sector will head and oversee the work of the performance and innovation unit on a part-time basis. Remuneration, if any, will be settled when someone is identified for the role. The delivery unit has been drawn from the previously existing policy unit and there are no additional costs associated with it.</p>

  <p>The Chief Medical Officer&#8217;s June 2003 report, <em>Recent Psychological Research of Significance to the Delivery of Healthcare in Scotland</em> , (which is available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre, Bib. number. 29821) promotes the extension of psychological interventions to all areas of health and social care and will inform local workforce planning and approaches in this important area of care.</p>

  <p>Cancer managed clinical networks are set up across Scotland involving clinicians from among the relevant disciplines to secure access to the best care possible including psychology services. NHS Education Scotland (NES) has in place a novel funding scheme to expand trainee numbers through matched salary funding for every new clinical psychology trainee supported by NHSScotland. One Regional Cancer Network has taken up this NES funding scheme.</p>

  <p>The Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) and Stroke Strategy for Scotland, published in October 2002, provides the framework for the future organisation and delivery of services. Managed Clinical Networks for cardiac services and stroke are being developed in each NHS board area, as the drivers of service change. These networks must include the full range of health professionals who are involved in providing these services. Psychology services should therefore be included wherever appropriate. NHS Quality Improvement Scotland standards for CHD and stroke also emphasise the importance of patients being treated by multi-disciplinary teams.</p>

  <p>1. Indicator 2 is calculated using three year&#8217;s combined data (i.e 1998-99 to 2000-01 for the 2001 figure and 1999-2000 to 2001-02 for the 2002 figure) from the Family Resource Survey, in order to ensure sufficient sample size, and projected figures on population and numbers in education for 2001-02.</p>

  <p>Detailed descriptions of the data used are as found in <em>Life through Learning; Learning through Life: The Lifelong Learning Strategy for Scotland</em>. However, Indicator 1 has been calculated using four quarters of Labour Force Survey data (to February 2003) to ensure sufficient sample sizes. This is the format that will be used in the forthcoming 2003 Social Justice Annual Technical Report.</p>

  <p>Indicator 2 is the proportion of 16- to 19-year-olds not in higher education living in private households with gross income below &#163;25,000 who are in school or further education and has been constructed using Family Resource Survey data.</p>

  <p>The Executive remains committed to building the capacity of NHSScotland. In order to assist NHS employers meet local health needs, we have invested record sums in health</p>

  <p>A range of recruitment and retention measures have been introduced to help build capacity within the nursing and midwifery workforce.</p>

  <p>As part of our on-going commitment to this improvement agenda, we will increase our programme to train, recruit and retain nurses and midwives, bringing 12,000 into the NHS by 2007.</p>

  <p>Additional help in areas of recruitment will also be provided by Careers for Health with one of its aims being to raise the profile of careers in the NHSScotland.</p>

  <p>Work is, therefore, under way to re-energise recruitment to the health service workforce and redesign jobs where new nursing roles are identified.</p>

  <p>In addition, Scotland&#8217;s Cancer Strategy, <em>Cancer in Scotland: Action to Change, </em>recognised that nursing care is not restricted to Clinical Nurse Specialists and that the development of nurses&#8217; skills and experiences is vital to effective patient care in all care settings. Also, a Framework for Nursing People with Cancer is currently being developed.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how much of the tourism, culture and sport budget is committed to tackling disadvantage in communities across Scotland and how progress in achieving this objective will be measured.</p>

  <p>The tourism, culture and sport portfolio has a commitment &quot;to enhance everyone's quality of life in Scotland through widening participation in sport and culture and building on a successful and sustainable tourism sector to create jobs and opportunity across Scotland&quot;. To help meet that commitment, the Scottish budget 2003-06 set targets and invests an extra &#163;3.85 million in 2004-05 and &#163;6.95 million in 2005-06 for cultural activities across Scotland, with the specific aims of increasing participation, particularly by under-represented groups, (under-represented groups includes children, young people, older people, women, disabled people, people from minority ethnic groups, people living in rural areas, and socially excluded people) and boosting the number of cultural and sporting programmes in areas of economic and social disadvantage.</p>

  <p>We have a specific objective of supporting social inclusion by ensuring the widest possible involvement in cultural, social and sporting opportunities which will be measured against a target of increasing the numbers of under-represented groups, especially children and young people, taking part in cultural and sporting activity by 5%. Statistical data to support the measurement of progress against the portfolio targets will be collected as part of a major new annual statistical exercise among the cultural non-departmental public bodies.</p>

  <p>The action we are taking under <em>A Partnership for a Better Scotland</em> will help maximise the benefits of cultural provision in areas of disadvantage to promote the regeneration of individuals and communities. We are also working with the local authorities to help develop local cultural provision and spread good practice in this area.</p>

  <p>The majority of the tourism, culture and sport budget is allocated to a range of national agencies who are prioritising their programmes in accordance with the Executive&#8217;s policies and to meet the budget targets for tackling disadvantage. To obtain detail on how these bodies allocate their respective budgets, I suggest the member writes to the chief executive of each.</p>
