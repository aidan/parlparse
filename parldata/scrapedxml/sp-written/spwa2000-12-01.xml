  <p>Raising literacy levels in the workplace is one of the issues that will be considered by the Literacy 2000 Team in their report to Ministers in December. To inform their recommendations, the team has commissioned research which assesses:</p>

  <p>the attitudes of employers, employees and unemployed to literacy levels in the workplace;</p>

  <p>whether literacy demands are increasing, and</p>

  <p>what would motivate or prevent individuals from seeking help.</p>

  <p>&pound;22.5 million will be available over the next three years from March 2001 to raise literacy and numeracy levels and support the recommendations of the Literacy 2000 Team.</p>

  <p>The Training for Work programme helps adults who have been unemployed for over six months to improve their work-related skills. The Scottish Executive has been consulting on the best contribution the programme can make to promoting individual employability and lifelong learning in the workplace, including enhancing the help provided with literacy, numeracy and other basic skills.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The data was collected by the annual school census in September 1998.</p>

  <p>2. The above information includes:</p>

  <p>i. children attending special schools with Autistic Spectrum Disorder recorded as their <i>main</i> difficulty in learning, whether or not they have a formal Record of Needs. Pupil age was based on the census date of 14 September 1998.</p>

  <p>ii. children attending mainstream primary schools with Autistic Spectrum Disorder recorded as their <i>main</i> difficulty in learning, who have a Record of Needs. Dates of birth are not available for these pupils &#8211; all pupils attending primary schools have therefore been considered as within the scope of the question whereas those at secondary have not.</p>

  <p>3. These figures don&#8217;t include pupils with autism that also have another learning difficulty which is recorded as their main difficulty. They also don&#8217;t include any pupils with autism attending mainstream primary schools but who have not had a Record of Needs established. Children with autism but who are not attending school are not included - they may be too young to attend school or they may be educated elsewhere.</p>

  <p>All student social workers, on Diploma in Social Work courses, receive training on the range and impact of physical, social, sexual and emotional neglect and abuse. This should enable qualified social workers to identify sexual abuse in adult survivors. The treatment of survivors of sexual abuse is complex and social workers require training at post-qualifying level to deal with it.</p>

  <p><i>Scottish Health Statistics 1999</i> , published in February this year, indicates that the number of such deaths declined from 67 in 1998 to 47 in 1999. This underlines that, where numbers are relatively small, there can be a degree of volatility from one year to the next. Over the 1990s the trend has been encouragingly downwards, although the Executive is not complacent about the picture presented by these figures, as the following examples illustrate.</p>

  <p>Schoolchildren are a particular target audience for fire safety messages and Scottish fire brigades have developed a number of educational packages. The Executive has funded an interactive website for primary schools.</p>

  <p>On 1 March, the Scottish Executive and UK Government announced targets for road accident casualty reductions in the period to 2010 including a 40% reduction in the number of fatal and serious casualties and a 50% reduction in those involving children. These targets are underpinned by a Great Britain-wide strategy <i>Tomorrow&#8217;s Roads &#8211; Safer for Everyone</i>. The Executive also provides funding to the Scottish Road Safety Campaign to develop road safety education resources and publicity measures, many of which are aimed at children.</p>

  <p>Copies of <i>Tomorrow&#8217;s Roads &#8211; Safer for Everyone</i> and the Scottish Road Safety Campaign&#8217;s Annual Report are held in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what targets it is setting for tackling drug misuse in Scotland.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-12-01.S1W-11703.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80167" speakername="Iain Gray" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa1201.htm#7">

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s vision, in line with our national drugs strategy <i>Tackling Drugs in Scotland: Action in Partnership,</i> is of <i> </i> a Scotland whose people choose healthy lifestyles free from the harm of drug misuse. The additional &pound;100 million funding over the next three years that we announced recently boosts the work already underway, which is outlined in the Executive&#8217;s <i>Drugs Action Plan. </i> These resources give the opportunity to make substantial progress towards the achievement of our vision. I shall make a further announcement in January about how the additional resources in Scotland&#8217;s first three-year budget for drugs will be used.</p>

  <p>In an area as important as drug misuse, targets need to be challenging and ambitious. They highlight what can and should be done by the Executive, by agencies, by communities and by individuals. We have set targets and standards spanning the four pillars of the drugs strategy: action concerning young people, communities, treatment and availability. We have drawn these up in consultation with the drugs field, the Scottish Advisory Committee on Drug Misuse and with MSPs.</p>

  <p>In developing targets and standards we have had to take into account the availability of data to measure success. Targets need to be specific and timed. Information about drug misuse is improving, but it is not yet comprehensive. We have a Drug Misuse Information Strategy, under which a number of initiatives will give us a clearer picture of the problem and how we are coping with it, data about the availability of drugs, about prevalence in schools and the wider population, and about treatment services and treatment outcomes. From 1 April 2001, we shall have national performance indicators and baseline data for all the targets set, with supporting local data, where local targets are required.</p>

  <p>As new and better information emerges, we shall look at whether the targets we have set are in the right areas and whether other targets are also required. Targets will be set in Scottish prisons next year, following baseline data collection this year.</p>

  <p>We are setting the following national targets, which will be subject to local target setting:</p>

  <p>Reverse the upward trend in drug-related deaths and reduce the total number by at least 25% by 2005.</p>

  <p>Reduce repeat offending by increasing the number of drug misusing<strong> </strong>offenders entering treatment from criminal justice diversion and community disposals by 40% by 2004.</p>

  <p>Reduce the proportion of drug misusers who inject by 20% by 2005.</p>

  <p>Increase the number of drug misusers in contact with drug treatment and care services in the community by at least 10% every year until 2005.</p>

  <p>Reduce the proportion of injecting drug users sharing needles and syringes by 20% by 2005, and reduce the percentage of injecting drug users testing positive for hepatitis C by 20% by 2005.</p>

  <p>Increase the number of drug seizures by 25% by 2004.</p>

  <p>Increase the number of offences recorded by Scottish police forces for supply or possession with intent to supply drugs by 25% by 2004.</p>

  <p>Drug misuse poses problems throughout the whole of Scotland. However they are not always the same problems with the same solutions at the same time. The national targets will guide local target setting and we will be providing detailed guidance for Drug Action Teams on what we expect from them in the way of local targets, depending on their local situation.</p>

  <p>In addition we are setting targets for young people, which will not be subject to local target setting, because their achievement will depend on a wide range of influences in society as a whole, efforts by many agencies and UK-wide and international co-operation. The Executive is therefore laying down challenges to all concerned to reduce the number of youngsters being offered or using illegal drugs:</p>

  <p>To reduce the proportion of people under 25 reporting use of illegal drugs in the last month and previous year substantially, and heroin use by 25%, by 2005.</p>

  <p>To reduce the proportion of young people under 25 who are offered illegal drugs significantly, and heroin by 25%, by 2005.</p>

  <p>These are targets to guide all our efforts, in particular to clamp down on the drugs such as heroin that cause the greatest harm. The action that we are taking on all fronts of the strategy matches their importance. We shall monitor and report on progress towards achieving them, and do more if we need to.</p>

  <p>We are also setting the following national standards:</p>

  <p>All schools to provide drug education to every pupil and to have written procedures for managing incidents of drug misuse, in line with national advice, by 2002.</p>

  <p>All local authorities to have an agreed written policy on drug misuse applying to community education settings, covering drug education and the management of incidents of drug misuse by 2002.</p>

  <p>All DATs and Area Child Protection Committees to have in place local policies on support to drug misusing parents and their children, in line with national guidance, by 2002. National guidance on support to drug misusing parents and their children to be published by the Scottish Executive in 2001.</p>

  <p>All DATs with Social Inclusion Partnership and Community Safety Partnerships to have mechanisms in place for joint working, by 2002.</p>

  <p>Every Local Health Care Co-operative or Primary Care Trust to have a locally approved shared care (or equivalent) scheme by 2004.</p>

  <p>All DATs to ensure that drug misusers aged under 16 have access to drug treatment and care services which are in line with national guidance by 2004.</p>

  <p><u>Monitoring</u></p>

  <p>The Executive will monitor national and local progress in meeting targets and standards, through the annual DAT corporate planning arrangements.</p>

  <p>Monitoring of progress on implementing the drugs strategy will not depend solely on the monitoring of targets however. We shall continue to use annual DAT reporting to review action in support of all of our national objectives and to ensure that both existing and new resources devoted to drug misuse are used wisely.</p>

  <p>Taken together, the Executive&#8217;s drugs strategy, national objectives, major investment of resources and now a framework of targets and standards, provide a powerful response to the problems of drug misuse that face us all today.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Performance against targets is measured using a three-year rolling average.</p>

  <p>2. Targets were set for 2000-01 and as such are not expected to be attained until that time. Conversely, it will not necessarily be the case that schools attaining or exceeding their targets at present will attain or exceed them in 2000-01.</p>

  <p>3. It should be noted that the figures giving the level of performance averaged across 1995-97 and 1996-98 relate to examination performance which pre-dates any planned programme of improvement associated with the setting-targets initiative. The first year in which examination performance was directly influenced by the setting-targets initiative was 1999.</p>

  <p>4. 1995-97, 1996-98 and 1997-99 figures are all based upon post-appeal data.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive makes a very substantial input into TCS (formerly the Teaching Company Scheme) in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is one of 11 TCS Sponsors, together with five other Government Departments (DTI is the lead sponsor) and five Research Councils. It is sponsors who jointly provide the funding for TCS and decide upon scheme policy and qualifying criteria.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive acts as a liaison point for the activities of TCS consultants and the three TCS Centres in Scotland.</p>

  <p>I am aware of the recent announcement by the Secretary of State for Education and Employment but it related solely to the piloting of an ILA-linked small firms grant scheme in the Lincolnshire/Leicestershire area. My officials are already considering how best small businesses in Scotland can be encouraged to use ILAs and any action that needs to be taken.</p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise do not have any plans to review their decision to appoint Superfast as the preferred operator for the Rosyth ferry contract. Scottish Enterprise chose Superfast because they most closely matched the criteria specified by the steering group, which included the ability to run a ferry service safely and to an appropriately high standard.</p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise do not believe that the circumstances of the earlier accident in 1999 necessitate a review of the decision to appoint Superfast as the preferred operator.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive did not assist Northlink, the joint venture involving Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd and the Royal Bank of Scotland, in the preparation of the tender submitted for the Northern Isles ferry contract. The limited costs incurred by Caledonian MacBrayne in bid preparation and in the start-up of the joint venture will be repaid from the return which Northlink is expected to earn for the company.</p>

  <p>Scottish Executive officials had a number of meetings and other contacts with Northlink representatives and its professional advisers, in order to provide advice to Scottish Ministers in their capacity as sole shareholder of Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd. Such contacts were necessary to enable Ministers to determine whether they were content for the company to submit a joint venture bid and to provide them with the information necessary to satisfy themselves that the terms of the bid would not involve any competitive advantage to the joint venture arising from Ministers&#8217; ownership of Caledonian MacBrayne. A separation of duties was in place between officials engaged in that process and those considering the tenders submitted for the Northern Isles contract. That confidentiality arrangement will remain in place until such times as contractual negotiations are completed and a contract is awarded.</p>

  <p>Under the definition of learning that is eligible for Individual Learning Account incentives, people will be able to receive grants of up to &pound;150 for courses to learn Gaelic if they are in the first 100,000 applicants in Scotland. In most cases these grants should cover the full course costs. Later applicants will only be able to claim discounts of 20% as the higher 80% discounts are aimed specifically at people who have literacy difficulties, numeracy problems or who wish to develop basic computing skills.</p>

  <p>It is a matter for each health board to determine its prescribing policy on drugs, taking into account advice from local Drug and Therapeutic Committees. When the Health Technology Board for Scotland begins work later this summer, health boards will have access to a single focus of national advice on the clinical and cost-effectiveness of health technologies, including drugs. This will help to reduce the incidence of so-called postcode prescribing in future.</p>

  <p>Antiviral susceptibility testing, which permits an assessment to be made of each patient&#8217;s resistance to antiviral drugs, has only recently been developed from research. The testing involved is very complex and requires considerable expertise, which is not yet widely available within the NHS.</p>

  <p>At present, antiviral susceptibility testing is used only when treatment fails. The Executive has made arrangements for such tests in respect of Scottish patients to be carried out by the Public Health Laboratory Service in Birmingham.</p>

  <p>The Medical Research Council is currently funding a trial towards developing and testing guidelines and establishing protocols for treatment, which would define the circumstances in which resistance tests would be of benefit. The outcome of this work should indicate whether there will be significant benefits from introducing a resistance test for all or some HIV patients, prior to commencing antiviral drug therapy.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Higher Education Funding Council provides funding for superJANET, a network infrastructure in Scotland, which secures high-bandwidth connections for all higher education institutions in Scotland and Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs), which are local in nature and help speed up these connections. The council has also provided funding for a range of projects, which are developing approaches to online learning, such as the Clyde Virtual University project. More generally, the council is providing funding to support staff in the use of web-based tools for teaching and learning, as well as funding for staff development in a range of ICT skills.</p>

  <p>These activities are helping institutions to develop expertise in online and distributed learning. It is a matter for institutions whether they wish to offer provision in this mode, either in Scotland or internationally.</p>

  <p>Our <i>Memorandum of Understanding</i> with the UK Government sets out the principles underlying our working relationship with Whitehall Departments and ensures good communication where one administration&#8217;s work may have a bearing upon the responsibilities of another administration. In keeping with this we have kept DSS informed with the progress of the proposed Glasgow Stock Transfer and they have kept us in touch with their proposals for housing benefit reform.</p>

  <p>The <i>Code of Practice on Access to Scottish Executive Information</i> exempts from disclosure any information which would harm the frankness and candour of internal discussion including internal opinion, advice, recommendation, consultation and deliberation (Exemption 2 of Part II). As our discussions regarding housing benefit reform and the proposed Glasgow Stock Transfer with DSS relate to the process by which a decision or policy has been reached, they are exempt from disclosure under the terms of the code.

  <p>: Through its Digital Scotland initiative, the Scottish Executive is working towards pervasive and affordable access to the web for people of all ages in Scotland. We are committed to achieving universal access to the web by 2005.</p>

  <p>Specific actions to ensure all people may take advantage of the opportunities that ICTs present are the Community Access to Lifelong Learning (CALL) programme and the learndirect scotland initiative. More detail is provided below.</p>

  <p>The Community Access to Lifelong Learning (CALL) programme is funded by the New Opportunities Fund. CALL has been established to engage more adults in learning at a community level by developing support for ICT access to information and learning opportunities. Some &pound;23 million has been earmarked for spending in Scotland. Among successful applicants for funding is Stirling Council for a project which aims to increase awareness and accessibility of information and communications technologies (ICTs) for older people, as well as enhance the quality of life of older people through the development of ICT skills.</p>

  <p>In addition, anyone anywhere in Scotland can now get online access to learning, at home, at work, or at one of a growing network of learndirect scotland learning centres. learndirect<i> scotland</i> is promoting its lifelong learning services to people of <i>all</i> ages and the Executive is offering Individual Learning Accounts to anyone aged 18 or over to help pay for the learning they do. ILAs are available on a wide range of learning. Amongst other things, the maximum level of discount of 80%, may be used for many basic IT skills courses to help adults grasp and exploit the opportunities that new technology presents.</p>

  <p>Within the Scottish Executive, the Chief Scientist Office (CSO) has responsibility for encouraging and supporting research into health services and patient care within the NHS in Scotland. It fulfils this function by funding specific projects, proposed by research institutions, which meet acceptable standards. This role is well advertised throughout the medical and academic community. Although CSO has no proposals to promote actively or commission research projects <i> </i> on multiple <i> s</i> clerosis at present, CSO would be pleased to make funding available for, or contribute to, studies of a sufficiently high standard.</p>

  <p>More generally CSO provides infrastructure and support costs to the NHS to enable Trusts to participate in research being funded by the research councils and major charities. The Medical Research Council (MRC) is the main agency through which the UK Government supports biomedical and clinical research. CSO collaborates with other UK Health Departments and the MRC to develop and maintain an effective partnership for the promotion, funding and management of UK medical research.</p>

  <p>The Executive has not produced any such materials and has no plans to do so. General practitioners, who were advised by the Chief Medical Officer in July 1999 of the need to be aware of the possibility that patients may be suffering from organophosphate poisoning, are best placed to advise and inform patients, and to refer to a specialist in appropriate cases.</p>

  <p>Mr Jack McConnell&#8217;s answer of 6 July (question S1W-8578, Karen Gillon) announced a preliminary examination of nine organisations to establish whether the option of relocation from Edinburgh should be examined further or in detail. The announcement also covered the setting up of three new bodies, where there is a presumption against an Edinburgh location, and the Scottish Agricultural Science Agency where a scientific review had been initiated into the feasibility of relocating to a site near Dundee.</p>

  <p>In relation to the new bodies I can confirm that, if the Parliament passes the necessary legislation to enable them to be established, the Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care and the Scottish Social Services Council will not be located in Edinburgh. Decisions on the location of these bodies are expected in February 2001. The Minister for Justice announced on 11 October that the Public Guardian&#8217;s Office, which will eventually employ some 40 staff, will be located in Falkirk.</p>

  <p>The preliminary reviews of the other bodies are now complete. Further studies into the location of each of the following organisations will now be undertaken, and they will be completed by the dates shown. The studies will include detailed work on alternative locations and consider the individual circumstances of each body on a case-by-case basis.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Public Pensions Agency; decision by March 2001</p>

  <p>The Health Education Board for Scotland; decision by mid-2001</p>

  <p><strong></strong>sportscotland; decision by the end of 2001</p>

  <p>The Common Services Agency of the National Health Service in Scotland; decision by mid-2002</p>

  <p>The Scottish Arts Council; decision before 2003 in line with general review announced in <i>Creating our Future: Minding our Past</i></p>

  <p>Registers of Scotland; decision by the end of 2004</p>

  <p>The dates set for completion of each review reflect operational factors, the timing of any lease breaks and the time necessary to secure new property if this proves necessary.</p>

  <p>The detailed reviews do not mean that a decision has been taken to relocate these organisations. The option of an Edinburgh location will be considered along with alternatives.</p>

  <p>In relation to the Scottish Executive Inquiry Reporter&#8217;s Unit, we have postponed a decision about further consideration of the relocation issue until uncertainty about the status of the body flowing from the County Properties Ltd judgment is resolved. We have also decided that, because of particular operational links to other bodies in Edinburgh, further consideration should not be given to the Crown Office Management Services Group or the Scottish Council for Post-Graduate Medical and Dental Education&#8217;s facilities in Edinburgh.</p>

  <p>The scientific review undertaken to investigate the feasibility of locating the scientific work of the Scottish Agricultural Science Agency at a site adjacent to the Scottish Crop Research Institute near Dundee has been concluded. Its results indicate that ground conditions are not compatible with the agency&#8217;s work on the certification of seed potatoes. Accordingly, the agency will take forward its existing plans for relocation of this work in the Edinburgh area.</p>

  <p>As stated previously, our principal consideration is to ensure that government business is conducted efficiently, that high quality services are delivered to the public, and that Scotland as a whole benefits from sound decisions about the location of the Executive&#8217;s work. In considering alternative locations we will have regard to the aims of the policy and the position of staff, and we will seek the views of their trade union representatives and of the management of each organisation.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive will write to Local Enterprise Councils and local authorities about the process setting out the cost, efficiency and other criteria which will inform decisions.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that the statistics given below are based upon the data which are held in the central statistical database and which were collected by the police at the time of the accident and subsequently reported to the Executive.

  <p>All GPs can prescribe Zyban but it is most effective with the support of specialist services or counselling.

  <p>Smoking cessation has also been identified as a priority for investment from the &pound;26 million Health Improvement Fund. Health boards will be able to provide more practical support through the NHS for those people who want to quit smoking.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&#8217;s integrated transport policy is being delivered through action across a wide front, in particular:</p>

  <p>The Transport (Scotland) Bill will equip the Executive and local authorities with the powers to promote integration, address problems in Scotland&#8217;s bus services, tackle congestion and deliver free local bus travel to our pensioners and disabled people by October 2002.</p>

  <p>The Executive has increased its spending on transport, with an additional &pound;500 million being made available by 2003-04, a 45% increase in real terms.</p>

  <p>The Public Transport Fund is delivering better public transport right across Scotland. I recently announced &pound;33 million worth of expenditure, which will fund 19 new public transport projects, including measures to improve bus, rail and air services, and four specific cycling and walking projects.</p>

  <p>We need to improve the quality, reliability, frequency and accessibility of Scotland&#8217;s rail services and I will therefore be consulting shortly on our priorities for Scotland&#8217;s passenger railway.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has any plans to extend the remit of the Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive (SPTE) to cover freight transport and what the reasons are for its position on the extension or otherwise of SPTE&#8217;s remit to include this issue.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no plans to extend the remit of the Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive as, in common with all Passenger Transport Executives, it was established to oversee and address the passenger transport needs of metropolitan areas.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive <a name="QuestionText">whether the increased expenditure resulting from the recent Spending Review will release any additional funding for the water industry and, if so, whether it will detail how much and over what period and what the implications will be for the water authorities&#8217; external finance limits.</a></p>

  <p>The Spending Review figures were announced in resource terms. This means that Scottish Assigned Budget now scores the full capital expenditure made by the water authorities rather than just the loans and grants, otherwise known as the External Finance Limit, made to them.</p>

  <p>My predecessor announced on the 22 September the breakdown of the increases to the environment budget, which shows additional provision for the water industry. I will be making announcements about the allocation to each water authority in due course.<br /></p>
