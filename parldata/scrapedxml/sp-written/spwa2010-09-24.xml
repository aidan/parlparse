  <p>Unfortunately, the UK Border Agency does not provide statistical information on a month-by-month basis. However, it has published reports for the first two quarters of 2010 which are available on the UKBA website at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/immigration-asylum-publications.html" target="_blank">http://rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/immigration-asylum-publications.html</a>.</p>

  <p>According to these reports a total of 25 children entered Dungavel detention centre before the end to the overnight detention of children in May 2010. However, they do not specify if the children were those of asylum seeking families.</p>

  <p><table width="100%" border="BORDER" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#CCCCCC">
<tr>
<td width="47%" align="center" valign="top">Quarter (Period of Report)</td>

  <p>These figures are not subject to independent checks and therefore may not be wholly accurate. Some detainees may be recorded more than once, for example the person may have been detained on more than one separate occasion in the time period shown, such as a person who has left detention, but has subsequently been re-detained.</p>

  <p>My officials are in regular contact with colleagues in the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and Jobcentre Plus about the arrangements for the reassessment of customers in receipt of incapacity benefits. Discussions are continuing around the ongoing developments including the trial of the process which will commence in Aberdeen and Burnley on 11 October. Officials are also monitoring developments in relation to DWP&rsquo;s review of the Work Capability Assessment (WCA) which it will use to support the reassessment of incapacity benefit. Copies of a DWP briefing pack on reassessing customers in receipt of incapacity benefits are available from the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 51313).</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland&rsquo;s trunk road capital budget was &pound;256.8 million in 2009-10 of which &pound;1.35 million was spent on standalone cycling and walking improvements along or near trunk roads. In addition cycling and walking provision was a feature of capital road improvements and maintenance including 20km of cycleways within the A977 Clackmannanshire Bridge, A830 Arisaig to Loch nan Uamh, A9 Helmsdale and A68 Dalkeith Northern Bypass. The actual spend on this element cannot be separated out because of the fixed price lump sum nature of trunk road contracts.</p>

  <p>Cycling and walking facilities feature in the proposals for A90 Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route and A90 Balmedie-Tipperty. Elsewhere Transport Scotland is concentrating standalone trunk road cycling and walking efforts between 2010 and 2015 in completion of the National Cycle Network (NCN) between Oban and Fort William and between Fort William and Inverness. The NCN is already complete in Aberdeen/Aberdeenshire.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally by the Scottish Government. Not all local authorities have in place sports pitch and facility strategies which outline current provision and help to determine future priority areas based on local needs and priorities. As of September 2010, 18 local authorities have pitch strategies in place with a further eight local authorities in the process of preparing them. A wide range of practical and technical advice is available to local authorities from sportscotland on the preparation of sports pitch and facility strategies and on the planning and development of facilities more generally.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has invested over &pound;17 million in quality facilities through the National and Regional Sports Facilities Strategy which will have a significant positive impact on football. These include indoor and outdoor synthetic football pitches at Aberdeen Sports Village, Toryglen Regional Football Centre, both of which are open to the public, with the Ravenscraig Sports Facility due to open soon.</p>

  <p>In addition, sportscotland operate a Sports Facilities Fund which offers funding to eligible groups to help in the development and upgrading of facilities and since 2007 this has seen over &pound;21 million invested in facilities throughout Scotland.</p>

  <p>Whilst the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 places a duty on public bodies to contribute to reduction of carbon emissions in the course of exercising their functions, the act does not require Glasgow City Council to set sector-specific emission targets.

  <p>There is no standard methodology for calculating carbon emissions from transport. Which is the most appropriate ultimately depends upon the type of assessment being undertaken. However, we are working towards establishing a common approach to measurement and reporting of carbon emissions across the public sector.</p>

  <p>The Disability Working Group was established by ministers as a strategic short-term group in 2004, following the European Year of Disabled People (EYDP) in 2003. The remit of the group was:</p>

  <p>to establish priorities for the Scottish Government and partner organisations to promote equality for disabled people in Scotland, and to</p>

  <p>develop proposals on longer term mechanisms for engagement with the disability sector.</p>

  <p>The report of the Disability Working Group, and the Scottish Government Response to the report, were published in November 2006, and the last meeting of the group was in September 2007.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has since taken forward work on Disability Equality through the high-level Independent Living In Scotland Core Reference Group, which has a much broader and more ambitious remit than the original Disability Working Group. The main remit of the group, which has formally met five times to date since September 2009, is to:</p>

  <p>Consider the actions necessary to progress Independent Living for disabled people, and to support their involvement in this process.</p>

  <p>(a) The compulsory purchase order linked to the M77 Fenwick to Floak special roads scheme required various plots of land from 34 landowners in order to build the scheme.</p>

  <p>(b) At the date of completion of the works, final settlement of land compensation payments was still to be reached with all 34 affected parties</p>

  <p>(c) On 1 August 2010, final settlement of land compensation was still outstanding in the case of 11 affected parties.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to provide an estimated date for completion of the final account as this is dependent on the satisfactory conclusion of negotiations which are still continuing between the District Valuer and affected parties and/or their agents.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to provide an exact figure for costs relating to land acquisition for the M77 Fenwick to Floak special roads scheme as all figures relating to the scheme were combined into a single project with the M77 Fenwick to Malletsheugh scheme. Records which show the estimated costs at the project approval stage no longer exist. However, land acquisition costs for the combined scheme are as follows:</p>

  <p>(a) In 2002, the estimated costs were approx. &pound;2.1 million.</p>

  <p>(b) The actual spend to date is approx. &pound;3.2 million.</p>

  <p>(c) The current estimated final cost of land acquisition and land compensation is &pound;3.3 million.</p>
