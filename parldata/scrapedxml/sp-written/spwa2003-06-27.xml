<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2003-06-27.1.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80022" speakername="Ms Margaret Curran" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-03/wa0627.htm#1">

  <p>In my statement on charity law on 28 May, I set out the Executive&#146;s intentions for improving charity law and the regulation of charities. I have now given further thought to our strategy for taking forward this agenda and, in particular, our partnership commitment to legislate on charity law. My intention is to adopt a strategy which will involve, firstly, taking rapid steps to establish the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator (OSCR); secondly, an early consultation with the charitable sector and other interested parties on what should be included in the legislation which we will be bringing forward, and finally, following that consultation, an announcement of our decisions on the overall content of the legislation.</p>

  <p>In relation to the first of these commitments, I am now in a position to announce that, having completed a thorough review of potential locations for this body, in keeping with the Executive&#146;s policy of dispersing public sector jobs throughout Scotland, we have decided that the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator will be located in Dundee. This will see in the region of 30 new posts being created initially, bringing welcome additional employment to the area. This announcement will be followed quickly by other steps towards the establishment of OSCR, including the appointment of key staff.</p>

  <p>As far as consultation with the sector is concerned, I made clear in my earlier statement that we were committed to legislating on charity law and had not ruled out the option of such legislation making provision for a statutory basis for the regulator. I am anxious to take the views of the charitable sector on this and on other issues that might be included in future legislation. To this end, I am proposing to consult further with the sector over the summer, by means of a listening seminar, to which I intend to invite a cross section of sector and other representatives. I wish to rule nothing in or out of that discussion and I will listen carefully to what is said about how best, through legislation, we can take this agenda forward. Once my colleagues and I have had an opportunity to consider the views put to us through this process, we will announce our full legislative intentions.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what its policy is on exclusion from, and violence and disruptive behaviour in, schools.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2003-06-27.4.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80097" speakername="Peter Peacock" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-03/wa0627.htm#4">

  <p>The target on exclusions was helpful in setting a clear direction of travel and as a stimulus to the development of alternatives to exclusion. We remain committed to seeing a trend of reductions in exclusions but based on the application of the best available management practices, not on a specific target. No target should override judgements on a case-by-case basis where decisions must be made in accordance with the best interests of the staff and other pupils and of the child.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to supporting teachers and taking a firm approach to discipline. Exclusion is a sanction schools may use. It should sit within a wider framework of effective policies and practices on discipline within which exclusion is a legitimate last resort. Our policy on exclusion recognises the need to ensure the rights of the majority of pupils, who are hard working and well behaved, and of teachers to enjoy a positive learning environment. We also have an obligation to address the needs and observe the rights of pupils involved in disruptive behaviours.</p>

  <p>The way to reduce exclusions lies in determined, sustained, long-term, effective management and sound and consistent policies which make a real difference to behaviour in schools. That was the clear message from the Discipline Task Group (DTG). There is excellent practice in many Scottish schools and implementation of the DTG recommendations is making further improvements. Since 2000 we have allocated &#163;33 million to authorities to implement the DTG recommendations, with a further &#163;10 million to follow in each of the next two years. This is in addition to the &#163;10 million a year we have been providing since 1999 to fund alternatives to exclusion, increased to &#163;11 million from this year.</p>

  <p>We are building on the work of the DTG with the establishment of two expert groups: one to look at discipline in corridors, playgrounds and other out of class areas, and the other to look at involvement of parents in ways which improve behaviour in schools.</p>

  <p>We are also appointing a development officer to help authorities with implementation and assist in the sharing of experience and good practice. Finally, we are facilitating a series of &quot;masterclasses&quot; for headteachers. These will commence in the autumn and will be an opportunity for all headteachers to discuss and share best practice in behaviour management.</p>

  <p>We will continue to record incidents of violent and anti-social behaviour towards teachers in schools to monitor trends and we will encourage consistency in recording practices to give an ever more reliable base to such statistics. This information, together with other data and expert advice from education professionals and others, will form the basis of future policy action.</p>

  <p>By these means, and with the commitment and professionalism of teachers and other school staff, I am confident that we can ensure that all pupils can benefit from a high quality education in a well ordered learning environment.</p>

  <p>The laws on bail are under constant review.</p>

  <p>In 2000 the Parliament enacted the Bail, Judicial Appointments etc (Scotland) Act 2000, which ended the statutory exclusion to the granting of bail by a sheriff, removed the requirement of the accused having to apply for bail and required the court to consider bail for a new offence while the accused is in custody for a previous offence.</p>

  <p>Also in 2000 we announced a review of the effectiveness of the powers of the courts to impose aggravated sentences for those convicted of offences committed while on bail. Two research projects were commissioned as part of the review. The first was completed in 2002 and the second is due to be completed shortly. We will then consider whether changes to the law or practice in this area are required.</p>

  <p>More recently we introduced, in the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2003, new rights for the Crown to be heard when bail is being sought by a convicted person pending the determination of an appeal by him. And in our document, <em>A</em> <em>Partnership for a Better Scotland: Partnership Agreement,</em> setting out the Executive&#146;s policies for the next four years we have undertaken to set up a judicially led Sentencing Commission which will as part of its remit review the use of bail and remand.</p>

These new data have been reviewed by an Expert Working Group on SSRIs and the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM), an independent scientific advisory committee. They do not demonstrate efficacy in depressive illness in this age group and show an increase in the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviour in the Seroxat group compared to placebo.

  <p>The Executive remains committed to building the capacity of NHSScotland.</p>

  <p>A range of recruitment and retention measures have been introduced to help build capacity within the nursing and midwifery workforce.</p>

  <p>As part of our on-going commitment to this improvement agenda, we will increase our programme to train, recruit and retain nurses and midwives, bringing 12,000 into the NHS by 2007. We will continue to support new ways of working that reflect best practice and offer innovative solutions to workforce issues. We will also implement nationally co-ordinated nursing bank arrangements to assist nurse placement across Scotland. Combined, these measures will reduce the reliance on the use of agency nurses.</p>

  <p>Projects awarded funding from the first four rounds of the Public Transport Fund are identified in the regional leaflets associated with the Scottish Executive transport delivery report, <em>Scotland&#146;s Transport: Delivering Improvements</em> , which was published in March 2002 and is available at http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library3/transport/stdi-00.asp. Those projects receiving awards under the fifth and final round of the Public Transport Fund were announced on 14 November 2002 (http://www.scotland.gov.uk/pages/news/2002/11/SEET181.aspx). The relevant authorities in receipt of grant are responsible for delivery of these projects.</p>

  <p>Angus Council&#146;s A92 Arbroath to Dundee upgrading project received an allocation from the Transport Challenge Fund, but has not as yet been completed due to delays in securing the necessary Compulsory Purchase Orders and Road Orders. I understand that the council expects to conclude negotiations with the preferred bidder by the end of July 2003, with a start on site by autumn 2003.</p>

  <p>This is primarily a matter for the bus industry. Whilst the Scottish Executive is not responsible for the provision of CCTV coverage on buses, resources have been made available under the Public Transport Fund to local authorities such as Dundee City Council and Glasgow City Council for such provision as part of a wider programme of bus improvements.</p>
