  <p>The Scottish Fire and Rescue Services are amongst the best in the world and they serve the people of Scotland with pride and professionalism. Since the publication of the Fire and Rescue Framework 2005 in October 2005, the fire and rescue authorities have made considerable progress in achieving the agreed priorities and objectives. This progress is recognised in the recent reports of both HM Chief Inspector of Fire and Rescue Services and Audit Scotland (copies of which are available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre, Bib. numbers 41202, 44156 and 42122). However, while much progress has been made, these reports note that there remains room for improvement and we will continue to work closely with the fire and rescue authorities to ensure that they respond effectively to these points.</p>

  <p>In addition, in recognition of the challenges ahead for the Scottish Government and the Scottish Fire and Rescue Services, we will review the framework within the next few months. We will work with the fire and rescue authorities and the unions to update the framework to set agreed priorities and objectives for fire and rescue authorities in a manner consistent with the government&rsquo;s new partnership with local government. By so doing, we will build upon the good work already achieved and continue the progress to create a modern and resilient Fire and Rescue Service, capable of protecting Scotland in the 21st Century.</p>

  <p>Yes. The Scottish Government will be providing local government in Scotland with record levels of funding over the period covered by the Spending Review 2008-11. The total package of funding for local government, as published in the Spending Review 2007, is &pound;34,730 million across the period 2008-11, which is an increase of 12.6% across the period.</p>

  <p>As agreed in the joint concordat, the support for flood prevention and coast protection is one of the grants which is being rolled up as part of the Local Government Settlement. Provision equivalent to the existing baseline of &pound;126 million funding for flooding has been transferred to the local government settlement.

  <p>Although we can do little to reduce the risk of developing inflammatory arthritis, early intervention can reduce symptoms, improve function, and reduce deformities and damage of joints by optimising treatment. This delays the progression of disease, and improves the day-to-day functioning of individuals and therefore their mental health and wellbeing.</p>

  <p>Those who develop arthritis may also benefit from anticipatory interventions that address the risk factors for cardiovascular disease, found often as a co-morbidity with arthritis. One such approach is the &quot;Keep Well&quot; programme which provides a health check that identifies and addresses clinical, lifestyle and social needs of 45 to 64-year-olds in deprived communities.</p>

  <p>Funding for the Scottish Funding Council reflects its responsibilities to fund college courses, including courses for school pupils. The college sector has been allocated additional resources as part of the 2007 Spending Review. We are currently in discussions with the Scottish Funding Council and the college sector to prioritise the investment we are making to determine how the funding can be used most effectively. We expect to issue strategic guidance to the council shortly.</p>

  <p>In accordance with the concordat, it is for a local authority to determine the number of kinship carers eligible for allowance. Eligibility criteria are set out in <em>Getting It right for every child in kinship and foster care.</em></p>

  <p>Data on the number of kinship carers of looked after children is not held centrally. National statistics show that at 31 March 2007, there were around 2,000 looked-after children living with kinship carers.</p>

  <p>This is the first progress report on implementation of the Scottish Biodiversity Strategy since the strategy was published in 2004.</p>

  <p>It records activity on biodiversity conservation carried out by government, non-government and other organisations working in partnership. It addresses the Strategy objectives for Species and Habitats, People, Landscapes and Ecosystems, Integration and Co-ordination and Knowledge.</p>

  <p>The report outlines activities which the Scottish Government and other public bodies have undertaken to implement the Biodiversity Duty, which was imposed by the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004, which requires all public bodies in Scotland to &quot;further the conservation of biodiversity&quot; in carrying out their functions.</p>

  <p>The publication of the progress report on implementation of the Scottish Biodiversity Strategy satisfies the requirements of section 2(7)(a) of the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act to publish such a report by the end of 2007.</p>

  <p>The decision to restrict the membership to public officials was taken in response to a strong view expressed by a number of different stakeholders during the consultation on the Strategy Plan in summer 2006, that applicants would be very uncomfortable with confidential business and financial information being open to scrutiny by private sector bodies or individuals.</p>

  <p>However, the RPACs have involved a range of private and third sector stakeholders and representative bodies, including those representing farmers and crofters, in the process of setting the regional priorities against which all funding proposals will be assessed, and will continue to engage with these bodies on the priorities and the operation of the programme as it goes forward to full implementation.</p>
