  <p>The government&rsquo;s objectives for cities are the same as for Scotland as a whole. We want cities to be wealthier and fairer; to be healthier; to be safer and stronger; to be smarter, and to be greener.</p>

  <p>Our objectives for community planning are consistent with our ambitions for simpler, smaller government. Our intention is to set out clear, strategic outcomes at national level but to leave local decisions to local decision makers. Community planning has a central role to play in this, joining national policy outcomes together with a clear vision for each local area to help deliver better services for local people.</p>

  <p>We are committed to supporting local authorities and their community planning partners in this work, ensuring that people and communities are better engaged in decisions about public services which affect them and helping public bodies work together more effectively to improve the well-being of local communities.</p>

  <p>As I announced during the debate on our Approach to Government, a critical element of our approach to simpler, smaller government is to declutter the landscape, in particular with reference to executive agencies and non-departmental public bodies. I plan to discuss this with the people who are involved in public services, to build consensus within Parliament that the public sector landscape has become too complicated and to reassess the relationship between the Executive its agencies and public bodies. Specific proposals will flow from those discussions and reassessment.</p>

  <p>The work of the General Register Office for Scotland and Registers of Scotland is essential to Scotland.</p>

  <p>I expect the General Register Office for Scotland to continue, on behalf of the Registrar General for Scotland, to arrange for the registration of life events (such as births and deaths), to maintain the NHS Central Register and to prepare and publish demographic and household statistics about Scotland&rsquo;s population. In particular, I expect them to continue to modernise the registration service using the new powers in the Local Electoral Administration and Registration Services (Scotland) Act 2006; to improve services for family historians (in particular by opening a new family history centre in Edinburgh in March 2008); to improve statistics on migration, and to prepare for the next census.</p>

  <p>The objective of the Registers of Scotland is to provide Scotland&rsquo;s citizens and institutions with the social and economic benefits that flow from a publicly guaranteed system of rights in land and property. Registers of Scotland will continue to develop the registers for which the Keeper of the Registers of Scotland is responsible, ensuring their accuracy, integrity and accessibility. In doing this, I expect the department to meet the financial target set annually by Scottish ministers for its operations and the registration performance targets set by the Keeper of the Registers of Scotland, and for the department to take forward a range of initiatives to develop its services and to deliver them electronically.</p>

  <p><strong>Shona Robison: Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network</strong> (SIGN) <em>Guideline 62 on Prophylaxis of Venous Thromboembolism</em> (VTE) states that all patients admitted to hospital for major trauma, major surgery or acute medical illness should be assessed individually for risk of VTE. This guideline, which is about to be reviewed, is followed in surgical units throughout Scotland.</p>

  <p>Other Guidelines relevant to VTE are <em>SIGN 89</em> (<em>Diagnosis and management of peripheral arterial disease, October 2006</em>) and <em>SIGN 36</em> (<em>Anti Thrombotic Therapy, March 1999</em>), which is currently under review.

  <p>Any changes to the role or functions of the Commissioner for Public Appointments in Scotland, who oversees public appointments in Scotland, is a matter for Parliament.</p>

  <p>The Public Appointments and Public Bodies etc, (Scotland) Act 2003 established the Commissioner for Public Appointments in Scotland. The commissioner is appointed on the nomination of the Scottish Parliament and is entirely independent of Scottish ministers. The current commissioner took up post on 1 June 2004. The commissioner&rsquo;s role is to oversee that all regulated appointments by ministers are made fairly and openly and, as far as possible, that all categories of people have the opportunity to be considered for public appointments. The act provides for the commissioner to consult with Parliament in the preparation of her Code of Practice on Public Appointments and to report to Parliament any failure by ministers to comply with the code. The act also requires that the commissioner must lay before Parliament each year a report on the exercise of her functions.</p>

  <p>The Executive&rsquo;s immediate procurement objective is to accelerate the programme of public procurement reform which is already underway. Two key themes underpin this programme. The first is to ensure effective collaboration amongst public sector bodies, to deliver best value for money for the taxpayer. The second is to improve access to public contract opportunities for the benefit of businesses.</p>

  <p>Budget monitoring is carried out within the Scottish Executive with the aim of producing information on a timely and reliable basis, to monitor the financial position against budgets approved by Parliament and to support decision-making and the application of financial resources in support of ministerial priorities.</p>

  <p>A 24-hour helpline for people in emotional crisis is already well established through Samaritans. The Scottish Government supports Samaritans&rsquo; work in Scotland through core grant funding. In addition Choose Life (the implementation team for the government&rsquo;s strategy on suicide prevention) have provided funding to enable Samaritans to develop a co-coordinated approach to suicide intervention in branches in Scotland. This funding has included support to Samaritans to recruit and train more volunteers, with specific training in suicide intervention training skills, and support to pilot a phone texting service which will be reviewed in November 2007.</p>

  <p>There are no plans to introduce a separate service to meet the same needs.</p>

  <p>The government also supports a number of other initiatives which provide support to people in crisis or experiencing low mood or depression. This includes the free Breathing Space telephone advice line (open 6pm to 2am nightly; currently piloting extended hours to 6am at weekends).</p>

  <p>In emergency situations the emergency services can be contacted on 999 for assistance, 24 hours a day.</p>

  <p>Through Choose Life, suicide prevention training is being rolled out across Scotland; over 11,500 individuals in community and public service settings have been trained in suicide intervention and risk management skills in the last three years.</p>

  <p>Data relating to teachers beginning Chartered Teacher programmes is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>Chartered Teacher programmes are modular in nature and were designed so that steady progress can lead to full qualification in about six years. At the moment prior learning can also be accredited and most of those completing the programme have taken advantage of this to some extent.</p>

  <p>Based on information from the General Teaching Council for Scotland, the numbers achieving full Chartered Teacher status in each year since inception of the programme in August 2003 is as shown in the following table.</p>

  <p>The employment of teachers, including the type of contract offered, is a matter for local authorities. However, teacher workforce planning is designed so that new teachers are completing their induction year at the volume needed to achieve a broad balance between supply and demand for teachers.</p>

  <p>In previous years, surveys by the General Teaching Council have found that most newly qualified teachers are in full-time positions by the middle of the autumn term.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has made additional funding of &pound;50.3 million available to local authorities for the employment of additional teachers to meet the target of a workforce of 53,000 by August 2007. This funding covers staffing costs for the end of school year 2006-07, and part year costs for 2007-08.</p>
