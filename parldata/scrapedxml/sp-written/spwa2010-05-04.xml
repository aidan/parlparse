  <p>Promoting Positive Outcomes: Working Together to Prevent Antisocial Behaviour in Scotland was published jointly with COSLA in March 2009 with the support of all relevant agencies. Volume 2 contains the detailed research, analysis and public consultation that informed this review.</p>

  <p>As part of this, the implementation plan for the framework, published on 23 October 2009, proposed that a new voluntary performance framework will be created which will support partners and practitioners in developing effective strategies locally. Included in this is a proposed objective to identify and support the collection at a local level of performance management information which will enable local authorities and partners to focus on continually improving performance.</p>

  <p>SPS recognises the concerns raised by HM Inspectorate of Prisons, with 28% of liberations testing positive for illegal substances, although this is a significant reduction from the 82% who tested positive on admission.</p>

  <p>HMP Perth is currently undertaking a review of its work to manage prisoners with problematic drug use.

  <p>The Scottish Government has ensured that Scotland can benefit from the UK-wide feed in tariff for renewable energy schemes, including micro-hydro. The Feed in Tariff came into force on 1 April 2010.</p>

  <p>Support is also provided to agricultural, forestry and rural micro businesses wishing to install micro-hydro schemes under the Scotland Rural Development Programme and advice and funding is available to Communities under the Community and Renewable Energy Scheme.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Government supports interest-free energy efficiency loans through our Energy Saving Scotland Small Business Loans Scheme.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government also facilitates the Forum for Renewable Energy Development Micro Hydro Sub-Group, which is an industry led group tasked with taking forward actions identified in the Renewables Action Plan for the micro-hydro sector. The group is currently working with SEPA on its draft guidance for run of river hydro schemes, which should help developers in identifying suitable sites for development</p>

  <p>The majority of funding for renewable energy schemes is not allocated by technology type, so it is not possible to give a set figure for micro-hydro.</p>

  <p>However, the Community and Renewable Energy Scheme has a budget of &pound;7.5 million for the provision of advice and grants during 2010-11 and is currently working with community groups on 32 potential micro hydro projects across Scotland with a total capacity of 5MW.</p>

  <p>Through the Central Energy Efficiency Fund (CEEF), interest-free loans are available for Scottish local authorities plus NHS boards and Scottish Water to invest in a range of energy efficiency and renewables projects, including micro hydro projects. Individual bodies manage their own CEEF pot which acts as a revolving fund. This revolving fund scheme will continue into 2010-11.</p>

  <p>The &pound;1.5 billion Scotland Rural Development Programme of economic, environmental and social measures continues to provide support to help deliver the government&rsquo;s strategic objectives in rural Scotland, including providing financial support under its Renewable Energy and Diversification Outwith Agriculture measures.</p>

  <p>The Energy Efficiency Action Plan, due to be published in late spring, will set out how we will target energy efficiency funding going forward.</p>

  <p>It is also worth noting that the key support mechanism for renewable energy schemes of less than 5 Megawatts is the Feed in Tariff, which is managed by Ofgem at a UK level</p>

  <p>Figures for the Scotland Rural Development Programme are not broken down by technology or year, however to March 2010 over &pound;2 million of funding has been approved under the Renewable Energy Agriculture Option. Over &pound;437,143 has been approved under the Renewable Energy Forestry Option and &pound;609,705 has been approved under the Renewables Non Land-Based option. Funding is also available for Renewables Projects under the Diversification Outwith Agriculture Option, where businesses are diversifying into renewable energy production, but this option goes a lot wider than just renewable energy projects.</p>

  <p>CARES has allocated grants to a number of hydro schemes, mostly larger than micro-hydro. In the last year, CARES awarded a grant of &pound;2,757 to a micro-hydro scheme in Comhairle nan Eilean Siar.</p>

  <p>Central Energy Efficiency Funding was provided from 2004-06, with &pound;15 million being split between local authorities and &pound;4 million provided to the NHS and &pound;1 million to Scottish Water. A breakdown of the figures spent on micro-hydro is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>Scottish Government officials have been working with stakeholders since early 2009 on the preparations for, and launch of, the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion. In particular, a wide range of stakeholder groups were engaged in the preparation for and delivery of the launch event for the European Year on 22 March 2010, opened by Fergus Ewing MSP.</p>

  <p>The Department for Work and Pensions are working in partnership with Scottish Government and the other devolved administrations to co-ordinate the UK National Programme for the European Year, being taken forward by a range of stakeholder groups. This includes awareness raising documentaries being produced by Poverty Alliance in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Scottish Government also sponsor and work closely with the Poverty Alliance on promotion of the year &ndash; including funding and support for a seminar in September 2009, to encourage early engagement with the European Year. Save the Children Scotland have also been supported by Scottish Government to raise awareness as part of the European Year, for a programme of local engagement centred around their travelling Museum of Poverty.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to supporting young people to achieve their potential through recognised awards for volunteering. Youth Achievement Awards and ASDAN certificates are both levelled against the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework and the Duke of Edinburgh&rsquo;s Award is also well recognised. The Scottish Government supports Youth Scotland in its work to develop and promote these awards in Scotland in line with the four capacities of National Outcome 4 and the Curriculum for Excellence.</p>

  <p>Through supporting organisations such as Youth Scotland, the Duke of Edinburgh&rsquo;s Award and Volunteer Development Scotland, the Scottish Government is committed to building capacity in the voluntary youth sector to enable all Scotland&rsquo;s young people to take advantage of the opportunities available to them.</p>

  <p>While we do not have exact numbers for all volunteering opportunities available to young people, we do know that 18,000 young people volunteered through the Duke of Edinburgh&rsquo;s Award with over 4,000 full awards gained; over 3,000 received Millennium Volunteer Awards, and over 3,500 received Youth Achievement and Dynamic Youth Awards in 2008-09.</p>

  <p>As noted in my previous answer, it is not the practice of the government to disclose whether it has sought legal advice in relation to a particular matter. Disclosure Scotland has not had a legal challenge relating to the inclusion of information about supervision orders on certificates</p>

  <p>Between April 2002 and March 2010, Disclosure Scotland has issued 4.5 million disclosure certificates. To establish completely accurate figures about the number of individuals where a supervision order has been disclosed would involve disproportionate cost as that would require a manual search of the content of each certificate.</p>

  <p>This is an operational matter for the Scottish Children&rsquo;s Reporter Administration (SCRA). The information requested is not held centrally. I have therefore asked the Principal Reporter to provide this information to the member.</p>
