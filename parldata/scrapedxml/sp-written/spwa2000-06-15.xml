  <p>A number of measures are already in place to improve the oral health of children. These include the payment of enhanced capitation fees to dentists for children in deprived areas who are registered with them on the NHS. Oral health promotion programmes are also in place in all health board areas and cover a diverse range of programmes including dental registration from birth, nursery toothbrushing schemes and dietary advice.

  <p>Assessment, which includes the setting and marking of examinations, is within the remit of the Scottish Qualifications Authority.</p>

  <p>I understand that an appeals procedure is in place to deal with any cases in which candidates fail to perform to their expected ability as set out in the estimated grades submitted for each candidate by centres. Results can be upgraded at two points in time. First there is an automatic appeal procedure carried out prior to the issue of results, where results will be adjusted if a centre&#8217;s estimates of expected grades are generally accurate. Second, a candidate&#8217;s centre can submit a formal appeal after the results have been published.</p>

  <p>In the event of a formal appeal the Scottish Qualifications Authority will require centres to provide evidence of a candidate&#8217;s ability before upgrading an award. Centres would have to submit a medical or other admissible reason for absence from an exam. Internal Assessment results may be submitted by the centre as part of this evidence.</p>

  <p>In June 1999, Glasgow had 10,330 employees working in 65 call centres. However, there are no details available about the number of male or female employees, and the number of full/part-time workers.</p>

  <p>In December 1997, a Scottish Call Centre Study was published by the University of Strathclyde and University of Stirling. This showed around two-thirds of the people employed in Scottish call centres (65.5%) are full-time employees and one-third (34.5%) are part-time employees.</p>

  <p>This report also showed overall Scottish call centre workforce is composed of 32.6% men and 67.4% women. Men are more likely to work full-time than women, 75% as opposed to 63.6%. Accordingly, women were more likely to be part-time than men, 36.4% as against 25%.</p>

  <p>29 out of Scotland&#8217;s 32 maternity hospitals participate in the UNICEF UK Baby Friendly Initiative with a further two planning to do so in the future. The initiative requires participating hospitals to implement 10 steps to successful breastfeeding. The 10 steps are evidence-based good practice standards and are part of a global initiative to enable mothers to breastfeed successfully. The initiative requires hospitals to have a written policy to ensure that staff receive training to enable them to implement that policy.</p>

  <p>Six of these hospitals have received the Baby Friendly Initiative UK Award and a number of other units have been awarded the Certificate of Commitment that acknowledges the units&#8217; progress in implementing some of the steps and also commits the hospital to working towards full assessment within two years.</p>

  <p>In addition the remit of the national breastfeeding advisor is to assist towards achieving breastfeeding targets, provide advice, training resources and support to NHS personnel and lay workers, to act as a facilitator to local Joint Breastfeeding Initiatives and to report and make recommendations to the Scottish Breastfeeding Group.</p>

Specialist services in the community are provided by Macmillan Nurses, Marie Curie Palliative Care Nurses and hospice home care nurses. Specialist palliative medicine physicians also frequently make domiciliary visits at the request of the General Practitioner. Marie Curie Community Nurses provide regular nursing care to patients at home, particularly night nursing, and give respite and support to relatives and carers.

  <p>I indicated earlier this week that we will set out our plans for forthcoming legislation in early July and this will represent the most comprehensive review of housing policy in decades. Our plans for legislation will build on ideas presented in December. In the area of anti-social behaviour we propose to introduce probationary tenancies for anti-social tenants as well as make it easier for nuisance neighbours to be moved from the community.</p>

  <p>We will legislate to introduce a common set of enhanced statutory rights (a new secure tenancy) for all tenants of social landlords. The new tenancy will build on the current secure model with new rights to succession, for example, for carers and new rights requiring landlords to consult tenants about plans for their homes enshrined in legislation. We will also enable additional rights to be provided on a contractual basis. We have also received a wide range of views on our proposals for modernising the right to buy in Scotland as part of these new tenancy arrangements. The main volume of comment has been in relation to three areas: the potential effect of our proposal if it was applied retrospectively to housing association assured tenants; the ineffectiveness of the current exemption to meet the needs of pressured areas, and the future operation of discounts for new tenants. We have responded to each of these concerns directly in our proposals for a modernised right to buy.</p>

  <p>Our conclusion is that the right to buy with its existing terms and conditions should remain unaltered for all current tenants who have this right. However, the right to buy for new tenancies should be modernised to strike a better balance between the interests of the individual, the landlord and the community as a whole.</p>

  <p>New tenants will become eligible to exercise the right to buy after five years as compared to the two-year period required under the current arrangements. In addition, a new unified discount structure for houses and flats will be introduced so that tenants will receive a 20% discount after the initial five year qualifying period, increasing by 2% per annum to a maximum 50% after 15 years and be capped at &pound;20,000.</p>

  <p>With respect to pressured areas, councils will be able to apply for a designation where there are particular difficulties in meeting the demand for socially rented housing. In these areas, the right to buy could be suspended for all new and re-let council and housing association tenancies for a specific period with the possibility of extension if pressures are not eased. We also intend to enable social landlords operating in these designated areas to offer tenants financial assistance towards the purchase of a house on the open market.</p>

  <p>The current exemption from right to buy for charitable housing association will continue and we will extend the existing exemption for sheltered housing to cover all group housing provided for persons with particular needs.</p>

  <p>With regard to retrospection, we have considered carefully the position of assured tenants of non-charitable housing associations that do not currently have a right to buy. We wish these tenants also to benefit from the new single social tenancy and, over time, from the modernised right to buy. Concerns have been expressed that the introduction of the new modernised right to buy could threaten the financial viability of some landlords. So, individual housing associations can choose to bring particular properties within the scope of the modernised right to buy if they so wish, but if there are concerns about financial viability properties can remain exempt for up to 10 years.</p>

  <p>We plan to make some general changes, which will affect both existing and new tenants. We propose to suspend eligibility for the right to buy from any tenants with arrears of rent and council tax and where legal proceedings are under way against tenants on the grounds of anti-social behaviour. We will also end the obligation on local authorities and Scottish Homes to act as lender of last resort to right to buy purchasers who are unable to obtain mortgage finance from other sources.</p>

  <p>Further details on all aspects of our housing legislative plans will be published in the forthcoming consultation paper on the Housing Bill. I will also be lodging an information paper on the single social tenancy proposals with the Scottish Parliament Information Centre shortly. This will set out the factual and analytical information that has informed our policy in this area.</p>

  <p>As explained in the announcement, the &pound;17.4 million now allocated amongst 31 specific projects on 1 June 2000 comes from the second phase of the Primary and Community Care Premises Modernisation Programme.

  <p>Following the invitation (announced on 9 December 1998) to bid against &pound;12 million for the first phase of this programme, details of a total of 44 successful individual projects to an increased total value of &pound;15.5 million were announced on 26 February 1999.</p>

  <p>These projects realise part of the &pound;1.8 billion investment programme announced by the then Secretary of State on 16 July 1998 and confirmed by the then Minister for Health on 18 November 1998.</p>

  <p>Information in the form requested is not readily available, as many trunk roads are a combination of dual and single carriageway sections and traffic flow and road standard along the route varies. It is therefore difficult to define either the busiest or least busy road.

  <p>At the first meeting of the Scottish Textile Forum on 12 June, I announced a package of support for the textile sector, full details of which are in a Scottish Executive press release. In summary, the support package includes the launch of four Champions for the textile industry to help promote the industry; plans for developing labelling initiatives; help for exporters as a priority sector; commissioning consultancy advice; reorganising Scottish Enterprise responsibilities to ensure better co-ordination of network support; financial support for retraining of redundant textile workers; proposed revision of the Assisted Areas map to support areas hit by textile redundancies; support for improving the image of the textile sector; and ensuring that the views of sector on important issues are fully and forcefully represented to UK and EU Governments. The forum meetings, which I shall chair, will help the Scottish Executive develop further measures to support the sector. All these support measures will be in addition to those announced on 6 June by the Government on a UK basis, in response to the report by the Textile and Clothing Strategy Group, and to the wide range of support provided to companies on a non-sectoral basis by the Executive and its agencies.</p>
