  <p>The monitoring of European foulbrood (EFB) consists of a European Foulbrood 2010 Control Plan, which was drawn up and agreed with beekeeping stakeholders. All apiaries where EFB was confirmed in 2009 were re-inspected and any cases were removed to quarantine apiaries where they were treated using the Shook Swarm method. Re-inspections are currently taking place in the quarantine apiaries.</p>

  <p>The monitoring of American foulbrood (AFB) consists of re-visiting all beekeepers whose bees were diagnosed as having AFB in 2009 and responding to beekeepers concerns. Any cases of AFB are destroyed.</p>

  <p>NHS boards in Scotland are responsible for the planning and provision of NHS services in accordance with national and local priorities and in line with the health needs of the population. Decisions regarding the care of individual patients are a matter of professional judgement for the clinician responsible for the patient&rsquo;s care.</p>

  <p>The arrangements in place for assessing new drugs and treatments for use in the NHS are through bodies such as the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) and NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS). Further information about these processes can be obtained from their websites <a href="http://www.scottishmedicines.org.uk" target="_blank">www.scottishmedicines.org.uk</a> and <a href="http://www.nhshealthquality.org" target="_blank">www.nhshealthquality.org</a>.</p>

  <p>The process for accessing orphan medicines as defined by the European Medicines Agency as a medicine licensed to treat or prevent life-threatening rare diseases affecting fewer than five in 10,000 people in the European Union, is the same as it is for all medicines. However, in addition to the usual assessment of clinical and cost effectiveness, SMC may consider additional factors such as whether the medicine substantially increases life expectancy and/or quality of life; can reverse, rather than stabilise the condition; or bridges a gap to definitive therapy. The list of SMC modifiers has been published on the SMC website.</p>

  <p>Where a medicine has been recommended by the SMC, it is expected that NHS Boards will make it or its equivalent available on an equitable basis within NHSScotland.</p>

  <p>Comprehensive guidance for NHS boards in the form of CEL 17 (2010) on the introduction and availability of new medicines in the NHS in Scotland was published on 17 May 2010. A link to the guidance is attached <u><a href="http://www.sehd.scot.nhs.uk/mels/CEL2010_17.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.sehd.scot.nhs.uk/mels/CEL2010_17.pdf</a></u>.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to generate an estimate of life expectancy for children undergoing conventional treatments for osteosarcoma in Scotland. A measurable indicator of outcome is the percentage of children diagnosed with osteosarcoma who remain alive 10 years after their original diagnosis (10-year survival). For children aged 0-14 years, diagnosed with osteosarcoma while resident in Scotland during 1998-2002 (14 cases), 50% of them survived to at least 10 years after diagnosis.</p>

  <p>The <em> </em> WHO <em> Night Noise Guidelines for Europe</em> were published in 2009. They build on the earlier 1999 WHO Guidelines for community noise and aim to provide scientific advice to the member states for the development of future legislation and policy action in the assessment and control of night noise exposure.</p>

  <p>The guidelines support the European Union Directive 2002/49/EC relating to the assessment and management of environmental noise (known as the END Directive). One of the obligations of the END is for member states to produce noise maps and data about night exposure from mid-2007. The Scottish Government has, in implementing the END, met all its obligations on time, including publishing <em>Noise Action Plans</em> which seek to manage noise on a prioritised basis.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government works closely with the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) to implement producer responsibility regulations in line with EC Directives on Packaging and Packaging Waste. The producer responsibility regulations obligate producers and suppliers who have a market share of more than &pound;2 million and produce more than 50 tons of waste a year to pay towards recycling the waste they produce. By placing this obligation on producers the regulations provide an economic incentive to reduce and prevent unnecessary packaging waste. More details can be found on SEPA&rsquo;s website:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.sepa.org.uk/waste/waste_regulation/producer_responsibility.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.sepa.org.uk/waste/waste_regulation/producer_responsibility.aspx</a>.</p>

  <p>The Zero Waste Scotland (ZWS) delivery programme, created to support Scotland&rsquo;s Zero Waste Plan, provides advice and support to all stakeholders involved in achieving a zero waste society. ZWS works with public agencies on the issue of reducing packaging of goods and supports the UK-wide Courtauld Commitment. Administered by the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), the Courtauld Commitment is a voluntary agreement aimed at improving resource efficiency and reducing the carbon and wider environmental impact of the grocery retail sector.</p>

  <p>The Courtauld Commitment (Phase 1) was launched in 2005 and had 42 signatories representing many key retailers and suppliers. This phase achieved the target of zero growth in packaging by 2008. Courtauld 2 was launched in March 2010 and moves away from solely weight-based targets, aiming to achieve more sustainable use of resources over the entire lifecycle of products, including their packaging. 29 major retailers and brand owners committed to Phase 2. Discussions about the shape of Phase 3 have commenced.</p>

  <p>Further details on the Courtauld Commitment can be found here:</p>

The Scottish Government will play a part of any review of the Skipton Fund.</p>

  <p>I will ensure that any such work will sit alongside that of the current Penrose Public Inquiry which is looking into the circumstances of hepatitis C/HIV acquired infection from NHS treatment in Scotland with blood and blood products.</p>

  <p>The Joint Improvement Team has funded five demonstrator sites to identify the contribution of intermediate care to a managed shift in the balance of care in order to achieve the outcome of increased independence at home.</p>

  <p>We are currently engaging with stakeholders to draft a national framework for intermediate care services in Scotland. As well as building on the emerging evidence from the demonstrator sites, the framework will incorporate examples of good practice, including those from rural and remote areas. The framework will be published early next year.</p>

  <p>The content, standards and competencies required within the GP training curriculum are specified by the General Medical Council, in consultation with the Royal College and educational providers. It is a competency-based curriculum which, over several years, is designed to ensure a GP gains a diverse range of experiences and specialist knowledge in practice settings in order to practice effectively and safely.</p>

  <p>While &quot;intermediate care&quot; is not a specific element within the GP curriculum, its many facets are covered within some of the core and essential skills a GP will need to demonstrate in order to satisfy the standards and behaviours prescribed by the GMC.</p>

  <p>Intermediate care is a range of enabling rehabilitative and treatment services delivered through an integrated approach in community settings to shift the balance of care from hospital to the community. It will include a wide range of services that help prevent avoidable acute hospital admissions and facilitate early discharge. The actual services provided will be a matter for local decision making and be based on local needs.</p>

  <p>It is extremely difficult to make any direct comparison between the cost in Scotland and the cost in England and Wales due to different ways in which EID has been implemented by the different administrations.</p>

  <p>A full Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) was prepared by the Scottish Government as part of the public consultation and regulatory process that introduced the Sheep and Goat (Records, Identification and Movements) (Scotland) Order 2009 (the sheep EID Regulations). Full cost estimates of all implementation options for Scotland, including those associated with the slaughter derogation, are provided within the RIA.</p>

  <p>The decision to electronically identify slaughter animals in Scotland was made in agreement with the majority of Scottish stakeholders as it provided a simple and efficient system for Scotland that maintained traditional market patterns. To assist with this decision I committed a further &pound;1 million to the &pound;3 million EID research pilot which all sheep farmers in Scotland can join as a partner farm and receive &pound;0.40 per animal which can assist with the cost of electronic tags. This research pilot is unique within the UK.</p>

  <p>Scottish Government published its <em>Zero Waste Plan</em> on the 9 June 2010. Annex B of the plan sets out guidance for local authority planning departments on the role of the land-use planning system in delivering waste management facilities. Scottish Government planning officials are working closely with all planning authorities in the preparation of their development plans including matters in relation to waste management. A wide range of stakeholders including planning authorities and Convention of Scottish Local Authorities have been engaged in the current review of Planning Advice Note 63 &ndash; Waste Management Planning.</p>

  <p>In addition, Scottish Government will shortly be giving further guidance to local authorities on the use of energy from waste treatment. Zero Waste Scotland and Scottish Futures Trust also provide local authorities with advice and support on procurement and achieving value for money in relation to waste management infrastructure.</p>
