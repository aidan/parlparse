  <p>Workforce development underpins the national objective, agreed by Scottish Government and COSLA, of ensuring that public services are high quality, continually improving, efficient and responsive to people&rsquo;s needs.</p>

  <p>Codes of practice developed by the Scottish Social Services Council for all social service staff and employers and national care standards require that staff have the necessary skills to undertake the roles for which they are employed and to meet the needs of the people they support. As commissioners of social services, local authorities need to work in partnership with employers across the social service sector and training providers to ensure that provision is made for training.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Social Services Council has developed two new professional development awards specifically for people working with individuals on the autism spectrum. Staff can choose between a Certificate in Supporting Individuals with Autistic Spectrum Disorders (SCQF Level 7) or a Certificate in Managing the Support of Individuals with Autistic Spectrum Disorders (SCQF Level 8).</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is aware of the importance of ensuring that health professionals receive appropriate guidance regarding the detection, diagnosis and treatment of all conditions, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD).</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has funded the evaluation of a number of pilots in diagnostic training to identify the most appropriate diagnostic tools for use across Scotland and enable more people to be diagnosed before referral to tertiary services. The aim of the training is to reduce waiting times for diagnosis for families where an individual may have an ASD and to get consistency in the diagnostic tools used in Scotland.</p>

  <p>A quality standard for ASD diagnostic services issued in 2005 offers people with ASD and family carers a clear indication of what can be expected from diagnosis and assessment services. It also provides a checklist for multi-disciplinary teams providing the service.</p>

  <p>NHS Education Scotland have developed and launched a web-based learning resource, designed for any health professional working in primary care, including GPs, nurses and allied health professionals. This resource aims to increase the understanding of key primary care practitioners of the needs of people with autism spectrum disorder when receiving patient care. This learning resource is also being accessed by dentists and other practitioners outwith primary care.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will shortly issue guidance to local authorities and health boards on commissioning services which are appropriate and accessible for people on the autism spectrum. The guidance recommends local authorities and health boards work in partnership to build on the 2003 audit of local needs and identify service gaps.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Consortium for Learning Disability has already done a considerable amount of work, through the e-SAY project, to develop national data standards for people with learning disabilities and people with autism spectrum disorder. Over the next year, the project will continue to work with health and social work partners to roll out the collection of information across Scotland.</p>

  <p><strong>(1.) Those whose medical history, travel history, or behaviours put them at risk of passing on transfusion transmissible infections and</strong></p>

  <p>The fuel poverty programmes have included the provision of central heating in both the public and private sectors. In the public sector, local authorities completed installations in their properties in March 2004 and housing associations completed installations in their properties in December 2004, except Glasgow Housing Association properties where, due to the high number of properties involved, the programme was completed in March 2007. In the private sector, installations have been carried out by the managing agent.</p>

  <p>The number of systems installed in the public sector from the start of the programme in 2001 until the programme ended in December 2004 are held as annual installation figures. The number of systems installed in each financial year over the period requested in North Ayrshire and South Lanarkshire council areas, is shown in the table:</p>

  <p>This dataset is not currently collected centrally. The content and range of data collection for looked-after children are kept under ongoing review. No final decisions have been reached on changes to be made for the immediate future.</p>

  <p><em>The Mental Health of Children and Young People: A Framework for Promotion, Prevention and Care</em> (Bib number 38415) clearly recognises the multi-agency planning and commissioning required by NHS boards and their partners in local authorities and education to ensure appropriate early intervention and access to services to address the emotional and mental health needs of this vulnerable group. We continue to work with NHS boards and their partners to deliver on this important agenda.</p>

  <p>Specifically, we have a commitment to providing mental health training for those working with or caring for looked after and accommodated children. This will allow them to recognise at an early stage mental health problems and facilitate earlier access to CAMHS services. A training pack has been produced and rolled out to 617 workers to date by 38 trainers. We are currently mapping the workers with the aim of ensuring the training remains accessible.</p>

We are currently engaging at strategic level with the &quot;For Scotland&rsquo;s Disabled Children&quot; coalition on relevant issues, as well as taking forward a range of practical measures such as national guidance on self-directed support which emphasises the involvement by children and young people in assessments and decisions about their care.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government, through sportscotland, is committed to providing opportunities for people with disabilities to take part in sport at all levels, and invests in disability sport in a number of ways through a range of key partners including local authorities.</p>

  <p>As the main providers of leisure and recreational activities, it is for local authorities to plan and deliver a range of opportunities. Sportscotland is helping to break down barriers in their ground breaking Active Schools programme by providing training opportunities through a new disability inclusion module. This training module has been designed to provide participants with the skills they need to ensure children and young people with a disability can enjoy the benefits of a range of sporting and physical activities. This training will roll-out across the whole of the active schools network operated by local authorities over the next two years.</p>

  <p>SIGN is reviewing its guideline 62 on prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism, and will use the opportunity to incorporate recommendations on the diagnosis and management of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The first meeting of the guideline development group is due to take place later this month, with consultation on the draft guideline expected during 2009.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether, in light of estimations that 1 in 20 people carry the thrombophilia gene and that around 3,000 people die of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in Scotland each year, there are any plans to increase the level of information available to doctors and patients on the risks of DVT.</p>

  <p>As an interim measure until the revised SIGN guideline is available, the Chief Medical Officer and the Chairman of NHS Quality Improvement Scotland have written to NHS boards asking them to ensure that consistent and accessible patient information on the prevention and management of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is available. Boards have therefore been asked to use the standard patient information leaflets provided with the letter.</p>

  <p>We have also commissioned Lifeblood, the thrombosis charity, to develop a general information leaflet on DVT. We expect GPs to make people aware of this leaflet and to display it so that it is available to the general public.</p>

</table></p>

  <p>Note: *Individual patients are counted once within year but may be counted more than once across years.</p>

  <p>These statistics are derived from data collected on patient discharges from non-obstetric and non-psychiatric hospitals (SMR01) in Scotland, SMR01 records are generated for each in-patient or day case episode occurring at general, acute (non-obstetric and non-psychiatric) hospitals.</p>

  <p>Adverse reaction to drugs is defined using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD10) codes; Y40 to Y59, T882, T886 and T887.</p>

  <p>Up to six diagnoses (one primary, five secondary) are recorded on SMR01 returns. All six diagnoses were used to select for T882, T886 and T887. The five secondary diagnoses were used to select for Y40 to Y59 (external causes), the primary diagnosis being the actual condition.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that within ICD10, it is possible to record information on adverse effects that may not necessarily be as a result of medicaments. For example, ICD10 code T78 can be used to record &quot;adverse effects, NEC&quot;. This will include patients who have had an adverse reaction to a food substance. Therefore codes that do not specifically make mention to &quot;medicaments&quot; have been excluded.</p>

  <p>This data has been provided by NHS National Services Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to improvement in mental health services. As part of that on-going attention we have published a commitment to work with NHS Education for Scotland to extend access to and provision of evidence based psychological therapies by 2010.</p>

  <p>Work to support this commitment includes a range of initiatives and interventions designed towards earlier intervention and better care management of mental health problems. These include: advancing a programme to improve training for a range of staff in cognitive behaviour therapy; publishing an Integrated Care Pathway for depression; rolling out a Self Help Treatment Access Resource Team (START) to support the delivery of training by using an evidence based programme for low mood and anxiety; establishing a pilot for a telephone advice line &quot;NHS Living Life&quot;.</p>
