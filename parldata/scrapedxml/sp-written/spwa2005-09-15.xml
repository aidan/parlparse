  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-18057 by Cathy Jamieson on 18 August 2005, whether the criteria for police issuing written warnings to children is standard across police forces and what the reasons are for its position on the matter.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-09-15.S2W-18587.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80053" speakername="Cathy Jamieson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa0915.htm#1">

  <p>Matters of operational procedure are for Chief Constables to decide rather than the Scottish Executive. The range of disposals can include a warning from a senior police officer, a police restorative warning, referral to the Children&rsquo;s Panel, or in serious cases, a report to the Procurator Fiscal. The reporter to the Children&rsquo;s Panel is normally consulted in all cases.</p>

  <p>It is important when dealing with children to consider each case on its merits so that an appropriate response can be made. Applying a set of fixed criteria for written warnings would run contrary to this.</p>

  <p>The Executive produced guidelines in June 2004 on the use of Police Restorative Warnings by the Police, supported by &pound;500,000 over two years to fund implementation. Chief Officers are committed to replacing the senior police officer warning across Scotland with restorative warnings by April 2006.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) has a statutory responsibility to keep under review and to develop its qualifications portfolio. SQA has developed a set of criteria for reviewing &quot;low uptake&quot; subjects &ndash; this policy has been endorsed by the National Qualifications Steering Group which is made up of representatives from across the educational sector. A summary of this policy is available to download from SQA&rsquo;s website ( <a href="http://www.sqa.org.uk" target="_blank">www.sqa.org.uk</a> ) &ndash; this outlines the criteria and sets out the position on retaining courses which have particular cultural, economic, social or political value.</p>

  <p>The SQA has not yet made any announcement concerning the withdrawal of specific National Courses. However, it is anticipated that SQA will shortly be communicating with all centres which deliver courses to provide an update on the development of the catalogue of national courses. This letter will explain how SQA intends to develop a dynamic portfolio of qualifications which meet the needs of Scottish learners.</p>

  <p>In terms of animal welfare during transportation there are a number of factors which need to be taken into consideration, such as the length of the total journey (not just the sea crossing) and the conditions in which the animals are housed during the journey. Livestock transported from Orkney are housed in Goods and Livestock Transporters which give the animals considerably more space than livestock vehicles and the road journey from Aberdeen is likely to be considerably shorter than that from Caithness. There is no evidence to suggest that sea journeys are particularly stressful and it is generally recognised that the most stressful time for animals is during loading and unloading. Provided those involved in the transport of animals comply with the requirements of the Welfare of Animals (Transport) Order 1997, animal welfare problems should not arise during sea transport.</p>

  <p>The framework for the provision of assisted conception treatments through the NHS is currently set out in the report of the Expert Advisory Group on Infertility Services in Scotland (EAGISS) 1999. Progress in adopting EAGISS has been made across Scotland, though I am aware of some remaining disparities in accessing these services. That is why I launched a consultation on the 8 September, seeking views on the future delivery of these services. A copy of this document can be found at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk</a> . Following this consultation the Executive will issue further guidance to NHS Scotland for planning the provision of infertility services by NHS boards.</p>

  <p>It is too early to assess the impact of boundary changes on individual treatments following the dissolution of NHS Argyll and Clyde in March 2006. I expect that our revised guidance on infertility will improve access to these services across all NHS boards.</p>

  <p>There are a number of mechanisms already in place and being developed to measure the public benefit of the new General Medical Services (GMS) contract.</p>

  <p>1. The national Pay Modernisation Team has developed an NHS Scotland-wide nGMS Implementation Tool to measure NHS boards&rsquo; progress in delivering the GMS contract. The information from this process is fed into the NHS board annual review process and action plans at both local and national level are being developed to address any issues from this which will improve delivery of services under the GMS contract to the public.</p>

  <p>2. Pay Modernisation Delivery Plans being submitted by NHS boards provide an opportunity to assess benefits and to ensure key issues are addressed both locally and nationally.</p>

  <p>3. The Quality and Outcomes Framework provides a comprehensive set of quality indicators that measure standard of quality care provided to patients and organisational achievements.</p>

  <p>4. NHS QIS has produced standards for the provision of safe and effective out-of-hours primary medical services to the public and these are evaluated to ensure they meet the required levels .</p>

  <p>5. Service specifications of enhanced services require providers to submit information to their NHS boards to support clinical and financial governance frameworks.</p>

  <p>6. NHS boards continue to develop systems to identify the impact of provision of enhanced services to patients and the general public.</p>

  <p>7. The performance of the GMS contract, including the delivery of patient benefits, is also discussed as part of the annual review for each NHS board.</p>

  <p>The continuation of high-level achievement in meeting the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) standards and providing additional services through the nGMS Contract provides positive benefits for the quality of the lives of many people across Scotland.</p>

  <p>For Example:</p>

  <p>Practices are rewarded for developing registers for patients with each of 10 chronic diseases and to show evidence of high-quality care of these conditions. Systematic call and recall of these patients is integral to this process, so that patients can be monitored and treated in accordance with expert guidance to optimise their care and prevent complications, minimising the need for referral to secondary care. Good chronic disease management is likely to reduce un-scheduled admissions to hospital.</p>

  <p>The QOF improves and encourages screening for all patients by incentivising up-to-date information about blood pressure, smoking status and past medical history so that patients in need of interventions can be targeted. It continues to incentivises practices to conduct cervical screening (smear tests) and to screen children in accordance with guidance.</p>

  <p>A programme for the evaluation of SMC work has been agreed and the work will commence in October 2005. The evaluation will look at the impact of SMC advice on the use of medicines across the healthcare system and compare SMC budget impact forecasts with the actual use of NHS resources. The work will also support the linking of clinical information with that on medicines use to help monitor the effectiveness of medicines in day-to-day patient care.

  <p>NHS board prescribing strategies seek to ensure more effective use of prescribing budgets. They are evidence based and reflect agreed clinical guidelines. They lead to savings in the use of some drugs and more intensive use of other therapies, where that has the potential to improve patient care. Savings in prescribing budgets remain within the NHS board concerned for reinvestment in patient care.</p>

  <p>Local prescribing behaviour should be in line with clinical guidelines which are set nationally. Implementation of guidance is a matter for NHS boards and individual clinicians in the light of the clinical need of individual patients.</p>

  <p>There are also national initiatives which will encourage national consistency in prescribing behaviour such as the evidence based prescribing elements of the Quality and Outcomes Framework in the new GP contract, a greater role for community pharmacists in medicines provision for those with chronic conditions, and improved decision support for prescribers through enhanced IT.</p>

  <p>The effective use of generic medicines is under constant review.</p>

  <p>In its June 2003 report on GP prescribing, Audit Scotland recognised that the potential benefits of further generic prescribing were at that time marginal. NHS boards and individual prescribers continue however to target savings as generic copies become available for branded products newly out of patent protection.</p>

  <p>The Executive also took steps during 2004-05 to ensure that NHS Scotland achieved better value from purchases of generic drugs used in Primary Care, and new reimbursement arrangements in respect of generic drugs are currently being phased in.</p>

  <p>I would refer the member to the definition which was given to the Social Inclusion, Housing and Voluntary Sector Committee in September 2000 by the then Minister for Communities, Wendy Alexander.</p>

  <p>Community ownership is a way of empowering tenants, maximising the total resources available for investment in public sector housing and securing additional benefits for the wider community. Community ownership would normally result from the transfer of existing public sector rented housing to alternative community landlords at a price which reflects the value of the stock and under arrangements which ensure that:</p>

  <p>The housing is owned by a non-profit-making body on which there is tenant, local authority and community representation;</p>

  <p>There is effective tenant involvement in key decisions;</p>

  <p>Housing is available, and continues to be available, to be let at affordable rents to those in housing need, including the homeless and other vulnerable groups, and</p>

  <p>There are guarantees for transferring tenants regarding rent increases, tenancy rights and repairs and improvements to the stock.</p>

  <p>I believe that definition is still relevant today.</p>

  <p>On 12 September 2005 the Scottish Executive published <em>Seas the Opportunity &ndash; A Strategy for the Long Term Sustainability of Scotland&rsquo;s Coasts and Seas.</em> Copies of the strategy document have been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 37466) and it is available on the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s website at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/publications/2005/08/26102453/25444" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/publications/2005/08/26102453/25444</a>.</p>

  <p>Our marine and coastal environments remain at potential risk from water borne pollution, sea-bed disturbance, habitat loss, disturbance to sea life and declining stocks of some fish species. While action is already in hand to address these risks, often through sector specific strategies, we need to do more to assess and deal with cumulative and cross-sectoral impacts to provide for improved protection of the environment in a way which means longer term socio-economic need. The new strategy will determine what specific new measure might be needed to achieve that.</p>

  <p>The impacts of any new measures that arise from the strategy will be considered initially by the new stakeholder group which will comprise representatives from a range of sectors, including fisheries. In addition, the interests of the fishing sector are being addressed through specific strategies for both inshore and sea fisheries, both of which are set within the wider context of the new marine and coastal strategy.</p>

  <p>The fishing sector, among others, is also being consulted fully on the work I have commissioned from Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) to identify potential candidate sites for Scotland&rsquo;s first coastal and marine national park. The stakeholder group for the marine and coastal strategy will make an input to SNH&rsquo;s assessment which I expect to receive by March 2006.</p>

  <p>The number of principal operations carried out on an in-patient and day case basis in Inverclyde Royal Hospital by operation type are shown in the table. Nationally collected information about out-patient procedures performed is a relatively new development and is incomplete at present.</p>

  <p>It should also be noted that clinical practice has changed significantly in a number of specialties between 1999 and 2004. Many procedures that may have been carried out as in-patient or day case procedures in 1999 are now carried out as out-patient procedures or even performed in health centres by primary care clinicians. As such, direct comparisons of hospital in-patient and day case procedure activity may not be representative of the total change in NHS activity undertaken over the given period.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. In-patient/day case surgical activity is captured on SMR01, derived from in-patient/day case discharges from non-obstetric, non psychiatric specialties.</p>

  <p>2. Procedures and operations are defined using the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys Classification of Surgical Operations and Procedures Fourth Revision (OPCS4).</p>

  <p>3. The information given relates to the calendar years 1999 through to 2004. However, due to the transactional nature of central databases (i.e. records are continually being added) this information could be subject to minor future change.</p>

  <p>4. From April 2003 the national reporting of surgical activity in out-patients has been required and ISD has been working with NHS boards to develop full compliance nationally. Comprehensive information on out-patient surgical activity is not yet available but indicative information on common out-patient procedures is available at <a href="http://www.isdscotland.org/data_development" target="_blank">http://www.isdscotland.org/data_development</a> in section <em>Changing Clinical Practices: Changing Data</em>.</p>

  <p>5. The figures above relate to principal operation only. Patients may have more than one operation performed during their episode in hospital.</p>

  <p>NHS board chairs have assured me at the recent annual review meetings that they will deliver the six months waiting times commitment for in-patient and day case treatment by December 2005.</p>

  <p>NHSScotland has made excellent progress in reducing waiting times for orthopaedic surgery. The latest figures show than on 30 June 2005, only 670 patients with a guarantee had waited more than six months for in-patient or day case orthopaedic treatment. This is a 64% reduction on the position on 30 June 2004. These figures clearly show that our policies of increasing NHS capacity and using the independent health care sector are working and providing significant benefits for patients.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what impact any changed priorities in policing since the London bombings have had on the ability of the police to respond to domestic violence incidents or to ensure the protection of victims of domestic violence and what statistical data on the deployment of police hours it has to monitor such impact.</p>

  <p>While Chief Constables may redistribute uniformed patrol resources from lower priority tasks in order to provide increased levels of security and public reassurance, they ensure that appropriate resources remain available for frontline operational policing tasks such as responding promptly to reports of domestic violence.</p>

  <p>Family protection work is normally undertaken by specially trained plain clothes officers who are not usually affected by any need to increase uniformed police visibility.</p>

  <p>The Executive&rsquo;s closing the opportunity gap approach to tackling poverty applies to all of working age. In particular, the forthcoming employability framework will support targets to reduce worklessness, increase the proportion of 16 to 19-year-olds who are not in education, training or employment, and tackle aspects of in-work poverty by providing employees with the opportunity to develop skills and make progress in their career. Executive programmes also address specific problems such as homelessness. The Executive is committed to implementing the recommendations of the Homelessness Task Force, which relate to all households which are homeless or threatened with homelessness.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The evaluation found that transitional care was &quot;reasonably effective&quot; at linking clients with services, however it was unclear to what extent these services could have been accessed by other means. The new Throughcare Addiction Services (TAS) will now be provided by community agencies and managed by Criminal Justice Social Work Departments. This service will provide continuity of care for prisoners leaving custody who wish to go on to receive addiction services in the community in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Females, Young Offenders and Prisoners serving over 31 days, not subject to statutory supervision, can be considered for access to the Throughcare Addiction Service. Prisoners who are serving less than 31 days, are on remand or in prison for fine default can continue to access Voluntary Throughcare Assistance, delivered by Criminal Justice Social Work.</p>

  <p>No single measurement can monitor racism but we can begin to gain an overall picture from a range of indicators, including:</p>

  <p>Dialogue with the experiences of minority ethnic communities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Social Attitudes Survey, and other surveys which seek people&rsquo;s views on discrimination, such as the pre- and post-evaluations of the One Scotland Many Cultures campaign.</p>

  <p>Monitoring the number of racist incidents reported to police forces (although an increase in the number recorded may not necessarily be attributable to an increase in incidents occurring, but more of a consequence of improved reporting procedures).</p>

  <p>Monitoring the educational attainment of minority ethnic pupils.</p>

  <p>Monitoring public authorities&rsquo; compliance with the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000.</p>

  <p>We are continually seeking to improve the information and monitoring available.</p>

  <p>The Partnership Agreement includes a commitment to complete the Scottish motorway network. The construction of a new motorway between the A8 junctions with the M73 and the A73 forms part of this. Draft statutory orders for this new length of motorway will be published early in 2006.</p>

  <p>The contract completion date is 26 September 2005. As I said in my reply to you on 18 August 2005, the contractor expects the new junction to be fully open to traffic at Christmas this year. The reason for the delay is due to structural failure.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Public Finance Manual sets out details of project management responsibilities for major investment projects. The precise management of capital projects post procurement will vary depending upon the nature of the individual project. For example, each IT capital project will have a project manager responsible for post procurement management whereas trunk road contracts are managed by a hierarchy of professional supervision provided by the contractor and an engineer appointed by the client, all under a quality assurance scheme. Professional engineers within the department provide the highest level of supervision to ensure adherence to contracted price, quality and delivery time.</p>

  <p>Speed monitoring is carried out on an on-going basis by the SPECS system and other permanent recording equipment on the road. Personal injury crash and casualty records are also maintained on an on-going basis. All these statistics will be used over time to establish the effect of the system.</p>

  <p>We are currently not aware of any plans by safety camera partnerships to introduce the Speed Enforcement Camera System (SPECS) to more roads in Scotland. SPECS has been introduced on the A77 from Bogend to Ardwell as a trial and as part of an integrated road safety strategy for the A77 that includes &pound;20 million investment in road engineering improvement, increased road policing activity and an education programme. The first review of the effects of the system will be at the end of twelve months and will inform future decisions on the inclusion of this type of equipment in the Scottish Safety Camera Programme.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to working with its partners in ensuring that we have the sporting infrastructure in place to make Scotland a truly sporting nation. However, it is for the owners or operators of the sports facilities to ensure they are maintained to an adequate standard.</p>

  <p>The information requested is set out in the following table using three year averages and was collected through a household omnibus survey undertaken by TNS every second month in Scotland. The total sample is normally 6,000 adults and 1,500 young people per annum but in 2003-04, as a result of additional funding from the Executive, the survey sample size was increased for this year only to 25,000 and 6,000 respectively. This allowed <strong></strong> sportscotland to gather more detailed information on participation at a local authority area level. In completing the survey, respondents are asked about what they did in the last four weeks. Peak two months data is used to take account of sports where participation tends to be seasonal.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally. It is for local authorities to determine their level of facility provision according to local needs and priorities and how best to fund facility development which may be under the new prudential regime for local authority capital, utilising the sports facilities and swimming pools element of their total revenue grant or a combination of funding sources. The Executive has committed over &pound;28 million of Exchequer funding to support the development of a range of facilities being developed through the National and Regional Sports Facilities Strategy.</p>

  <p>Visitors to the Scottish Parliament can tour the Main Hall area which comprises our exhibition, shop and caf&eacute; on their own. The exhibition and a wide range of leaflets are available for visitors explaining Parliament and its role. Audio tapes and CDs are available for all our main leaflets and the exhibition text. Leaflets themselves carry wording to explain that they are available in audio tape and CD and Visitor Service Officers in the Main Hall can respond to requests. This is also publicised on the website. Visitor services staff will make all reasonable adjustments in advance for visitors with a disability who indicate a specific requirement for their visit.</p>

  <p>On non-business days visitors can also take a paid for guided tour which includes the garden lobby, chamber, committee rooms and Queensberry House foyer. Tour guides are trained to meet the various additional requirements that may be required by a disabled person to allow them to fully participate in the tour. Further disability equality training for the guides is planned in the coming year.</p>

  <p>Visitor services will be reviewing the Guided Tour Programme as part of a wider review of Visitor Services planned for autumn 2005 and this will include considering the range and types of tours on offer.</p>
