  <p>The Executive has no functions in relation to the proposed aggregates tax. It is expected that the tax will lead to an increased use of recycled aggregate. No figures are available predicting the increase in use of recycled aggregates or the reduction in use of virgin aggregates in Scotland as a direct result of the proposed tax. The Executive has, however, commissioned research to provide information on the extent to which recycled minerals are being used as an alternative to primary aggregate. This will provide a basis for any future setting of recycling targets or regular surveys to enable monitoring of activity. The research report has been published this week and a copy is available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>Available data do not suggest that the overall incidence of cancer amongst residents of the Cowdenbeath and Lochore area of Fife is unusual when compared with that for Fife Health Board or Scotland as a whole. The table below sets out the observed and expected number of cases in postcode sectors best representing Cowdenbeath and Lochore areas based on rates for (a) Scotland and (b) Fife Health Board area; all ages, by sex: 1988-97.</p>

  <p>In all comparisons the ratios of the observed to expected numbers of cases are close to one, and the associated 95% confidence intervals all include the value of one, indicating that any departure from the expectation is not statistically significant.</p>

  <p>Chapter 9 of <i>Business in the Information Age </i> demonstrates that Scotland has made significant progress in the adoption of technologies for business purposes since the previous year, both relative to other regions of the UK and in actual terms. Scotland is above average or average on most significant measures, including the connectivity indicator. This shows that 76% of Scottish businesses either have a website, make frequent use of e-mail or use electronic data interchange, and is exceeded by only four of the UK&#8217;s 12 regions.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive and the enterprise networks are committed to ensuring that Scotland improves this position. The UK Government has announced that ICT local support centres will receive an additional &#163;30 million over the next three years to help businesses move beyond having a website or trading online to transform themselves through the effective use of information and communication technology. Scotland will receive a share of this money.</p>

  <p>Both Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise have set targets for e-commerce adoption in line with those for the UK as a whole. The e-commerce strategy for Scotland detailed in the <i>Connecting Scotland</i> document ensures a co-ordinated approach to these activities. The strategy was drawn up by a steering group led by Scottish Enterprise and assisted by around 300 other individuals and organisations, and it focuses on creating the right environment, accelerating business uptake, accelerating supply-side development and developing skills and knowledge for the future. They aim to achieve the targets by implementing a recently enhanced range of initiatives aimed at SMEs including workshops, seminars, a consultancy package, awareness raising events, best practice awards and e-business advisors.</p>

  <p>The Chief Scientist Office is largely a response mode funder of research and this role is well known and advertised throughout the health care and academic community. Research proposals are assessed on the basis of their scientific quality and potential relevance to the health of the people of Scotland. Projects must be able to demonstrate &quot;health gain&quot; and potential to improve health care. Such assessments are made by expert peer group and committee review. Potential applicants are encouraged to discuss their research idea with CSO at an early stage, so that they can develop their proposals in a way that most directly addresses Scotland&#8217;s public health and health services research needs. Comprehensive information and guidance on how to apply for a CSO research grant is available on the CSO website at www.show.scot.nhs.uk/cso/.</p>

  <p>A strategic statement of CSO&#8217;s role in supporting NHS-related research is set out in its 1998 Research Strategy document, a copy of which is also on the CSO website.</p>

  <p>Five life prisoners were transferred on an unrestricted basis and seven on a restricted basis under the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997. 13 life prisoners were transferred on a permanent basis under section 26(1) of the Criminal Justice Act 1961, which preceded the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 and one life prisoner was transferred following a court martial in Berlin, Germany. The Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 and its predecessor only provides for the transfer of prisoners within the UK, therefore the answer to parts (b) and (d) is none.</p>

  <p>In addition, there are three transferred life prisoners who are at present detained as restricted patients in the State Hospital.</p>

  <p>The GB Assisted Areas map (defining the areas in which Regional Selective Assistance can be given) was approved by the European Commission on 26 July 2000. This map comprised of amalgamations of 1991 local authority wards rather than development areas. A list of the 656 Scottish wards included in the map was published when the map was approved and is accessible on the Scottish Executive website ( <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/who/elld/_Forms/aawards.prn">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/who/elld/_Forms/aawards.prn</a> ).</p>

  <p>These 656 wards are of varying size and population coverage, but overall the Assisted Areas map covers 48% of the Scottish population.</p>

  <p>Data in respect of grant assistance offered in each individual 1991 ward is not readily available and could only be provided at disproportionate cost. However, details (including Travel to Work Area locations) of individual offers of Regional Selective Assistance over &#163;75,000 are, after the first instalment of grant has been paid, published quarterly in <i>Labour Market Statistics</i>, which is available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre.</p>
