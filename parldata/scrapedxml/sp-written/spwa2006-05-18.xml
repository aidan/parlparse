  <p>Since 2000 the Executive has invested nearly &pound;25 million into early years and childcare staff development and a further &pound;12 million is committed to 2008.</p>

  <p>As part of the Scottish Budget arrangements, 2004, the Executive committed to increasing the proportion of workers qualified to the Scottish Social Services Council (SSSC) registration standards from 65% in 2003 to 85% in 2009.</p>

  <p>Registration of the early years and child care workforce with the SSSC is an important aspect of increasing professionalism in the sector.</p>

  <p>Registration will commence during 2006 and is dependent on holding or working towards a relevant qualification. Registration will also involve a commitment to continuous professional development.</p>

  <p>The GDP figures published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) for Quarter 1, 2006 are the first preliminary estimate of GDP growth. These figures are available with a 3.5 week lag, but are based on incomplete production data, limited retail sector data, and published at the broad industry level only. The second estimate is available with a lag of eight weeks, with a third estimate, based on fully balanced accounts, available 12 weeks after the end of the quarter.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive publish one quarterly estimate of Scottish GDP around 17 weeks after the end of the relevant quarter.</p>

  <p>Additional time is required to process Scottish extracts of UK survey data for the relevant quarter and to obtain additional data for industrial sectors to produce robust estimates of GDP for Scotland.</p>

  <p>The vast majority of support services to business are provided through the Enterprise Networks. Since 2002, there has been an ongoing programme of simplification of the support offered to business throughout Scotland.</p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise, in 2002, had approximately 1,500 support products it could offer to business. A rationalisation programme saw this reduced to 800 by 2004. Since then, the Chief Executive&rsquo;s &quot;Agenda for Change&quot; has seen further reductions and by 1 April 2006, the number had been reduced to 126. It is expected by the end of this year, that there will be 71 support products on offer from Scottish Enterprise. Similarly, between 2002 and 2004, Highlands and Islands Enterprise undertook an intensive review of its products and processes, delivering a substantial reduction in product numbers and streamlining the process for smaller grant applications. This has resulted in a reduction in the time taken to process applications for up to &pound;25,000 from 40 days to under 12 days.</p>

  <p>In addition, following recommendations from a departmental review of business support, the Executive is currently reviewing the support offered to business through a variety of grant schemes. The aim is to simplify the support mechanisms available and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of direct grant support.</p>

  <p>Environment and Rural Affairs Department officials, in conjunction with Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise, have held several meetings with representatives of a number of key commercial interests to discuss their plans for the cultivation and processing of bog myrtle oil in Scotland.</p>

  <p>A comprehensive report, produced by independent consultants, on the potential for this new product to benefit Scottish producers and the rural economy, indicates that current demand can be met from wild harvest but that optimising future development will depend on further agronomic research. This is likely to require the establishment of a number of plantations in various parts of Scotland. Options are now being explored for taking this research forward, with support from public agencies, although immediate progress requires the provision of further information on the proposed research which is currently awaited from the private sector partners.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what steps it is taking to assist Glasgow City Council to make a case for a share of the &euro;50 billion EU &quot;smart money&quot; budget for scientific research and innovation.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive assumes that the EU &quot;smart money&quot; budget for scientific research and innovation refers to the 7th EU R&amp;D (Research and Development) Framework Programme. The Framework Programme (FP) is the EU&rsquo;s main instrument for funding research and development. The current FP is FP6, which will be running up to the end of 2006 and FP7 will be fully operational as of 1 January 2007 and will expire in 2013. The budget for the FP7 remains to be agreed as part of the ongoing negotiations. The Commission proposal for FP7 outlines a budget of &euro;73 billion over seven years (2007-13). A final budget is expected in the summer of 2006.</p>

  <p>The Executive is keen to maximise Scottish participation in Framework funded projects. The Innovation Relay Centre (IRC) is a Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise funded initiative specifically designed to facilitate Scottish participants to secure European R&amp;D funding and find Framework partners or projects to join. The framework is open to all private and public entities, both large and small, and I would encourage all interested parties to contact the IRC for further information.</p>

  <p>The Executive has recently introduced electronic tendering arrangements for procurement exercises such as this and bidders for the Clyde and Hebrides ferry services have the option of submitting their bid and other associated information using this mechanism. These arrangements should reduce bidders printing and postage costs, as well as provide savings on staff costs given the less intensive nature of the arrangements.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Executive will also be establishing an Electronic Information Room as part of the next stage of the tender process. Access to the Electronic Information Room will be made available to all of the organisations who are invited to tender to operate the services. The information provided by the Executive will include detailed operational and financial information relating to the existing services. This should minimise the time that bidders need to spend on collating and researching information in preparation of their bid.</p>

  <p>The tender process for the Clyde and Hebrides ferry services commenced in October last year when adverts seeking expressions of interest from operators interested in providing the services were widely published. Following the responses to the adverts, Pre-Qualification Questionnaires were sent to the organisations that expressed an interest. By the closing date for returns, three organisations submitted a Pre-Qualification Questionnaire. The questionnaires, which are being used to assess the financial and operational robustness of the organisations interested in operating the services, are currently being evaluated by the Executive. Following this process, which we hope to complete shortly, we will identify a suitable tender list and issue formal Invitations to Tender.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to providing bidders for the Clyde and Hebrides ferry services with as much information as possible to allow them to construct a fully informed bid. As part of the tender process so far, an Initial Information Pack was sent to the organisations who expressed an interest in operating the services. The Initial Information Pack provided background information on the project and details of the existing network of services.</p>

  <p>For the next stage of the procurement process, the Executive will be establishing an Electronic Information Room. Access to the Electronic Information Room will be made available to all of the organisations who are invited to tender to operate the services. The Electronic Information Room will include detailed operational and financial information relating to the routes being tendered, and should allow bidders to construct a fully informed bid.</p>

  <p>The Executive first became aware of complaints to the European Commission regarding the Clyde and Hebrides ferry services in spring 2005 but were not informed who lodged the complaints nor the details of the complaints. The general policy of the European Commission, unless in exceptional circumstances, is not to reveal the identities of any complainants. In this instance, the Commission has not revealed the names of complainants, or details of any complaints, against the Clyde and Hebrides ferry services.</p>

  <p>Arran Ferries wrote to the Executive on 26 April 2006 (which the Executive received on 9 May after requesting a copy), indicating that they had lodged a detailed report with the European Commission requesting the immediate commencement of Infraction Proceedings.</p>

  <p>The answer to question S2W-25339 outlines how any national allowance would be determined by explaining that it would be determined by Regulations under the Adoption and Children (Scotland) Bill proposed to be introduced by ministers to the Scottish Parliament following consultation. Question S2W-25339 did not ask whether any such allowance would be applied on a statutory or voluntary basis. We are still considering how best to implement such a national system, in the light of changing practice in the payment of allowances.</p>

  <p>Operations are carried out within NHSScotland in a wide range of settings dependent on a number of factors including the complexity of the operation and the clinical and personal needs of the patient.</p>

  <p>The table shows trend data on the number of principal procedures carried out on patients admitted as in-patients or day cases to Scottish hospitals.</p>

  <p>In addition, some operations are performed in out-patient clinics. The ISD website provides details of available national figures. Currently, it is difficult to describe and quantify accurately the level of operations carried out in out-patients. ISD have been working with NHS boards to capture this information.

  <p>The Vulnerable Witnesses (Scotland) Act 2004 gives all child witnesses an automatic right to use standard special measures to assist them give their best evidence and help reduce the fear and distress of doing so. The standard special measures are: giving evidence via a live television link, giving evidence from behind a screen in court and having a supporter present in conjunction with either of these measures. In addition, the act provides that a child witness under 12 will not normally be required to attend court to give their evidence in certain types of cases.</p>

  <p>These provisions are being implemented in phases. At present they are available to child witnesses in High Court and sheriff and jury trials and in children&rsquo;s hearings court proceedings. They will become available to child witnesses in sheriff court summary cases from April 2007. Until then child witnesses can on application be allowed by the court to give their evidence from behind screens or via a live television link under existing statutory provisions or under common law.</p>

  <p>The national protocol, &quot;In Partnership, Challenging Domestic Abuse&quot;, agreed by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service and the Association of Chief Police Officers Scotland provides that where a child witness is to give evidence the police and the Procurator Fiscal must consider what special measures are required to minimise any distress to the child. The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service offers training for its staff specifically on domestic abuse.</p>

  <p>The Victim Information and Advice service (VIA), part of the Crown Office, offers a court familiarisation visit and provides information booklets appropriate to a child&rsquo;s age. VIA also keeps in touch with child witnesses through their parent or carer and advises them of the progress of the case.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-25389 by Ross Finnie on 4 May 2006, whether any official in the minister&rsquo;s department received the advice from Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), or information about what that advice would be or would be likely to be, on an earlier date and, if so, which official or officials were involved and on which date or dates the advice or information was received.</p>

  <p>Scottish Executive officials from the Landscapes and Habitats Division in the Environment and Rural Affairs Department sat on the Coastal and Marine National Parks steering group which had oversight of Scottish Natural Heritage&rsquo;s work and the report. They were asked to provide comments on a draft paper which was presented to the SNH Board on 14 March. My officials in the Marine Management Division of the Environment and Rural Affairs Department, who have policy responsibility for Coastal and Marine National Parks, also saw a copy of the draft advice that was considered by the SNH Board.</p>

  <p>My officials in the SNH Sponsorship Team routinely see SNH Board papers which are submitted to them, prior to SNH Board meetings. These papers are, however, for the board to consider.</p>

  <p>I understand that the board recommended changes to the Coastal and Marine National Parks paper and that a board sub-group met on 28 March to incorporate these in the final version of SNH&rsquo;s paper. The paper was cleared by SNH on the afternoon of 30 March and sent to ministers that evening.</p>

  <p>The Executive already has some, limited, powers to support individual post office businesses. An amendment to the Scotland Act makes an exception to the reserved status of postal services for &quot;financial assistance for the provision of services (other than postal services and services relating to money or postal orders) to be provided from public post offices.&quot; Communities Scotland has used this provision to enhance Government assistance to post offices through a &pound;2 million capital grants scheme and recently-announced business improvement training opportunities for post offices in deprived areas. Any extension of these powers, through primary legislation or an order under the Scotland Act, would require the approval of both the Scottish and the UK Parliament.</p>

  <p>As part of the review of NHS prescription charges and exemption arrangements, the consultation document was sent to various organisations including medical bodies, patient groups, voluntary sector organisations and individuals, inviting responses on this issue. Recipients are listed in the consultation document.</p>

  <p>However, we recognise that the consultation document alone may not have reached all those who would wish their views to be taken into account. Accordingly the review process has included the establishment of focus groups targeted on key stakeholders whose views might not have been caught by means of the written consultation alone. Additionally an independently commissioned survey is being conducted to gauge public awareness regarding prescription charges.</p>

  <p>The responses from all three initiatives will be duly analysed and taken into account when considering what action may be taken.</p>

  <p>Thanks to the very hard work of all involved, including local authorities, the Licensed Trade and individual businesses, implementation has been very smooth. Compliance with no-smoking in enclosed public places is very high. Local authorities are working with businesses to deal with mainly technical infringements for non-display of the required no-smoking signage. Compliance data for the first month of the ban will be published in June.</p>

  <p>I can announce today that, following careful consideration of this matter, Scottish ministers have concluded that <strong></strong> sportscotland&rsquo;s headquarters should be relocated to Glasgow. The headquarters will be located within the new National Indoor Sports Arena in the east end of Glasgow which is being built as part of our National and Regional Sports Facilities Strategy. This is due to be completed in the autumn of 2009 and the move will take place as soon as the building is ready.</p>

  <p>The Student Awards Agency for Scotland does not provide funding for such vaccinations as it is a &quot;course related&quot; cost and not one to be met from the student support budget.</p>

  <p>In general, if a student is facing particular financial hardship then it is possible for them to apply to their institution directly for assistance from the hardship funds. However, there is no guarantee that the institution would provide funds for this purpose. Such decisions are a matter for the individual institution.</p>

  <p>Scottish interests in Ofcom work are represented by reserved statutory mechanisms such as the Ofcom office in Scotland, Ofcom&rsquo;s Scottish advisory committee and members on Ofcom&rsquo;s consumer panel and content board. The Executive works closely with all parts of Ofcom through regular dialogue on Scottish issues and via responses to key Ofcom consultations.</p>

  <p>The most recent study undertaken in Scotland in 1998 reported a median figure for domestic per capita consumption of 139.1 litres per head per day and a mean figure of 143.3 litres per head per day. The same report suggested this sat comfortably within the range of published OFWAT 1998-99 figures for English and Welsh water companies of between 134.5 and 158.8 litres per head per day.</p>

  <p>Water consumed by business customers varies significantly. It is not possible to make a meaningful comparison between Scotland and England and Wales.</p>
