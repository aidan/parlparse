  <p>Since April 2008, an agreed system of call categorisation (red, amber, green) has been in operation between the Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) and clinicians in Orkney. The purpose of this is to ensure that a consistent approach is taken by all clinicians in Orkney and that there is a clear understanding of priority by the SAS. This system only applies to clinician requests for an air ambulance.</p>

  <p>The following table sets out the four calls from April 2008 to end September 2008 that were categorised as red by the notifying clinician.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-15005 on 3 September 2008 which details some of the initiatives which will help to tackle Islamophobia that are currently being funded by the Scottish Government. In addition educational resources are being developed for the <em>Sectarianism: Don&rsquo;t Give It, Don&rsquo;t Take It</em> online schools resource and we are working with groups representing Scottish Muslim communities to develop work in this area. Broader initiatives, such as that described in the answer to question S3W-16054 on 2 October 2008, which support multicultural community engagement and inter-faith dialogue will have a positive impact for all communities in Scotland, including the Muslim community.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government, VisitScotland and EventScotland are working in close collaboration to promote Homecoming Scotland 2009 (HS09). VisitScotland is committed to the effective marketing of Homecoming and the Homecoming theme now runs through VisitScotland&rsquo;s entire marketing programme. Homecoming is integral to VisitScotland&rsquo;s drive to promote Scotland domestically and internationally as a quality must see, must return destination.</p>

  <p>The US is a key market for Homecoming and activity to promote Homecoming has included:</p>

  <p>VisitScotland&rsquo;s US database &ndash; now comprising some 200,000 tourism prospects &ndash; receiving monthly alerts on Homecoming;</p>

  <p>Homecoming was the central theme for Scotland Week this year;</p>

  <p>VisitScotland&rsquo;s Scots Masters (US travel agents who sell Scotland) will represent Homecoming at around 15 of North America&rsquo;s largest Highland Games, with a combined audience of over 1 million. Some of the individual games have an audience in excess of 250,000 Scottish and Highland Games enthusiasts;</p>

  <p>Ryder Cup activity in Louisville included announcements on Homecoming, and</p>

  <p>Whisky Press trip from US took place in September 2008.</p>

  <p>A major Homecoming multi-media campaign is to be launched in Canada, the US, Australia and New Zealand. The campaign will run across National Geographic&rsquo;s many assets alongside an online campaign with VisitScotland&rsquo;s best responding media such as the New York Times, Toronto Star and Melbourne Age.</p>

  <p>19% of ancestral tourists to Scotland come from the USA. Homecoming presents an enormous opportunity to tap into the market of people worldwide with Scots ancestry. A robust programme of marketing activity continues to promote <a href="http://www.ancestralscotland.com" target="_blank">www.ancestralscotland.com</a> as the main signpost for users to find out all they need to know about starting their ancestral journey to Scotland. The website <a href="http://www.ancestralscotland.com" target="_blank">www.ancestralscotland.com</a> is one of VisitScotland&rsquo;s busiest websites.</p>

  <p>Changes to the US census rules now allows people to identify themselves as Scots (previously the category was Scots-Irish). In September VisitScotland used this information and launched its biggest ever US direct mail initiative. Almost 140,000 specific household addresses, profiled by Scots ethnicity and income, will received a Homecoming mailshot. VisitScotland&rsquo;s partners in the direct mail initiative are the airlines Continental, US Airways and Globespan, and travel operators CIE, Trafalgar, Great Canadian Travel Company and Royal Scottish Tours.</p>

  <p>Local authorities take a wide range of approaches in addressing the health and support needs of homeless households. As such, there will be a number of indicators which local authorities would see as contributing to the support needs of homeless people with alcohol dependency.

  <p>In line with our public announcement in August on progress with the Fife Structure Plan, a decision has not yet been reached, as Scottish Government is considering draft modifications, and progressing the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) of their environmental effects, with a view to publishing the proposed modifications and the SEA Environmental Report for public consultation later this autumn.

  <p>The vast majority of ex-offenders are accommodated within mainstream housing services.

There are a number of options for provision of additional support, including supported tenancies and residential hostel accommodation.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government acknowledges the importance of suitable accommodation as one of the key factors that can reduce the likelihood of an individual re-offending. We are working closely with COSLA to ensure that at national and local level agencies work together to enhance services for offenders, including their ability to access and sustain appropriate accommodation. In some cases they will require not just a tenancy, but additional support to sustain it.</p>

  <p>There are a range of ways to provide additional support in accommodation, including residential units like St Fittick&rsquo;s House and supported tenancies. Decisions on the appropriate range of service provision in a local authority area are for the local authority concerned, working with the relevant Community Justice Authority. Annual grant of approximately &pound;3.925 million per year is provided by the Scottish Government to Community Justice Authorities under section 27(1) of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 for supported accommodation for offenders.</p>

  <p>We believe that public space CCTV systems can play an important role in the prevention, detection and prosecution of crime. Local authority operated CCTV systems are nearly all linked to local police force operations, and in some areas there are information sharing protocol agreements already established for the sharing of footage and information.</p>

  <p>Businesses and organisations are required to operate CCTV systems within the requirements of the Data Protection Act 1998 and Information Commissioner&rsquo;s code of practice. We are currently concluding a strategic review of public space CCTV in Scotland, which is intended to clarify its specific role. The report is expected in November. In addition to profiling what public space CCTV infrastructure exists in Scotland, the report will cover strategic issues on its purpose and use; changing technology and data management, plus consideration of the published evidence that exists regarding the evaluation and impacts of public space CCTV. I plan to share the output of the strategic review with key stakeholders early in 2009, and then consider what actions to take in light of its findings.</p>

  <p>In addition to direct research expenditure, the CSO also meets the additional indirect costs to the NHS of hosting research funded by bodies such as the MRC and research charities. Such indirect expenditure on these conditions is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>As yet there has been no extension to the free school meals scheme. There are two commitments in the concordat about extending entitlement to free school meals:</p>

  <p>To extend entitlement to free school meals to all primary school and secondary school pupils whose parents or carers are in receipt of both maximum child tax credit and maximum working tax credit from August 2009, subject to the necessary legislation being passed.

  <p>Local authorities will provide free school meals to all P1 to P3 pupils from August 2010, subject to the necessary legislation being passed. This will benefit approximately 118,000 pupils.</p>

  <p>The Chief Professional Officers&rsquo; advice to NHS boards on the seasonal flu vaccination has recommended that local occupational health services offer the seasonal flu vaccination to staff since 2002. It is likely that some boards will have offered the vaccination to staff locally prior to this.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally, however a study carried out by the Scottish Executive in 2002 suggested that the level of vaccination uptake amongst health workers was around 20%.</p>

  <p>We engage regularly with organisations concerned with volunteering, in the course of which funding is a normal topic. Most volunteering is a local activity and the focus on community planning partnerships we have agreed with local authorities offers opportunities for investment in volunteering at the local level.</p>
