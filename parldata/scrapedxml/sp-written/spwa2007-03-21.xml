  <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service is subject to regular inspection of its functions and performance, as are all other health boards across Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service produces a Local Delivery Plan each year which is agreed with the Health Department and sets out the performance targets for the year. Progress against this plan is monitored by the Health Department and is discussed by the Ambulance Service Board at its meetings throughout the year.</p>

  <p>In addition, I chair an annual review meeting with the ambulance service&rsquo;s chairman and members of the management team. This meeting is held in public and is about supporting the ambulance service in delivering the functions and responsibilities delegated to it using a process which enables the Health Department and Scottish ministers to determine how effectively these are being discharged.</p>

  <p>The ambulance service is also subject to regular inspection by the Health and Safety Executive and review by NHS Quality Improvement Scotland.</p>

  <p>The survey referred to is an NHS Staff Opinion Survey in which all staff in NHSScotland are invited to participate and which was undertaken in 2006. It covers a wide range of issues such as communication, personal development, involvement in decisions and fairness and consistency of treatment. NHS boards are then explicitly required to incorporate feedback from the survey into their local Staff Governance action plan, which is developed in partnership with local representatives from trade unions and professional organisations and helps to prioritise those issues that are most important to staff at a local level.</p>

  <p>Staff governance, including action plans covering the findings from local staff surveys, form a key part of the discussions I hold with board chairs and chief executives during the public annual review meetings.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service monitors each of the stages between a call coming into the 999 emergency service through to turnaround time at hospital including allocation time, time to scene, time at scene and time to hospital, and reviews the performance regularly to identify any areas for improvement.</p>

  <p>This information, along with the performance against the key indicators covered in the ambulance service&rsquo;s Local Delivery Plan (LDP), is submitted regularly to the health department. The key performance indicators are reviewed annually as part of the review of the ambulance service&rsquo;s LDP.</p>

  <p>The current performance indicators for responding to 999 emergency calls were originally identified when the ambulance service was putting forward its proposals for introducing priority based dispatch in 2001-02. The ambulance service engaged with stakeholders, including staff, over a two year period and there were staff representatives (paramedics and technicians) on the project team. This process of engagement has continued each year as the ambulance service has developed its key performance management document which is, since 2006, the Local Delivery Plan.</p>

  <p>The Accountant in Bankruptcy maintains the Register of Insolvencies in Scotland. Details of corporate insolvencies are compiled by financial year. The following table gives the number of compulsory liquidations and receiverships for the financial years 1999-2000 to 2005-06. Figures for previous years are incomplete because administrators and receivers were not required to send forms to the Accountant in Bankruptcy until July 1999. These figures refer to limited companies only as partnerships and other unincorporated business associations, which are declared bankrupt in Scotland, are registered as personal bankruptcies under Scottish law. Figures on these are not available separately from other personal bankruptcies.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2007-03-21.S2W-32226.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80053" speakername="Cathy Jamieson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-07/wa0321.htm#6">

  <p>Data on numbers of arrests and charges is not held centrally, nor is there a specific crime code for &quot;incitement to racial hatred&quot;. Such crimes will be included within crimes arising from race relations legislation, which includes offences arising from the Race Relations Act of 1976, and those parts of the Public Order Act 1986 which refers to acts likely to stir up racial hatred and the possession of inflammatory material. The available information is shown in the following tables.</p>

  <p>The statistics dealing with recorded crime and court proceedings are not directly comparable as a person may be proceeded against for more than one crime involving more than one victim and there is the possibility that the crime recorded by the police may be altered in the course of judicial proceedings. A crime may be recorded by the police in one year and court proceedings concluded in a subsequent year. Crimes committed by children aged under 16 are also generally dealt with through the children&rsquo;s hearings system rather than the courts.</p>

  <p>It is important to be aware of the differences between the output generated from these different sets of data. Firstly, not all recorded crimes will have been detected by the police, and there can be occasions where the Procurator Fiscal decided not to proceed with a case. When reports are made to the Procurator Fiscal, there might be several charges under race relations legislation against the same individual, which would become a single case. There could also be cases where a person is facing several different charges, which are grouped together, but the offence under race relations legislation is not the main offence. Finally, the statistics on charges proved are only available at the end of the case &ndash; it can take up to two years to go through the court systems.</p>

  <p>The Executive recognises technical issues such as cable quality can affect the download speeds of existing broadband connections and indeed broadband availability itself.</p>

  <p>We have helped to deliver broadband to every community and to over 99% of Scottish households. Furthermore, at the end of last year, I announced &pound;5 million of funding to further extend broadband coverage where it is currently unavailable. Detailed plans are being developed, with deployment of solutions anticipated over 2007-08.</p>

  <p>I recently wrote to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry setting out Scottish ministers&rsquo; views on the European Commission&rsquo;s proposal to establish a European Institute of Technology (EIT). I said in my letter that I support the UK&rsquo;s negotiating strategy which reflects the issues that have been raised by the Scottish higher education sector and other stakeholders which are:</p>

  <p>EIT should add value to competitiveness and innovation and not duplicate or cut across existing instruments such as the Seventh Framework Programme.</p>

  <p>Funding of EIT needs to be clarified.</p>

  <p>EIT should not have independent degree-awarding powers and this should remain the preserve of individual institutions.</p>

  <p>The engagement of business is critical to the success and reputation of the EIT and we need to ensure that businesses in Scotland are involved in the development of the EIT and its proposed Knowledge and Innovation Communities.</p>

  <p>Since the Commission&rsquo;s Communication was first published, I have written to Alyn Smith, MEP indicating my broad support for the concept of EIT and that further work is needed before the proposal can be fully supported.</p>

  <p>It would be premature to discuss the location for the board of the EIT at such an early stage in the negotiations. However, we will continue to closely monitor this and we will work with the sector and other stakeholders to ensure that Scotland is able to take best advantage of the opportunities that EIT may offer.</p>

  <p>There is a formal appeal and complaints procedure that is available to all applicants which is publicised through the MMC Scotland website. This process can be invoked where recruitment processes or procedures have not been followed, or there is evidence of unfairness in how the process has been implemented and the objectivity of decisions is called into question. Where these reasons are cited, applicants can request a review by the Medical Training Application System (MTAS) administrators or the appropriate postgraduate dean.</p>

  <p>Competition for speciality training positions in medicine continues to be highly competitive. The modernising medical careers recruitment and selection process is open, fair, transparent and competency based, which will ensure that the best candidates are selected for posts. Scotland will have at least the same number of training posts available under the new system as was available under the old regime. Whilst we expect to fill all our Scottish vacancies with the best available candidates, it is impossible to predict how many of those currently working in Scotland will be successful in securing posts in Scotland.</p>

  <p>More than two thirds of those who responded to the consultation on Scotland&rsquo;s first coastal and marine national park support the idea in principle. However, the consultation also revealed significant detailed concerns which we need to address before decisions are taken.</p>

  <p>The concerns reflected issues raised by business interests in particular, including fisheries, aquaculture and tourism businesses. I have therefore written to the enterprise networks inviting them to review these concerns and to discuss further with relevant interests. Furthermore, I would welcome suggestions from the enterprise networks on measures and options for addressing the concerns raised, going with the grain of the overall policy initiative. I have asked for initial results of this review by the end of June.</p>

  <p>In parallel, my officials will continue to work with the range of public sector bodies concerned to develop further the proposals for a coastal and marine national park.</p>

  <p>A draft European Postal Services Directive proposal was issued by the EU Commission in October 2006. It is currently under consideration by the European Council Working Group on postal services, which has asked the Commission, inter alia, to consider the implications on employment of full market opening. The postal services market in the UK was opened to full competition on 1 January 2006.</p>

  <p>The postal sector, its regulation and the European Directives governing it, are reserved issues. The Executive has not made an assessment of the employment consequences of the Directive.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive published its draft Energy Efficiency and Microgeneration Strategy for Scotland for public consultation on 12 March 2007. This sets out the Executive&rsquo;s aims for encouraging a greater uptake of microgeneration. In addition the Executive recently consulted on Scottish Planning Policy 6 on Renewable Energy, including proposals for requiring minimum standards for on-site generation from microgeneration technologies in new developments. The Executive also plans to consult later in the year on detailed changes to planning controls to make the uptake of these technologies easier.</p>
