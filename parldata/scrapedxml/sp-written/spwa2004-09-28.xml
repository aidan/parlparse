  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>*The figures do not include any orders granted in August but not yet notified to the OPG.</p>

  <p>**The discrepancy of one between total orders granted and those ascribed to individual local authority areas may be attributable to the location of an adult&rsquo;s property being outwith Scotland.</p>

  <p>The planned reduction in the number of direct support schemes and the introduction of the Single Farm Payment Scheme will reduce the number of people employed on the administration of Pillar 1 Common Agricultural Policy Schemes, although this will be off-set by any new schemes required in the administration of modulated funds. In the short-term, staffing has increased because of the need to develop the new scheme while still running the old schemes.</p>

  <p>Whilst local action is a matter for NHS Argyll and Clyde, the Executive is committed to modernising and improving audiology services across NHSScotland. We are investing almost &pound;20 million over the five-year period 2002-03 to 2006-07 to ensure NHS boards are equipped with the necessary facilities, equipment, staff and hearing aids to provide a modernised service.</p>

  <p>Each NHS board has its own action plan for modernisation and has therefore reached different stages in the modernisation process.</p>

  <p>I announced the classification of this site at an event attended by local stakeholders to launch an associated SNH moorland management scheme to provide financial incentives for local land managers for habitat improvement. I announced the classification of two other SPAs for hen harrier (Arran Moors and Galloway Moors) at the same event, along with related moorland management schemes which in total amount to a commitment of &pound;2.34 million to protect and enhance the features of interest of these three sites in south west Scotland.

  <p>Real Gross Domestic Product is not available for Scotland. However, an approximation can be calculated by applying Scotland&rsquo;s ratio of UK gross value added (GVA) per head at current prices to the figures published by WHO. This gives the following, which assumes that Scottish prices have behaved in the same way as in the UK overall.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is currently considering its response to the No 10 Strategy Unit report <em>Net Benefits:</em> <em>A sustainable and profitable future for UK fishing</em> . The introduction of individual transferable quota (ITQ) is one of the recommendations within the report. No decision on the implementation of ITQ has been made. The Scottish Executive working closely with a range of key stakeholders, will carefully consider a range of economic and other data before reaching a view.</p>

  <p>These varieties have been bred for southern European conditions and have been modified to carry resistance to the European corn-borer; a problem pest in southern Europe, but not in Scotland. They do not, therefore, represent a viable alternative to the varieties already available to Scottish growers. With regard to co-existence, the Executive has made a commitment to introduce statutory measures to enable producers to meet public demand for non-GM produce. The Executive is aiming to introduce these measures in advance of any commercial planting of GM crops in Scotland and intends to launch a formal consultation later this year.</p>

  <p>The SKIPPER package was originally developed by ISD Scotland, in the mid 1990s, as a means of supporting NHSScotland in planning and performance management. It is based on old pre-web technology and is expensive to maintain, distribute and support. Difficulties have increased with the introduction and use of more modern operating systems (e.g. Windows 2000) where the successful installation of SKIPPER requires much more effort.</p>

  <p>Finally, the knowledge that the system needed substantial development to reflect changes in information requirements and organisational changes in NHSScotland led ISD Scotland to conclude that it was not viable to continue to support SKIPPER.</p>

  <p>The final release of SKIPPER was at end of May 2004. Before reaching a final decision ISD Scotland reviewed to what extent there were alternative sources to the SKIPPER screens. In some cases SKIPPER duplicated information published on the ISD Scotland website. Indeed, ISD Scotland found that the majority of SKIPPER screens had an alternative source, although not necessarily with the same level of detail. ISD is committed to continual improvement of the contents of its website and is confident that, in time, much of the useful information, previously on SKIPPER, can be made available through the web.</p>

  <p>The Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 introduced the Scottish Secure Tenancy (SST) for tenants of local authorities and registered social landlords, including housing associations registered with Communities Scotland.

Prior to increasing rents landlords must first consult with those tenants who would be affected. Landlords are required to have regard to the views expressed by those consulted.</p>

  <p>The numbers of applicant households on waiting lists for each local authority are published on an annual basis for 2000-01 onwards in the quarterly Scottish Executive Statistical Bulletin (Housing Series) <em> Housing Trends in Scotland.</em> Table 16 in the latest bulletin HSG/2004/4 published August 2004 shows the snapshot position as at 31 March 2004 as well as changes to the lists during 2003-04. This publication can be accessed on-line through publications section of the Scottish Executive housing statistics branch website ( <a href="www.scotland.gov.uk/stats/housing/hsbref" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/stats/housing/hsbref</a> ).

  <p>This data collection began in 2001 and data are not centrally available prior to that date. The numbers reported to the Scottish Executive are for applicant households and do not specify the number of people within each household.</p>

  <p>1. These figures do not include GP Registrars.</p>

  <p>2. Figures are board predictions for the number of doctors in training expected to be WTR compliant at 1 August 2004.</p>

  <p>3. An unknown rota occurs where the return has provided insufficient information to distinguish which of the above specialities apply.</p>

  <p>4. Compliance with the European Working Time Regulations includes working no longer than 58 hours per week, taking a minimum 11 hours rest in a 24 hour period, and receiving four weeks' paid annual leave.</p>

  <p>We are currently considering the responses to the consultation on the Land Management Contract (LMC) Menu Scheme, paying particular regard to the range of measures suitable for inclusion in the scheme. Funding issues are being considered as part of this process. We aim to introduce the scheme in 2005, subject to approval from the European Commission. Work is also on-going to look at development of the LMC approach in 2006 and beyond.</p>

  <p>The Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 which comes into effect in April 2005 includes a right for anyone with a mental disorder to access independent advocacy services. This right will apply whether the person is a patient in a psychiatric hospital or receiving care or treatment for mental disorder in their local community settings.</p>

  <p>Funding from the Scottish Executive is provided to cover all aspects of the new mental health act&rsquo;s implementation. Each local authority then allocates funding according to its priorities. The allocation to each local authority from the Scottish Executive to fund implementation of the new act for the years 2003-04 to 2005-06 is as follows:</p>

  <p>NHS boards are still agreeing 2004-05 uplifts in respect of service level agreements (SLA&rsquo;s) with neighbouring NHS boards. Until these are agreed, NHS boards will not be in a position to identify shortfalls in budgets due to lack of payment to them by neighbouring boards.</p>

  <p>The Executive is aware that a number of boards have made assumptions within their budget plans regarding cross boundary flows and that these will need to be resolved further to the agreement of SLA&rsquo;s.</p>

  <p>The Executive issues an overall allocation to NHS boards which aims to give each board its fair share of the resources available nationally. Allocations are not made in relation to specific local or national cost pressures. Instead NHS boards are expected to manage within the overall allocations available supplemented by any other sources of funding.</p>

  <p>Given this position, it is not possible to identify specific national or local cost pressures which are not covered by allocations from the Executive. However, as stated in the answer to question S2W-9983 the basic uplift provided to NHS boards in 2003-04 and 2004-05 is expected to cover all national cost pressures.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The code of practice offers guidance to Scottish public authorities on the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002. The act does not require publication in every case. The SPS will decide on the extent of publication of any future the SPS contract for private prisons on the merits of each case. Given the Executive&rsquo;s commitment to openness, such contracts entered into by the SPS will as in the past, normally be published by the SPS subject to appropriate protection of material exempt under the act to safeguard, for example, commercial interests or security and good order in prisons.</p>

  <p>The issue was not one of excluding MSP&rsquo;s staff from live testing. On the contrary, this was but one of a number of commissioning and testing exercises carried out by parliament staff during the migration period.</p>

  <p>A ballot will not be held for MSPs&rsquo; staff to participate in the Parliament&rsquo;s opening day as guests. However, a large number of MSPs&rsquo; staff are very much involved in the opening as both they and SPCB staff are presently working together in teams to make the Opening Ceremony a success.</p>

  <p>As part of the landscaping works for the building, permanent signage will be installed shortly at the public entrance to the Parliament, to replace the temporary signage, as well as at Queensberry House and the passholders entrance to the Parliament on the Canongate. Permanent directional signage will also be installed at the public entrance, and at prominent locations around the exterior of the building.</p>
