  <p>Acute illnesses, chronic or severe, can cause malnutrition. Information collected by the Information and Statistics Division of the Common Services Agency through the Scottish Morbidity Record, the Continuous Morbidity Record and child health surveillance identifies a condition, although not the cause of a condition.</p>

  <p>The following table shows the number of discharges over the four years to December 2001 for conditions where malnutrition is either specifically mentioned or where it is highly likely, excluding codes where the deficiency is more likely to be secondary to another condition.</p>

  <p>Health care associated infection is a more precise term than hospital-acquired infection. It recognises that many infections occur in health care settings other than hospitals. It also recognises that whilst many infections are acquired in hospital this is not always the case.</p>

  <p>The joint Health Department and NHS Scotland Working Group report <i>on Managing the Risk of HAI</i> (2001) used &quot;health care associated infection&quot; to reflect this assessment. The department along with the other UK Health Departments and public health agencies has also used this terminology because it reflects more accurately the scope of issues being addressed. The UK-wide use of the term facilitates the comparison of statistics related to these types of infection.</p>

  <p>Adverse reactions known to be associated with combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccines and contraindications for MMR are listed in the product information for the MMR products. These are also described in the report of the MMR Expert Group as well as in <i> Immunisation Against Infectious Disease</i> , published by the health departments, and are detailed in materials for parents, such as <i>The MMR discussion pack</i> . In many cases, as with most medicines and vaccines, the risk factors for the development of adverse reactions to MMR vaccine are not known.</p>

  <p>The safety of MMR vaccines is kept under continuous review by the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) and the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM). Any new research that may emerge in relation to possible immunopathological risk factors for adverse reactions to MMR vaccines would be carefully reviewed by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, MCA, and CSM.</p>

  <p>The MMR Expert Group recently recommended that the Scottish Executive and the Medical Research Council (MRC) should work together to drive forward and fund, as appropriate, the full research agenda outlined in the final chapter of the MRC Review of Autism Research. My response to question S1W-25472 on 30 April 2002 made clear that the Executive accepts that recommendation and will also work with researchers in Scotland to develop proposals for innovative, high quality research to underpin improvements in treatment and care for people with autistic spectrum disorder.</p>

  <p>These statistics demonstrate that decisions made by the west area of Fife Council were upheld in 75% and 73% of cases respectively in the two years concerned, against a national average of around 70%.</p>

  <p>The planning application was received by the Scottish ministers on 2 May 2002 and is currently under consideration. The target for deciding whether a case should be called in for determination by the Scottish ministers is that 80% should be decided within 28 days and the remainder within two months.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Prison Service offers addiction services to prisoners with the exception of sex offenders whose broader needs are dealt with in other ways. An assessment is completed for each prisoner. Clients can be referred at admission or at any time during their sentence. The covers health, finance, housing, education and employment. Following client assessment a multi-disciplinary case conference/care planning process evolves involving the client. Addiction teams are multi-disciplinary. The care plan is reviewed and monitored as the client progresses through their sentence. Prior to release transitional care for those serving less than four years becomes a priority. Transitional care action planning and case conferencing commences to establish an individual plan prior to the clients release back in to the community. Figures for March and April 2002 show that 1,524 prisoners have been offered an individual assessment with 1,224 prisoners taking up the service.</p>

  <p>The latest projections of the prison population, which were prepared in April 2002, are given in the following table. The projections are almost identical to those prepared in September 2001 and published in Appendix F of the <i>Scottish Prison Service Estates Review</i> (March 2002). These latest projections were published in an Scottish Prison Service News Release on 1 May 2002.</p>

  <p>The underlying trend for the majority of categories of sentenced receptions follows that displayed for the past 10 to 18 years. The average daily prison population continues to rise and has recently reached an all-time high on 30 April of 6,610. The trend analysis suggests an increase in some short-term prisoner population categories and an upturn in the remand population. There has also been a marginal increase in the long-term prisoner population. These trends have been extrapolated into the projections provided.</p>

  <p>The current projections do not include the impact of Scottish Executive policy as it is difficult to factor in the possible results of extending non-custodial alternatives. Whilst these are expected to reduce the numbers given custodial sentences, they will mainly provide alternatives to short-term prison sentences and therefore have a much greater impact upon reception numbers than on the average daily prison population.</p>

  <p>Prison Population Projections Prepared in April 2002 and September 2001</p>

  <p>We have today published the revised <i>Information Age Government Framework</i> . The framework covers a number of areas including technical and data standards, access, authentication, data protection and data sharing, electronic record management and skills. It contains details of an approach including a set of common standards which we expect to see adopted for information and communications technology applications in the public sector in Scotland. Common standards are vital if we are to achieve interoperability and ensure that new technologies are harnessed to maximum effect to deliver more convenient, joined-up, responsive and efficient public services in Scotland.</p>

  <p>We also intend to establish a standards supervisory group to ensure new standards are brought into the framework and that changes and additions to the framework are suitably publicised.</p>

  <p>Copies of the framework have been placed in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre, and it is also available on the 21st Century Government website.</p>

  <p>Wind farms of over 50 mega watts capacity require consent from the Scottish ministers under section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989. In granting consent under this procedure planning permission is deemed to be granted. Wind farms of smaller capacity require planning permission from the relevant planning authority under the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997.</p>

  <p>The electricity consent procedures and the planning permission procedures have associated formal environmental impact assessment (EIA) requirements contained in the Electricity Works (Assessment of Environmental Effects) (Scotland) Regulations 2000 and the Environmental Impact Assessment (Scotland) Regulations 1999 respectively.</p>

  <p>The information required to be included in the environmental statement associated with an EIA will depend on the particular circumstances of each case. Prior to seeking consent or planning permission, a developer may approach the competent authority (either the Scottish ministers or the planning authority) to seek an opinion on the scope of the environmental statement.</p>

  <p>Where an application for planning permission is involved, aside from the formal EIA procedures, planning authorities also have powers to require the submission of further information necessary to determine the application. This can include information on, for example, environmental issues, flood risk or traffic impact.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive and the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body are separate and distinct bodies. There is therefore no requirement for them to have similar pay ranges for their staff.

In these cases, ownership of land can enhance SNH&#146;s ability to manage and protect important areas of high natural heritage value, taking into account, as required by section 3(1)(f) of the 1991 act, the interests of local communities.</p>

  <p>YouthLink Scotland will be undertaking a mapping exercise in the coming year to establish what youth work provision exists for all young people across Scotland. The Executive and others will be able to use this information to inform future policy on youth work.</p>

  <p>In October 2001, I launched the Executive's consultation document, a <i>National Framework for the Prevention of Suicide and Deliberate Self-Harm in Scotland</i> . The framework aims to guide action to address suicide and deliberate self-harm. We received over 140 responses to the consultation document, including a number from lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender organisations. The responses to the consultation are currently being analysed and will inform the development of the final version of the framework, which I hope to launch later this year.</p>
