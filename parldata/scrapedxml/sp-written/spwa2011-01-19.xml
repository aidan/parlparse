<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2011-01-19.S3W-38684.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80396" speakername="Nicola Sturgeon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-11/wa0119.htm#1">

  <p>The operation of the patient transport service (PTS) is the responsibility of the Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS), the Scottish Government does not issue specific guidance to the service. However, Scottish Government ministers and officials are in regular dialogue with the service about a range of issues, including the operation of the PTS.</p>

  <p>The operation of the Patient Transport Service forms part of the agenda for the public annual review held each year, and the areas of discussion and actions arising are set out in the follow up letter to the board chair. The 2010 letter and letters for previous years are also available at <a href="http://www.scottishambulance.com/AboutUs/Howweareperforming/AnnualReview.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.scottishambulance.com/AboutUs/Howweareperforming/AnnualReview.aspx</a>.</p>

  <p>As part of the Local Delivery Plan (LDP) process the SAS agrees its annual performance targets with the Scottish Government. The SAS LDP for 2010-11 (Health Plan) and LDPs for previous years can be found at <a href="http://www.scottishambulance.com/AboutUs/Default.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.scottishambulance.com/AboutUs/Default.aspx</a>. This includes targets for the PTS, performance against these is regularly reported to the SAS Board and the Scottish Government. SAS Board papers are available on their website.</p>

  <p>The PTS provides a vital service for those patients with a medical need for transport. Both the Scottish Government and the Scottish Ambulance Service appreciate the importance of each and every journey and that is why we are committed to securing continuous improvement. We have both been frank in the past about the need for focus on improving the Patient Transport Service and have acknowledged that the service does not always meet the expectations of patients. That is why the Scottish Ambulance Service Strategic Framework <em>Working together for better patient care 2010 &ndash; 2015</em> sets out the service vision for the scheduled care service (PTS), this vision is underpinned by a series of actions being progressed by Scheduled Service Programme Board. Information about the strategic framework can be found at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scottishambulance.com/AboutUs/Strategicframework.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.scottishambulance.com/AboutUs/Strategicframework.aspx</a>.</p>

  <p>The service has now completed a Scheduled Care Accelerated Demonstrator Project (ADP) agreed as part of the SAS Learn and Improve project. The findings indicate that the programme appears to have significant potential to deliver substantial quality improvement and efficiency benefits through supporting service teams to improve the quality of service delivery and thus directly or indirectly benefiting patient care. The project has identified 11 improvement opportunities with the potential to:</p>

  <p>Significantly improve the PTS profile as a clinically focussed service by the consistent application of clinical criteria as a pre-requisite for accessing transport.</p>

  <p>Significantly improve and increase the service&rsquo;s ability to signpost patients to alternative transport providers where ambulance transport is not required.</p>

  <p>Significantly reduce inappropriate demand on the service by standardising systems and processes.</p>

  <p>Significantly improve productivity and the utilisation of existing resources by consistently applying good practice, improving communications and making best use of available technology.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not hold the amount allocated broken down by each local authority except for the funding given to Youthlink Scotland, which is broken down in this way for each year. The following table sets out the amounts administered by Youthlink Scotland since 2007 within each local authority. However, as from 1 April 2011 we will be collecting this information from all CashBack partners, which will allow allocations to be shown by each local authority.</p>

  <p>To date the Scottish Government has committed to invest &pound;24 million in the CashBack for Communities programme which includes diversionary and participatory projects for young people across Scotland, and in a wide range of projects.</p>

  <p>So far over 300,000 young people participate in CashBack for Communities activities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is supportive of students accessing education through all routes. Students leaving one institution before enrolling at another to commence further studies are not deemed to be students during that period. Consequently, they may be liable to council tax. However, where they are liable, they may be eligible for council tax benefit of up to 100% to help pay their council tax bill.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government views the retention of the RAF bases at Lossiemouth, Kinloss and Leuchars as an issue of national importance. We have been pressing the Ministry of Defence (MoD) for clarity on the future direction of the Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR), in order to ensure that robust representations are both developed and made to the UK Government in advance of any detailed decisions being taken in respect of any of the RAF bases in Scotland.</p>

  <p>On 27 October 2010, the First Minister requested an urgent meeting with the Secretary of State for Defence to discuss the SDSR implications for Scotland. The First Minister met with the Secretary of State for Defence on 11 January 2011 where he pressed the Secretary of State for clarity on the timing and scope of the base review; for engagement with potentially affected communities to ensure that socio economic impacts of any changes can be properly assessed and submitted to the MoD prior to any decision; and for the UK Government to recognise its role in supporting communities that may be affected by the bases review.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally. Annual figures for electricity demand and generation by renewables in Scotland are published on the Scottish Government website at:</p>

  <p>In 2009, the most recent year for which statistics are held, wind and wave power generated the equivalent of 11.6% of Scotland&rsquo;s gross electricity consumption. This represents an increase of 3.5 percentage points from 2008, where wind and wave power alone was equivalent to 8.15% of Scotland&rsquo;s gross electricity consumption.</p>

  <p>Although it operates UK-wide the National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death reports do not normally cover Scotland as such work is undertaken by the Scottish Audit of Surgical Mortality. This report covers England, Wales and Northern Ireland. However, we will consider any relevant learning for NHSScotland.</p>

  <p>The provision of acute pain services by the NHS in Scotland has been the subject of reviews by NHS Quality Improvement Scotland, against the clinical standards for anaesthesia. The most recent of these was published in September 2010 and found that the delivery of acute pain services had improved from the previous review in 2005, albeit with scope for further improvement.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are expected to have due regard to these findings in order to improve the quality of the service they provide. This reflects the ambitions in the Healthcare Quality Strategy for NHSScotland of safe, effective and person-centred care for every patient.</p>

  <p>There have been no changes in Scottish Illegal Money Lending Unit access to police intelligence since 2007. An Information Sharing Protocol between Association of Chief Police Officers Scotland and the Society of Chief Trading Standards Officers in Scotland (which would cover the Illegal Money Lending Unit) has been established and will greatly facilitate the future exchange of information between the unit and the police.</p>

  <p><strong>Frank Mulholland: </strong>The following table shows the number of charges under the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995, Section 52(1) which were reported to Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) in the last three financial years, and which were dealt with by &quot;direct measures.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Direct measures&quot; includes all decisions other than instructions for court proceedings or no action, i.e. fiscal fines, compensation offers, combined fiscal fine and compensation offers, diversions, work orders, warnings and referrals to the Scottish Children&rsquo;s Reporter Administration. It is notable that a significant proportion of the charges of this type received by COPFS and dealt with by direct measures were referred to the Scottish Children&rsquo;s Reporter Administration (1,848 in 2007-08, 1,284 in 2008-09, and 861 in 2009-10).</p>

  <p>The information is presented below using court jurisdictions as the COPFS database does not contain information to identify parliamentary constituency boundaries and court jurisdictions do not match parliamentary boundaries.</p>

  <p>The database is charge-based. The figures quoted therefore relate to the number of charges rather than the number of individuals charged or the number of incidents that gave rise to such charges.</p>

  <p>The Public Records (Scotland) Bill provides a general framework for the management of records by named public authorities in Scotland which should apply to all types of records created and held by those authorities and contractors which provide functions on their behalf. It does not deal with specific types of records and therefore it is not appropriate to amend it to impose a specific requirement on local authorities to compile and maintain a comprehensive record of common good assets.</p>

  <p>The bill imposes a duty on named public authorities to produce and implement a records management plan. An important element of a plan will be a retention and disposal schedule which sets out minimum retention periods and disposal actions for specific types of records created and held by an authority.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Coronary Revascularisation Register (SCRR) has monitored Scottish coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) outcomes since 1996. Its data are thought to be more accurate than those of the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery, on which the Question is based. According to the SCRR, CABG inpatient mortality in Scotland between 2006 and 2008 was 1.6%.</p>

  <p>When making comparisons between countries it is important to bear in mind factors such as the variation between definitions used in monitoring performance, patient profiling and patient selection. Severity of disease, co-morbidities and age are also important factors in patient selection and can affect clinical outcomes.</p>

  <p>When comparing SCRR reports over time and between countries, Scotland has demonstrated ongoing improvement and clinical outcomes very much in line with the rest of the UK and Europe.</p>

  <p>Under the terms of this multi-supplier ranked framework, NHS boards should give consideration of using the first ranked supplier. However, if this pump does not meet the clinical requirements of the patient, then the suppliers ranked second then third can be considered. Decisions relating to the clinical requirements of patients are made at a local NHS board level.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not hold detailed information on bus service operations centrally including those between Coatbridge and Glasgow. We expect bus services to run to their registered timetables, albeit that we are well aware of the severe weather experienced during part of this period. Specific concerns about services should be referred to the Traffic Commissioner at The Stamp Office, 10 Waterloo Place, Edinburgh, EH1 3EG.</p>

  <p>We do not hold a full breakdown of funding for Scots language education since 1990.</p>

  <p>Today, the value of Scots is recognised within the Curriculum for Excellence guidance, which indicates teachers should promote and encourage the use of Scots in developing young people&rsquo;s literacy skills. In order to support practitioners with this, our ongoing programme funding for Learning and Teaching Scotland (LTS) across a number of curriculum areas has enabled the production of Scots resources, including the Scotland&rsquo;s Songs and Stories website and the online Scots Knowledge of Language Module.</p>

  <p>Other recent funding which supports Scots language education includes the provision of &pound;8.6 million to the National Trust for Scotland to develop the Robert Burns Birthplace Museum, due to open in January 2011, which will be the first development in the country to use the Scots language to explain its collection. Also, the Scots Language Centre and Scottish Language Dictionaries, have been in receipt of funding since 2009-10, with &pound;70,000 provided in 2009-10 and 2010-11 for to the Scots Language Centre and &pound;200,000 in 2009-10 and 2010-11 for the Scottish Language Dictionaries.</p>

  <p>Species reintroduction programmes in Scotland are carried out in accordance with best scientific practice and principles as set out in international guidelines, to limit the risk of unforeseen environmental damage and to address the concerns of a wide range of stakeholders. The Scottish Government supports efforts to re-establish beavers in Scotland through a properly constituted reintroduction project involving local consultation and with proper management and monitoring arrangements in place. In the case of the feral beaver populations, these conditions have not been met, and therefore risk undermining the longer term re-introduction project.</p>

  <p>Beavers are a former native species which is no longer ordinarily resident in Scotland. I refer the member to the answer to question <strong>S3W-38451</strong> on 19 January 2011 for the justification of the recapture project. No assessment of the potential impact of these animals has been made.
