  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answers to questions S1W-15634 and S1W-16259 by Sarah Boyack on 18 June 2001 and 2 July 2001 respectively, whether it will issue a comprehensive summary of all reports, studies and procedures, broken down by Executive Department, where it considers that it is not appropriate to divulge to the public matters which are pertinent to the public interest.</p>

  <p>It would not be practical for the Scottish Executive to publish a summary of information whose disclosure would not be in the public interest. If the summary was to be retrospective this would involve an enormous exercise researching past documents which had not been placed in the public domain and considering whether the public interest in disclosure was outweighed by any of the exemptions in Part 2 of the <i> Code of Practice on Access to Scottish Executive Information</i> .</p>

  <p>In line with its policy on the disclosure of information, as set out in Part 1 of the Code, the Scottish Executive publishes, or releases on request, information whose disclosure is in the public interest.</p>

  <p>The Animal By-Products Order 1999 prescribes the following options for disposal of fallen cattle; incineration, rendering, knackery yard or hunt kennel or in limited circumstances burning or burial. Since July 1 there has been an EU requirement on all member states to carry out tests for BSE on all fallen cattle over 30 months old. All bovine carcases that form part of the fallen stock survey are disposed of by incineration. The table shows the names and addresses of the businesses in Scotland awarded contracts by the Rural Payments Agency (RPA). The RPA is responsible for procuring disposal facilities throughout Great Britain.</p>

  <p>The annual number of carcases each site is expected to deal with will be governed to a maximum of each individual site&#8217;s authorisation as stipulated by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. This figure has been provided based upon an average weight of 520kgs per beast and the RPA ensure that no more than 90% of this figure is incinerated under their contracts.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to provide an accurate figure in respect of the number of fallen stock carcases that each site is expected to deal with annually.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no specific budget provision for the promotion of international air links.

  <p>Since the First Minister&#8217;s announced that a Review of Scotland&#8217;s Cities would be undertaken, the Executive has carried out preparatory work for the first phase of the work programme. The second phase of external discussion and consultation is now under way. A Sounding Board and Academic Panel have been established to inform and test the review&#8217;s emerging thinking.</p>

  <p>Additional members are likely to be invited to join both groups, to cover further specific issues, as the review develops.</p>

  <p>I intend to meet with council leaders collectively at internals during the process and each city will have the opportunity to make its case on the particular mix of problems and opportunities it faces.</p>

  <p>The review is planned to conclude in early 2002. It will be firmly set within the changing urban pattern of Scotland and will involve a fundamental review of the key long-term challenges and opportunities affecting Scotland&#8217;s cities, with tangible and deliverable measures for progressing the emerging agenda.</p>

  <p>The Executive, across all its responsibilities, is subject to independent investigation by the Scottish Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration (SPCA) in the event of any claims made by the public of injustice resulting from maladministration.</p>

  <p>The Executive is currently consulting on new proposals for modern public sector Ombudsman arrangements in Scotland, with a view to introduction of a Scottish Public Sector Ombudsman Bill to the Parliament. The key policy contained in the Bill will be the creation of a one-stop shop which will combine the existing functions of the SPCA, the Health Service Commissioner for Scotland, the Commissioner for Local Administration in Scotland and the Housing Association Ombudsman for Scotland. It is proposed that the one-stop shop should also deal with complaints made against Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise, whose existing External Complaints Adjudicators will be wound up. The Bill will contain provisions which will continue and reinforce the independence of the Ombudsman function.</p>

  <p>Additionally, specific arrangements exist for dealing with complaints about administrative procedures in certain areas for which the Executive has responsibility. Details are set out in the table.</p>

<p>This procedure is established through The Prisons and Young 
                      Offenders Institutions (Scotland) Rules 1994 as amended. 
                      This enables prisoners to raise complaints formally on general 
                      matters; confidential matters direct to the Governor; medical 
                      complaints, and appeals against Orderly Room (disciplinary) 
                      decisions. The CP system enables complaints to be considered 
                      on a progressive basis from residential officer to Governor 
                      in Charge. Where a complaint has gone through the CP system 
                      and the prisoner remains dissatisfied with the answers provided 
                      he can raise the matter with the Scottish Prisons Complaints 
                      Commissioner. (SPCC).</p>
<p>The SPCC is independent of the SPS and was created by administrative 
                      arrangements. The Commissioner can investigate any complaint 
                      (except medical complaints), which have exhausted the internal 
                      CP system.</p>
<p>Prisoner&#8217;s complaints about<strong> </strong>medical<strong> </strong>matters<strong>

However, SEPA has identified risks of pollution from sewer sources at seven of these beaches as set out in its publication <i>Scottish Bathing Waters 2000</i> (Bib. no. 15371).</p>

  <p>The water authorities have embarked on a significant programme of upgrading. Their investment scenarios are set out in the Executives Quality and Standards documents, which are referred to in the answer given to question S1W-17169. Upgrading work includes sewer remediation and improvements in sewage treatment. The water authorities will have to ensure that these improvements will allow bathing water to meet the higher guideline standard set by SEPA.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) has a general responsibility for protecting (and determining general levels of pollution in) the environment. SEPA does not monitor waste stored on site but undertakes a comprehensive environmental monitoring programme to determine the effects on the environment of radioactive discharges from nuclear installations. The results of the programme are reported annually in <i>Radioactivity in Food and the Environment</i> (RIFE).

  <p>The Scottish Executive keeps in touch with e-government progress in a number of countries across the globe, including the USA, Canada, EC countries, the Far East and Australasia, either directly through the staff of its 21 <sup>st</sup> Century Government Unit and its Digital Scotland Unit, or through access to the work of third parties such as Whitehall departments. This is achieved in a variety of ways including through checking internet sites, attending seminars, overseas visits, meetings with individuals and scanning the press.</p>

  <p>Most countries&#8217; strategies have broadly similar aims to the Executive and have identified similar problems and, as such, we actively seek to adopt good practice from their experiences.</p>

  <p>No. The English Heritage Survey was a sampling exercise which demonstrated that monuments are at risk for a variety of reasons. A different approach has been adopted in Scotland. Historic Scotland&#8217;s monument wardens are engaged in a programme under which every scheduled monument in Scotland (there are at present some 7,500) will be visited and its condition recorded in a structured way. Following the conclusion of this programme in 2004, we will have comprehensive and up-to-date information on all monuments scheduled as being of national importance and be in a position to reach informed conclusions about the overall state of ancient monuments in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Over 300 historic sites and buildings are in the care of Historic Scotland, an agency of the Scottish Executive. Of these, 76 are owned by Scottish ministers and four are on long leases. The remainder, including a few owned by the National Trust for Scotland, are in guardianship under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Acts. All are maintained by Historic Scotland. In most cases, visitor services are also provided by the agency, although in a very small number of cases other arrangements are in place.</p>

  <p>Historic Scotland is not actively seeking to add to the portfolio of properties for which it cares, but approaches are made to the agency from time to time to do so and other opportunities may arise. Such approaches and opportunities are given careful consideration but only sites of national importance or of very exceptional archaeological or architectural merit are taken into care by Historic Scotland on behalf of Scottish ministers.</p>

  <p>The National Trust for Scotland is a non-governmental organisation. It receives grant assistance from the Scottish Executive, through Historic Scotland, towards the cost of agreed programmes of work to maintain and repair the historic fabric of outstanding properties in its care. Historic Scotland can also pay acquisition grant to the National Trust for Scotland.</p>

  <p>Source: Scottish Household Survey 2000.</p>

  <p>The sample size used by just one Scottish Household Survey is not large enough to permit breakdown of the latest results by local authority, since any results would be based on small numbers and would therefore be unreliable. In order to provide results at a sub-Scotland level, the figures have been produced by combining data collected over the whole of 2000. They therefore present the average figure over this time period rather that the &quot;end of 2000&quot; results.</p>

  <p>The information requested on the number of forms issued by the Executive, agencies and non-departmental public bodies is not held centrally. However, the Executive is committed to reducing the burden placed on providers of information. The following are examples of some of the action being taken:</p>

  <p>a bureaucracy audit to reduce the administrative burdens on teachers, schools and authorities;</p>

  <p>development of proposals to allow the electronic submission of legal aid forms by solicitors to the Scottish Legal Aid Board;</p>

  <p>a number of initiatives aimed specifically at reducing bureaucracy for Scottish farmers and crofters.</p>

  <p>More generally, as part of the Modernising Government agenda, the Executive is committed to improving public services. One aspect of this is improving the ease with which information is provided; activity in this respect should have a very positive impact on the current number of forms issued by the Executive and public bodies.</p>

  <p><i>Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change</i> requires NHS boards to ensure that their staff are professionally and culturally equipped to meet the distinctive needs of people and family groups from ethnic minority communities. This commitment is underpinned by <i>Learning Together</i> , <i> </i> the Strategy for Education Training and Lifelong Learning which requires all NHS staff to have a personal development plan that should ensure that they are adequately trained in equality issues. The Equal Opportunities Policies Guideline which was published in January this year also made clear that training must include a high level of awareness of equal opportunities legislation and its application to selection and recruitment and employment within the Health Service.

  <p>The relevant data on the recovery and recycling of packaging waste are incomplete as some businesses have yet to submit data or are in the process of reviewing their previous estimates. It is therefore too early to say whether the United Kingdom has achieved its&#8217; packaging targets under the EC Packaging Directive. The position should be clearer towards the end of the year when a review of the data which is currently being undertaken is complete.</p>

  <p>Implementation of the directive is an ongoing process. The <i>National Waste Strategy: Scotland</i> identifies packaging waste as a priority waste stream. The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 transpose the directive into UK law and these are enforced in Scotland by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency.</p>

  <p>Additional staff costs of approximately &#163;1.8 million per annum will result from the recruitment of around 67 new staff to deal with additional responsibilities placed on SEPA by the Scottish Executive. These new responsibilities flow primarily from legislation. The majority of new staff will be recruited for front-line regulation duties.</p>

  <p>The approximate cost of in-house resources to redesign the logo was &#163;77.50, this being the cost of the graphic designer for one day. It should be noted that the changes were of a minor nature and no external expenditure was incurred.</p>

  <p>To implement Scotland&#8217;s National Waste Strategy eleven Area Waste Plans are being prepared; these will set out the Best Practicable Environmental Option for dealing with waste from each area. The plans are being prepared by groups consisting of local authorities, industry and local organisations, and are co-ordinated by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency.</p>

  <p>The plans have reached various stages of preparation. One draft plan (for the Forth Valley area) was published for public consultation recently. Interim discussion papers setting out options for waste management have been issued for public consultation for four other areas, with others planned between now and October.</p>

  <p>Consultation on the draft plans themselves is programmed in most cases by the end of 2001, with the remainder by the end of the financial year following which they will be finalised.</p>
