  <p>Yes. Both the Schools (Health Promotion and Nutrition) (Scotland) Act 2007 and the Nutritional Requirements for Food and Drink in Schools (Scotland) Regulations 2008 require that all pupils should have free, easy access to fresh drinking water at all times. The duty commenced in both primary and secondary schools on August 4, 2008. It is up to the local authority and schools to decide how this provision is met in the context of their school.</p>

  <p>The requirements under both the act and regulations are set out below:</p>

  <p>The Schools (Health Promotion and Nutrition) (Scotland) Act 2007 places the following duty on all education authorities and managers of grant aided schools:</p>

  <p>56B Regulations under section 56A: further provision</p>

  <p>(c) requiring that drinking water be made available for every pupil, free of charge, on the premises of &mdash;</p>

  <p>(i) a public school, or</p>

  <p>(ii) a hostel provided and maintained by an education authority for pupils.</p>

  <p>This is further supported by The Nutritional Requirements for Food and Drink in Schools (Scotland) Regulations 2008 which states that:</p>

  <p>Provision of drinking water</p>

  <p>5.&mdash;(1) Education authorities must ensure that drinking water is provided free of charge at all times, including during school meals, to pupils on the premises of&ndash;</p>

  <p>(a) public schools, and</p>

  <p>The First Minister raised a number of issues with the Prime Minister including: the agenda of respect in government to government relations and the application of current funding arrangements in relation to; the fossil fuel levy, capital acceleration, Olympic regeneration funding consequentials and the proposals for borrowing powers recommended in the Calman Commission Report.</p>

  <p>The current Point Prevalence Surveillance system operated by Health Protection Scotland (HPS) provides data on norovirus activity across NHS Scotland on a weekly basis. HPS advise it is not essential to have every case reported in order to provide an accurate picture of the impact and geographical spread of norovirus outbreaks in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Given the high incidence of norovirus over the winter period, the Scottish Government has asked HPS to undertake a qualitative evaluation of how NHS boards managed norovirus to identify optimal systems, review guidance implementation and determine if there are identifiable high risk alert points for which specific control measures should be instigated.</p>

  <p>The findings of this evaluation will be used to amend existing guidance ahead of the norovirus season this coming winter.</p>

  <p>Recruitment to vacant hospital pharmacist posts in Scotland is a matter for NHS boards. However, where any board is encountering difficulty in recruiting to a vacancy, it is open to them to apply for a local recruitment and retention premium which allows the salary on offer to be increased beyond the nationally agreed rate in an attempt to aid recruitment and/or retention. No such applications have been received to date for pharmacists.</p>

  <p>I am aware of results from the Pharmacy Establishment and Vacancy Survey which suggest there are recruitment and retention difficulties in areas of Scotland amongst the more junior hospital pharmacy grades. Officials are currently conducting a full analysis of any issues and the results will be considered in partnership. Findings will then be included in this years evidence to the NHS Pay Review Body together with proposals detailing what, if any, further action is required.</p>

  <p>The available information is given in the following table.</p>

  <p>Section 41(1)(a) of the Police (Scotland) Act 1967 provides that any person who assaults, resists, obstructs, molests or hinders a constable shall be guilty of an offence. Offences which specifically involve an assault on a police officer can not generally be identified separately from other section 41(1)(a) offences in the data held centrally.</p>

  <p>Following the introduction of the Emergency Workers (Scotland) Act in 2005, a new distinct crime classification of minor assault of an emergency worker was created. Section 1(1) includes offences by a person who assaults, obstructs or hinders a constable, member of the fire brigade or person acting for the Scottish Ambulance Service Board. These cannot be disaggregated into the type of emergency worker from the information held centrally, but have been included in the following table.</p>

  <p>Other assaults on police officers which may result in other charges such as serious assault or attempted homicide cannot be identified separately in the available statistics and so are not included.</p>

  <p>The 2007-2013 European Structural Fund Programmes are not yet at their half-way point but about two thirds of the total budget has been allocated to projects. The Operational Programmes for the European Structural Funds in Scotland originally presented, overall, a profile of roughly equal commitments in each of the seven years. Approximately 80,000 people have been assisted to date, through training and support towards employment provided by projects supported by the European Social Fund. The latest forecast, from project sponsors, for gross jobs to be eventually created by the projects that have been allocated awards from the European Regional Development Fund is approximately 20,000. This includes 2,200 jobs from the projects for which funding was announced in April 2010.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is aware of Project Prevention and does not support this organisation. This organisation offers cash incentives to individuals who are having problems with substance misuse to commit to long term, and potentially permanent birth control.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government and its partners are focussed on ensuring that appropriate advice, guidance and support on birth control and family planning services are part of drug treatment services, and are accessible to people with drug problems. Helping an individual to achieve sustained recovery and, if and when they are ready, supporting that individual to have a healthy pregnancy and to bring up their child in the future, is integral to national strategies such as <em>The Road to Recovery (Drugs)</em> and <em>Respect and Responsibility (Sexual Health)</em>, and national frameworks such as <em>Changing Scotland&rsquo;s Relationship with Alcohol</em> and <em>Early Years</em>.</p>

  <p>The Annual Population Survey (APS) is the official source for data on people not in education, employment or training. Table 1 shows the latest estimates from the APS, covering the period October 2008 to September 2009, of the numbers of people aged 16 to 19 not in education, employment or training in the Lothians region. Data is provided for the latest year and the previous year to allow for comparison. It has not been possible to break down these estimates by local authority area because the sample sizes in each of the local authorities are too small to provide reliable estimates.</p>

  <p>APS data for the 2009 calendar year (January to December) will be released on 24 June 2010.</p>
