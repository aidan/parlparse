  <p>The Chief Medical Officer issued guidance to health professionals on 19 November 2002, which included advice on the care of patients who may have suffered a bite or an abrasion from a bat. It also confirmed that bats do not pose a serious risk to the general public or to pets and domestic animals. Bats are naturally timid and at this time are hibernating.</p>

  <p>The risk to the public is minimal unless they handle bats. Almost all bat-handling licences have been withdrawn by Scottish Natural Heritage.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1F-2269 by Mr Jack McConnell on 21 November 2002, what financial assumptions were used to compute the total provision for implementation of free personal care for the elderly in the Highland Council area; which assumptions formed the basis of its conclusion that the &quot;total provision for implementing the policy is sufficient to enable all local authorities to meet their commitments to existing self funding residents"; what estimate it made of the additional demand stimulated by this policy, and whether it will review its allocation in the light of evidence on the demand and take-up rate of free personal care in the council area.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-12-11.3.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80199" speakername="Mr Frank McAveety" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa1211.htm#3">

  <p>Highland Council's free personal and nursing care total allocation in 2002-03 was &#163;4.106 million. Of this, &#163;2.092 million was based on the most recent information available on the number of <strong> </strong> residents funding their own care in residential and nursing homes in that area. In addition, the council received &#163;2.014 million which was distributed pro rata through the Grant Aided Expenditure formula for social work services for home-based older people.</p>

  <p>The Spending Review 2002 settlement reflects the Care Development Group's (CDG) costing assumptions for free personal care. The group took into account, as key influences, demography along with other relevant health and social factors, change in the unit costs of care, supply of informal care and possible shifts in care provision. Their assumptions estimated an increase in demand from unmet need and a shift from informal to formal care of approximately 12% building up over the first two years of the policy to 2004-05. The Executive provided resources in excess of those identified by the CDG.</p>

  <p>The Executive will be collecting data from local authorities on the uptake of free personal and nursing care on a quarterly basis. This will inform whether any adjustment of allocation is necessary.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to announce that I am today publishing Lord Bonomy&#146;s report and launching a wide-ranging four month consultation on its recommendations.</p>

  <p>I am most grateful to Lord Bonomy for his thorough and detailed report. He has considered carefully the causes of the current difficulties in the High Court and put forward a range of practical solutions designed to serve the interests of justice and to improve the experience of victims, witnesses and jurors. We are committed to reform of the High Court, and his report gives an excellent basis on which to take that reform forward.</p>

  <p>We are today writing to all the key stakeholders (including the Justice Committees) with copies of the report and inviting their comments. We are also inviting comments from all those individuals and groups who responded to Lord Bonomy&#146;s earlier request for views. The report will also be available electronically on the Scottish Executive&#146;s consultation website, and we are lodging copies in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 25575). Responses can be submitted online or by post.</p>

  <p>We will hold meetings where appropriate to facilitate discussion of the report. Special arrangements will be made to consult groups whose first language is not English.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether voluntary organisations that are involved in working with children are under any legal obligation to carry out Scottish Criminal Record Office checks.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-12-11.5.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80171" speakername="Hugh Henry" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa1211.htm#5">

  <p>Criminal record checks are now mostly carried out under Part V of the Police Act 1997 through the issue of criminal conviction and criminal record certificates. There is, however, no provision in Part V which requires a person to apply for a certificate. Nevertheless, those making appointments, whether paid or unpaid, to positions which give access to children or vulnerable adults have a responsibility to do as much as they can to ensure that those being appointed are suitable persons to have access to children and vulnerable adults. Asking potential recruits to apply for a criminal conviction certificate under Part V of the Police Act will help organisations make safer recruitment decisions. We are making available &#163;1 million per annum so that volunteers working with children and vulnerable adults in voluntary organisations may be able to obtain certificates without cost.</p>

  <p>Regulations made under the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001 require that providers and managers of care services are fit persons and that any person they employ (paid or unpaid) is a fit person. These regulations apply to all types of organisations that provide care services. One of the fit person criteria relates to criminal conviction information. Access to that information is available only through Part V of the Police Act 1997. This means that a Part V certificate will be needed to satisfy the requirements of the regulations.</p>

  <p>When the Protection of Children (Scotland) Bill is enacted it will be an offence for an organisation to employ in a child care position a person who is on the list of people deemed unsuitable to work with children. Access to names on the list will only be available through Part V certificates. This will effectively mean that child care organisations in all sectors will have to ask those they intend to employ to apply for a criminal record certificate.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether targeting the &#163;3 million grant to councils for specialist money/debt advice and specifically excluding other forms of advice and assistance represents best value in the light of the complexity of the problems facing people seeking advice on debt.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-12-11.6.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80144" speakername="Ms Margaret Curran" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa1211.htm#6">

  <p>Our additional investment of &#163;3 million to increase the number of money advisers in Scotland is being channelled through local authorities, because they are best placed to assess local provision and local needs. In many local authority areas the extra funding will be used to support voluntary sector and other advice agencies. Specialist money advisers have the skills and knowledge to take full account of the complexity of debtors&#146; circumstances. This may include looking at income maximisation through tax and benefits systems, and looking at housing and employment issues. In particular specialist money advisers will be able to assist debtors to participate in the new statutory Debt Arrangement Scheme, which is proposed in the Debt Arrangement and Attachment (Scotland) Bill. Advisers refer clients to others for additional advice on others matters, where this is needed and is in the best interest of the client.</p>

  <p>Transforming Waste.</p>

  <p>The New Opportunities Fund Transforming Waste programme will be launched in February 2003. In Scotland the programme is led by Forward Scotland in partnership with the Recycling Advisory Group Scotland, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and Keep Scotland Beautiful.

  <p>Transforming your space.</p>

  <p>Fresh Futures have been selected to manage the Transforming your space programme on behalf of the New Opportunities Fund.

  <p>The Scottish Forestry Grants Scheme (SFGS) represents a major change from the current Woodland Grant Scheme and Farm Woodland Premium Scheme (both of which operate across Great Britain). Development of information systems to support SFGS is a significant task and, to ensure that the systems are properly developed and tested, the Forestry Commission has recently announced that applications for SFGS will not be accepted until June 2003, after which the scheme should be fully operational. This represents a two-month delay to the original target date of April 2003, but the existing grant schemes are being kept open for an additional two months to minimise any inconvenience to the industry.</p>

As guidelines are an integral part of the development of condition-specific standards by the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland, the board's assessment of compliance with these standards, and with its clinical governance or generic standards, ensures that procedures are in place locally to implement relevant evidence-based guidelines and recommendations.

  <p>There has been no comparison undertaken between compensation paid in these cases and what the levels of compensation may have been paid under a "no fault" health insurance scheme.</p>

  <p>There are currently no plans to alter the way in which compensation is claimed and settled for acts of possible clinical negligence. However, you will be aware that in response to the reports published earlier in the year, by the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the Church of Scotland, the Scottish Executive established an expert group to look at current compensation arrangements for patients injured by the NHSScotland. This group is due to report by the end of 2002.</p>

  <p>I have asked Graeme Munro, Director and Chief Executive of Historic Scotland to reply. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The term historic buildings<i> </i>can refer to both listed buildings and scheduled monuments, although the latter covers a much wider range of types of monument. No record is kept by the Scottish Executive of the number of historic buildings for which a new use has been found. Records on changes to scheduled monuments are available for the last five years but these do not distinguish between different types of work for which consent is sought. Thus it is not possible to provide information on scheduled monument applications for the re-use of historic buildings.</p>

  <p>The granting of consent for a change of use to a listed building is a matter for the relevant planning authority to determine. Where a change of use involves an alteration or extension to a building listed at category A or B for which listed building consent is required, the local planning authority, if they are minded to grant consent, refer the matter to Historic Scotland for clearance. No such referral is required for buildings listed at category C(S), except in the case of demolition. Historic Scotland dealt with some 12,000 clearances in the five years up to 31 March 2002, with 97% cleared within 28 days.</p>

  <p>Monuments of national importance are added to the schedule for the purpose of preservation and this guides all consent decisions. The granting of consent for any works to a scheduled monument for the purpose of repairing it or any part of it or of making any alterations or additions to it is a matter for Historic Scotland under statutory powers delegated by the Scottish ministers. The total number of scheduled monument consent applications received in the five years up to 31 March 2002 totalled 1,097. In the vast majority of those cases the work was considered to be appropriate and consent was granted, often subject to conditions. Only a very small number of those applications involved the re-use of historic buildings and in those cases the preservation needs of the monument were the principle consideration.</p>

  <p>A prosecution can be brought against an owner residing anywhere within the UK. If they are outside the UK, the position is the same as for other offences which do not carry the possibility of a sentence of imprisonment. A Complaint can be served on them and, if they fail to appear for trial, trial may, with leave of the sheriff, proceed in absence under the terms of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995. At present any penalty imposed would not be enforceable outside the UK, but steps are being taken by the European Union to make it possible for fines imposed in one member state to be levied in another member state. There are no obvious prospects of such arrangements being extended to countries outside the European Union. The negotiation of such international agreements is a reserved matter.</p>

We expect authorities to make their own decisions about how to spend that block grant, taking into account national priorities and local circumstances. We discuss and agree those priorities with COSLA and are developing local outcome agreements, linking national priorities with local service outcomes.

  <p>Announcements made earlier in the summer designated Moray, Aberdeenshire, Banff and Buchan, Strathmore, Fife, and Lothian and the Borders as nitrate vulnerable zones. A subsequent report by the British Geological Survey presented evidence of a significant and rising trend in the nitrate levels in the Dumfries aquifers which provide drinking water for the public supply, and most critically, samples from one borehole indicated nitrate levels of over 50mg/l, the level at which the EC Nitrates Directive requires designation to be made.</p>

  <p>After discussion with farmers&#146; representatives we are therefore taking a proportionate step to halt the spread of nitrates into the drinking water. I have today made regulations designating the lower Nithsdale as a new groundwater nitrate vulnerable zone (NVZ).</p>

  <p>Copies of the detailed maps of the NVZ which accompany the regulations will be placed in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre, at local Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department area offices and in the Executives' offices at Pentland House and Victoria Quay in Edinburgh.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does acknowledge the importance of milk as part of a balanced diet. An adequate calcium intake is essential for the formation of healthy bones, particularly in childhood, and dairy products, including milk, are a good source of calcium for children. Recognising the important part that milk can play, &#163;380,000 a year is provided through the Health Improvement Fund as a top-up to the EC School Milk Subsidy Scheme to support the provision of milk in primary schools.</p>

  <p>In their interim report, the Expert Panel on School Meals devised Nutrient Standards for school lunches based on five food groups. They advised that school lunches should have at least one portion of food from the milk and dairy products group (which includes milk, cheese, yoghurt and milk-based deserts) and that milk as a drink should be available as an option at lunch time each day.</p>

  <p>There are also strong links between osteoporosis and physical activity and these have been considered as part of the work of the Physical Activity Task Force. The task force&#146;s draft report contains activity targets for children that are designed to promote good health.</p>

  <p>While many authorities provide free milk to some or all pupils, the decision on whether to do so is a matter for individual authorities. No data on an individual authority&#146;s policy is available centrally.</p>

A number of standards are built in with measurable outputs and these are monitored closely. The contracts were not designed to focus only on costs.

  <p>The protocol, announced on 11 November, applies to all new PPP/PFI projects with immediate effect. It deals with staff who join the Project Company after transfer of the undertaking and who, until now, could have faced less favourable terms and conditions than those enjoying protection under TUPE regulations. Scope for this two-tier workforce has been eliminated by the protocol. The protocol was drafted with regard to the Cabinet Office statement of practice, and operates in tandem with existing guidance. It applies equally to all groups of staff within the Project Company. Use of the protocol will be a condition of funding for all projects in the future.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Executive announced on 26 November that ministers intend to seek the power to direct local authorities in Scotland to protect the terms and conditions, including the pension rights, of workers transferred to other contractors on a similar basis to the one to be afforded to English and Welsh ministers through the Local Government Bill being published by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. The precise means of achieving that will be discussed with the UK Government, since some of the issues concerned are reserved to the UK Parliament.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will consider reforming the law so that public authorities are placed under a statutory obligation to inform the police when they have good grounds to believe that a crime has been committed, or is about to committed, by an employee or employees or anyone on their premises.</p>

  <p>We have no current plans to do so. At present, employers generally have the option but not the legal obligation to ask the police to investigate suspected crimes on their premises. There are some limited statutory exceptions to this. For example, where employers suspect that money laundering may be taking place, then steps must be taken to bring this to the attention of supervising authorities.</p>

  <p>Regardless of the attitude of public agencies, there is nothing to prevent an employee or any other person making a complaint about a suspected criminal offence to a professional body, the police or the procurator fiscal. The Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 provides protection for individuals who make certain disclosures of information in the public interest. This includes the disclosure of information which, in the reasonable belief of the worker making the disclosure, tends to show <i>inter alia</i> that a criminal offence has been committed, is being committed or is likely to be committed.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-12-11.61.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80223" speakername="Peter Peacock" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa1211.htm#31">

  <p>We have made good progress. The Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Department is wholly located in Glasgow, the Food Standards Agency Scotland has been set up in Aberdeen and the Public Guardian's Office has been set up in Falkirk. The National Office of the Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care and the offices of the Scottish Social Services Council has been set up in Dundee. The Scottish Public Pensions Agency is now located in Galashiels, and Scottish Water Headquarters has been set up in Dunfermline.</p>

  <p>Decisions are expected on the location of the Health Education Board for Scotland, <strong>sport</strong>scotland, and the Common Services Agency of the National Health Service in Scotland and Scottish Natural Heritage and the Scottish Arts Council before the end of this financial year, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education by mid 2003 and Registers of Scotland in 2004.</p>

  <p>Rolling this programme forward, I can announce today that we will examine relocation options for the following bodies, with reviews taking place in 2003.</p>

  <p><table border="BORDER" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="50%">

Commission</p></td><td width="41%" valign="TOP"> <p>Decision, early 2005</p></td></tr>
</table></p>

  <p>Consideration is being given to setting up the following new bodies.</p>

  <p><table border="BORDER" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="50%"> <tr><td width="60%" valign="TOP">
<p>Scottish Building Standards Agency</p></td><td width="40%" valign="TOP"> <p>Decision,

<tr><td width="60%" valign="TOP"> <p>Forest Enterprise Scotland</p></td><td width="40%" valign="TOP">
<p>Decision, end 2003</p></td></tr> </table></p>

  <p>If the Executive decides to set up these new bodies, in the case of the Mental Health Tribunal Service and the Scottish Building Standards Agency subject to parliamentary approval, they will be determined in accordance with the relocation policy with a presumption against an Edinburgh location. For organisations being considered following lease breaks, options outwith Edinburgh must be considered.</p>

  <p>It is also the intention of the Executive to provide further guidance on social issues to the bodies covered by the announcement. Currently, unemployment is one of the factors which is taken into account in location reviews. The guidance will make it clear that there is a case for giving greater weight to economic factors such as unemployment and other indicators of deprivation in conducting location reviews.</p>

  <p>These organisations will be examined on a case-by-case basis, with the aim of finding the best location for each organisation, within the context of relocation policy. The position of staff will be a consideration, as will the costs and benefits of the moves. As part of the process, the organisations concerned will continue to consider how most efficiently to conduct their work in line with the most up to date practices and use of technology. There will be opportunities for representations to be made about different locations and full consultation with the organisations concerned and the relevant trade unions.</p>

  <p>In addition, and as an extension to the policy, Mr Kerr announced on 25 October and the First Minister set out on 28 October that the Executive would undertake a review across the organisations covered by the relocation policy to identify small units of work which could be successfully carried out in more remote areas where other opportunities to promote economic activity can be harder to find.</p>

  <p>All NHS boards presently run optional training courses for health professionals, including dentists, on providing smoking cessation advice to patients.

  <p>We have introduced and are promoting a variety of volunteering initiatives across Scotland aimed at increasing the number of people who take part in voluntary activity.</p>

  <p>Specifically, we have allocated &#163;4.5 million towards developing the Active Communities Initiative throughout Scotland. Its objectives are:</p>

  <p>to bring about more positive attitudes to volunteering and community action;</p>

  <p>to locate volunteering and community action at the heart of Scottish Executive policy;</p>

  <p>to broaden the range of people involved, and</p>

  <p>to increase the number of people involved.</p>

  <p>In addition, we have established and funded a national network of Volunteer Centres across Scotland. Renfrewshire has had a Volunteer Centre since 1999.</p>

  <p>We have also introduced the Valuing Volunteers small grant scheme to enable small, local, service delivery organisation to apply for a grant to recognise, recruit, reward and resource volunteering activity. Over &#163;4,000 has been distributed amongst nine projects in Renfrewshire, during 2002, each receiving grants of up to &#163;500.</p>

  <p>Local authorities have a discretionary power to charge householders for the collection of certain types of household waste, including bulky items. A list of such wastes is prescribed by The Controlled Waste Regulations 1992. In exercising this power, local authorities must determine when charges are to be levied on the basis of practical considerations.</p>

  <p>The notified planning application for the Aucheninnes site extension was received by the Scottish ministers on 27 November and is now being assessed to decide whether it should be called in for determination by the Scottish ministers or cleared back to Dumfries and Galloway Council for them to deal with as they see fit. Our published target for dealing with such cases is that 80% should be assessed within 28 days, and 100% within two months.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what role the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) plays in assisting the police in the detection of wildlife offences.</p>

  <p>The RSPB sometimes assist in wildlife crime investigations but it is the responsibility of the police to lead enquires and it is for the police to judge whether or not the specialised assistance of the RSPB is required. The Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland and the RSPB are in the process of setting up a protocol for the reporting and investigation of crimes against birds.</p>

  <p>No. I am informed by the Convener of the Holyrood Progress Group that Gardiner &amp; Theobold were employed as consultants by Audit Scotland to assist the Auditor General for Scotland in the preparation of his report on the Holyrood Project in 2000. Any questions about their work should be addressed to the Auditor General for Scotland. Neither the Corporate Body nor the Scottish Commission for Public Audit has a locus in this matter.</p>
