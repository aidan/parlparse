  <p>The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) Council, which is independent of the Scottish Executive, supports and co-ordinates the development of clinical guidelines for NHS Scotland. A SIGN guideline is currently being developed for children and young people up to the age of 18 years with autism spectrum disorders. The guideline will address assessment, diagnosis and clinical interventions. Any decision on the development of a guideline for adults with autism spectrum disorders will be a matter for the SIGN Council.</p>

  <p>Source: 1997, New Earnings Survey (NES), 1998 to 2004, Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The median is the value below which 50 per cent of employee jobs fall. It is preferred over an arithmetic average for earnings data as it is influenced less by large or extreme values.</p>

  <p>2. Employees on adult rates whose pay for the survey pay-period was not affected by absence.</p>

  <p>3. ASHE data is currently only available from 1998 onwards. Prior to 1998 the preferred source of earnings data was the New Earnings Survey (NES). However, caution should be used when comparing data from NES and ASHE as they are not directly comparable.</p>

  <p>Although the Scottish Executive provides financial support for salaries and wages in the grant provided to local authorities, it is the responsibility of each local authority to allocate its financial resources to reflect local needs and priorities. In accordance with current legislation, the responsibility for the terms and conditions of local authority employees also lies with individual local authorities.</p>

  <p>The Single Status Pay Agreement was negotiated and agreed between local authorities and the unions in 1999. The Scottish Executive has no plans to provide further financial assistance for the implementation of the Single Status Pay Agreement. It is for local authorities to consider the implications of agreements which they negotiate with any party.</p>

  <p>The European Commission &quot;Decision on the application of Article 86(2) of the Treaty to state aid in the form of public sector compensation granted to certain undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest&quot;, announced on 15 July 2005 <em>, </em> provides an administrative framework which exempts certain state aids from notification to the European Commission. It does not, however, exempt public authorities from any other requirements in relation to state aids rules nor exempt them from the requirements of sectoral state aid rules. This means that, in relation to the Clyde and Hebrides, and Northern Isles ferry services, the Scottish Executive is still required to comply with the terms of the maritime state aid rules (the Maritime Cabotage Regulation) and, in particular, the requirement to act in a non-discriminatory way in respect of all community shipowners when concluding public service contracts or imposing public service obligations relating to the provision of cabotage services.</p>

  <p>Data about injury road accidents are collected by the police and reported to the Scottish Executive using the &quot;Stats 19&quot; statistical report format. These returns do not cover damage only accidents.</p>

  <p>Prior to 1 January 2005, &quot;Stats 19&quot; returns did not record contributory factors so the data requested is not available centrally.</p>

  <p>With effect from 1 January 2005, a new set of questions was added to the &quot;Stats 19&quot; injury road accident reporting system. Information about contributory factors should henceforth be supplied by all police forces for personal injury road accidents which are reported either (a) following attendance at the scene by a police officer or (b) by a member of the public to police staff at a police station. In due course, therefore, the statistical system will provide information about the contributory factors for personal injury accidents.</p>
