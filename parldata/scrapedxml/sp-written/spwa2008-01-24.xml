  <p>I have now set up an independent panel to review the current EU agricultural subsidies appeals process. It held its first meeting at the end of November 2007.</p>

  <p>The panel is chaired by John Kinnaird, a past President of NFU Scotland. The other members are Sheriff Roddy MacLeod from the Scottish Land Court, Professor Julie Fitzpatrick, Chief Executive of the Moredun Foundation and Mrs Isobel McCallum, vice president of the Black Isle Farmers Society.</p>

  <p>The review will be wide ranging and cover all aspects of the current process including the legislative framework (which sets out the level of penalties) within which panels have to operate.</p>

  <p>As part of its consideration the panel has also invited the industry to provide its views and opinions on the current procedure.</p>

  <p>I expect to receive the findings in May.</p>

  <p>International studies have shown a correlation between price and consumption, although it is clear that the relationship is complex, and variable in different countries and across different products. From the available evidence it is not possible to accurately predict the effect of price increases on consumption levels in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Much progress has been made by local partnerships to address antisocial behaviour since the Antisocial Behaviour (Scotland) Act was introduced in 2004. We are currently reviewing the national strategy to see where it can be strengthened, and will report our findings to Parliament by the end of 2008.

  <p>The Scottish Government wants children and young people to make full use of the internet and is committed to ensuring that they are able to do so in a safe and responsible manner.</p>

  <p>We continue to work with a number of agencies to raise children and young people&rsquo;s awareness about how to &quot;surf safely&quot;. Learning and Teaching Scotland provides advice on school policies for internet use and access and links to a number of websites that provide advice on internet safety. Respectme the national bullying service recently published advice on the use of the internet to prevent cyber bullying. Chatsafer, a Scottish Government information website, is a parental guide to safer chatting on the web. &quot;Safe and Well&quot; guidance, which issued to schools in 2005, includes good practice guidance on computer safety.</p>

  <p>As part of our on-going commitment to protect children, the draft outcomes and experiences for technology, which will be published later this year as part of the work on the curriculum review, are likely to include opportunities for teachers to develop young people&rsquo;s knowledge of safe and responsible use of the internet.</p>

  <p>The most recent assessment of sea level rise by the UK Climate Impacts Partnership was made in 2002 and suggests a rise by up to 600mm by 2080. This assessment will be updated in October 2008 in the light of which we will consider further the need to prepare contingency maps of areas that may be permanently lost to the sea through erosion as a result of rising sea levels. However, SEPA have published maps showing land that is currently at medium to high risk of coastal flooding.</p>

  <p>As with all privately owned land, the responsibility for accurate boundary information rests with the owner and occupier of that land. Determination of boundary disputes is a matter for the courts rather than the Crofters Commission. The Register of Crofts held by the Crofters Commission will record such boundary information as is supplied to it. No formal discussions on improving the accuracy of croft boundaries have been held with the Crofters Commission. The commission already assists landowners and crofters in identifying boundaries.</p>

  <p>Also two recent reports- <em>Mental Health in Scotland: Closing the Gaps- Making a Difference</em> and <em>National Forum On Drug Related Deaths- Annual Report 2007</em> -highlighted the increasing linkage between suicide prevention and substance misuse.

  <p>We would strongly encourage households and other users of energy-saving light bulbs to use the arrangements put in place for recycling and recovery of waste electrical and electronic equipment. These require producers and distributors to arrange for the take-back of relevant types of waste for recycling either through recycling centres or retail outlets.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is engaging with national governments to place Scotland as a nation rather than a region, but we will continue to cooperate with EU regions in areas where there is sufficient interest, goodwill and mutual benefit. Ministers are currently considering the Scottish Government&rsquo;s engagement with our European partners and this will form part of the European Strategy that is being drawn up at the moment.</p>

  <p>I have accepted an invitation to speak at the 2008 ENCORE (Environmental Conference of the Regions of Europe) event later this year. Most recently, Scottish ministers were represented at a side event to the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Bali in December 2007. The event was organised by The Climate Group, for politicians and officials from states and regions, including representatives from EU regional legislatures, to discuss climate change policy solutions.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government, in consultation with the fishing industry and environmental NGOs, is taking a number of steps to ensure sustainable cod fisheries, in particular under the new Conservation Credits scheme. A key factor in designing and implementing such steps will be the expected impact on cod mortality. However, given the innovative nature of several of these measures and the fact that the Scottish fleet is responsible for only a part of overall cod mortality, it is not possible to give firm estimates of what overall cod mortality is expected to be in 2008.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to anticipate exact numbers of vessels which would be eligible to benefit from EU days at sea derogations during 2008, but we can assume levels would be similar to those during 2007. I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-7738 on 11 January 2008 in which I provided the total number of Scottish-registered vessels benefiting from additional days for derogations for 2006 and 2007.</p>

  <p>This year, however, Scotland will for the first time be operating its own arrangements, with additional days at sea awarded domestically through Conservation Credits, a scheme which will reward fishermen for taking part in initiatives with real conservation benefits. The details of the Conservation Credits scheme, including the level of credits to be made available, are still in the process of being decided, with the full involvement of the industry, scientists and environmental NGOs.</p>

  <p>Despite the accuracy of the figures in this report, they should be used as indicative, and not definitive, as they are based on an Indicative Flood Map. The limitations of this map are:</p>

  <p>Discontinuity of the fluvial outline, due to tributaries not joining up;</p>

  <p>Misalignment between datasets, due to projection errors;</p>

  <p>DTM errors, due to complex automated land cover removal, and</p>

  <p>Methodology limitation.</p>

  <p>The number of potentially affected properties is based on the estimated number of postal entries at the time of release of the OS Address Layer 2 dataset (April 2006) and is likely to have a high degree of variability.</p>

  <p>The coastline of Scotland used in this analysis is the Ordnance Survey Boundary Line 2005 high-water mark coastline. Although it is unlikely that there are any properties located outside this coastline, the land surface between the low-water mark and the high-water mark can be considerable in places. The coastal flood zone produced by the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency does include this lands surface as well as some sea area. In the calculations, these areas were not included as coastal flood zone, or as land surface.</p>

  <p>Other points of concern are:</p>

  <p>Exclusion of non-postal entries in the OS Address Layer 2 dataset.</p>

  <p>Indicative map at scale 1/50k, not suitable to use for individual properties.</p>

  <p>Interaction between fluvial and coastal is not included.</p>

  <p>As agreed in the joint concordat, the support for flood prevention and coast protection is one of the grants which has been rolled up as part of the Local Government Settlement for 2008-11. Allocations to authorities took account of both the flood risk to be managed in its area and flood management measures already underway.</p>

  <p>Falkirk Council&rsquo;s total support for capital is &pound;18.384 million for 2008-09. It is the responsibility of Falkirk Council to allocate the total financial resources available to it on the basis of local needs and priorities having first fulfilled its statutory obligations and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Forestry Grant Scheme and the Woodland Grant Scheme continue to provide support for replanting but only where the funding commitment was made prior to 31 December 2007 when the previous Scotland Rural Development Plan (SRDP) closed.</p>

  <p>At the present time there are no grants schemes open to new applications which provide support for the replanting of felled woodlands. When the Rural Development Contracts &ndash; Regional Priorities opens to applicants, in the spring of 2008, it will include options which will support the replanting and restructuring of woodlands. It is a matter of concern for the Scottish Government that the process of SRDP approval by the EC has taken so long and that this has, so far, prevented the introduction of any new grant scheme which can support replanting and restructuring.</p>

  <p>The GP contract has built-in funding to reflect the additional costs of providing primary medical services in rural areas.</p>

  <p>Around &pound;300 million is distributed on the basis of the Scottish Allocation Formula, which is weighted to the needs of rural practices.</p>

  <p>Rural practices also benefit from an income guarantee which ensured that in the move to the new contract in 2004, no practice received less funding for the provision of core essential services.</p>

  <p>Local authorities have a duty to assess the needs of an individual where it appears to them that the individual may be in need of community care services. In the light of that assessment, the local authority should then provide or arrange for any required services, taking account of the individual&rsquo;s wishes.</p>

  <p>If the service is provided to a disabled person under the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1971, the local authority has a specific duty to provide that service to the individual. The introduction of single outcome agreements between the Scottish Government and local authorities will not affect an individual&rsquo;s legal entitlement to community care services.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Ministerial Code details the arrangements for the conduct of affairs by ministers and provides guidance by listing the principles and the precedents which may apply. The code is not a rule book, nor does it include or imply a complaints process. However, where a member, or any other party, writes to the First Minister to draw his attention to matters relating to the code, they will receive a formal reply from him or his office. The First Minister has received five letters since May 2007 which make reference to the code and are expressed in terms that make clear the correspondent wishes to draw his attention to matters of ministerial conduct. All have been received from members of the Scottish Parliament. After proper consideration of each case the First Minister has confirmed that he considers ministers had acted appropriately.</p>

  <p>Once this key priority of in-year balance is delivered and sustained the issue of the cumulative deficit will be brought into focus. In principle it is important that debts are cleared in the places they arise.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s priority is to recruit, retain and redeploy police officers to build police capacity and strengthen operational policing in our communities. Thus delivering an additional 1,000 officers into our communities.</p>

  <p>Retaining valuable officers is important to the government and communities. The 30 + scheme is not working as well as we would wish.</p>

  <p>In November we published a draft budget that will make Scotland a more successful, wealthier and fairer country.</p>

  <p>We are committed to working with Parliament to deliver the budget, and that is exactly what the Scottish Government has done over recent weeks and will continue to do.</p>

  <p>The Finance Committee&rsquo;s report is an important part of that process. As John Swinney said in yesterday&rsquo;s debate, we will now consider the report and respond to the points it raises as the Budget Bill moves through Parliament over the next month.</p>

  <p>Of course any suggested increases in funding would have to be matched by changes elsewhere.</p>

  <p>Under the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001 (the act) and its associated regulations, a care home service is required, as part of its application for registration, to provide the Care Commission with a business plan and cash flow statement, and where available, its annual accounts for any part of the three year period preceding the date of application during which the care service was in operation.</p>

  <p>In addition, as part of the on-going regulatory framework, care homes are required to provide the Care Commission with such information and documents as it may require in order to consider the financial viability of the care home.</p>

  <p>These documents include the certified annual accounts of the care home, a bank reference expressing an opinion as to the provider&rsquo;s financial standing and information as to the financing and financial resources of the care service.</p>

  <p>The use of Regional Project Assessment Committees is not a new process, having been successfully used to administer the Farm Business Diversification Scheme previously operated by the Scottish Executive. Other significant changes being implemented to deliver the new elements of the Scottish Rural Development Fund will also offer opportunities for further streamlining of administration both for applicants and government officials.</p>

  <p>In particular, bringing together in excess of ten funding streams into one integrated application process under the Rural Development Contracts &ndash; Rural Priorities, will cut down much duplication for applicants, both in terms of the application and claims processes and reduce inspection visits.</p>

  <p>Rural Priorities will also allow applicants to seek information and guidance, and submit applications to any office of the Rural Payments and Inspections Directorate, Forestry Commission Scotland and Scottish Natural Heritage. The three bodies will be jointly responsible for operating Rural Priorities, and applicants will receive the same service from whichever office they choose to visit. This &quot;one stop shop&quot; approach will offer applicants greater flexibility and efficiency savings when accessing funding from the Scottish Government to support their rural development proposals.</p>

  <p>It is important to recognise that it is only applications for the new competitive Rural Development Contracts &ndash; Rural Priorities (RDC RPs) which will be on-line. Hard copy application processes are being used for all the other funding streams (seven) in the Scotland Rural Development Programme (SRDP).</p>

  <p>2. The online application approach has been chosen on the understanding that the vast majority of applicants to the predecessor schemes replaced by RDC RPs, chose to use an agent to complete their applications. We expect a similar proportion to do so for RDC RPs, and in addition, will provide funding towards the cost of completing a proposal.</p>

  <p>3. There are a number of clear benefits, both from an applicant and an administrative perspective, for the adoption of an on-line application process for this element of the SRDP:</p>

  <p>RDC RPs offers over 120 options, each with differing information required from applicants. This would be unmanageable on paper; web forms ensure applicants only see the questions they have to answer for their selected circumstances;</p>

  <p>Similarly, the guidance will be extensive and putting it on the web, makes it easier to navigate and ensures any updates are immediately available;</p>

  <p>Web forms greatly reduce errors, effort and delay in the application process (e.g. they ensure all mandatory information is completed; they offer only valid choices of answer; they can be pre-populated with data already recorded);</p>

  <p>Developing and operating an on-line system uses public funds much more efficiently than a manual, paper-based service, and</p>

  <p>RDC RPs is a competitive opportunity and it is reasonable to expect those who wish to bid for funds to use effective and efficient business tools to do so.</p>

  <p>4. Whilst we recognise that on-line submission may provide challenges for a limited number of those wishing to apply for funding under RDC RPs, the SRDP Implementation Team is taking action to assess the scope and nature of any barriers to access and to provide appropriate assistance to overcome these:</p>

  <p>Broadband coverage now extends to 99% of the Scottish population. Scottish Government&rsquo;s &lsquo;Broadband for Scotland&rsquo; initiative is proactively helping to fill the remaining gaps;</p>

  <p>Many libraries, community centres, schools and other public facilities provide internet access, and assistance to novice users;</p>

  <p>Staff are engaged with local enterprise companies and other rural agencies regarding the provision of services for small rural businesses and land managers, including guidance on access;</p>

  <p>Crofters Commission have been allocated &pound;100,000 to assist community groups within the Crofting Counties to apply for funding under the SRDP;</p>

  <p>We are in discussion with Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations to fund a similar service outwith the Crofting Counties.</p>

  <p>5. Our regional staff also intend to engage with local authorities and other regional stakeholders to identify further ways to direct applicants to existing facilities and support services.</p>

  <p>The Heriot Watt University review of Scottish Natural Heritage&rsquo;s (SNH) role in planning casework is still being finalised by the consultants. Once the report has been finalised it will be for Scottish Natural Heritage, in the first instance, to consider the recommendations and any action they intend to take. I look forward to discussing with SNH now they do so.</p>

  <p>The Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 establishes the right of responsible access by members of the public. Representatives of rural businesses and land managers, including livestock farmers, were involved in the development of the legislation and the <em>Scottish Outdoor Access Code</em> . They continue to be fully involved in the implementation of access rights through the National Access Forum which is able to consider any relevant issues highlighted by land managers, recreational users or others. The National Farmers Union has distributed a <em>Public Access to Farmland</em> brochure to provide a brief introduction for farmers, crofters and growers on their rights and responsibilities.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland officials have been involved in discussions with NESTRANS on the emerging conclusions from the STAG 2 report on the Aberdeen Crossrail project which has been received in draft format only. As a result of this dialogue, it was jointly agreed that NESTRANS should give further examination to the passenger benefits which could be achieved from the existing infrastructure. Alternative proposals have been identified and submitted to Transport Scotland. These are currently being assessed to identify which meet our strategic priorities and best meet the needs of rail users in the Aberdeen area whilst at the same time offering best value.</p>
