  <p>No formal monitoring has taken place. However, the Scottish Executive, through Historic Scotland, is aware of the range of provision made for archaeological services by Scottish local authorities. It is for each local authority to allocate its resources across the range of services that it provides in the light of locally determined priorities.</p>

  <p>The Executive recognises and supports the work of research charities with which we have a common purpose - to secure continuous improvements in outcomes, treatment, care and quality of life for NHS patients. Under a UK-wide agreement with the research charities, the Executive financially supports charity-funded research by meeting the costs to the NHS of hosting their research activities. These costs are met through the NHS RandD Support Fund which is managed by the Chief Scientist Office (CSO). It follows, therefore, that any increase in cancer research which charities fund within NHSScotland will be eligible for additional support funding from the NHS RandD Support Fund.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, as I announced last month, &#163;1 million is being made available to support additional clinical trials in cancer.</p>

  <p>There are no plans to establish such a convention. The Executive recognises that the debate on the future of the European Union is of great importance to the people of Scotland and it has already participated in a number of events focusing on this issue. We welcome the recent announcement by the Northern Ireland Executive of its intention to develop the debate there. We indicated in our response to the European Committee's 9th Report of 2001: <em>Governance of the European Union and the Future of Europe: what role for Scotland?</em> that we intend to encourage and facilitate full participation by civil society in Scotland in the Future of Europe debate. We, however, think it sensible to establish precisely how the forum and the structured network will operate and how the views of civil society can most effectively be conveyed to the Future of Europe Convention before embarking on that process and details of these arrangements are still not available.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will support the case for road equivalent tariff to be applied to the costs of travel by ferry; whether it has considered the cost of implementing such a policy and, if so, what the estimated cost would be, and whether it has estimated what the additional traffic would be through a reduction in the ferry fares by the application of a road equivalent tariff policy.</p>

  <p>We have no plans to implement a road equivalent tariff (RET) approach to setting fares for ferry services which the Executive subsidises, nor do we intend to conduct research into the cost of implementing such a policy. As I have indicated in previous answers, it is clear that RET would require substantial alteration in the fares structure of Caledonian MacBrayne at a time when it and the people whom it serves most require stability and security of service. Our efforts must be focused on securing continuity of services and protection of fares through the future tendering exercise relating to the company's services.</p>

  <p>The Executive issued NHS HDL (Health Department Letter) (2002)20 to NHSScotland on 28 March 2002. This outlines guidance on payment verification arrangements for family health services. Chapter 4 of the payments verification procedures document at Annex B of the HDL lists the verification checks undertaken by the Common Services Agency on payments claimed by GPs under general medical services, including item of service fees. In addition, the Executive issued HDL(2002)23 on 5 April 2002 which provides guidance to NHSScotland on procedures to be followed where there is cause to suspect that a criminal offence, including fraud, has been committed involving public funds or property. There is a requirement to report the case to the Procurator Fiscal where there is prima facie evidence of fraud. The HDLs are available on the SHOW website at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/sehd/publications.asp" target="_blank">http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/sehd/publications.asp</a></p>

  <p>In addition to having their case referred to the Procurator Fiscal, GPs who are suspected of claiming payments falsely will be investigated by the Fraud Investigation Unit of the Common Services Agency and may be referred to one or more of the following bodies, depending on the gravity of the alleged offence - an NHS Discipline Committee, the NHS Tribunal, the General Medical Council.</p>

  <p>Under the National Health Service (General Medical Services) (Scotland) Regulations 1995, an Islands NHS Board or a Primary Care Trust is required to keep an up-to-date list of patients for each of its general practitioners. Where the board or trust is satisfied that a person no longer resides in the area where the general practitioner provides services or that the whereabouts of the person are no longer known to it, it should remove that person's name from the patient list.</p>

  <p>Students are entitled to have their names included in the patient list of a general practitioner in the area where they reside during their course of study. Registration of students is subject to the same controls as other patients.</p>

  <p>When a patient dies their name is to be deleted from the patient list as from the date on which notification of death is received by the board or trust. A general practitioner is obliged to send the medical records of a patient who has died to the board or trust in a case where he or she learned of the death other than by notification from that body.</p>

  <p>Temporary residents are not included in a general practitioner's list. The board or trust for the area of their normal place of residence should remove them from the list of their own general practitioner once their stay in the place of temporary residence exceeds 90 days and they have not returned to their own area.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has put in place a range of measures to tackle hospital acquired infection (HAI). These include the introduction of service standards by the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland (CSBS) for infection control and cleaning services, a national mandatory system of surveillance of HAI, improved measures for the decontamination of re-usable medical devices, the antimicrobial resistance strategy and additional funding for the training of infection control nurses.</p>

  <p>The CSBS interim report on performance against the infection control standard will be the first indication of how well the NHS in Scotland is responding to the new measures.</p>

  <p>Responsibilities for assessing and meeting all housing needs at local level, including needs for sheltered housing, lie with local authorities.</p>

  <p>The Executive does, however, collect information at local authority level on (a) the total number of sheltered houses in the social rented sector at 31 March each year, and (b) the total number of lettings of local authority owned special needs dwellings each quarter (which includes sheltered but does not separately identify them). The most recent information on (a) was published in the Scottish Executive Quarterly Housing Trends Bulletin HSG/2001/6, which is available in the Parliament's Reference Centre (publication date 18 December 2001, Bib. number 18220). The latest figure on (b) for the period July-September 2001, for the council area of North Lanarkshire was 53.</p>

  <p>In deciding on the regular statistical information to gather from councils and maintain centrally, the Executive aims to ensure that the need justifies the costs to councils of assembling and supplying the information.</p>

  <p>The Rent Registration Service sets rent levels for housing benefit purposes in line with legislation drawn up by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and approved by the UK Parliament.</p>

  <p>The legislation requires the Rent Officer to make a significantly high rent determination if he considers that the tenant's rent is significantly higher than that which the landlord might reasonably expect to obtain on the open market at that time.</p>

  <p>If the dwelling exceeds the defined size criteria for the household, the Rent Officer must determine a rent for a similar tenancy of the appropriate size for that household in the vicinity.</p>

  <p>If the rent officer considers that the rent for the dwelling is exceptionally high, he has to determine the highest rent (which is not exceptionally high) which the landlord might reasonably be expected to obtain for a similar tenancy in the same neighbourhood.</p>

  <p>The Rent Officer makes his determination on the basis of his knowledge of the local market and, in doing so, looks at similar tenancies in the same vicinity. In particular, the Rent Officer will consider the proposed rent against his or her determination of the mid-point market rent for the appropriate size of dwelling in the locality. These "Local Reference Rents" ("Single Room Rents" for claimants under 25) are calculated by formulae defined in the legislation.</p>

  <p>A UK-wide risk-sharing scheme for the treatment of eligible patients with multiple sclerosis begins on 6 May 2002. The scheme allows beta interferon and glatiramer acetate to be prescribed on the NHS to patients who meet criteria set out by the Association of British Neurologists. Patients' eligibility for treatment will depend on the clinical judgement of the specialist neurologists concerned.</p>

  <p>The health departments do not underestimate the work required to set up and operate the scheme and will be holding regular meetings with professional and patient groups to assess progress. The scheme includes incentives for the pharmaceutical companies to increase their investment in generic specialist MS nursing services.</p>

  <p>About 2,100 prisoner places are currently available to prisoners who wish to have nothing to do with drugs. This figure represents 36% of available capacity.

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally.

  <p>The Motorway and Trunk Road Programme to 2004 includes 15 schemes on the A75 and A77 at a total cost of over &#163;19 million. Consideration will be given to reallocating planned investment along the routes to best address the priorities identified in consultation with the Loch Ryan ferry companies. The case for further investment beyond 2004 stands to be considered against competing priorities from across the trunk road network in the context of Spending Review 2002.</p>

  <p>Neither council has submitted current applications for the consent of the Scottish ministers to the reorganisation or closure of schools in their areas. Decisions on school reorganisation or closure proposals are in the first instance the responsibility of the education authority concerned, following statutory consultation with parents, school boards and church bodies in the case of denominational schools. The consent of Scottish ministers to individual proposals is required only in certain circumstances prescribed in statute.</p>

  <p>Both North Lanarkshire Council and South Lanarkshire Council have submitted bids for revenue support for potential school building Public/Private Partnership projects with the objective of contributing to the improvement of their school estates. These are under consideration with bids received from 12 other authorities and we shall announce decisions as soon as all relevant issues have been considered.</p>

  <p>The Victim Liaison Office is a major strand of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service Action Plan on the <em>Scottish Strategy for Victims</em> . I have already given a commitment that there would be a Victim Liaison Office within each region of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service by summer 2002. Offices have been established in Aberdeen, Hamilton, Peterhead, Glasgow and Kilmarnock. Further offices will be opened in Edinburgh and Dundee by August 2002.</p>

  <p>The principal aims of the service are to provide information to eligible victims, witnesses and bereaved next of kin about the criminal justice process in general and the progress of the case that affects them and to facilitate referrals to other agencies for specialist support and counselling as required.</p>

  <p>The Victim Liaison Office provides its services to the following categories:</p>

  <p>Victims in serious cases where the nature of the charge is indicative of proceedings before a jury;</p>

  <p>Next of kin in deaths cases which are reported for consideration of criminal proceedings, and in deaths cases where a Fatal Accident Inquiry is to be held;</p>

  <p>Next of kin in cases where the Procurator Fiscal will invite the next of kin to discuss the circumstances of the death;</p>

  <p>Victims in cases of domestic abuse;</p>

  <p>Victims in racially aggravated cases and cases where it is known that the victim perceived the offence to be racially motivated;</p>

  <p>Cases involving children who have been cited as prosecution witnesses;</p>

  <p>Victims in cases involving sexual offences, and</p>

  <p>Any other victim, witness or next of kin where the Victim Liaison Office considers that because of particular vulnerability the provision of services would be beneficial.</p>
