  <p>We have no such evidence. Under existing legislation, it is mandatory for developers to detail the environmental impact of their proposals, especially for environmentally significant sites, and propose mitigation measures as part of their accompanying environmental statement. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds is of the opinion that studies are helpful at a local level, but it is difficult to apply their conclusions more generally. However, one local five-year study on the Novar windfarm at Inverness registered no significant impact on the bird population.</p>

  <p>The British-Irish Council (BIC) held its third summit meeting, in Jersey, on 14 June. The main focus of the meeting was the knowledge economy, on which Jersey takes the lead. The meeting was a useful and constructive one. Besides agreeing an approach to closer working on measures to tackle the &quot;digital divide&quot;, it enabled members to exchange information and views on the wide variety of policies, methods of working and projects under way. I also emphasised scope for council members to work together on the development of enterprise skills in young people.</p>

  <p>The meeting also received progress reports on BIC co-operation on drugs, environment, social inclusion, transport, health: the application of telemedicine, and tourism.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to confirm that Scotland will host the next BIC Summit in November, where the focus of the meeting will be on the issue of social inclusion.</p>

  <p>I am placing a copy of the Communiqu&eacute; issued by the British-Irish Council after the summit meeting in Jersey in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 22056).</p>

  <p>I can confirm that the Scottish Executive carried out a performance assessment of the Chairman of Caledonian MacBrayne before the recent announcement of his reappointment. This was based on significant contact between ministers and the chairman and very frequent contact between senior officials of the Development Department and the chairman over almost three years. A senior Executive official attends every Caledonian MacBrayne Board meeting and, in addition to this, there are further contacts through regular dialogue, meetings and correspondence. The Executive did not consult users or the company&#146;s staff prior to re-appointing the chairman nor is that a statutory requirement or a requirement of the <em>Commissioner for Public Appointments&#146; Code of Practice</em> . As with other similar papers associated with any public appointment, details of the performance assessment are confidential.</p>

  <p>Three thousand, five hundred and fifty-nine over 60&#146;s households in the private sector and 4,906 households in the social rented sector who were without central heating benefited from the central heating programme in 2001-02. We cannot specify how many of those in the social rented sector were aged 60 or over because the programme in that sector is not confined to that age group.</p>

  <p>The Community Regeneration Statement - <em>Better Communities in Scotland: Closing the Gap </em> - which was published on 25 June, signals a number of important shifts in our approach to regeneration. These include the placing of regeneration within the community planning framework and, as part of consequence of this, the migration of social inclusion partnership funding to community planning partnerships; giving higher priority to providing individuals and communities with the skills and confidence necessary to take advantage of opportunities and to play a full part in the life of their communities, and putting in place a more robust monitoring and evaluation framework. Together these proposals will make a significant contribution to closing the gap between deprived communities and the rest of Scotland. A full debate on the statement will take place immediately after First Minister&#146;s Question Time today.</p>

  <p>We will continue to strengthen the Scottish Drug Enforcement Agency (SDEA) which, together with Scottish police forces and law enforcement partners, are actively targeting drug dealers. We are providing &#163;18.3 million to the SDEA over the next two years to enable it to continue to build on the achievements in its second annual report, published on 24 June, including the arrest last year of 172 persons involved in drug dealing. The Proceeds of Crime Bill, which is nearing the end of its progress through the UK Parliament, will also have a major impact on drug dealers and other criminals.</p>

  <p>The Discipline Task Group (DTG) report <em>, Better Behaviour &#150; Better Learning</em> made 36 recommendations aimed at improving discipline in schools, many of which will also impact on violent or threatening behaviour exhibited towards school staff. These recommendations are currently being implemented by the Scottish Executive, local authorities and individual schools following the Joint Action Plan published in December 2001. During 2001-02, the Scottish Executive made available initial funding of &#163;13,000,000 to local authorities to assist with this implementation</p>

  <p>It is hoped that the implementation of the DTG recommendations, along with other Scottish Executive initiatives, ensure an effective learning environment for all pupils.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how it plans to take forward its proposals to tender the Clyde and Hebrides ferry service currently operated by Caledonian MacBrayne.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-06-27.12.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80189" speakername="Lewis Macdonald" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0627.htm#11">

  <p>I have today published, for consultation, the draft Invitation to Tender (ITT), which includes the service specification, for the Clyde and Hebrides ferry services currently operated by Caledonian MacBrayne. This sets out our proposals for tendering. I have also published an accompanying consultation document <em>Proposals for Tendering Clyde and Hebrides Ferry Services</em> which explains the principles adopted in the service specification and seeks views on options. At the heart of these proposals is our commitment to protecting existing levels of fares and the level of services and ensuring that safety is a priority at all times. I believe that the service specification achieves this. The key elements are:</p>

  <p>The network will be tendered as a whole. The European Commission took account of the case we made for this and the way is now clear for the Executive to proceed on this basis. Overwhelming support was expressed for this option in response to the previous consultation <em>Delivering Lifeline Ferry Services</em>. This will maximise service reliability for the communities served, simplify the process for management of vessels and provide economies of scale in company management, safety and quality systems. It also avoids cherry picking of routes and facilitates integrated transport through co-ordinated timetabling of services.</p>

  <p><em>Delivering Lifeline Ferry Services</em> explained that the EC rules ruled out the possibility of subsidy for mainland-to-mainland routes. Through our representations, we have been able make inroads to secure these routes. I am delighted to confirm that both of the mainland-to-mainland routes in the current Undertaking (Gourock to Dunoon and Tarbert to Portavadie) will be included in the single bundle. This is based on the European Commission's assessment that the land-based routes do not provide viable alternatives. This is welcome news and will mean that subsidy for these services can continue.</p>

  <p>We also explained that Public Service Obligations (PSOs) can be imposed for scheduled services to ports serving peripheral areas or thinly served routes considered vital only where the operation of market forces would not ensure a sufficient service level. Nevertheless, we decided to make strong representations for the continuation of the approved Gourock to Dunoon passenger service. This is consistent with our integrated transport policies. However, following discussions with the Commission we have concluded that the service for Gourock to Dunoon should be restricted to a passenger only service to comply with EC rules for PSOs). This is because the case for a vehicle service is undermined by the existence of an unsubsidised private sector competitor nearby. We are pleased that the Commission accepted the arguments for a continued passenger only service which will carry passengers between the railhead at Gourock and Dunoon.</p>

  <p>New services - We undertook to review the Out of Undertaking services and I am pleased to announce that we will expand the services to include two services that are currently outwith the Undertaking. These are:</p>

  <p>Mallaig to Armadale winter vehicle service, and</p>

  <p>Tarbert to Portavadie winter service.</p>

  <p>I also propose further new services as follows:</p>

  <p>Sound of Barra and Sound of Harris - The Executive recently announced funding for a new CalMac ferry for the Sound of Harris route. This will allow a vessel to be deployed to provide a new service for the Sound of Barra and also enhanced services for the Sound of Harris.</p>

  <p>Kilchoan to Tobermory winter passenger service - This service is currently provided by the local community with financial support from various sponsors including the local authorities. The current winter service is a passenger only service and it is proposed that it will remain so with a vehicle service provided during the summer (as now). This will ensure vital links between Tobermory and Kilchoan are secured.</p>

  <p>Enhanced Oban services - a new vessel is being built to serve the Mallaig to Armadale route. This releases a third major vessel (MV Lord of the Isles) to enhance services from Oban to Mull, Colonsay, Coll, Tiree, Lochboisdale, Castlebay and Islay during the summer.</p>

  <p>Following discussions with the Commission, I can confirm that we intend to establish a publicly owned vessel owning company (VesCo). This will ensure effective utilisation of the existing fleet, offer service reliability through this period of change and guarantee the availability of vessels for subsequent operating contracts. The operator will be bound to the VesCo fleet and the vessels will be chartered/leased on a bareboat basis at commercial rates. This is in line with the EC rules that prohibit grant in respect of vessel replacement.</p>

  <p>Our original proposals had allowed scope for operators to bring their own vessel solutions where we had identified a need for new vessels. However, we have concluded that VesCo should be regarded as the procurer of new vessels for the specified services and will also have a role in strategic planning. Decisions in relation to the vessel procurement programme for the first tendering period have yet to be taken in the context of the 2002 spending review but we plan to include these for bidders in the final service specification. There will be scope for operators to bring their own vessels to provide services over and above those specified if they wish. This will ensure that expansion of services would not be constrained by the size of VesCo&#146;s fleet.</p>

  <p>VesCo will be responsible for providing an operator of last resort function. VesCo may do this at its own hand or through a retainer arrangement with a ship management company. It will be an early priority of VesCo to investigate these options and make recommendations to ministers. Arrangements will be in place by the start of the first contract.</p>

  <p>VesCo will also own CalMac's piers and harbours. The operator will be required, as VesCo's agent, to manage certain harbour functions currently provided by CalMac in return for management fees (although VesCo will still retain overall responsibility for delivering these functions through such an agreement). Ticketing offices, waiting rooms etc will be made available for lease by the operator. This ensures that all the &quot;tools of the job&quot; remain with VesCo and can be made available on a continuing basis to the first and subsequent operators. Operators will not be bound to these facilities since they may be able to deliver improvements and efficiencies.</p>

  <p>Safety of passengers and crew is paramount. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) is responsible for safety in relation to sea transport in UK waters. The core principle of the service specification is to ensure that bidders must comply with all MCA standards on all vessels at all times. The successful bidder will be subject to the same stringent safety standards that CalMac and other operators already have to comply with. The VesCo's contracts with the successful bidder will set out detailed maintenance responsibilities in respect of vessels. The key principle will be that the operator is responsible for vessel maintenance. This will ensure that there is no confusion in relation to safety issues.</p>

  <p>The Draft Invitation to Tender encompasses the above decisions. In addition, key proposals and principles include the following.</p>

  <p>Protecting levels of services. We gave a commitment to protect existing levels of service. All services currently within Caledonian MacBrayne&#146;s Undertaking will be maintained. Following discussions with initial consultees the service specification adopts a prescriptive approach to timetables. It requires the operator as a minimum to provide the summer and winter arrangements as currently operated by CalMac. However, it is not the intention to set these arrangements in stone and, as now, there will be the possibility for changes to be approved during the contract provided the operator has agreed this with the local communities concerned through the consultative machinery. This is in line with the current system. The timetables prescribed will be the most recent at the time the service specification is finalised.</p>

  <p>Protecting fares - I propose that, for the service specification, CalMac&#146;s fares are taken as the starting point in setting maximum fares and that these would be adjusted annually to reflect changes in the Retail Price Index over the contract period. The operator will be required to offer the full range of fares for passengers and vehicles as currently set out in the timetables. Concessionary fares will be continued as detailed in the draft service specification and operators will be expected to continue arrangements for local authority funded concessionary schemes. The operator will also be expected to continue special charging arrangements as detailed in the service specification. As for timetables, the fares prescribed will be based on the most recent available at the time the service specification is finalised. We propose to carry out further research on fares to inform the approach for the second tendering period.</p>

  <p>Branding - it is proposed that the operator should be required to operate the vessels under the existing CalMac livery. This will ensure continuity of brand and assist with the longer term marketing of the Highlands and Islands. However, there would be flexibility for operators to be identified with the operation of services in literature and websites. It is also proposed that where operators bring their own vessels to provide extra services over and above those specified they be allowed to sail those under their own livery.</p>

  <p>Performance regime - there will be a robust performance regime which will set tough targets for operators and safeguard standards of reliability and punctuality of services. This will operate on a route by route basis (so that no one route can be operated at the expense of others). The operator will also be required to develop a User's Charter which will set down standards in relation to a number of areas such as conduct of staff, standard of on-board facilities, standard of cleanliness and the complaints procedures.</p>

  <p>I am keen to promote good consultative arrangements within the new framework. I invited the Highlands and Islands Strategic Partnership to consider these and to make recommendations. These are presently being considered and we intend to consult on the way forward separately later this year. In the meantime the draft service specification sets out the current arrangements and requires the contractor to meet these as a minimum. This will be amended in due course if appropriate.</p>

  <p>Turning to the timescale for tendering, the work involved in restructuring CalMac is complex. It seems unlikely that VesCo would be in a position to liaise with tenderers until at least early next year. Based on this I anticipate that the tendering process will be completed in early 2004 with contract handover later that year. However, this may be subject to change depending on progress with restructuring. I believe that it is important to take the time necessary to ensure a smooth transition to the new framework.</p>

  <p>The consultation period will close on 27 September. I hope to see a full response from all those with an interest. In the meantime I will be publishing a Prior Information Notice in the Official Journal of the European Commission. This is not part of the formal tendering process but will alert operators to proposals and ensure that they can take part in the consultative process too. I will give close consideration to the responses to the consultation in making decisions about the final Invitation to Tender.</p>

  <p>There have been a number of trials of GM oilseed rape in Belgium. The Belgian authorities recently ordered the destruction of a small research plot of GM oilseed rape because it did not have the required separation distance between it and a conventional crop of oilseed rape which was planted subsequently.</p>

  <p>Separation distances are concerned with maximising crop purity and are not about safety. In Scotland, those distances are set following expert advice and are based upon their successful use in conventional agriculture. Compliance with separation distances is monitored by the Executive&#146;s GM Inspectorate who have visited all Scottish release sites. They have not identified any instances where sexually compatible crops were growing within the permitted separation distances.</p>

Information about face-to-face consultations between GP's and patients is gathered centrally from a representative sample of 60 Scottish General Practices. For the illnesses most commonly caused by stress - mood/affective disorders and neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders - it is estimated that approximately 552,200 individuals were seen by GPs in Scotland in the year ending December 2001. However, we cannot quantify exactly how many of these were caused by stress.</p>

  <p>Since the publication of <em>Our National Health</em> there has been a significant shift in the focus on developing a range of initiatives to support Patient Focus and Public Involvement. These policies are being developed to ensure that there is full and meaningful engagement of the public in service reconfiguration. Monitoring mechanisms for public involvement are being included in generic standards of the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland and more specifically Audit Scotland has been asked to provide external monitoring of the implementation of the Greater Glasgow Acute Services Review and that could be replicated in other areas.</p>

  <p>The Executive supports the use of restorative justice as a means both of addressing the needs of the victim and the community and of reducing re-offending by providing offenders with the opportunity to understand the consequences of their actions and to offer reparation. As part of the action programme to reduce youth crime, the Minister for Education and Young People announced an additional &#163;2 million in March to help set up restorative justice schemes in areas where there are none and to develop and enhance those that are already up and running. In addition, we expect many of the youth crime programmes being developed across the country to have strong restorative justice elements. In the adult system, restorative justice is an important element in existing reparation and mediation schemes and in Community Service Orders, which provide courts with the powers to order offenders to undertake unpaid work or services for the benefit of the community.</p>

  <p>Amendments have been tabled to the Police Reform Bill, currently before the UK Parliament, to fulfil this commitment by amending the Employment Rights Act 1996 so that police officers in England, Wales and Scotland are covered by the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998. These are due to be considered by the Standing Committee on the Bill on 27 June 2002.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has offered financial assistance to City of Edinburgh Council for further modelling work into passenger demand for heavy rail and light rail options on the Edinburgh South Suburban Railway route. This forms part of a wider funding package, totalling &#163;6.555 million under the Integrated Transport Fund, for the development of light rail in the city. Any decisions we make on supporting the re-opening of a passenger route will of course be taken in light of the findings of the further modelling work.</p>

  <p>I am happy to be able to make the Directions and Guidance for the next Scottish passenger rail franchise available to the Scottish Parliament today, in advance of delivering them to the SRA. A copy of my Directions and Guidance to the SRA for the next Scottish passenger rail franchise has today been placed in the Parliament's Reference Centre. Scotland deserves a railway that is fit for the 21st century and we should not settle for anything less. The directions and guidance clearly set out the Executive&#146;s broad objectives for railways in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Between 2000 and 2004 over &#163;21 million will have been made available by the Scottish Executive to local authorities to take forward work on walking, cycling and safer streets projects. These resources can be used to implement measures which will encourage more children to walk to school. It is, however, for each local authority to decide how best to use its allocation having regard to local needs and priorities.</p>

  <p>In December 1999 the Executive published Guidance on <em>How to Run Safer Routes to School</em>. It contains practical guidance on how to encourage more children to walk, cycle or use public transport to school.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive takes staff welfare seriously. The Executive recently asked an independent organisation to conduct a survey of staff to examine work-related stress in detail. The Executive's Management Group committed themselves to giving the issues raised close attention.</p>

  <p>In addition to this work, there are a number of strategies already in place to help staff who experience stress both in and out of work. These include the Executive's Counselling and Welfare Service and an independent Employee Assistance Programme.</p>

  <p>It is too early to assess the impact of the new student support arrangements. There are, however, some encouraging trends in the most recent data which shows a steady growth in the proportion of school leavers entering higher education to 32%, an overall participation rate of 50% of Scots under the age of 21 and a 5% increase in the numbers of Scots applying for higher education through UCAS this year.</p>

  <p>On 26 June, Cabinet agreed a 10 point action plan to tackle the problem of persistent offending, to enhance community safety and to improve the effectiveness of Scotland&#146;s youth justice systems.</p>

  <p>The review recommends a tiered approach in tackling youth crime:</p>

  <p><strong>To tackle persistent offending: A</strong> small number of persistent offenders are responsible for a disproportionate amount of youth crime. Action will be targeted at this group, including:</p>

  <p><strong>1. A pilot of Specialist Children&#146;s Hearings to fast-track persistent offenders under 16.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>2. A Youth Courts feasibility project for persistent offenders aged 16 and 17, with flexibility to deal with 15-year-olds.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>3. Reviewing the scope for using Restriction of Liberty Orders, Anti Social Behaviour Orders and Community Service Orders for persistent offenders.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>To promote community safety and order: youth </strong>disorder blights our communities. We need a range of ways to deal with disorder and offending in the community. This will include:</p>

  <p><strong>4. A Safer Scotland police campaign on high visibility policing, covering Youth Disorder, to increase visibility and provide community re-assurance.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>5. Spread best practice, and establish firm standards, for community based projects funded through the Action Programme, Better Neighbourhood Services Fund programmes and Making Communities Safer programmes.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>6. Consideration of a Scottish wide application of a system of police warnings, and a detailed exploration of restorative cautions approach, perhaps through piloting. </strong></p>

  <p><strong>7. Re-configuring the secure accommodation available nationally to provide groups of girl-only accommodation, further consideration of additional places and improving the range and provision of programmes in secure units. </strong></p>

  <p><strong>To promote the effectiveness of the system:<em> </em></strong>While many aspects of the youth justice system are working well, there are some key pressures which must be addressed:</p>

  <p><strong>8. A set of national standards to operate between local authorities, the criminal justice system and Children&#146;s Hearings, covering reporting, timescales and follow up.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>9. Promote parental responsibility, through voluntary measures and in the longer term to consider the feasibility of introducing further statutory obligations on parents.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>10. Measures to increase the speed of referral to the courts will be considered, and introduction of specific targets discussed with the judiciary.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>The report and statement has been placed in the Parliament's Reference Centre.</strong></p>
