  <p>Children are referred to the Children&rsquo;s Reporter on the basis of grounds contained within section 52 of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995, for example parental neglect, not on the factors which underlie the referral. Data on parental substance abuse is therefore not collated centrally.</p>

  <p>However, among other publications a Scottish Children&rsquo;s Reporter Administration (SCRA) research report <em>On the Right Track</em> contains information on the characteristics of parents of children involved in the Fast Track hearings pilot (Bib. number 36165). Another SCRA Research report <em>Social Backgrounds of Children Referred to the Reporter</em> looked at the social background of 100 children&rsquo;s files from Glasgow, Inverclyde and Aberdeenshire. That report found that within these files 39% demonstrated parental problem alcohol abuse, while 35% contained evidence of parental misuse of drugs. A copy of the report is available from the SCRA website: <a href="http://www.scra.gov.uk" target="_blank">http://www.scra.gov.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>The Organic Aid Scheme, which is an accompanying measure to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), encourages the development of organic farming. In 2004, the Scottish Executive increased the payment rates available to farmers under this scheme for converting to organic farming and extended the scheme to include payments to help farmers to maintain their organic farming systems after the initial five-year conversion period.</p>

  <p>The Single Farm Payment scheme will assist organic farmers by permitting organic crops to be grown on set-aside land without loss of premium; also organic farmers will benefit like other producers from the new flexibilities flowing from CAP reform. In addition, the new Land Management Contract Menu scheme has an express provision to support the costs of membership of organic schemes.</p>

  <p>Local authorities have a duty under the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 to assess the needs of, and provide appropriate services to, people in their area who appear to need them. They are responsible for arranging services to meet the needs of the population in their areas and for deciding how their resources should be spread out to best meet local needs and priorities.</p>

  <p>Ultimately it is for Highland Council to decide whether or not to help facilitate the establishment of a day care centre for Canisbay and Dunnet in Caithness.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive when the new computer system to replace the current criminal history system database, originally due for implementation in March 2004, will now be introduced; what the original estimated costs were and what the current estimated costs are for the system, and what additional functionality will be provided which was not in the original system specification.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-04-22.S2W-15561.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80053" speakername="Cathy Jamieson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa0422.htm#9">

  <p>The criminal history system (CHS) is the central record of people convicted of an offence in Scotland and forms an important part of the criminal justice system. It is used by the police and other law enforcement agencies and by the courts and other criminal justice partners in day to day operations and it supports Disclosure Scotland checks.</p>

  <p>The CHS replacement project is being undertaken by the Scottish Police Information Strategy (SPIS) working in liaison with the Scottish Criminal Record Office (SCRO) who maintain and house the database. Since the work was progressed in-house by SPIS a separate budget was not defined.</p>

  <p>The project was expected to be completed in March 2004. This was not achieved and some consultancy work was undertaken to examine the adequacy of the software and hardware supporting the replacement project. Although the output from these consultancy projects was reassuring, the replacement project continued to be delayed. In January 2005 and following a competitive tendering exercise, further consultancy was commissioned to develop a plan which identified key outputs and milestones for the successful delivery of the CHS replacement project including an informed assessment of the required human, financial and physical resources necessary to implement the plan. The consultancy report was delivered in April 2005.</p>

  <p>The consultants concluded that whilst a significant proportion of the required functionality of the current CHS system exists in the replacement system, too little attention has been paid to performance requirements and that this aspect of the project will be urgently addressed. The consultants recommend that roles and responsibilities of those involved in the project should be sharpened and that fresh project management would be beneficial.</p>

  <p>The consultants identified an early three to four month phase of work which includes mobilising new project management input, clarifying the specification for functional and performance requirements at the point at which the replacement system will become operational, and undertaking some performance testing. The output from this early phase of work will be a revised project initiation document. They estimate that there will then be around nine months work to deliver the first phase of the replacement project which will achieve a &lsquo;like for like&rsquo; replacement for the current CHS system. In addition to existing SPIS and SCRO resources, the consultants estimate that around &pound;1.3 million of additional resource will be required to achieve this.</p>

  <p>A further phase of work will then be required to improve the user interface, introduce enhancements to the database in line with demands from the police and wider criminal justice community, and to improve the technical architecture of the database. The consultants estimate that this will take in the order of a further 12 months and around &pound;2 million.</p>

  <p>As a contingency plan and to guard against any risks with respect to performance specification, the consultants recommend that preparations are undertaken for a procurement exercise for a replacement criminal history system. The expectation is that this will be stood down once the revised project initiation document is developed.</p>

  <p>The Common Police Services Programme Board, which exercises strategic governance of SCRO and SPIS, considered the consultant&rsquo;s report on 12 April 2005 and accepted the recommendations as set out above.</p>

  <p>Whilst it is disappointing that a project which was due to deliver in March 2004 will not deliver until March 2006, it is more important that we get this key project right than we get it quickly.

In addition to several indicators distributing money to rural authorities within the settlement, island and rural authorities also receive a Special Islands Needs Allowance.

The Scottish Executive&rsquo;s statistics related to the public sector are calculated using the Labour Force Survey, which is carried out by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This survey does not include a specific question about the reasons for absence from work and therefore any information on stress related illness from the survey is not comparable.</p>

  <p>The number of sick absence days in the Scottish Executive since 1999 is provided in table A. These figures represent the actual number of sickness absence days reported by staff.</p>

  <p>Table B provides information held by the Scottish Executive about sickness absence in the public sector. However, the information has not been compiled on a comparable basis as that for the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s staff. The public sector sickness absence figure has been obtained from the Labour Force Survey, which is carried out by the Office for National Statistics. The survey is based on a one week period when respondents are asked to identify any days when they were absent from work due to illness. The number of sickness absence days is then aggregated up to a yearly total and divided by the number of employees to provide an average number of sickness absence days per employee. Statistics for the Scottish public sector are only available for the period 2001-03.</p>

  <p>I announced at the time of the Queen&rsquo;s Speech that, subject to the Parliament&rsquo;s consent through a Sewel motion, it was anticipated that ten bills could offer opportunities for making useful provision on matters within the legislative competence of the Parliament and on matters relating to the functions of the Scottish ministers. Subsequently, Malcolm Chisholm wrote to the Equal Opportunities Committee to advise that opportunities had also been identified in the Equality Bill. The position reached in relation to these 11 bills is as follows:</p>

  <p>Animal Welfare Bill was not introduced prior to the dissolution of the Westminster Parliament.</p>

  <p>Constitutional Reform Bill received Royal Assent on 24 March and includes the provisions for which the Parliament gave consent on 19 January.</p>

  <p>Disability Discrimination Bill received Royal Assent on 7 April and includes the provisions for which the Parliament gave consent on 24 February.</p>

  <p>Equality Bill fell with the dissolution of the Westminster Parliament.</p>

  <p>European Union Bill fell with the dissolution of the Westminster Parliament.</p>

  <p>Gambling Bill received Royal Assent on 7 April and includes the provisions for which the Parliament gave consent on 12 January.</p>

  <p>Inquiries Bill received Royal Assent on 7 April and includes the provisions for which the Parliament gave consent on 3 February.</p>

  <p>International Organisations Bill received Royal Assent on 7 April and includes the provisions for which the Parliament gave consent on 23 February.</p>

  <p>National Lottery Bill fell with the dissolution of the Westminster Parliament.</p>

  <p>Railways Bill received Royal Assent on 7 April and includes the provisions for which the Parliament gave consent on 26 January.</p>

  <p>Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill received Royal Assent on 7 April and includes the provisions for which the Parliament gave consent on 2 February.</p>

  <p>In February this year I set out the Executive&rsquo;s sustainable objectives for the water industry in Scotland towards achieving the maximum affordable improvement in public health and environmental protection. We are now examining Scottish Water&rsquo;s business plan aimed at delivering these objectives for 2006-10. Public health is paramount and education plays a vital part in putting across the message. Scottish Water and its predecessor authorities have actively pursued measures aimed at bringing awareness of best practice to the public. Scottish Water&rsquo;s website education pages offer easily accessible, and engaging, interactive modules for pupils with teacher support material, and these, together with a series of campaigns such as the &quot;Water for Life Roadshow&quot; demonstrate our determination to pursue an integrated approach to sustainability.
