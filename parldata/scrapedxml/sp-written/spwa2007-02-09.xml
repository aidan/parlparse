  <p>The Executive and local authorities are working hard to find alternative providers for services, where possible, to reduce the impact of the liquidation of One Plus.

  <p>The responsibilities of the Ministry of Defence are reserved to the UK Government and so no Barnett consequentials come to the Scottish Executive as a result of allocating resources to defence.</p>

  <p>Only if the UK government reallocated resources to another UK Department, to be spent on functions with a devolved comparator, would any additional resources come to Scotland. It would be misleading to suggest that there would be any automatic additional resources available to the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive on how many occasions Scottish ministers attending European Council meetings have had to listen to proceedings from the &quot;salle d&rsquo;&eacute;coute&quot; and have not been seated in the council meeting room and on which occasions this has occurred.</p>

  <p>In the interest of good governance and transparency, I include a literal translation of &quot;salle d&rsquo;&eacute;coute&quot; to aid understanding for members of the public. &quot;Salle d&rsquo;&eacute;coute&quot; means &quot;listening room&quot;.</p>

  <p>In 2006 Scottish ministers attended ten European Union Council of Ministers meetings. No minister was obliged to listen to proceedings from the listening room at any of these meetings. Attendance at European Union Council of Ministers meetings provides a valuable opportunity for Executive ministers to network with other ministers and Commission officials. Such networking occurs both inside and outside the formal Council negotiating room.</p>

  <p>As at the end of January 2007, the total amount held back from trade contractors involved in the construction of the Parliament is circa &pound;4 million, which amounts to just under 1% of the projected final cost of the building. The SPCB has no direct contractual arrangements with sub-contractors. There are 27 trade contracts out of 60 with some form of payment still to be made. Some &pound;425,000 remains to be paid to the seven companies which are Scottish based. Final payments to trade contractors will continue to be made when the client considers that conditions for doing so have been met. Most are expected to be released by the end of March 2007.</p>
