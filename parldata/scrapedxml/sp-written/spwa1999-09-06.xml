  <p>An additional &pound;115.7 million over 5 years was announced in the July 1997 Budget. Following the Comprehensive Spending Review, additional expenditure of &pound;185 million on school buildings is expected under the local authority capital allocation arrangements over the 3 years from April 1999. These amounts will be complemented by Public private partnership schemes in 9 authorities amounting to &pound;400 million announced in November 1998.</p>

  <p>When the Comprehensive Spending Review settlement for the FE sector was announced last year, one of the main objectives of the extra &pound;214 million for the current and the next two financial years was to improve the sector&#146;s financial stability.</p>

  <p>More than 98% of the increased funds available for the FE sector in the current financial year were allocated by the Secretary of State for Scotland before the Scottish Further Education Funding Council took over funding responsibilities on 1 July 1999. The Council has at its disposal for the remainder of the financial year three &pound;1 million Funds for New Areas, Innovations and Ventures, and Collaboration and Rationalisation, plus a small contingency reserve.</p>

  <p>Source of data is the National Audit Office Report &quot;Scottish Further Education Colleges: Managing Costs&quot; published in June 1999. Data shown is from annual accounts, except for 1998-1999, which is based on colleges&#146; forecast figures. &#145;Overall deficit&#146; is total income less total expenditure, including depreciation on the value of property inherited at nil cost on incorporation and exceptional restructuring costs. In 1993-1994, not all colleges included depreciation on the value of inherited property.</p>

  <p>Support for the FE sector over the next three years</p>

  <p>&pound;329 million is available for the FE sector in 1999-2000. Planned levels of funding in support of the FE sector are &pound;358 million in 2000-2001, and &pound;394 million in 2001 &#150;2002.</p>

  <p>Employment policy is reserved to the UK Government. The Department for Education and Employment, along with the Department of Social Security for some programmes, takes the lead on funding and delivery of the New Deal. In Scotland it does this in partnership with the Scottish Executive and contributing Scottish organisations.</p>

  <p>The expenditure on each New Deal programme other than the New Deal for Young People in Scotland from April 1998 to July 1999 was:</p>

  <p>(a) New Deal 50 plus: Programme not yet commenced. Pathfinders due to start in October 1999.</p>

  <p>(b) New Deal 25 plus: &pound;5.6m</p>

  <p>(c) New Deal for Partners of Unemployed People: &pound;0.05m</p>

  <p>(d) New Deal for Disabled People: &pound;0.3m</p>

  <p>(e) New Deal for Lone Parents: &pound;2.3m</p>

  <p>The figure for New Deal 25 plus includes spending on employment subsidies. The other New Deal programmes listed do not offer an employment subsidy, but the figures given include various other allowance payments.</p>

  <p>In addition, there are central running and marketing costs for each programme which have not been included in these figures.</p>

  <p>Employment Policy is reserved to the UK Government which therefore takes the lead on the funding and delivery of the New Deal throughout Great Britain, although in close consultation with its partners, including the Scottish Executive. Many partner organisations at local level also provide New Deal services under contract or provide funds and other resources, including training funds to enhance the quality of new Deal in their areas. The public and voluntary sector organisations which contribute to the New Deal in this way fall within the remit of the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>Information on the number of employers who have taken on New Deal recruits is not available.</p>

  <p>There is a range of New Deal vacancies for suitable young people, to offer them a choice. At the same time, a number of measures are being tested. These include the intensification of the Gateway, in order to make New Deal clients more attractive to prospective employers.</p>

  <p>The performance of the New Deal for Young People is measured in each Unit of Delivery by 9 Core Performance Measures. These are as follows:-</p>

  <p>The number of New Deal participants and the proportion of each cohort moving into</p>

  <p>i) unsubsidised jobs, ii) subsidised jobs and iii) all jobs;</p>

  <p>The number of participants and the proportion of each monthly cohort moving from the Gateway and each of the options into unsubsidised jobs;</p>

  <p>The unit costs of the outcomes covered in 1 and 2 above;</p>

  <p>The number of participants and the proportion of each monthly cohort remaining in jobs 13 weeks, 6, 12 or 18 months after leaving New Deal, as measured by the renewal or otherwise of claims for JSA and other benefits;</p>

  <p>The numbers and proportions of participants who are disabled, from ethnic minority backgrounds and who are men and women achieving the outcomes in 1, 2 and 4 above;</p>

  <p>The numbers of subsidised jobs made available by employers and the level of employer satisfaction;</p>

  <p>The level of satisfaction among participating young people;</p>

  <p>The number and level of qualifications achieved by New Deal participants; and</p>

  <p>The number of participants and the proportion of each monthly cohort leaving the New Deal for known destinations.</p>

  <p>In addition to these measures a comprehensive programme of evaluation is underway. The other New Deal programmes are assessed in similar ways.</p>

  <p>The Employment Service Research and Development database is client-based and will not track whether a person&#146;s employment is the same or if they have moved to a different employer. The database can only track New Deal clients returning to Jobseekers&#146; Allowance/New Deal. Figures to the end of June 1999 show that, a total of 10,120 people had secured sustained employment through New Deal. A sustained job is one from which the participant does not return to claim benefit, or transfer to another option, within 13 weeks. This includes those who have been in employment for less than 13 weeks, but who have not yet returned to JSA.</p>

  <p>No. <strong> </strong> Further consideration <strong> </strong> will be given to existing planning advice when the outcome of the research is known <strong>. </strong> NPPG 16 was published in March 1999. It introduced a robust new framework for the control of opencast coal mining and is intended to ensure that full weight is given to the effects of mining on local communities and the environment <strong>. </strong> The guidance confirmed that the research was under way and that further consideration would be given to existing planning advice when the outcome of the research is known. In the meantime, the industry and planning authorities were asked to adopt a cautious approach and ensure that proposals and developments do not result in an unacceptable level of airborne dust. The Scottish executive will do likewise in considering cases that come before it.</p>

  <p>Suicide is a complex phenomenon influenced by a wide range of social, cultural, psychological, economic and other factors. The White Paper confirms that mental health is one of the top 3 priorities for the NHS in Scotland, and as is well known, some individuals (although by no means all) who commit suicide have been suffering from mental illness.</p>

  <p>The White Paper also emphasises that improving life circumstances &#150; poverty, unemployment, bad housing etc &#150; will have a beneficial effect on people&#146;s mental health and sense of well-being; healthier lifestyles, too, contribute to better mental health. The thrust of the White Paper should lead to improvements in mental health and, therefore, to reductions in the suicide rate.</p>

  <p>We have a range of initiatives, which are designed to tackle some of the factors, which can contribute to suicide. For example, as part of our policy to encourage social inclusion, we have announced the funding of numerous social inclusion partnerships around Scotland. The Framework for Mental Health Services in Scotland remains the basis for Health Boards, together with their planning and commissioning partners, to provide appropriate mental health services locally.</p>

  <p>In addition, legislation has been introduced governing the pack sizes of some paracetamol and aspirin products available over the counter, following evidence that many people who intentionally overdose use products that are readily available in their homes. The new measures are designed so that customers can still have easy access and sufficient quantities to treat short episodes of minor illness without leaving large residual amounts in the home.</p>

  <p>We are also funding a National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Homicide by People with Mental Illness. The study is examining health records of all individuals who committed suicide or homicide and had been in contact with mental health services in the period leading up to the suicide or homicide. The aim is to identify common patterns of behaviour, symptoms etc, and to use this information to provide guidance to medical practitioners to enable them to identify at an early stage symptoms which indicate that an individual&#146;s mental state has the potential to lead to their committing suicide or homicide. Early identification may lead to timely intervention and diagnosis, and it is hoped that this may result in a reduction in the rates of suicide and homicide.</p>

  <p>Further, the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) has had a Suicide Prevention Strategy in place for some years, with a revised strategy introduced as recently as 1998. Key features include reducing isolation to a minimum, providing a safe social environment and engaging families in the care process.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive why survival rates for patients admitted following a stroke are significantly lower at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, Queen Margaret Hospital in Dunfermline and Kirkcaldy Acute Hospital Trust than the Scottish average, to provide an explanation for the wide variation in survival rates in such cases across Scotland, and what plans it has to improve survival rates in such cases across all Scottish hospitals, particularly those with the lowest survival rates.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/1999-09-06.S1W-1056.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80146" speakername="Susan Deacon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-99/wa0906.htm#539">

  <p>The section on stroke in the most recent Clinical Outcome Indicators report, published on 23 August 1999, shows that survival rates in the 3 Trusts referred to appear to be significantly lower than the Scottish average.</p>

  <p>It is important to emphasise that outcome indicators are not intended to be used as &#145;league tables&#146;. As the report itself stresses, no direct conclusions should be drawn from any of the comparisons in this report about the quality or effectiveness of the services or treatment provided for patients of different Trusts or populations of different Health Boards. Such differences may exist, but they cannot be identified solely on the basis of these comparisons. The outcome indicator reports should rather be seen as part of a range of initiatives geared to the creation of a more quality-oriented and patient-centred NHS in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The most likely explanation of any variations will be case mix (i.e. how ill the patients were then they were admitted), but this cannot be confirmed without further detailed analysis, which is the responsibility of the Trusts and Health Boards concerned. Both Boards, in conjunction with the Trusts concerned, are specifically investigating the stroke survival variations shown by the latest Clinical Outcome Indicators report. This gives added impetus to the work already being undertaken by these and all other local health services to translate into local practice the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) guidelines on the management of patients who have had a stroke. In addition, both Boards are also investing in stroke services. In Lothian, &pound;350 000 is being made available to develop an 11 bed stroke unit at St John&#146;s, while in Fife, &pound;86 000 will be invested to provide a dedicated stroke rehabilitation unit at Cameron Hospital.</p>

  <p>In future, one of the roles of the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland will be to oversee the development and monitoring of standards for specific services, and it is in that context that the clinical outcomes indictors are likely to be of greatest value.</p>

  <p>A breakdown of sitting days as between summary and solemn business at each court is also included. This does not sum to the total sitting days because the courts also sit on civil business.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive provides financial aid to the national office of Scottish Women&#146;s Aid through grants under sections 9 and 10 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 and section 197 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987.</p>

  <p>The funding of local Women&#146;s Aid groups is a matter for local authorities to decide. In the financial year 1998-99 Scottish Women&#146;s Aid was, however, awarded a one-off grant of &pound;150,000 to assist with the increased demand on Women&#146;s Aid services arising from the national campaign to raise awareness about domestic violence. I understand that Scottish Women&#146;s Aid decided to divide this grant equally between the national office and the 38 affiliated local groups.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no plans at present to disburse funds directly to local Women&#146;s Aid groups, but we are concerned about the welfare of all of those who are the victims of domestic violence.
