  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-15511 by Shona Robison on 5 September 2008, whether the Adults with Incapacity Act 2000 recognises the confused state of a person before, during and after an epileptic seizure as an impairment to that individual&rsquo;s capacity to make decisions.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-10-28.S3W-16866.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80379" speakername="Shona Robison" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa1028.htm#1">

  <p>The purpose of the Adults with Incapacity Act 2000 is to provide for decisions to be made on behalf of adults who lack legal capacity to do so themselves because of mental disorder or inability to communicate. The decisions concerned may be about the adult&rsquo;s property or financial affairs, or about their personal welfare, including medical treatment.</p>

  <p>The act describes incapable as an individual who is incapable of:</p>

  <p>(a) acting, or</p>

  <p>(b) making decisions, or</p>

  <p>(c) communicating decisions, or</p>

  <p>(d) understanding decisions, or</p>

  <p>(e) retaining the memory of decisions,</p>

  <p>by reason of mental disorder or of inability to communicate because of physical disability. It states that incapacity will be construed accordingly.</p>

  <p>The definition of incapacity will, on occasions, apply to patients who experience seizures. It should, however, be noted that in the majority of cases normal cognitive functioning returns in a short period of time, often in a matter of minutes. In such cases the important issue for ambulance crews is consent to treatment and the patient&rsquo;s ability to make decisions independently.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service staff follows the Joint Royal Colleges Ambulance Liaisons Committee (JRCALC) UK Ambulance Service Clinical Practice Guidelines 2006. These can be found via the following link:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/med/research/hsri/emergencycare/prehospitalcare/jrcalcstakeholderwebsite/guidelines" target="_blank">http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/med/research/hsri/emergencycare/prehospitalcare/jrcalcstakeholderwebsite/guidelines</a>.</p>

  <p>If a patient is unable to give informed consent and is deemed incapable of understanding the implications of refusing treatment, then ambulance staff should act in the patient&rsquo;s best interests and take whatever action is necessary to safeguard life and prevent or reduce further harm. However, it must be emphasised that if a patient is able to understand the implications of treatment refusal they have the right to refuse the offer of treatment.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-15515 by Shona Robison on 3 September 2008, whether it will provide specific details about the special arrangements for cases where medazalan has been prescribed for patients who have experienced an epileptic seizure.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-10-28.S3W-16869.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80379" speakername="Shona Robison" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa1028.htm#1">

  <p>Special arrangements are currently in place whereby paramedics can administer Midazolam <sup>1</sup> to specific named patients under the instruction of that patient&rsquo;s consultant.</p>

  <p>However, the Scottish Ambulance Service is in the process of approving a National Patient Group Direction (PGD)<sup>2</sup> for the buccal administration of Midazolam to patients in Status Epilepticus<sup>3</sup> by registered paramedics. It is anticipated that this will be introduced into practice before the end of the year. This will help ensure that where emergency treatment of Status Epilepticus is required and an ambulance has been called to attend, registered paramedics can treat the patient at the scene. Once treated, the patient will be taken to the nearest appropriate receiving unit .</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Midazolam is a Schedule 3 controlled drug used for the emergency treatment of status epilepticus (unlicensed indication), and can be included in a PGD provided a licensed medicinal product is used. Midazolam is the only Schedule 3 controlled drug that can be included in a PGD.</p>

  <p>2. A PGD is a written direction relating to the sale/supply and/or administration of a Prescription Only Medicine (POM), to persons generally, subject to specified exclusions) and is signed by a doctor/dentist, and by a pharmacist.</p>

  <p>3. Extract from SIGN clinical guideline no.70. &quot;Status Epilepticus has been defined as a condition in which &quot;epileptic activity persists for 30 minutes or more, causing a wide spectrum of clinical symptoms.&quot; Emergency treatment should be sought or given by carers of people with epilepsy once a seizure has persisted, or there are serial seizures, for more than five minutes. Generalised tonic-clonic status epilepticus is a medical emergency with significant morbidity and mortality, which can often be attributed to inadequate or delayed treatment.&quot;</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-15516 by Shona Robison on 3 September 2008, what the Scottish Ambulance Service considers to be the three most common types of epilepsy.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the revised answer to question S3W-15516 on 3 September 2008. The three most common types of convulsion covered in ambulance service training are grand mal seizures, status epilepticus and infantile convulsions.</p>

  <p>It is important to explain that the Scottish Ambulance Service trains its staff based on presenting complaints and symptoms rather than in disease specific format. For example, the commonest form of epilepsy, grand mal, is incorporated within training on the assessment, management and treatment of convulsions. While epilepsy is the major cause of this clinical presentation there are a number of other conditions that can trigger convulsions.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-15517 by Shona Robison on 3 September 2008, whether it will provide more specific details about the basic training and the training in the administration of specific medicines that Scottish Ambulance Service paramedics receive.</p>

  <p>Scottish Paramedics are trained to the UK-wide standard syllabus as provided by the Institute of Health Care Development and the Standards of Proficiency as laid down by the Health Professions Council. Management standards are set by the Joint Royal College Ambulance Liaison Committee which has UK-wide ambulance and medical representation including the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Paediatricians.</p>

  <p>In order to register as a paramedic staff must have completed a minimum of 18 months technician training, although in practice this is often nearer two years. During this time, and in relation to epilepsy, they will learn about the anatomy and physiology of the nervous system and about major and minor seizures and how to manage them.</p>

  <p>The technician period is consolidated by a 12 month period of clinical practice on an ambulance before returning to paramedic training. During this period students will further study anatomy and physiology and disorders of the nervous system, extend their knowledge of see and treat procedures and undergo training in drugs licensed for use in the UK by paramedics. This list includes rectal diazepam and intravenous diazemuls for the management of active seizures. The indications for the use of these medicines is clearly defined in the JRCALC Clinical Practice Guidelines and all staff have access to these both in hard copy and via the electronic patient report form. Classroom training is further enhanced by placement in accident and emergency departments and in hospital theatres where students will experience the management of unconscious patients.</p>

  <p>However, the SAS recruits and trains to allow for traditional accident and emergency ambulances to be staffed by a paramedic and a technician.

  <p>The Sea Eagle Project partners, comprising Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and latterly the Forestry Commission Scotland for the east coast undertake annual monitoring of sea eagle breeding performance which also includes an assessment of sea eagle diet across a number of accessible nests. This work has allowed the partners to build up a picture of sea eagle diet across the current range of sea eagles over the last 10 years.</p>

  <p>SNH will be commissioning additional research work on sea eagle diet in 2009, with representatives from the RSPB and the Scottish Crofting Foundation on the steering group overseeing the study. This work will look at particular aspects of sea eagle diet and livestock health, in particular the extent to which sea eagles predate livestock and the general health of lambs taken as live prey or as carrion. The research will have its focus on Gairloch and the surrounding area but further work is also planned for the Western Isles in a separate project. In addition, continuing effort will be made to recover prey items from nests across the breeding range.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government contributed 10% (&pound;11,000 in 2008-09) to the costs of &quot;SunSmart&quot; which is commissioned by Health Departments across the UK and run by Cancer Research. SunSmart is a generic skin cancer prevention campaign which aims to raise awareness around the causes of skin cancer and includes information on the health risks associated with sunbed use.</p>

  <p>Campaign activities are evaluated by Cancer Research UK on an on-going basis and a full evaluation report of all activities sent to UK health departments. Figures from a yearly survey commissioned by Cancer Research UK from the Office for National Statistics show an increase in knowledge that using sunbeds increases the risk of skin cancer from 71% in 2003 to 81% in 2005. Further studies have been carried out in 2007 and 2008 but we are awaiting verification of the results.</p>

  <p>Following the passage of the Public Health etc (Scotland) act 2008 the Scottish Government will refocus its activity to carry out an awareness raising campaign to accompany the act&rsquo;s provisions on sunbeds when they come into effect in 2009. The sunbed provisions in the Act will ban the use, sale and hire of sunbeds to under 18s, ban unsupervised use and introduce a requirement for sunbed operators to give their clients detailed information on the health risks associated with sunbed use. The campaign will be targeted at sunbed users and all known sunbed operators in Scotland. It is envisaged that the campaign will include the distribution of leaflets and posters and that information and materials will be available to download free of charge from the Scottish Government website. The estimated cost of the campaign is in the region of &pound;50,000.</p>

  <p>The final form of the campaign has not been decided. Therefore no impact assessment has been designed at this stage although the campaign will be evaluated and impact assessed following its delivery.</p>

  <p>I recognise the difficulties young carers&rsquo; projects experience in securing core funding. We will examine ways of supporting local young carers projects to access sustainable funding as we develop proposals for the young carers section of the revised Carers Strategy next year.</p>

  <p>As the member is aware, the funding of specific local services, including young carer projects, is at the discretion of individual local authorities. By exercising this local discretion in the planning and delivery of services, local authorities and their partners can ensure best use of their available resources.</p>

  <p>To enable local authorities to continue to develop their services, the Scottish Government is providing local government in Scotland with record levels of funding over the period covered by the spending review 2008-11. The vast majority of funding, including funding for young carers services, is provided by means of a block grant. It is the responsibility of each local authority to allocate the total financial resources available to it, on the basis of local needs and priorities.</p>

  <p>The member may also wish to note that we have provided an additional &pound;4 million over the next two years &ndash; on top of the total settlement to local government - to enable local authorities to deliver in full the concordat commitment of an additional 10,000 respite weeks a year by 2010-11.</p>

  <p>In addition to the funding available to local authorities, the Scottish Government has provided resources rising to &pound;5 million per year for the NHS to implement local Carer Information Strategies. These strategies should include measures to identify and support young carers. We have urged boards to use this funding to prioritise front line services for carers and to deliver carer information and training through local carers&rsquo; centres, where they exist.</p>

  <p>The principal scheme for supporting households to undertake energy efficiency improvements is the Carbon Emission Reduction Target (CERT), which places an obligation on the major energy supply companies to help households by providing subsidies for energy efficiency measures such as cavity wall and loft insulation, appliances and light bulbs.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has recently established a Scottish CERT Strategy Steering Group, chaired by Stewart Maxwell MSP, and working in partnership with the energy suppliers to ensure better delivery of CERT in Scotland.</p>

  <p>We have secured the commitment of the energy companies in principle to funding Scotland&rsquo;s share of the CERT. This could be worth at least &pound;107 million each year for home energy efficiency improvements and savings of &pound;83 million each year in household fuel bills.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers meet individually with the energy companies on a regular basis and are due to meet with a number of energy companies over the coming month.</p>

The Budget Bill 2007 was scrutinised by the Parliament and its committees, and expenditure is reported on in a range of ways, for example in the Draft Budget, for 2009-10, reports to parliamentary subject committees and press releases. Individual spending decisions on particular issues within portfolios etc are taken by portfolio ministers within the overall context agreed by the Cabinet and set out in the Budget Act, with First Minister and other ministerial colleagues involved as appropriate, for example where cross-portfolio issues are involved. It would be impractical in terms of cost and time to attempt to identify every decision with spending implications in which the First Minister has been involved since May 2007.</p>

  <p>A range of evaluations are underway or planned in support of Healthy Eating, Active Living: an action plan to improve diet, increase physical activity and tackle obesity. For example, the HEAT target &quot;tackling childhood obesity&quot; is a developmental target and will be reviewed after its first year. The requirement for the monitoring and evaluation of the interventions being delivered by each health board is currently being determined. Counterweight has evaluation component built into the contract which provides the Scottish Government and health boards with regular progress reports including preliminary results of patient interventions, clinical outcomes, health economics and qualitative research.</p>

  <p>The Chief Scientist Office (CSO), of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Health Directorates, has responsibility for encouraging and supporting research into health and health care needs in Scotland. The CSO is currently funding 12 research trials involving medicines at a cost of &pound;2.7 million. Funds of &pound;5.9 million have also been allocated to the NHS in Scotland this year to support an increase in clinical research and to fund research networks. Of this, some &pound;324,000 has been allocated to the two experimental cancer medicine centres in Glasgow and Edinburgh and &pound;325,000 for the medicines for children research network. More generally, the CSO allocates &pound;38 million to the NHS to meet the additional costs of supporting research funded by major research funders such as the Medical Research Council and Wellcome Trust. Some of this research will also involve trials of medicinal products.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Government and Scottish Enterprise have in the last five years allocated through a range of investments and grants approximately &pound;35 million towards projects involving investment or development in drug discovery.</p>

  <p>Our published standards for integrated care for those with depression underline the importance of early assessment and interventions for successful planning and care. GPs are using validated assessment tools for patients with a new diagnosis of depression repeated at regular intervals to monitor progress and outcome.</p>

  <p>The GP contract also provides additional resources for objective assessments and provision of information on suitable interventions including self help, life style advice and other interventions. Pharmacists also advise on mental health and wellbeing issues.</p>

  <p>Our national and local public health and anti-stigma campaigns also encourage earlier presentations and fits with other initiatives including the Breathing Space national telephone advice and signposting service for those experiencing low mood, depression or anxiety.</p>

  <p>As announced in the summer, we are also considering the extent to which mental health services could be brought into the 18 weeks waiting time target. In most cases those requiring urgent access to mental health services already receive treatment well within 18 weeks but we are committed to further addressing delays where these occur. Our initial considerations will be completed shortly.</p>

  <p>NHS Scotland and the Scottish Government support a comprehensive recovery-orientated approach to the provision of care, treatment and support for mental health patients, and their carers, as part of continuing joint working to improve mental health services in line with published targets and commitments.</p>

  <p>In line with one of our key published commitments the Scottish Recovery Indicator (SRI) has been developed to ensure that services are recovery-orientated and socially inclusive. A broadly positive independent evaluation report on the piloting of the SRI, in five NHS board areas: Greater Glasgow and Clyde; Forth Valley; Ayrshire and Arran; Tayside, and Grampian, was published on 24 October 2008.</p>

  <p>The SRI is being improved, in line with recommendations within the evaluation, with the Scottish Recovery Network undertaking actions on our behalf, working with practitioners and service users from the five pilot sites to improve the SRI. The SRI will be available for general use by 2010 in line with our published commitment.</p>

  <p>No specific research has, or is currently, being undertaken to determine the availability of advocacy services for mental health patients.</p>

  <p>However, the University of Stirling was commissioned to carry out research into the named person role and to consider its interaction with other forms of patient representation under the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 as part of its research programme into the operation of the new act. The study explored the named person role from the perspective of a range of stakeholders and made recommendations for the development of patient representation. A final draft of this work has now been received and a report and research findings will be published in due course.</p>

  <p>The Mental Welfare Commission has a programme of scheduled visits to mental health and learning disability services. Though these visits do not constitute research done to determine the availability of advocacy services for mental health patients, this is one of the elements that they examine. The commission&rsquo;s findings are summarised in their annual reports from 2005-06 onwards.</p>

  <p>A consistent approach to grading across Scotland is being taken by the Care Commission. The National Care Standards and the requirements in the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001 provide a national framework for the regulation of care services.

  <p>The Care Commission regulates for improvement. Services which do not meet the National Care Standards and receive a lower grade will be expected to improve. The commission has a wide range of powers available to it under the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001 which it uses in a proportionate and incremental way.

  <p>The Care Commission places all care service inspection reports and grades on its website. The grading system was introduced on 1 April 2008, with all care services being graded at their first inspection after that date.</p>

  <p>There is an expectation that care services will make their inspection reports, which includes the grades, available to care service users and their carers. It is also expected that a copy of the latest inspection report be displayed within the service.</p>

  <p>Reports of integrated inspections by the Care Commission and HMIe are published and copies sent to the services to be distributed to parents, staff and other stakeholders. The reports are placed on the HMIe website and linked to the Care Commission website for access by any interested party.</p>

  <p>The National Care Standards set out what people using care services can expect from the provider. We have been running an awareness campaign about the National Care Standards since 30 June and we are looking at ways to extend this in Spring 2009. The standards are available online at</p>

  <p>Untreated genital chlamydia infection in women can result in pelvic pain and scarring known as Pelvic Inflammatory Disease which can progress to ectopic pregnancy and infertility.</p>

  <p>There is also some evidence to suggest that untreated genital chlamydia infection in men can affect fertility.</p>

  <p>The Guidance from the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Health states that women with risk factors for chlamydia should be routinely screened. Clinicians who provide contraceptive coils are required to follow this guidance and will routinely discuss risk factors with their patients and offer testing for chlamydia.</p>

  <p>We join with many others in marking the 20 years since the Retired and Senior Volunteer Programme started in England. The older volunteer is a cornerstone of our communities and we warmly recognise the contribution they make. As local authorities and community planning partnerships develop the work to deliver the single outcome agreements we believe they should not overlook the contribution which volunteering, particularly by older people, can make.</p>

  <p>Organisations that support volunteering are supported across all directorates within government. The Scottish Government retrospectively publishes annual details of its direct and indirect support for third sector organisations, so full details of support during the current year are not available at this stage.</p>

  <p>In addition, direct support to volunteering infrastructure organisations is provided through the third sector division. This support is provided to the national network of volunteer centres and Volunteer Development Scotland.</p>
