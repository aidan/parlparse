  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1O-4666 by Malcolm Chisholm on 14 February 2002, whether it plans to award funding for research into the causes of autism on the same basis that funding have been awarded by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government.</p>

  <p>The Executive has no such plans. The &#163;2.5 million additional funding for research into the causes of autism, announced recently by the Minister of State at the Department of Health, was awarded to the Medical Research Council to conduct research into autism throughout the UK. The research findings, when available, will inform the policies and clinical practices of NHSScotland.</p>

  <p>Throughout Scotland, people suffering from eating disorders are diagnosed and treated by general psychiatrists. In addition, specialist services have been established in Lanarkshire, Lothian, Highland and Grampian. These services range from specialist eating disorder teams to single nurse specialist posts. Some of the specialist services are available to residents of other NHS board areas.</p>

  <p>The published guidance on the best organisation of eating disorder services invites agencies to explore all mediums that can offer improved access to services and advice.</p>

  <p>A teleconferencing link is already established between the Royal Cornhill Hospital in Aberdeen and Lerwick Health Centre, with validated positive results for patients and therapists for all conditions including eating disorders. The Grampian Eating Disorder Service has also piloted the use of teleconferencing for people with eating disorders from Aberdeen, Peterhead and Fraserburgh.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Telemedicine Action Forum has recently funded a project designed to further extend the existing specialist psychological therapies for eating disorders service to the whole of the Grampian area.</p>

  <p>More generally, the Remote and Rural Area Resource Initiative has been established to advise and help with more effective means of delivering care in rural and remote areas of Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has not commissioned any studies in connection with the River Clyde. Studies of the kind referred to in the question are matters for the riparian owners and other landowners, developers, local authorities and local bodies, not the Executive.</p>

  <p>We have, however, commissioned research into climate change impacts that may be relevant to interests on the River Clyde, the reports of which are available on the Executive&rsquo;s website: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/climatechange" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/climatechange</a> .</p>

  <p>The Executive is aware that the City of Glasgow Council is undertaking studies on flood risk associated with the River Clyde and officials are keeping in touch with developments.</p>

  <p>Regarding studies on the use of the river, various studies are being undertaken by the River Clyde Working Group (RCWG). This group was established in November 2001 after the Minister for Enterprise, Transport &amp; Lifelong Learning, convened a meeting of all public and private sector partners with an interest in regeneration of the Clyde. The RCWG studies cover the section of the Clyde between Glasgow Green and Erskine Bridge and are:</p>

  <p>a strategic benchmarking, market assessment and economic impact study;</p>

  <p>a collation of the existing technical and engineering studies;</p>

  <p>an assessment of the potential for water based transport, and</p>

  <p>an assessment of prospects for attracting European funding.</p>

  <p>The level of funding provided to the sector by the Executive has risen by 20% from &#163;551 million in 1997-98 to &#163;660 in 2001-02. This does not include additional funding allocated for newly designated institutions of UHI Millennium Institute, Open University and Bell College of Technology and additional funding for research which will take the total allocation for 2001-02 to &#163;710 million.

  <p>This does not include funding for the provision of higher education courses in further education colleges. The Scottish Further Education funding council does not allocate funds separately for higher education and further education provision.</p>

  <p>The responsibility for funding palliative care and respite care lies with NHS boards and local authorities. The Executive provides some core funding for voluntary organisations which run hospices. We have no plans to change existing arrangements.</p>

  <p>However, we are aware that the Children&rsquo;s Hospice Association Scotland (CHAS) is planning to build a second children&rsquo;s hospice in Scotland. I place a very high value on CHAS&rsquo; work at Rachel House, its existing hospice. I propose to make an award of grant to support this new development. I will make a contribution of &#163;500,000 to the capital costs of the new hospice and provide additional grant of &#163;250,000 per annum to support its first two years, when it is up and running.</p>

  <p>NHS hospitals are required to implement the guidance in the <i>Scottish Infection Manual (1998)</i> . This makes clear that:</p>

  <p>where the potential for the spread of infection may pose exceptional difficulties, hospitals should develop and adhere to appropriate infection control policies to reduce the risk to particularly vulnerable patients;</p>

  <p>suitable arrangements should be established for the admission, transfer and discharge of patients with infection, including liaison with the medical and nursing staff responsible for the care of patients during admission and after discharge or transfer, and</p>

  <p>hospitals are required to provide suitable accommodation for the clinical care of patients with healthcare associated infection.</p>

  <p>Trust chief executives are responsible for ensuring that effective arrangements for infection control are in place, including adequate clinical facilities and staff, microbiological resources, infection control teams and occupational health service.</p>

  <p>To ensure that hospitals are addressing healthcare associated infection effectively, the Executive requested the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland (CSBS) to introduce a new infection control standard. The CSBS will shortly provide an interim report on hospitals&rsquo; performance against this standard.</p>

The Scottish Executive Health Department has, however, been fully supportive of the report's recommendations and has written on two occasions, the last as recently as 7 February this year, to all NHSScotland Trusts and Island Health Boards, reminding them that they should be adopting the Accounts Commission Report recommendations when employing a bank or agency nurse.

  <p>Section 33 of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 (the 1997 act) allows a planning authority to grant planning permission for development carried out, without complying with some condition attached to the original planning permission. Where a planning permission of this sort is granted, it can take effect retrospectively from the date the development was carried out.</p>

  <p>Section 64 of the 1997 act, empowers a planning authority to vary a grant of planning permission, in circumstances where they take the view that the variation sought by the grantee is not material. It is not possible for such variation to have retrospective effect i.e. the statutory provision does not enable the variation to be effective in respect of the period prior to it being made. Under section 42 of the 1997 act, a developer may seek planning permission to develop land, without complying with conditions attached to a previous planning permission. The planning authority can refuse such an application, grant it subject to new conditions replacing those attached to the previous permission, or grant it unconditionally. Any planning permission granted under this provision cannot have retrospective effect.</p>

  <p>Section 65 of the 1997 act, allows planning authorities to promote orders modifying planning permission, where they consider it expedient to so do (i.e. not in response to a request from the developer) and where the development proposal has not been completed or the proposed change of use has not taken place. Again the relevant statutory provision precludes such orders having retrospective effect.</p>

  <p>The Executive&rsquo;s Development Department Circular 4/1998 contains guidance on the use of conditions and the mechanisms in sections 33 and 42 of the 1997 act. It is available on the Executive&rsquo;s website at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/planning" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/planning</a>.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer given to question S1W-23495 today, regarding the different procedures for amending planning permissions and the circumstances in which they apply.</p>

  <p>The procedures in relation to sections 33 and 42 of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 (the 1997 Act) involve planning applications, and the normal statutory requirements for public consultation, including neighbour notification, consultation with community councils and, where appropriate, advertising apply.</p>

  <p>In relation to the power in section 64 of the 1997 act, no planning application is required, and therefore none of the statutory consultation procedures which apply to planning applications would apply.</p>

  <p>Where the planning authority decides that it wants to promote an order under section 65 of the 1997 act, they must serve notice on the owner of the land affected, the lessee and the occupier of the land affected and any other person who in their opinion will be affected by the order. Those upon whom a notice has been served may request an opportunity to appear before, and be heard by, a person appointed by the Scottish ministers before the order is confirmed or confirmed subject to modifications.</p>

  <p>The Executive is currently engaged in a consultation exercise on public involvement in the planning system, including public consultation on planning applications. The consultation paper, entitled <i>Getting Involved in Planning</i>, is available on the Executive&rsquo;s website at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/planning" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/planning</a>. The consultation period closes on 31 March.</p>

  <p>Strathclyde Police officers do not routinely police the perimeter of Faslane Naval Base. This normally falls to the Ministry of Defence Police. Officers from Strathclyde Police are only engaged in such duties when there are large anti-nuclear demonstrations at the base.</p>

  <p>The number of Strathclyde Police officers deployed at the four major anti-nuclear demonstrations at Faslane Naval Base since the start of 2001 has not exceeded 880 officers for any one event.</p>

  <p>Deployment by the local Divisional Commander has been for the purpose of minimising disruption to naval base staff, the local community and ensuring the maintenance of public order. The level of deployment of police officers at each demonstration has been commensurate with the number of demonstrators.</p>

  <p>Our modernising agenda is about improving choice in the way services are delivered. The Scottish Executive is therefore committed to a multi-channel approach for the delivery of online public services and is continuing to explore a variety of platforms, including the use of interactive digital television, public kiosks, Personal Digital Assistants, the internet and WAP phones.</p>

  <p>As part of this, the Scottish Executive is paying close attention to the development of the Your Guide pilot project in Post Offices in Leicestershire and Rutland. Arrangements have been made for ministers and officials from the Scottish Executive to see the project first hand. The pilot will of course have to be comprehensively evaluated to assess the case for national roll out. In particular those organisations wishing to use Your Guide will need to examine carefully how a national service could fit in with their wider service delivery plans, how far it could help in achieving greater efficiencies and whether it would provide value for money compared with alternative direct channels to the public. Until these evaluations are complete, it would be premature to discuss details such as responsibility for the provision of equipment. I can assure you, however, that the Scottish Executive is examining this project and its potential implications for Scotland with great care and that we are committed to finding ways to achieve citizen-centred public service delivery.</p>

  <p>As regards progress in the delivery of online public services, the <i>Electronic Service Delivery Progress Report</i>, published on 16 November 2001, details the services provided by the Scottish Executive, its agencies and non-departmental public bodies. That report shows that 66% of services are now available online, though the majority of these relate to the provision of information. The second <i>Electronic Service Delivery Progress Report</i> is currently being prepared and will be published shortly.</p>

  <p>The Directive on Packaging Waste Directive has been implemented in Great Britain by the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 (as amended).</p>

  <p>The regulations require businesses which manufacture or use packaging materials or products, to recover and recycle certain volumes of packaging waste, calculated by the amount of packaging handled by the business. Such businesses can reduce their recovery obligation by using less packaging and by re-using packaging whenever possible. The more re-usable packaging a company uses, the less is its packaging recovery obligation and the lower are its consequent compliance costs.</p>

  <p>The main reasons detailing the reduction in the budget of the Student Awards Agency for Scotland, amounting to &#163;141.7 million, is set out in the following paragraphs. However, as all adjustments are being made in Annually Managed Expenditure, the amount available to SAAS for student loan purposes has not been reduced as a result of these technical accounting adjustments:</p>

  <p>The increase in the provision for bad debts, amounting to &#163;104.8 million, has been removed as being no longer required. The amount provided for in the existing Student Loan subsidy budget is now considered sufficient.</p>

  <p>Capital charges have been reduced by &#163;50.4 million. As these have been taken into account in estimating the existing Student Loan subsidy, there is no need to make further provision.</p>

  <p>These adjustments amount to a reduction of &#163;155.2 million. Together with various other upward adjustments within the Student Awards budget, the net effect is a reduction of &#163;141.7 million.</p>

  <p>I have asked the Chief Executive of West of Scotland Water to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The current consumption of water at Balmore water treatment works is approximately 220 megalitres per day. The consumption of water at Milngavie water treatment works is approximately 400 megalitres per day.</p>

  <p>The capacity of the Balmore works is approximately 350 megalitres per day. With a leakage reduction of approximately 20 megalitres, this means that 150 megalitres will be available to the Glasgow network. The proposed new water treatment works at Milngavie has been designed to provide 240 megalitres per day based on a leakage reduction for the Glasgow area of 43 megalitres per day.</p>

  <p>There are no lead water mains in Scotland and lead plumbing has not been used since the 1960&rsquo;s. Internal lead plumbing is confined to properties constructed before 1964 although the use of lead supply pipes (the underground pipes connecting properties to the water main in the street) continued until as late as 1971 in some parts of Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has instructed the Scottish water authorities to undertake a survey of water supply zones across Scotland, to determine areas where there is likely to be non-compliance with the tighter lead standard being set by the EC from December 2003. As lead does not normally occur naturally in water, any areas of non-compliance detected are likely to be as a result of lead plumbing or lead supply pipes.</p>

  <p>To ensure compliance with the lead standard, the water authorities will be installing water treatment in areas identified as likely to fail to meet the new standard. In addition, where the water authorities identify the presence of lead plumbing in a particular property, they will advise the owner and/or occupier of remedial action that they can take. As part of their water mains renewal programmes, the water authorities are also replacing any lengths of lead supply pipe that are found to be in their ownership.</p>

  <p>There is no accurate data on the number of properties that have internal lead pipes or lead pipes connecting the property to the public water supply. Similarly, the number of properties with copper pipes with lead solder joints is not known.</p>

  <p>The use of lead plumbing within buildings ceased in 1964 and the use of lead pipes to connect buildings to the public supply largely stopped around this time, although it is known to have carried on in some areas of Scotland until 1971. Based on these facts, a broad estimate on the extent of lead plumbing in domestic properties was contained in the 1994 annual report on <i>Drinking Water Quality in Scotland</i>. The 1994 report estimated that, at that time, around 589,000 domestic properties in Scotland still had lead plumbing.</p>

  <p>Lead solder joints in copper plumbing were legal until 1987, but the illegal use of lead solder joints in copper plumbing was recently discovered on a number of new housing developments across Scotland.</p>

  <p>As indicated in the answer given to question S1W-23228 today, there is no accurate data on the number of properties that have internal lead pipes or lead pipes connecting the property to the public water supply. Consequently, there is no reliable estimate of the cost of eliminating all lead water pipes.</p>

  <p>The report <i>Drinking Water Quality in Scotland 1994</i> did suggest that the cost of replacement of all domestic lead plumbing would, at that time, be around &#163;480 million. However, if the replacement was restricted to pipes directly supplying drinking water, the report suggests a cost of &#163;280 million. However, the 1994 report did stress that these costs must be treated with some caution.</p>

  <p>The number of properties with copper pipes with lead solder joints is not known and no cost estimate has been made regarding their replacement.</p>

  <p>Local authorities have discretion to pay repair grants towards the cost of replacing lead plumbing in private sector houses. This also applies to business premises which share plumbing with such houses, where the premises are subject to a repair notice. The amount of grant payable is dependent on the grant applicant&rsquo;s resources. Grant is not normally payable in respect of a house less than 10 years old.</p>

  <p>As part of the Parliament&rsquo;s security vetting policy, checks are carried out with the relevant foreign authorities on all applicants who are foreign nationals or who have lived abroad for a period during the previous five years. Under normal circumstances, the clearance of such applicants takes on average five weeks: the average for UK resident applicants is two weeks.</p>

  <p>The terrorist attacks of 11 September resulted in increased demands on the resources of the USA authorities and low priority was given to vetting enquiries. Clearance times increased to an average of 16 weeks, which meant that the interns who commenced in September 2001 had finished their assignment before clearance had been received. As a result of measures set up with Edinburgh University, which arranges the internships, together with easing pressures on the USA authorities, the average clearance time for the most recent intake of interns is currently eight weeks, with the majority being cleared within six weeks.</p>
