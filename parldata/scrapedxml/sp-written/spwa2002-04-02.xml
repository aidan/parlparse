  <p>Local authorities and NHS boards provide respite services in response to local need. The Executive has been providing substantially increased levels of resources for social care year on year since 1998-99. Under our Carer's Strategy we are making available &#163;10 million a year to local authorities, specifically for services to support carers, including respite. Authorities are also being given substantial new resources to provide an extra 22,000 weeks of short break services each year across Scotland by 2003-04. Authorities decide how best to use all these resources in consultation with carers, service users and their representatives.</p>

  <p>The Committee of Scottish Clearing Bankers produces figures for the number of new business accounts opened with their members. In the period 1995 Q1 to 1999 Q3 the average number of new accounts per quarter was 13.7 per 10,000 adults in Scotland. In the period 1999 Q3 to 2001 Q4 the average rate was 10.4 per 10,000 adults.</p>

  <p>There is no single explanation for the change in the rate but it will be strongly influenced by, among other things, the rate of growth in the economy.</p>

  <p>Guidance was issued in 1998, <i>Protecting Children-A Shared Responsibility</i> , which sets out how agencies and professionals should work together to protect children from abuse and neglect, and to safeguard and promote their welfare. The Executive also issued further guidance for consultation &#150; <i>Getting Our Priorities Right</i> - in September 2001, which includes guidance to local agencies on preparing policies for the support of drug misusing parents and their children.</p>

  <p>With effect from 1 April 2001, the Executive has committed &#163;7 million per annum for three years through the Changing Childrens Services Fund for drugs projects tailored towards children, including support for those whose parents misuse drugs. On 8 February, the Minister for Education announced the allocation of &#163;2 million over three years to Lloyds TSB Foundation to support vulnerable children and young people affected by drug misuse.</p>

  <p>In response to recommendations from phase one of the work of the independent Review Group on the Retention of Organs at Post-Mortem, the Executive issued guidance in January 2001 to all Scottish NHS trusts indicating that they should, in appropriate cases, meet the expenses associated with the burial or cremation of organs retained at post-mortem examination without the parents&#146; authorisation.</p>

  <p>In the interests of sustainable farming, it is important for all producers to have profitable markets for the livestock that they produce, whether that is abattoirs or other farmers who finish the animals. Around two-thirds of livestock from the Western Isles is currently sold to buyers elsewhere in the UK and it is in the best interest of Western Isles producers that the abattoirs that buy their livestock are commercially viable, irrespective of where they are based.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the Chief Dental Officer for Scotland (CDO) has decided that when sedation is used in the NHS by a dentist or an anaesthetist the sedation is limited to the use of a single drug; if so, under what authority the CDO acted in this matter and whether such action was contrary to any General Dental Council Guidelines on the sedation of patients.</p>

  <p>More than one sedation agent may be used when intravenous sedation is administered by a dentist or an anaesthetist in an NHS hospital setting, where there is immediate access to appropriately trained personnel and equipment in case of emergencies. In general dental practices where NHS general dental services are offered, a single sedation agent is advised for purposes of patient safety.</p>

  <p>The Chief Dental Officer advises Scottish ministers on all dental matters which are devolved, including dental sedation in the NHS.</p>

  <p>The General Dental Council&#146;s ethical guidance <i>Maintaining Standards</i> gives a general guideline on how sedation should be administered. It is not specific in relation to setting or technique.</p>

  <p>The information collected centrally on incidents of domestic abuse recorded by the police in Scotland does distinguish the gender of both victim and perpetrator.</p>

  <p>Police forces have adopted a common definition of domestic abuse and statistical collection so that patterns of behaviour, including information on gender of both victim and perpetrator, can be monitored and repeat victimisation identified. This enables previous incidents to be taken into account and future protection of the victim and any children to be considered by the police and other agencies.</p>

  <p>The latest available information on incidents of domestic abuse is given in the statistical bulletin <i>Domestic Abuse Recorded by The Police in Scotland, 1 January - 31 December 2000</i> published by the Scottish Executive in December 2001, a copy of which is available in the Parliament's Reference Centre (Bib. number 18250).</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no function in relation to unemployed people seeking employment. The responsibility for assisting unemployed people into work rests primarily with the Employment Service, with local enterprise companies also providing training and support</p>

  <p>I understand no additional, special monitoring measures have been introduced in relation to decommissioning. That would not seem necessary. The key issue is that any fisherman who loses his job as a result of decommissioning is given any assistance necessary to find alternative employment.</p>

  <p>Current approvals for the release of GM crops are listed on the Scottish Executive GM website and full details of all approvals are placed on a public register held by the Executive.</p>

  <p>In 1999 the Scottish Executive gave approval for the release of a total of approximately seven hectares of GM herbicide tolerant oilseed rape, in a number of small-scale research plots. The greatest proportion of these were sown with GM winter oilseed rape, while the remainder were sown with the GM spring oilseed rape. No other varieties of GM crop were released in this year. The Farm Scale Evaluation (FSE) Programme had not been embarked upon at this time.</p>

  <p>2000 was the first year of the FSEs in Scotland; two hectares of GM spring oilseed rape and 25.5 hectares of GM winter oilseed rape were planted in the FSEs, at a total of five sites. In addition to this, a total of approximately two hectares of GM oilseed rape was planted in small-scale research plots. No other varieties of GM crop were released in 2000.</p>

  <p>Nine hectares of GM spring oilseed rape, and 29 hectares of GM winter oilseed rape were grown in the FSEs at a total of seven sites in 2001. A total of approximately 3.5 hectares of GM oilseed rape was planted in small-scale research plots. 0.07 hectares of GM potatoes were also grown in 2001 for research and development purposes. This is not part of the FSE programme.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not itself plant GM crops. It has however given approval for a maximum of 23 hectares, in total, of GM herbicide tolerant spring oilseed rape to be released at three sites this year as part of the Farm Scale Evaluation Programme. It is possible that the actual area planted will be less than this. No new applications have been received to release any other GM crops in 2002. Existing approvals permit no more than six hectares of GM winter oilseed rape and no more than 0.2 hectares of GM potatoes to be grown for research purposes on Scottish sites in 2002. It is not possible to know at this stage whether planting will proceed under these approvals, or whether any new applications will be received.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-22764 by Mr Jim Wallace on 19 February 2002, why the information given in the answer differs from that provided by South Lanarkshire Council in its planning application report, considered by the Local Area Committee on 12 March 2002.</p>

  <p>Question S1W-22764 asked what new facilities would be available after renovation that were not available before. The answer given provided that information and also referred to other upgrading of the court. The South Lanarkshire Council&#146;s planning application report provides further information on the work being undertaken including facilities that are currently available but that are going to be upgraded. For example, the layout of the existing facilities is being altered to provide a more efficient use of space and to create secure routes for prisoners through the court building.</p>

  <p>The arrangements relating to the transfer of prisoners between UK and Islands jurisdictions are governed by statute &#150; the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 &#150; and apply across the jurisdictions. They enable prisoners to transfer during the custodial part of their sentence, on an unrestricted or restricted basis or to transfer their supervision on licence on release or subsequently.</p>

  <p>Local authorities have a statutory responsibility for providing a range of social work and associated services to prisoners following release into the community in Scotland. The services are provided to enhance community safety and minimise the risk from offenders, including sex offenders and are governed by National Objectives and Standards for Social Work Services in the Criminal Justice System. These have been supplemented by additional guidance on the operation of the provisions in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, which allow courts to impose extended sentences, thus providing additional post-release supervision for violent or sex offenders where necessary.</p>

  <p>Offenders who are not subject to statutory supervision following release, can receive voluntary assistance in the form of advice, guidance and assistance from the local authorities on release from custody. The aim is to provide a range of supportive services to offenders to assist in the reintegration into the community and reduce the risk of re-offending.</p>

  <p>The Light Railways Acts of 1896 and 1912 will remain in force following introduction of the Order in Council under section 30 of the Scotland Act 1998 on the promotion and construction of railways which start and end and are wholly within Scotland. Order-making powers under these acts, in so far as they are not already devolved, will be transferred to Scottish ministers as soon as the section 30 Order is enforced.</p>

  <p>Under the National Waste Strategy, Scotland has been divided into 11 waste strategy areas. Each area has an area waste planning group tasked with preparing a plan to determine the best practicable environmental option for dealing with waste over the long term. The plans will propose levels of recycling and composting which are appropriate in each area. The Executive has established the Strategic Waste Fund to begin implementing these proposals and distributed &#163;3 million in March 2001 between all local authorities for recycling and composting initiatives. Examples of projects funded in remote areas include home composting, centralised composting, provision of mini recycling centres, kerbside collection schemes and shredding of paper for animal bedding.</p>

  <p>The Executive is also currently supporting innovative projects to promote recycling through the Sustainable Action Grant Schemes, enabling the Shetland Amenity Trust to extend its recycling activities and providing resources to establish a Community Recycling Forum to share best practice across Scotland.</p>

  <p>Under the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984, local authorities have a general duty to secure the expeditious, convenient and safe movement of traffic. This general duty is met by the local authority making traffic regulation orders, which can be introduced for a variety of reasons.

  <p>The Scottish Executive is working with the enterprise networks to stimulate the creation, competitiveness and growth of small businesses. It is doing so particularly through the Small Business Gateway, which is easing access to advice and improving the quality of business support in Scotland, including in the Inverclyde area. There has been an increase in the number of small businesses being supported in Inverclyde since the introduction of Small Business Gateway. The Small Business Gateway Information Centre handled 2,104 business enquiries from April 2001 to 25 March 2002 compared to 1,623 the previous year (through the Business Shop Inverclyde). The local Small Business Gateway advisers are also working with 116 small businesses carrying out Business Healthcheck reviews and helping on a one to one advisory capacity. During 2000-01 this figure was 77. A number of events have been held locally to encourage the take up of advisory support such as marketing clinics and Women into the Network events.</p>
