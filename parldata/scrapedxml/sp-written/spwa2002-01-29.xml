  <p>The review of undergraduate funding identified an imbalance in the NHS support for Dundee compared to other UK schools. This has been progressively adjusted to benefit Dundee over the last four years. Review of the numbers of students required to achieve the target output of 120 in conjunction with the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council (SHEFC) resulted in financial gain for the Universities training dental students.</p>

  <p>Energy Action Scotland is an independent registered charity. It is sponsored by the Scottish Executive to enable it to carry out activities which reflect ministers' aims to tackle fuel poverty and its effects. Sponsorship is not awarded for particular activities but is dependent on the organisation meeting a number of targets. For the current financial year the targets are (a) to secure &#163;95,000 of private sector resources, at least &#163;65,000 of which must be awarded for projects to improve home energy efficiency and tackle fuel poverty and (b) to enrol 26 Scottish local authorities as members. The targets are such that success in achieving them is easily assessed. Questions about any involvement by COSLA in the work of Energy Action Scotland must be addressed to those organisations.</p>

  <p>In <i>Rivers, Lochs, Coasts: The Future for Scotland&#146;s Waters</i> (Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre Bib. number 14576) <i>,</i> our consultation paper on the proposed Water Environment and Water Services Bill, which will give effect to the Directive in Scots Law, we said that we believed that the key to tackling diffuse pollution was to ensure the implementation of good practice across the board. We envisaged that this might be done by means of statutory codes of good practice, backed up by powers for a regulator to enforce specific pollution control measures where necessary. We also said that non-regulatory approaches such as voluntary and educational initiatives would have an important role to play.</p>

  <p>The issue of timing will be discussed in our second consultation paper on our legislative intentions for the bill. We will publish that paper shortly.</p>

  <p>The only difference in the EU technical conservation measures applying to these boats is the requirement for a smaller square mesh panel in trawls and seines used by boats under 150hp.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what economic assessment has been made, or is being made, of the effect on shore-based businesses in coastal communities of the reduction in catching capacity caused by the 2001 fishing vessel decommissioning scheme.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-01-29.S1W-21862.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80155" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0129.htm#12">

  <p>Decommissioning will not of course reduce the level of fishing opportunities available and, indeed, should help contribute to healthier stocks and a more viable, sustainable industry for the future. We recognise, however, that fleet size reductions may have some impact on supporting industries. The effect on individual communities and businesses will depend on the circumstances involved and, indeed, decisions by individual vessel owners on whether to proceed with decommissioning following a decommissioning grant offer.</p>

  <p>In the event that there are impacts arising from fleet restructuring, bodies such as the enterprise networks are in place to assist, including in relation to any employment consequences or, for example, measures to reduce dependency on fishing.</p>

  <p>More generally, work is under way - including through the Scottish Fish Industry Project led by Scottish Enterprise, the Processors Action Working Group and the Fisheries Departments and SeaFish - on economic issues related to the fishing industry.

  <p>The Scottish Executive has funded research looking at the impact of various mesh sizes on the catch of a single seine net fishing vessel. The work was conducted by the North Atlantic Fisheries College in Shetland as part of the &#163;1 million science/industry partnership that the Scottish Executive announced in March 2001. The trial looked at catches from a variety of mesh types, including 120mm cod ends.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will publish the scientific research on which the 25% cut in monkfish quotas for both the North Sea and the west coast was based, as agreed at the EU Fisheries Council meeting in December 2001, when the research was carried out and by whom.</p>

  <p>The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), which provides the scientific basis underpinning the setting of Total Allowable Catches, published the findings of the most recent international assessment of monkfish stocks in October 2001. The ICES advice, noting the parlous state of monkfish stocks and that the present fishery is not sustainable, advocated a 50% cut in catches for 2002. The UK successfully argued that cuts should be introduced more gradually to take account of the impact on fishing communities and provide fishermen with some time to adapt their fishing patterns. At the Fisheries Council last month, the council agreed to a smaller cut of 25% for 2002.</p>

  <p>Negotiations on the management of the blue whiting stock involve the European Community, Norway, the Faroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland and Russia. The most recent meeting was held last month immediately prior to the December Fisheries Council. Discussions failed to resolve the level of the Total Allowable Catch to be fished in 2002, or the allocation of the stock between Coastal States. Frans Fischler, the European Commissioner with responsibility for fisheries, intends to meet from Coastal States in February to press for a multilateral agreement to regulate the stock.</p>

  <p>In the absence of an international consensus, the European Council of Ministers agreed to reduce quotas in European waters by 280,000 tonnes in line with scientific advice. Blue whiting transfers to Norway were also reduced substantially and were discontinued with the Faroe Islands. These arrangements will be reviewed in the light of any future international management agreement.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive did not undertake a specific review of the State Veterinary Service (SVS) before 23 February 2001. However, it did examine and clarify the relationship between the SVS and the Scottish Executive in 1999. This led to the production of the Concordat between MAFF and the Scottish Executive in respect of the SVS. The Concordat set out an agreed framework for co-operation between the two organisations and detailed the key principles and practices underlying this co-operation.</p>

  <p>The Concordat does not deal specifically with an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease but does cover the procedures to be adopted during an animal health emergency.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&#146;s policy is outlined in <i>A Forward Strategy for Scottish Agriculture</i> ; the aim is to introduce Land Management Contracts in two to three years&#146; time. As part of that policy, a steering group to assist in the development of Land Management Contracts will be announced in due course.</p>

  <p>Officials have also been in contact with the European Commission and with the French Ministry of Agriculture. A further fact-finding visit to France will take place over the next few months.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what plans there are to reform the Occupiers&#146; Liability (Scotland) Act 1960 in light of the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill with reference to the liability on farmers and landowners for personal injury to those exercising their statutory rights.</p>

  <p>We see no need to amend the Occupiers' Liability (Scotland) Act 1960 which essentially enshrined in legislation the relevant common law principles relating to liability. Under the 1960 Act, the occupier of land has a duty to take such care, as in all the circumstances of the case is reasonable, to see that any person entering on the land will not suffer injury or damage by reason of any dangers due to the state of the premises or to anything done or omitted to be done on them.</p>

  <p>Part 1 of the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill provides for a right of responsible access to land for recreation and passage. Section 5(2) of the bill effectively provides that Part 1 of the bill, <strong>or its operation</strong>, will not affect the duty of care owed by an occupier to any person present on the land. This means, for example, that the fact that someone was exercising access rights when injured has no bearing on the extent of any duty of care owed by the occupier of land to that person in terms of the 1960 Act.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer given to question S1W-21848, which explained that we see no need to amend the Occupier's Liability (Scotland) Act 1960, given the terms of section 5(2) of the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill. Section 2(3) of the 1960 Act also provides that nothing in that act imposes on occupiers any obligations to persons entering their land in respect of risks which such persons have willingly accepted, as determined by reference to the same principles as in other cases in which one person owes to another a duty of care. This ensures the application of the relevant common law rules concerning assumption of risk. However, since the issue of assumption of risk is so tied up with the question of the extent of the occupier's duty of care and since section 5(2) makes it clear that nothing in Part 1 of the bill will affect that duty, we do not consider that any further provision is necessary concerning this issue in the bill.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers are responsible for devolved ports policy in Scotland. Policy advice is provided mainly by the Scottish Executive Development Department (SEDD) Ports and Harbours Branch. This falls largely to three staff in that branch amongst their other duties. The development of policy requires close liaison within SEDD Transport Group on related issues, including grant assistance to piers and harbours serving lifeline ferry routes in the Highlands and Islands, and with the Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department interest in fishery harbours.</p>

  <p>Ports policy is set out in <i>Modern Ports: A UK Policy </i>(November 2000, Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre Bib. number 9874). The paper sets out the broad policy aims on both devolved and reserved matters for UK ports. In addition, trust ports are implementing the guidance set out in<i> Modernising Trust Ports: A Guide to Good Governance</i> (January 2000, Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre Bib. number 18579). This provides a benchmark for best practice in the management, accountability and operation of trust ports, including the appointment of board members.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to announce that following an open competition towards the end of last year 12 new Independent Assessors have been appointed for a period of three years commencing 1 January 2002. This increases the total number of current assessors from 14 to 26 (10 men, 16 women, three people from an ethnic minority background and 1 disabled person) and brings the total number of assessors back up to the June 2001 level (there were 25 assessors in post in June).</p>

  <p>With effect from 1 January, all assessors will now be paid a daily fee of &#163;150 or &#163;250 subject to the level of their involvement in the appointments process. This policy change brings the Executive in line with the majority of Whitehall Departments. The overall financial implications are minimal, in the region of &#163;13,000 per annum.</p>

  <p>A review of rural definitions in use across the Executive revealed that around 20 different definitions of rural were in use. To ensure a more consistent approach to defining rural Scotland within the Executive, a core definition was adopted. It defines rural Scotland as being areas outside settlements of more than 3,000 residents. A framework approach ensures that, where appropriate, variations on the core definition, or indeed, alternative definitions can be adopted, where it can be demonstrated that those variations will allow individual policies or programmes to be targeted more effectively. An article giving details about this review was published in the <i>Scottish Economic Report</i> , published in June 2001. The Executive has no immediate plans to carry out a further review of rural definitions.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive recognises the benefits that may result from additional transport links with Europe. We are not aware of any current proposals to introduce commercial ferry services to Scandinavia or the Baltic, but we would encourage ferry operators to consider the opportunities that such markets might provide. While the Executive has no powers to offer revenue support for such services, any necessary shore infrastructure associated with them, which is related to the carriage of freight, might be eligible for support under the Freight Facilities Grant scheme.</p>

  <p>Although the euro is not legal tender in the UK, some retailers have indicated that they are prepared to accept it as a method of payment. This reflects the commercial choices of businesses. VisitScotland are distributing material, on request, regarding the euro.</p>

  <p>In conjunction with the Treasury, Scotland Europa have implemented a detailed programme to provide advice and raise awareness of the need by all businesses &#150; including in the tourist industry - to make appropriate preparations for the introduction of the currency. This includes the Trading in Euro symbol which indicates that an organisation is willing and able to deal with the euro currency.</p>

  <p>The Executive has undertaken two surveys of businesses in Scotland, assessing usage and expected usage of the euro. The first survey took place in the summer of 2000 and was repeated in 2001. The surveys did not include specific results from the tourism sector.</p>

  <p>Prior to 1999-2000, the travel element for all students was calculated as a percentage of the whole student support package available. In session 1999-2000, the maximum living cost support for new students entering higher education was increased. The increase included a revision of the amount within the student loan that is deemed to be for travel expenses and which is therefore deducted from the total amounts claimed by students. This resulted in the figures quoted above.</p>

  <p>Guidelines for initial teacher education courses in Scotland require that courses prepare teachers entering the profession to be responsive to the needs of all pupils in respect of health and general well being. The guidelines are not prescriptive and each training institution develops their own programme.</p>

  <p>It is the responsibility of local authorities, as employers, to ensure a wide range of continuing professional development (CPD) opportunities is available for qualified teachers. This should include a range of activities that ensures teachers are well prepared to deal with such issues as drug, alcohol and tobacco misuse.</p>

  <p>Separately, training has been made available for primary teachers by Scotland Against Drugs, which is supported by the Scottish Executive. This will be extended to secondary school teachers in the next year with an additional financial contribution from the Executive. The final amount has yet to be agreed.</p>
