  <p>I sympathise with the current plight of Scottish pig producers, which arises from overproduction at national EU and world levels. The Scottish Executive is precluded by EU rules from providing direct financial assistance to this sector. But we will encourage the European Commission to use other measures at its disposal to help alleviate the situation.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is currently developing a work programme to improve the dissemination of economic and statistics knowledge on the Scottish economy, raise the profile of the Scottish Executive&#146;s thinking on the economy and improve external dialogue and policy-related research capabilities.</p>

  <p>Wider consultation with the economic community is also proposed via a programme of increased dialogue with the external community to facilitate the flow of knowledge, together with the commissioning of policy-related economic research on selected elements of the Scottish economy.</p>

  <p>Greater Glasgow Health Board&#146;s recently finalised Health Improvement Programme (HIP) for the 5-year period from April 1999-2004 sets out the challenges facing the provision of services and details specific service proposals that are being considered to meet identified needs. The Health Board does not believe the existing disposition of adult acute services and emergency care throughout Glasgow is a sustainable basis for the future and the HIP sets out a range of service changes to modernise and strengthen emergency services that it will be seeking to discuss with various parties. To date, no decisions have been taken. The Health Board intends to invite comments on its proposals in due course.</p>

  <p>A number of improvements are in train to replace and modernise Glasgow hospitals. A major &pound;52m publicly funded re-development of Glasgow Royal Infirmary began in February this year. The project includes better, modern maternity services for mothers and their babies in Glasgow with the full range of clinical support facilities on site, an enhanced plastic surgery and burns facilities and services, and an enhanced emergency receiving service. Approval was given in March this year for an &pound;8.3m publicly funded project to develop a head and neck surgery (including oral and maxillo facial surgery) and cancer service for south Glasgow. The Government has agreed to establish Scotland&#146;s first &quot;walk-in, walk-out&quot; treatment centre in Glasgow to pilot fast, one-day diagnosis and treatment for a range of conditions. These developments are representative of the Executive&#146;s commitment to provide modern co-ordinated and quality care for patients.</p>

  <p>There are no current plans to increase staffing levels of the Procurator Fiscal Service specifically for this purpose.</p>

  <p>Scottish Office commissioned research published in August 1998 has shown a substantial reduction in the amount of time spent by police officers in court. The research also recognised that a significant contribution to this reduction was due to the efforts made by members of the Procurator Fiscal Service to implement the legislative changes introduced by the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995. Other practical and innovative measures such as &#145;on-call&#146; services were introduced, following consultation in order to make more efficient use of police witness waiting time. Over the last 3 years there has been a steady increase in the number of legal staff employed by the Procurator Fiscal Service. In addition as a result of a recent recruitment drive 22 further legal appointments have been made.</p>

  <p>As with other witnesses cited to attend court, Procurators Fiscal continue to make every effort to ensure that evidence is agreed where possible and that attendance at court is restricted to those whose evidence is essential.</p>

  <p>Our initial proposals on the use of revenue collected by means of possible future road user charging or workplace parking levy schemes are set out in the consultation paper on these issues published today. A copy of the paper will be deposited in the Parliament&#146;s Information Centre. Following consultation, our proposals will be incorporated into the planned Transport Bill.</p>
