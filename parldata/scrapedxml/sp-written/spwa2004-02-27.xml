  <p>Eight special protection areas (SPAs) have been classified by the Scottish Executive for the protection of golden eagle in Scotland. These cover an area of almost 344,000 ha or 4.4% of Scotland&#8217;s land mass.</p>

  <p>No figures are available on the number of home ranges which are fully within the site network for this very wide-ranging species, although most recent data indicate that there are 79 pairs which have at least part of their range within the eight classified sites.</p>

  <p>Based on the numbers of pairs which have at least part of their range within designated sites, an estimated 19% of the total Scottish population is protected by SPA for which golden eagles are named as a qualifying species. 58% of the overall population have at least part of their range within the wider network of Natura sites where habitats are protected. All golden eagles in Scotland are also fully protected under the provisions of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.</p>

  <p>A new national survey of golden eagle was undertaken in 2003 and once the results are analysed and published (expected in 2005) the Scottish Executive will seek advice from Scottish Natural Heritage on whether further sites can be identified which should be considered for future classification.</p>

  <p>The purpose of EU Directive 2000/78/EC is to lay down a general framework for combating discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation as regards employment and occupation, with a view to putting into effect in the member states of the European Union the principle of equal treatment.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for equal opportunities, including the matters dealt with by this Directive, is reserved.

The Department of Work and Pensions provides information about the Regulations to come into force in October 2004 to implement the disability provisions of the Directive. The DTI also provides information about its proposals for Regulations to come into force in October 2006 to implement the age provisions of the Directive.</p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise has provided information on the new Regulations relating to religion and belief and sexual orientation to all of its business advisers and business clients, who may include voluntary sector businesses. The Highlands and Islands Equality Forum has been tasked by Highlands and Islands Enterprise with engaging the private, voluntary and public sectors on all aspects of equality legislation and good practice issues.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive, Communities Scotland to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Registered Social Landlords (RSLs) are regulated and inspected by Communities Scotland. Communities Scotland does not, however, get involved in the different payment arrangements that exist between individual RSLs and their suppliers.</p>

  <p>RSLs are independent businesses and it is up to the RSL to agree the terms of any contract entered into with a supplier; payment terms will differ from supplier to supplier.</p>

  <p>The Confederation of British Industry Prompt Payers Code encourages payment within the suppliers terms and the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998 encourages creditors to pay within the terms of their contract and allows a right to claim interest from all businesses for late payment of bills.</p>

  <p>As the regulator, we expect RSLs to pay contractors promptly, within the terms of the contract. During our periodic inspections, we will examine how well an RSL is performing in this area. If we find that an RSL is making late payments without due cause then we would investigate this and expect the RSL to take corrective action.</p>

  <p>There are no plans to require RSLs to publish a record of how promptly they pay their suppliers.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, with reference to the Pathfinder Inspection Report on East Lothian Council by Communities Scotland, what concerns it has regarding the limit placed by the council on vacant properties on offer to homeless households in priority need and whether this breaches the council&#8217;s statutory duties.</p>

  <p>I have asked Ms Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s concerns regarding this matter are set out in paragraph 7.3 of the Pathfinder Inspection Report on East Lothian Council. This states that &quot;The Council places a limit on the number of vacant properties that can be offered to homeless households in priority need, either in its own housing or through nominations to RSLs. This is resulting in many homeless households spending relatively long periods of time in temporary accommodation while awaiting permanent housing.&quot;</p>

  <p>In terms of section 20 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 (as amended), a local authority has an obligation to give reasonable preference to homeless persons as well as other groups in the allocation of its housing. There is no legislative provision that prevents the local authority from limiting the allocation of vacant houses in its ownership in respect of certain categories of applicant.</p>

  <p>The local authority has a statutory duty under section 31 of the 1987 Act to secure permanent accommodation for homeless people in priority need. The concern raised in the Pathfinder Inspection Report does not directly relate to the local authority&#8217;s fulfilment of the duty under section 31 but to the length of time many homeless people are waiting before the duty is fulfilled.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Communities Scotland, acting on behalf of Scottish Ministers, in terms of Part 3 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001, has powers to require a local authority to submit a plan setting out how it will deal with the matters of concern raised in an Inspection Report. Once this plan has been agreed, the local authority is required to implement it.

  <p>No. The Glasgow Housing Association&#8217;s business plan will enable it to deliver its regeneration commitments in Glasgow. The Scottish Executive has already provided substantial resources to ensure that the plan is fully fundable.</p>

  <p>We have recently made an additional &#163;1 million available to the Scottish Police Service to support the development of DNA in the investigation of crime. Around &#163;800,000 will be used by forces to purchase eight genetic analysers which are used in the process of developing DNA profiles obtained from samples taken both at the point of arrest and from crime scenes. The remaining money will be allocated to increasing DNA sampling levels across Scotland. Together, these measures will give the Scottish Police Service equipment that is as up to date as any in the world and will, in turn, assist in solving more crimes.</p>

  <p>The Executive has not had an opportunity to consider the practicalities of Stewart Maxwell&#8217;s Bill in detail. However, it is premature to reach a decision on legislation ahead of research which we have commissioned on the evidence base for introducing smoking restrictions and hearing the views of the Scottish people.
