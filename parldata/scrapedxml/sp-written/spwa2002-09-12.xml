  <p>A review of the range and capacity of community care services for older people in Scotland over the next five, 10 and 15 years is currently under way. This will include a strategic review of care home provision, to identify the most effective way of developing and managing the market to meet the future needs of elderly people throughout Scotland.</p>

  <p>We are keen to see the correct range of services in place, to take account of future demographic changes and ensure that older people receive appropriate levels of care and are not delayed unnecessarily in hospital. We will carry out this work in partnership with health and local authority colleagues and in consultation with independent sector care home providers and intend this work to form the basis for longer term national and local planning of future developments.</p>

  <p>Direct Payments Scotland will continue to work closely with local authorities and will monitor take up regularly. The Executive will continue to collect annual statistics to ensure that all local authorities are making direct payments available. Revised guidance will be issued by the Executive prior to 1 June 2003 to remind local authorities that from that date they have a duty to offer direct payments. We will also consider the need to repeat the research carried out in 2000, which would help determine whether the new legislation is being implemented fully.</p>

  <p>The Financial Provision and Direct Payments Survey is intended to cover all payments made by local authorities under section 12B of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968. The most recent survey covers the period 1 April 2001 to 31 March 2002 and results are due to be published on 25 September 2002. Statistics on the number of people who have applied for direct payments are not collected centrally.</p>

  <p>However, latest figures published by Direct Payments Scotland in its August Newsletter show that they are aware of 303 people who are receiving direct payments. The breakdown by local authority is as follows:</p>

  <p>There is a wealth of national and international research evidence to support prescribing of methadone as a substitute for illegal opiate-based drugs. The duration and dosage of methadone prescriptions are matters for individual patients and their health professionals to determine. Guidance on substitute prescribing is included in our <i>Drug Misuse and Dependence &#8211; Guidelines on Clinical Management</i> .</p>

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s Effective Interventions Unit has also produced and disseminated a report <i>Moving On</i>, which provides information to service providers on effective ways to help recovering drug misusers into education, training and employment.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is unable to confirm when Aventis CropScience first knew of impurities in their GM seed. However, Aventis formally notified the Scottish Executive of low levels of additional GM material in the oil seed rape seeds used in farm scale trials in a letter dated 2 August 2002. The Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs was also notified at the same time.</p>

  <p>The text of the letter from Aventis notifying the Scottish Executive of the details of this incident was attached to the Executive&#8217;s News Release dated 15 August 2002.</p>

  <p>For Scotland to thrive rather than simply survive in the rapidly evolving, knowledge driven, global economy we need to be more fully integrated within it: to be well connected physically, digitally and intellectually with the rest of the world. The Scottish Executive&#8217;s policy approach was articulated in <i>Scotland: A Global Connections Strategy</i> , which was published <i> </i> last October. This makes it clear that the Executive wants to see Scotland recognised as the most globally connected small nation in Europe, capitalising fully on its existing diverse range of international linkages and seizing new opportunities.</p>

  <p>While the Executive has not undertaken a detailed assessment of the impact of globalisation on the promotion of Scottish culture, work undertaken by the UK Government and by Scottish Enterprise suggests that globalisation means that there are significant opportunities for the promotion of Scotland's creative and cultural industries.</p>

  <p>Scottish Parliamentary elections are a reserved matter. The Executive has made no assessment of the effects of globalisation on turnout at local government elections but the Electoral Commission is undertaking on-going research on voter engagement and education as part of its remit on electoral issues.</p>

  <p>Resources for healthy eating in Scotland are allocated across a wide range of sectors and settings including the Food Standards Agency, the NHS, Health Education Board for Scotland, local government and the voluntary sector.</p>

  <p>Healthy Eating is a key element of the drive to improve the health of the people of Scotland. The National Healthy Eating Campaign will spearhead this drive and take forward the further implementation of the Scottish Diet Action Plan.</p>

  <p>The National Campaign will be supported by funding from the Scottish Diet Action Plan and will augment the Scottish Executive&#8217;s anticipated allocation of &#163;1 million each year for implementation of this plan.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive supports the development of breakfast clubs and fruit provision in schools in a number of ways.</p>

  <p>The Executive has created a &#163;250,000 Breakfast Service Challenge Fund to expand services targeting vulnerable children and is reviewing current provision.</p>

  <p>One of the priorities identified for the Health Improvement Fund, which has allocated &#163;26 million per annum towards improving public health until 2003-04, is improving the diet of children. This includes supporting the provision of breakfast clubs and fruit in nurseries and schools.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Community Diet Project has a specific remit to work with low-income communities and will receive funding of &#163;1.2 million between 2002 and 2005. It supports a range of community food initiatives including breakfast clubs and recently published a Breakfast Club toolkit to assist organisations wishing to set up a breakfast club.</p>

  <p>Childcare Strategy funding (&#163;16.75 million in 2002-03) is allocated to local authorities who, with Childcare Partnerships, make decisions on its disbursement to meet local childcare needs. The Executive has allocated an additional &#163;8 million to local authorities as part of the Childcare Strategy funding over 2001-04 to help support and stabilise fragile out of school care provision, including breakfast clubs.</p>

  <p>New Community Schools have the twin aims of promoting social inclusion and raising educational standards in Scotland. Many New Community Schools have been involved in setting up breakfast clubs where there is perceived need.</p>

  <p>In addition to services provided by the NHS and local authorities, the Executive continues to provide core funding to a range of voluntary organisations, which offer advice, care and information to those with mental health problems.</p>

  <p>Overall, &#163;1.2 million will be provided for 2002-03 under the section 10 and section 16B grant schemes to voluntary bodies in the mental health field. A further &#163;19 million will be disbursed through Mental Illness Specific Grant which goes via local authorities to 400 small scale projects at local level throughout Scotland. These projects provide a range of support, including drop-in centres, day services, counselling services, information and advice, education and employment schemes, advocacy and befriending services.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to say that implementation of the National Waste Strategy is progressing well. All 11 draft Area Waste Plans have been published for public consultation. I intend to publish, shortly, a summary report on the work to check that the plans are consistent, will achieve Scotland&#8217;s overall targets and identify potential economies of scale. The next step will be to finalise the area plans around the end of the year and publish an overall National Waste Plan.</p>

  <p>Following the publication of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency&#8217;s (SEPA) report, <i>Strategic Review of Organic Waste Spread on Land</i> , the then Scottish Office carried out a public consultation on its recommendations. I refer the member to the answer given to question S1W-12162 on 22 December 2000, in which the then Minister for the Environment formally responded to the report.</p>

  <p>SEPA&#8217;s recommendations in the report were considered further in the context of the Transport and the Environment Committee&#8217;s report on Petition PE327 by the Blairingone and Saline Action Group on Organic Waste Spread on Land. The Executive responded to the Transport and the Environment Committee&#8217;s report in May 2002 detailing the progress already made on this issue and proposals for further action on a number of points. The full text of this response can be found listed under TE/02/22/12 at: www.scottish.parliament.uk/official_report/cttee/trans-02/trp02-22.pdf</p>

  <p>A key element of our proposals is amendments to the Waste Management Licensing Regulations exemptions to tighten up controls surrounding this practice. We intend to issue a consultation paper on this in late autumn.</p>

  <p>No decision has been made on whether or how hedgehogs might be removed from the Uists and Benbecula, although action is required to address the serious threat to the internationally important population of ground nesting wading birds on these islands. Research conducted by the RSPB over the past seven years has clearly demonstrated the serious decline in these birds due to predation by hedgehogs.</p>

  <p>The published research on methodology which Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) has considered is noted below. Additional advice has been given by RSPB Scotland.</p>

  <p>SNH has undertaken wide consultation with academics and animal welfare groups through the Uist Wader Project, a partnership between SNH, Scottish Executive and RSPB Scotland. During September 2002, SNH are discussing methods of controlling the hedgehog population on the Uists and Benbecula with a wide range of conservation and animal welfare organisations prior to reaching final conclusions.</p>

  <p>The Executive does not place offenders with the Airborne Initiative (Scotland) Ltd. The courts have the option of imposing an additional specific condition to attend the Airborne programme, as part of a probation order. Since January 1998 to date, there have been 495 offender placements, with 51 participants so far this calendar year.</p>

  <p>In the financial years 1999-2000 and 2000-01, &#163;471,500 and &#163;483,286 respectively was allocated in direct grant, through South Lanarkshire Council, to fund placements with Airborne. Following an independent evaluation published in June 2000, changes were made to these funding arrangements from the 2001-02 financial year. In 2001-02, &#163;300,000 was allocated to South Lanarkshire Council in respect of the direct grant for Airborne. In addition, all local authorities received a ring fenced grant allocation from the Executive to purchase places on the Airborne programme and similar courses provided by the Fairbridge Venture Trust. The total sum made available to the local authorities for this purpose in 2001-02 amounted to &#163;278,545. In the current financial year, South Lanarkshire received an allocation of &#163;206,000 for the direct grant for Airborne and local authorities a total allocation of &#163;404,573 to purchase places from Airborne and the Fairbridge Venture Trust.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not collected on a routine basis by the Scottish Executive. However, an independent evaluation by Stirling University commissioned by the Executive and published in June 2000 suggested that the average programme participant had 10.5 previous convictions and had served, on average, 3.0 previous custodial sentences. The research indicated that the principal offences for which offenders were referred to Airborne were dishonesty (50% of referrals), violence including common assault (23%) and breach of a previous court order (10%).</p>

  <p>Since January 1998, there have been 495 participants on the Airborne programme of whom 321, or 65%, have successfully completed the programme. The remaining 174 participants failed to complete for a variety of reasons.</p>

  <p>The information requested on re-offending rates is not collected on a routine basis. However, an independent evaluation carried out by Stirling University and published in June 2000 indicated that reconviction rates were significantly lower among those who completed the Airborne programme compared with those who failed to complete and amongst a comparison group, who received alternative disposals. The evaluation found that 64% of Airborne completers had been reconvicted within 12 months compared with 95% of non-completers and 77% of comparison group cases. The evaluation also indicated that Airborne participants were slower to be re-convicted and that participation in Airborne significantly increased an offender&#8217;s likelihood of remaining free of further convictions.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has been aware for some time of the organisation&#8217;s desire to find an alternative location and premises to its current site at Abington. As a voluntary sector organisation, decisions on the most suitable site for its operations are essentially matters for Airborne Initiative (Scotland) Ltd. The Executive was, however, made aware by the organisation of its intention to purchase Braidwood House and there have been a number of informal discussions on the issue in recent weeks. I myself paid a visit to the organisation&#8217;s current site at Abington on 19 August when the subject of the move to Braidwood was discussed. The issue has also been discussed on an informal basis between officials of the Scottish Executive and South Lanarkshire Council in its role as the local planning authority and managing authority for the organisation.</p>
