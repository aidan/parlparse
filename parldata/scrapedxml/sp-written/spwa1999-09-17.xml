  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will use powers under Schedule 12 of the Local Government Finance Act 1988 to make regulations with regard to Section 6 of the Valuation and Rating (Scotland) Act 1956, and in particular whether it will use the powers prescribed thereunder to make regulations in order to reduce business rates for smaller businesses.</p>

  <p>The powers under Schedule 12 of the Local Government Finance Act 1988 to make regulations with regard to Section 6 of the Valuation and Rating (Scotland) Act 1956 may be used to prescribe how the Net Annual Value (NAV) of lands and heritages is calculated. It would therefore not be appropriate to introduce a rate relief scheme for small businesses under these powers.</p>

  <p>Powers do exist in terms of Section 153 of the Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994 to prescribe the amount payable in non-domestic rates in respect of any lands and heritages. We will consider whether rates relief for small businesses is needed in the light of the results of the independent revaluation survey of the rates base (expected in late autumn).</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it is aware of the concern amongst traders and some community groups about the increased numbers of charity shops working under preferential trading conditions in the high streets of Scottish towns, and whether there is any research, planned or in progress, into the longer term effects of this increase on property prices, rates and rental levels and other aspects of town centre trading and shopping.</p>

  <p>Charity shops perform a valuable function and the principle of rates relief is long established. H M Treasury recently consulted on the whole question of charity taxation, including rates relief for charity shops. One of the suggestions in the consultation paper was to consider tightening up the legislation so that charity shops receiving rates relief are more clearly defined in terms of the goods they sell. We will consider whether to propose changes once the Treasury review is published</p>

  <p>It is often the case that charity shops occupy sites that no-one else wants and very rarely occupy prime retail sites. The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) does not consider that charity shops present unfair competition to small shopkeepers.</p>

  <p>There are no plans at this stage for research to be carried out into this matter.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not collected centrally.</p>

  <p>The Government wishes to ensure fair, supportive and effective procedures for dealing with teachers who cannot maintain professional standards. Such procedures should command the support of the profession and local authorities. HM Inspectors of Schools have recently completed a wide ranging study into the application of existing disciplinary procedures and I will be bringing forward proposals for consultation in due course.</p>

  <p>Bullying of any kind is unacceptable, whatever the motivation, and should be addressed quickly and firmly whenever it arises. The Scottish Executive is funding the national Anti-Bullying Network to help schools across Scotland share good practice in tackling bullying and provide training and consultancy services to support schools and local authorities in developing anti-bullying strategies. The Network will combat all forms of bullying, including bullying which is motivated by racist, sexist or homophobic attitudes. We are also providing funding to Childline to secure the continued operation of their Bullying Helpline.</p>

In some instances, the Plans provided do not specify the type of staff to be employed and in others, funds are devolved to schools.

  <p>Employment Policy is reserved to the UK Government which therefore takes the lead on the funding and delivery of the New Deal throughout Great Britain, although in close consultation with its partners, including the Scottish Executive. Many partner organisations at local level also provide New Deal Services under contract or provide funds and other resources, including training funds to enhance the quality of New Deal in their areas. The public and voluntary sector organisations which contribute to the New Deal in this way fall within the remit of the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>The evaluation of the New Deal, including all individual strands, is conducted on a national (GB) basis. Samples are designed to be as representative as possible and evaluation reports are published by the Employment Service. Copies of the twelve reports published to date have been placed in the Parliament Reference Centre. In addition, a major quantitative survey of New Deal participants has been commissioned in Scotland and a report of the findings should be available in January 2000.</p>

  <p>Some further evaluation work of the Full-Time Education and Training Option in Scotland is being undertaken by HM Inspectorate of Schools in conjunction with Scottish Enterprise and Highlands &amp; Island Enterprise. The outcome of this work will not be available until early in the New Year.</p>

  <p>Based on figures in the Public Expenditure: Statistical Analyses 1999-2000 the Scottish Budget grows on average by 1.7 per cent per annum in real terms over the CSR period, while UK Total Managed Expenditure grows on average by 2.8 per cent per annum in real terms. Scotland starts from a significantly higher base level of expenditure per head of population than in the UK as a whole. Figures for real terms spending in Scotland by programme are given in table 1.5 of &quot;Serving Scotland&#8217;s Needs, the Government&#8217;s Expenditure Plans 1999-2000 to 2001-02&quot;, Cm 4215.</p>

  <p>Health Boards continue to work with their local authority partners in addressing all avenues to reduce and, where possible, remove delays in discharge from NHS Care.</p>

  <p>We are aware that an increase in referrals from St Johns Hospital for residential and nursing home places has resulted in an increase in the number of patients awaiting discharge in West Lothian. Lothian Health Board, the West Lothian Healthcare NHS Trust and West Lothian Council are working together to address the issue.</p>

  <p>The Trust is considering additional funding to facilitate the placement of a number of patients currently occupying orthopaedic beds and West Lothian Council is looking to temporarily increase the number of places in its residential care homes to meet the needs of 10 patients currently awaiting places in Council residential homes.</p>

  <p>Mr Reid&#8217;s unsuccessful appeal to the sheriff, in 1997, was followed by judicial review of that decision, at Mr Reid&#8217;s behest, on points of law. The Lord Ordinary&#8217;s Judgement which favoured the Secretary of State was appealed by Mr Reid to the Inner House of the Court of Session. Their judgement was favourable to Mr Reid&#8217;s case. It was later overturned by the House of Lords in December 1998, on appeal by the Secretary of State. Mr Reid remained legally detained throughout this period.</p>

  <p>Mr Ruddle&#8217;s case is different. His appeal to the sheriff was successful. Legal advice to Ministers of the Scottish Executive was that an application for judicial review of the sheriff&#8217;s judgement would not have succeeded in overturning the sheriff&#8217;s decision, and would not have allowed Mr Ruddle to be kept in the State Hospital. We also concluded that the law needed to be changed. For that reason, no application for judicial review has been lodged.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it accepts that there is reasonable doubt about any criminal prosecution of members of the public accused of non-compliance under the Skye Crossing Toll Order (SI 1992/1501) given the terms of section 5(2) of the Statutory Instruments Act 1946 whereby a statutory defence is provided to a person accused of non-compliance if they can prove that the Order in question was not published and given that the Register of Statutory Instruments 1992 describes the Skye Crossing Toll Order as &quot;unpublished&quot;.</p>

  <p>The statutory defence afforded by section 3(2) [not 5(2)] of the Statutory Instruments Act 1946 applies "in any proceedings for an offence consisting of a contravention of any <u>such</u> statutory instrument", that is to one "printed and sold by the Queen's printer of Acts of Parliament" as specified in section 3(2) of the Act.</p>

  <p>The Invergarry-Kyle of Lochalsh Trunk Road (A87) Extension (Skye Bridge Crossing) Toll Order 1992 (Statutory Instrument 1501 of 1992) is classified a local order in terms of regulation 4(1) of the Statutory Instruments Regulations 1947, and is, by virtue of the provisions of regulation 5 of the regulations and section 8(1)(c) of the Act, exempt from the requirements of printing and sale.</p>

  <p>The question is one of law. The test of reasonable doubt is a matter for the courts in determining guilt or innocence.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-521 by Mr Jack McConnell on 23 August, how the &pound;100 average cost of answering a Scottish Parliamentary Question was calculated and whether this average cost is a mode, median or mean average.</p>

  <p>The &pound;100 average cost was calculated by estimating the amount of time spent by members of staff of the Scottish Executive on dealing with a limited sample of Scottish Parliamentary Questions covering a range of subjects. Staff time was costed to include, for each grade of staff, a share of the overhead costs of the Scottish Executive. The overhead costs are based on expenditure in 1998-99. The total value of staff time was divided by the number of questions in the study to arrive at an average cost per question of about &pound;100.</p>

  <p>The preliminary work to assess average costs was undertaken over a short period and with a relatively small sample of questions so that a broad indication of costs could be provided quickly to members who asked for that information. The Executive intends to undertake a detailed study of the cost of answering questions over the coming months and will make the results of that exercise available to members.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive , further to the answer to question S1W-521 by Mr Jack McConnell on 23 August, whether the reference to the &pound;100 average cost of answering a Scottish Parliamentary Question being consistent with evidence from the UK Parliament means that the cost of answering Scottish Parliamentary Questions is (a) the same as or (b) different from the cost of answering UK Parliamentary Questions and, if it is different, whether the cost of answering Scottish Parliamentary Questions is more or less, and by how much, than the cost of answering UK Parliamentary Questions.</p>

  <p>The average cost of &pound;100 for answering written Scottish Parliamentary Questions is an estimate based on preliminary work undertaken over a short period and using a relatively small sample of questions. The Executive intends to undertake a detailed study of the cost of answering questions over the coming months and will make the results of that exercise available to members.</p>

  <p>The last comprehensive exercise to assess the cost of answering Westminster Parliamentary Questions was undertaken in 1991. The resulting average cost figure is uprated on an annual basis. The latest published figure for the average cost of answering written questions is &pound;115 (Hansard, 11 March 1999, Column 363). This reflects uprating to April 1998.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive published its consultation document on road user charging and workplace parking levy schemes, <i>Tackling Congestion, </i> on 13 July. The document seeks views on what national exemptions or privileges, if any, should be specified in legislation and what might be left to local discretion. The Executive would welcome views as to whether the service rendered by charities transporting patients to specialist care facilities should be exempt from any charging scheme.

  <p>No. Operational matters such as timetabling are for Caledonian MacBrayne to determine. Timetables for Colonsay and all the other islands served by CalMac are decided after extensive consultation through Shipping Services Advisory Committees (SSACs). Representatives from Argyll &amp; Bute Council sit on the relevant Committee and it is through them that Colonsay residents can participate in the decision making process.</p>

  <p>The Sewerage (Scotland) Act 1968 places duties on water authorities to provide and maintain drainage infrastructure. The 1968 Act does not deal with preventing pollution which is controlled under the Control of Pollution Act 1974.
