  <p>The prescription charge medical exemption arrangements were reviewed by the UK Government in 1997. The decision taken was that the conditions which currently qualify for exemption would remain unchanged for the remainder of the current UK Parliament. The Scottish Executive has no plans to change this position.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what assessment has been made of any increase in costs to the three Scottish water boards which will result from the implementation of the climate change levy, and whether it will make additional finance available to cover any increased costs.</p>

  <p>All three water authorities have made assessments of the impact of costs of the climate change levy. At this stage, their estimates are as follows:</p>

  <p>East of Scotland Water Authority: &pound;400,000 per annum</p>

  <p>West of Scotland Water Authority: &pound;900,000 per annum</p>

  <p>North of Scotland Water Authority: &pound;475,000 per annum</p>

  <p>The climate change levy will apply to all business in both the private and public sectors, and is an instrument designed to encourage energy efficiency, reducing energy consumption and the emission of greenhouse gases. It would therefore not be appropriate to attempt to mitigate its impact. The monies raised will be returned to the business sector in full through a reduction in National Insurance Contributions and through support for energy efficiency measures.</p>

  <p>NHS Trusts and health boards already have a range of formal and informal measures to ensure that incompetent or dangerous doctors are not allowed to practise within their area. These include: voluntary withdrawal from one or more segments of the practitioner&#8217;s work; limitation of some elements of his or her work; close supervision of the work; retraining in the areas of concern, and formal suspension of the practitioner by the health board or Trust. The Medical Act 1983 is currently being amended to give the General Medical Council additional powers to impose immediate interim suspension on any doctor, in the public interest, for the protection of patients and the maintenance of confidence in the medical profession. This GMC suspension would prevent the doctor from practising anywhere in the United Kingdom.</p>

  <p>As was set out in detail in the paper that I made available on 17 January 2000 and is available in SPICe, the overall effect of the higher rate poundage in Scotland was balanced by the effect of the greater revaluation factor in England. The competitive position of typical Scottish firms relative to equivalent English firms was maintained. The total revenue raised by non-domestic rates in Scotland is the same in real terms as before the revaluation.</p>

The day-to-day management of pupils requiring medication would normally be undertaken by school staff on a voluntary basis.

  <p>The prescribing of Beta Interferon depends on the clinical judgment of the specialist concerned, informed by advice and evidence regarding this treatment.</p>

  <p>At present, local Drug and Therapeutic Committees provide advice to clinicians in their health board on the use of Beta Interferon in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. To provide a single national focus for this advice, I recently wrote to the Health Technology Board for Scotland asking them to provide advice on the clinical and cost-effectiveness of Beta Interferon as a treatment for multiple sclerosis as an early priority.</p>

  <p>The NHS in Scotland&#8217;s approach to osteoporosis is through tackling life circumstances as set out in the White Paper, <i>Towards a Healthier Scotland</i> , which was endorsed last year by the Scottish Executive. The Health Service is therefore aiming to prevent osteoporosis through a joined-up national policy based on promoting exercise, including the elderly, and stopping smoking and improving diet.</p>

  <p>Work is being taken forward as part of the Scottish Executive&#8217;s comprehensive Public Health Strategy which will assist with osteoporosis prevention. All health boards are participating in this national public health approach.</p>

  <p>Health boards and NHS Trusts devise strategies for the care of patients with a wide variety of conditions, including osteoporosis. They are best suited to determine the services which are required to meet the needs of their local population, within available resources. Health boards have received allocations for the current year for their hospital and community health services and prescribed drugs totalling &pound;4.1 billion.</p>

  <p>Guidance to help health boards and NHS Trusts to devise strategies for osteoporosis was issued by the Health Department in 1997 in the form of a Scottish Needs Assessment Programme report. This gave the conclusions of a group of experts drawn from within the NHS on the current situation in Scotland, a review of recent research and options for the prevention, detection and management of osteoporosis.</p>

  <p>Police grant was cash limited from 1996-97 onwards. The drop in the level of funding for police grant shown for 1996-97 is due to the recovery of an overpayment from the previous year. Loan charges depend on the capital projects within the force area at a given time. Dumfries &amp; Galloway received &pound;310,000 for policing the millennium but actual spend was &pound;293,000. The difference will be recovered.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to the promotion of renewable sources of energy. Although the use of passive solar power in the design and construction of buildings in Scotland is not monitored, we would expect that it would play a part in meeting Scotland&#8217;s future energy needs.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive intend to allocate &pound;15.9 million of additional funding to transport. This reflects a Barnett share of the comparable expenditure. This &pound;280 million investment will provide a massive boost to the UK transport infrastructure, improving transport and reducing congestion.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-4347 by Sarah Boyack on 21 March 2000, whether it will require the relevant local authorities to safeguard the routes identified in the answer when revised structure plans are submitted to it.</p>

  <p>No. Revised structure plans should include those schemes on which work is expected to commence in the plan period; other schemes should merit only description in the text, the level of detail dependant on the degree of commitment. As explained in answer to question S1W-4347, the detailed routes can then be safeguarded in local plans.</p>

  <p>The effectiveness of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) as the regulator and enforcement body for pollution control in Scotland is kept under continual review in the light of current and new duties arising from domestic and European legislation. Procedures within SEPA are primarily operational matters, responsibility for which rests with SEPA itself rather than the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>Audit Scotland is currently carrying out a value for money study of SEPA&#8217;s main regulatory functions. A report is expected to be available to the Parliament&#8217;s Audit Committee this autumn.</p>

  <p>SEPA&#8217;s Chief Executive has been, and will be, fully consulted about these developments.</p>

  <p>I announced to Parliament on 13 April that Europa Building, in Glasgow&#8217;s Argyle Street, has been chosen as the location for the Scottish University for Industry&#8217;s headquarters. The company&#8217;s staff of around 25 are expected to locate there at the end of May and the Scottish UfI will become operational in the autumn.</p>

  <p>Good progress has been made since the publication of our progress report on development <i>The</i> <i>Shortest Route to Learning </i>- last October Mr Frank Pignatelli was appointed as Chief Executive in November; the company, Scottish UfI Ltd, was established in December; the four Executive Directors were appointed in December; the appointments process for the board began in March, and the call-centre operator was appointed earlier this month.</p>
