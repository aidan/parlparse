  <p>Membership of an inshore fisheries group (IFG) is open to commercial fishermen who operate in the IFG area. An IFG must liaise with all relevant stakeholders, such as recreational sea anglers, as it develops its management plan. Where locally appropriate, we would expect recreational interests to be included formally within the IFG&rsquo;s advisory group, which exists to provide expert advice to the IFG and to provide the necessary checks and balances to ensure robust management plans that accord with wider environmental, social, economic and management objectives.</p>

  <p>The role of the advisory group for an inshore fisheries group (IFG) will be that of supporting the decision-making processes of the executive committee by providing the necessary scientific and technical advice and ensuring that wider interests are taken into account. The advisory group will consist of representation from the statutory bodies with the relevant expertise and key stakeholders. Other bodies and locally relevant stakeholders such as other fishing interests as well as business or community interests may also be invited to join the advisory group depending on the IFG local circumstances.</p>

  <p>As much will be learned from experience, Scottish ministers and the Scottish Inshore Fisheries Advisory Group will regularly review the operation of IFG pilots to ensure that they fulfil their role and are properly inclusive.</p>

  <p>The cause of the outbreak in October 2007 could not be determined. The Outbreak Control team is currently reviewing the circumstances of the most recent outbreak at the Victoria Infirmary and a full report will be compiled. Six patients were affected in October 2007 and I understand that a further six patients were affected in the most recent outbreak, one of whom died on 24 June 2008. We are advised by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde that clostridium difficile was a contributory factor in the patient&rsquo;s death.</p>

  <p>The inherited unsustainable commitments referred to in the Affordable Housing Investment Programme announcement are commitments made to pay out Housing Association Grant (HAG) at levels per home which had increased in real terms by 35% in the four years between 2002-03 to 2006-07. The challenge of meeting the 2012 target on homelessness and also of meeting our aspiration to increase the supply of new affordable homes mean that continuing to approve HAG subsidies at this level is not sustainable.</p>

  <p>We have been informed by the supplier of the e-petitions system that difficulties have arisen with the e-petition system due to problems with the hardware that runs the system. Part of this is due to the overwhelming volume of traffic being experienced on the system.</p>

  <p>These difficulties have resulted in performance issues which have meant that in order to keep the main part of the system running, the discussion forum has been disabled on a temporary basis.</p>

  <p>A technical solution has been identified by the supplier and discussions are taking place on the supply, cost and timeframe for implementation of the solution which will see full functionality restored as quickly as possible.</p>
