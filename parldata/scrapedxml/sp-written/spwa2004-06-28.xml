  <p>The table shows the gross ingredient cost of drugs used in the management of asthma for the financial years 2001-02, 2002-03 and 2003-04. These data relate to prescribed items dispensed by community pharmacists and dispensing doctors and do not take into account items dispensed by hospitals or hospital-based clinics. The cost given is the cost of the items before the addition of pharmacy fees and the deduction of any discount or patient charges.</p>

  <p>It is important to note that the preparations can be used to treat conditions other than asthma. Prescription data are not patient-specific and do not identify the condition for which a particular medicine was prescribed.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to the dispersal of public sector jobs and wants to see all areas of Scotland benefit from the policy, including areas of most need. When relocation is being considered, no parts of the country are targeted, nor are any ruled out. Each location review is viewed on its own merits and decisions are reached on a case by case basis. Clydesdale will continue to be considered as a potential area for relocation.</p>

  <p>The Home Office decision refers only to financial support for the National Neighbourhood Watch Association an independent organisation which operates in England and Wales and which has no equivalent in Scotland. The Home Office will continue to provide support and advice for local schemes under the neighbourhood watch movement. Local neighbourhood watch schemes in Scotland are set up and supported by the police and the Executive provides support by way of free publicity materials. The question of the use of the Neighbourhood Watch logos by local schemes is currently being pursued by the Home Office with a view to taking action to assert Crown copyright to protect the name and standing of the neighbourhood watch movement.</p>

  <p>I have asked Graeme Munro, Chief Executive of Historic Scotland, to answer. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Where stained glass windows form part of a listed building or a building within an outstanding Conservation Area, Historic Scotland may grant aid their repair and conservation.</p>

  <p>Historic Scotland has no grant scheme to fund the storage of stained glass windows removed from demolished or altered buildings.</p>

  <p>Local authorities may grant aid the storage, conservation and reuse of stained glass windows through their own conservation grant schemes.</p>

  <p>I announced to Parliament on 22 April that the Cultural Commission would report to Ministers by June 2005. I reported the provisional budget of &pound;478,000 in answer to question S2W-8237 on 11 June 2004. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament's website, the facility for which can be found at:</p>

  <p><a href="/webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a>..</p>

  <p>Since the Commission's work will influence how we spend some &pound;120 million of public funds each year, I do not think the cost of engaging in this review is in any way disproportionate. Like all such bodies, the commission will seek to ensure the cost effective use of the resources we have made available for its work, and will be subject to audit.</p>

  <p>The Welfare of Animals (Transport) Order 1997 and the Export of Horses (Minimum Value) Order 1956, as amended, require that horses are fit for transport and that they meet minimum values. These values are &pound;715 for draft horses, &pound;495 for vanners, mules or jennets, &pound;220 for an ass, &pound;300 for ponies over 122 cms and up to 147 cms, &pound;145 for Shetland ponies up to 107 cms, and &pound;220 for all other ponies. A pony is an equine of 14.2 hands or less in height.</p>

  <p>Scottish Executive officials have been in regular contact with Defra to discuss the continuation of the minimum value rules.</p>

  <p>With the exception of the Highlands and Islands, the Farriers Act 1975 requires that any farriery must only be carried out by a registered farrier. The Scottish Executive is reviewing this legislation and will be issuing a consultation paper in the autumn seeking views on whether this exemption should continue to apply.</p>

  <p>Couping is a laymen's term used to describe the shoeing methods used to change the gait or stance of horses. Uneven or corrective shoeing can be done for welfare purposes to correct a physical defect in the animal and training on this type of corrective shoeing and the physiology of the horse is an important part of the training of both veterinary surgeons and farriers. The Scottish Executive have no records on how many farriers or veterinary surgeons carry out &quot;couping&quot;, nor on which breeds of horses.</p>

  <p>The Clydesdale Horse Society and the Farriers Registration Council have produced guidelines which limit the degree of couping which is considered acceptable. Views on this specific issue are being sought in the consultation paper issued by the Scottish Executive on 31 March 2004 on proposals to revise existing animal welfare legislation.</p>

  <p>It is for local authorities to identify cost effective measures to protect properties in their areas from flooding.

  <p>Throughout Scotland, local authorities and the emergency services take the issue of flood prevention and flood warning very seriously. In all areas likely to be affected by flooding, generic multi-agency response plans exist to deal with this risk. Furthermore, each area is represented by multi-agency flood liaison/response groups, which can be brought together at the earliest sign of potential risk of flooding. Further details of the multi agency response can be found on the Scottish Environment Protection Agency's website ( <a href="http://www.sepa.org.uk/" target="_blank">www.sepa.org.uk</a> ).</p>

  <p>However, management of flood defences is not a matter for the Executive: instead, this is for local authorities or landowners. While the availability of the proposed data-base will help in the management of assets it is not the Executive's responsibility to draw up asset management plans.</p>

  <p>The Executive have discussed the question of use of the beef national envelope with EU Commission officials on several occasions since February, when the announcement was made about use of the envelope. While there is flexibility in its use, notably in terms of the relative focus on quality or environmental objectives, EU legislation requires that it must be operated in a way which does not result in discrimination amongst producers. Hence it is not possible to operate a scheme which pays calves or cows at different rates in different areas.</p>

  <p>Also, the legislation specifies that once set, the rate of the national envelope cannot be changed until the legislation is reviewed - at the latest in 2009. Seeking change to this would mean a re-opening of the package agreed in June last year. This would require widespread support from other member states; there is no such support.</p>

  <p>A framework for taking action to control the spread of ragwort already exists in Scotland, under powers conferred by the Weeds Act 1959. Each year, the Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department undertakes an assessment of the level of the problem posed by ragwort and other injurious weeds in Scotland, by collating information on the complaints received by its area offices. Data has been compiled from 2003, and compared with similar information about complaints received in previous years. This information is used to determine the potential need in Scotland for changes in legislation or guidance.</p>

  <p>There are no current plans to increase regulation of the bus industry. It is for the Competition Commission to determine the conditions, if any, to be imposed on First Group to protect users of public transport from abuse of a monopoly situation. First Group will be required to comply with these conditions as a matter of competition law. There is no direct role for the Scottish Executive.

However, information received indicates that while there are regional variations in the differential in the cost of care, in some cases this is quite small.
