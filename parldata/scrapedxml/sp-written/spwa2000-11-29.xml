  <p>Company takeovers are a commercial matter for the companies concerned. The Scottish Executive will make representations about the employment consequences of company takeovers. Dawson management say that an offer has recently been made for the company but have not named them. In the event of a takeover the Executive will be entering very early discussions with the acquiring company to discuss their intentions, especially where there are concerns about future employment to establish whether public support would help in creating or safeguarding employment.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally. There are no specific detoxification services available for those aged under 16 who are drug dependent.</p>

  <p>There are three social work projects at present in Glasgow city, which work with young people aged 12 and up, and approximately 120 under 16s are in contact with social work addiction services at any one time. Young people may be accepted for detoxification in an adult ward on a case-by-case basis.</p>

  <p>With social work realignment of services, there will be nine realigned addiction services expected by April 2001, which will address drug and alcohol misuse of those between the age of 12&#8211;16. The Glasgow Drug Action Team recognises the need to ensure that targeted services are available to this age group.

  <p>There are several specific detoxification services available to drug dependant young mothers in Glasgow.</p>

  <p>There are two residential units in Glasgow with specific services for young mothers, and the Women&#8217;s Reproductive Health Service in Glasgow provides support and midwifery services to pregnant drug misusers. The Glasgow Royal Maternity Hospital is a national centre of excellence for the care and treatment of women who are drug dependent, and there are several other residential detoxification establishments and specialist health service addiction services.</p>

  <p>The Glasgow Drug Action Team reported that, in 1998-99, 120 pregnant drug misusers were provided with support from council addiction services. Pregnant drug misusers are seen by all 13 social work addiction services in the Glasgow area. There are also several services available to female drug misusers, some of whom will have children.</p>

  <p>The Drug Action Team Strategy for 1999-2003 contains plans to review the needs of pregnant drug misusers on methadone, and to develop targeted services for babies and children affected by drug misuse. With the social work realignment of services there are seven new family support posts to work with families and pregnant drug misusers.</p>

  <p>The employer-led National Training Organisations are responsible for providing information about current and future skills requirements based upon detailed knowledge of their sectors. NTOs operate on a UK-wide basis and audit the skills requirements of their sectors by a variety of means, such as:</p>

  <p>conducting Skills Foresight surveys, and publishing the results;</p>

  <p>gathering labour market intelligence, and</p>

  <p>participating in skills benchmarking.</p>

  <p>Robust labour market information and intelligence systems are essential if sectoral skills shortages are to be forecast accurately and timeously.

However, Scottish Enterprise is committed to co-operating with the local authorities concerned to explore the economic development opportunities which will be created by the completion of the M74.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what steps it is taking, in partnership with Scottish Enterprise Glasgow, Glasgow City Council and developers, to deal with any underlying shortage of IT-efficient, large-floorplate office accommodation in Glasgow city centre and peripheral locations such as business parks.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-11-29.13.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80131" speakername="Ms Wendy Alexander" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa1129.htm#8">

  <p>Scottish Enterprise Glasgow (SEG) continuously monitors market availability and suitability to ensure that all aspects of demand for office accommodation in Glasgow can be accommodated. SEG in partnership with Glasgow City Council has over the last five years assembled and promoted the Strategic Sites Programme, which allows IT companies who wish to build their own facility to purchase serviced sites direct from SEG at seven locations throughout Glasgow. In addition, SEG in partnership with Services to Software operate a incubator facility at 150 St Vincent Street which provides small offices on flexible terms with associated infrastructure and business support facilities. The incubator facility has been fully occupied since it opened three years ago.</p>

  <p>The city centre office market with a total stock of some 20 million square feet represents the largest office sector outwith London. Modern large-scale occupiers with a heavy IT requirement typically require increasingly large floorplates. This is to achieve economies of scale, to provide raised access flooring for underfloor cabling and air conditioning, and a floor to ceiling height of c.2.5 metres. To date there has been no evidence to suggest that the private sector has been unable to provide this standard of accommodation. However, due to the continuing trend for larger floorplates there is increasing evidence of development activity in the Broomielaw. This is primarily due to the fact that the traditional grid iron layout of the city centre cannot provide the size of floorplate some large companies require whereas the Broomielaw can. SEG together with Glasgow City Council and private sector developers have under consideration proposals for the development of business parks at several locations outside of the city centre. SEG in partnership with the private sector are creating a business park at Pacific Quay adjacent to the new National Science Centre. It is envisaged that Pacific Quay will appeal to companies with large IT requirements in the creative industries sector, for example media, design, and software development companies.</p>

  <p>In September Henry McLeish also announced the proposed inner-city Science Park development adjacent to Strathclyde University at a site which has been assembled by SEG at George Street/Albion Street to the east of the city centre. This projected &pound;60 million development will ultimately provide c.500,000 square feet of office accommodation aimed specifically at target sectors of the economy which includes software, optoelectronics and biotechnology.</p>

  <p>Following the adoption by the Commission on 14 April of guidelines for the Community initiative EQUAL, concerning equal opportunities in employment, the Scottish Executive has worked with the UK Government and the other devolved administrations to prepare proposals for a UK plan. Scottish organisations were consulted on its possible content in the summer. Subsequently, the UK Government made proposals to the Commission and Scottish Executive officials are now involved in the continuing discussions with the Commission. We have kept the European Committee informed of developments. I expect implementation of the EQUAL programme to begin in the New Year.</p>

  <p>Guidelines for INTERREG II, concerned with inter-regional co-operation were adopted in May. As with EQUAL, the Scottish Executive is working closely with the UK Government, in the development of programmes for the North Sea, Atlantic and North West Europe programme areas. The Scottish Executive has sole UK responsibility for the Northern Periphery Programme, involving the Northern parts of Scotland, Finland, Sweden and Norway as well as other North Atlantic countries such as Iceland. These programmes are being developed in co-operation with other respective member states and &quot;third countries&quot;. Again we have kept the European Committee informed of developments and expect implementation to begin in the New Year.</p>

  <p>This information is not held by the Scottish Executive.

The outcome of that research was published by the institute in June and is available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. no. 9793).</p>

  <p>Mr Davis&#8217; report will be published on 29 November. Amanda Duncan&#8217;s death was a tragedy and I sympathise deeply with the grief which her parents have experienced in consequence of it. I am grateful to Mr Davis for the thorough investigation which he has carried out and the well considered recommendations he has made. As he says in his report, it is essential that we learn all the lessons that can be learned from this incident, and I believe that he has indicated clearly what these lessons are. It is now for those to whom his recommendations are directed, including the Scottish Executive, Tayside Fire Board and the Inspectorate themselves, to do all that we can to ensure that there is no repetition of the events which led to this investigation.</p>

  <p>The Executive does not hold information on water levels in the River Clyde. However, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency holds records of flows from their network of gauging stations in the Clyde catchment, some of which date back 40 years. We understand that there seems to be little change in average flows during this period but a trend over the last 25 years of increased high flows. The relationship between river flow and water level depends on local river conditions. The impacts on Clydeside of any increases in water levels are matters for the consideration by the authorities concerned.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for walking infrastructure rests with local authorities. Information on the number and location of projects carried out by local authorities is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive can, however, use the Public Transport Fund to enable authorities to carry out projects which assist pedestrians. Dumfries and Galloway Council were awarded &pound;0.9 million over three years (1999-2002) for an integrated package of measures for Dumfries which included a large element to improve cycling and walking infrastructure in the town. Midlothian Council were awarded &pound;0.802 million from this fund for a pedestrian and cyclists&#8217; overbridge at Sheriffhall.</p>

  <p>Most recently, I announced on 9 November that six further projects to improve facilities for walking and cycling will receive a total of &pound;4.3 million from the Public Transport Fund. Those projects which include a walking element are located in East Renfrewshire, Stranraer, Kilmarnock, the Helensburgh and Lomond area and Renfrewshire.</p>

  <p>Scottish Natural Heritage and the Forestry Commission have also funded or carried out projects to improve access facilities for walkers and other users. Information on these projects is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>Since the strategy was launched in November 1999 we have been acting on a number of fronts to turn the strategy into action, including:</p>

  <p>We have asked local authorities to spend &pound;10 million from this year on supporting carers, double the funding previously earmarked. We will check that these resources are used effectively and in discussion with local carers groups.</p>

  <p>The NHS Helpline was extended from April to provide information and advice to carers.</p>

  <p>We undertook a major national media campaign in the spring to alert carers to the strategy and the helpline.</p>

  <p>In May we made information packs for young carers available to all primary, secondary and independent schools.</p>

  <p>In November we announced grant awards of &pound;500,000 over the next three years to 11 voluntary sector projects aimed at supporting carers and implementing the strategy at a local level.</p>

  <p>A working group considering whether changes in the law are needed to ensure carers are properly supported is expected to make recommendations to the Executive by the end of the year. We plan to consult widely on its proposals.</p>

  <p>We will continue to work to improve the support and recognition given to carers.</p>

  <p>The interim report produced by the Network Study Group, which comprised Scottish Power, Scottish and Southern Energy, the Scottish Renewables Forum, Inter-University Centre for Economic Renewable Power Delivery, Ofgem and the Department of Trade and Industry has been placed in SPICe.</p>

  <p>The study group has identified that around &pound;210 million would need to be invested in the Scottish transmission networks in order to allow renewable electricity generation to expand so that it can meet the expected demand arising from the Renewables (Scotland) Obligation and the Renewables Obligation in England and Wales. This is considerably higher than previous estimates, but it provides a good basis for further examination of the costs involved in meeting our renewables target, which were set subject to the cost to the consumer not being excessive.</p>

  <p>I have asked the study group to continue its work to update the 1993 report on the renewables potential in Scotland and so that a more detailed assessment of the options and the costs can be made.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) is obliged to inform the Executive if it is likely that its expenditure on any individual accounts will exceed agreed estimates by more than &pound;50,000. The SQA notified us in September of a likely deficit in this financial year due to additional work undertaken to resolve the problems with Diet 2000. The full financial implications are currently being quantified and will be discussed with SQA in detail.</p>

  <p>Deficits were projected in the annual budget estimates exercise in December in each of the two previous financial years. The establishment of SQA in 1997 and the associated costs of merging the Scottish Examination Board and the Scottish Vocational Education Council led to a substantial deficit in the first year of operations which the organisation has since gradually reduced.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many publicly funded projects aimed at encouraging cycling have been completed since 1997 and what the location was of each such project.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-11-29.53.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80134" speakername="Sarah Boyack" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa1129.htm#39">

  <p>Responsibility for cycling infrastructure rests with local authorities. Information on the number and location of projects carried out by local authorities is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>In 1998-99, however, the Scottish Office funded 35 projects through the Cycle Challenge Fund. The locations of these projects are listed in Table 1 below. The total project costs were just under &pound;2 million and the grant awarded was &pound;0.58 million. An evaluation of the outcome of the fund is currently under way.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Office, and now the Scottish Executive, has, through the Trunk Roads Cycling Initiative, funded those stretches of the National Cycle Network which interface with or cross the trunk road network. Completed works are valued at over &pound;6 million. Details are given in Table 2 below.</p>

  <p>Finally, the Scottish Executive can use the Public Transport Fund to enable authorities to carry out projects which assist cyclists. Dumfries and Galloway Council were awarded &pound;0.9 million over three years (1999-2002) for an integrated package of measures for Dumfries which included a large element to improve cycling and walking infrastructure in the town. Midlothian Council were awarded &pound;0.802 million from this fund for a pedestrian and cyclists&#8217; overbridge at Sheriffhall.</p>

  <p>Most recently, I announced on 9 November that six further projects to improve facilities for walking and cycling will receive a total of &pound;4.3 million from the Public Transport Fund. Those projects which include a cycling element are located in East Renfrewshire, Stranraer, Kilmarnock, the Helensburgh and Lomond area, Perth and Kinross, and Renfrewshire.</p>

  <p>The Voluntary Issues Review Group which is chaired by Jackie Baillie has met on seven occasions. It has discussed a number of issues related to the impact on voluntary organisations of the criminal record checks which will become available under Part V of the Police Act 1997.

  <p>The Part V Voluntary Issues Review Group, which is chaired by Jackie Baillie, has been examining a number of issues, of which charges is one, related to the possible impact on voluntary organisations of the introduction of criminal record checks under Part V of the Police Act 1997.</p>

  <p>I expect the group to report by the end of the calendar year on the outcome of its deliberations. Decisions about charges will be made as soon as possible thereafter.</p>

  <p>Following consultation earlier this year, I laid before Parliament on Friday 17 November, proposed regulations which would increase the packaging recovery targets which companies with obligations under the packaging recovery scheme have to meet in 2001. These are aimed at ensuring the UK meets the Directive&#8217;s targets. Subject to Parliament&#8217;s approval, the Regulations will come into force on 1 January 2001.</p>

  <p>The packaging recovery scheme is the means by which the UK complies with the Packaging Directive. It was designed to operate in a unitary way across Great Britain. It is therefore not possible to disaggregate data relating to compliance in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Working on the assumption that Scotland&#8217;s share of the UK obligation is approximately 10% of the total, the Executive is satisfied that Scotland will meet the Directive&#8217;s targets.</p>
