  <p>The budget allocations for agri-environment schemes (including the Organic Aid Scheme) are programmed in the Scottish Rural Development Plan for the period 2003-06. It will be for Scottish ministers to decide on the allocation of resources in light of the priorities established by the partnership agreement.</p>

  <p>Support is also provided to the organic sector through SEERADs&#39; Processing and Marketing Grant Schemes (PMG) and the Marketing Development Scheme (MDS) Since May 2001, almost &#163;4 million has been awarded to support the processing and marketing of organic produce through these schemes.</p>

The Commission is currently working to conclude all cases received prior to 30 September 2002 by 31 March 2004. Thereafter, the Commission will aim to reduce the review period for all cases, from date of acceptance, to 12 months by 2006.</p>

  <p>The Auditor General&#39;s report contained 42 recommendations mainly for local authorities, the National Health Service and the Scottish Executive. An action plan is being drawn up to take these recommendations forward.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what resources will be made available to any special school whose pupil numbers decrease as a result of a presumption to mainstreaming legislation, in the light of the Auditor General for Scotland report, <em>Moving to mainstream: The inclusion of pupils with special educational needs in mainstream schools</em> .</p>

  <p>The Executive has no plans to make resources available specifically to special schools whose pupil numbers decrease. I refer the member to the answer given to question S2W-1447 for details of resources allocated to local authorities.

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer why the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body is unable to comply with its obligations regarding the payment of employer pension contributions to the personal pensions of MSPs&#39; staff, as required by changes to Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority regulations in April 2001, if it uses the direct debit scheme.</p>

  <p>: Under the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority an employer has obligations to maintain a record of payments made, send a record of payments made to the pension provider and pay the correct amount of contribution over by the 19th of the month following the pay run in which the contributions are collected. Under the direct debit scheme, the pension provider initiates when and how much to collect. The Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body could not, therefore, guarantee that the correct amount was collected and paid over by the due date, as required under Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority regulations.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer what steps were taken, and by whom, to advise affected employees of the changes being made to the method of payment by the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body regarding employer contributions to the personal pensions of MSPs&#39; staff where such payments were being made under the direct debit scheme.</p>

  <p>: The change in the method of payment was a procedural change between the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body and the pension providers. Since none of the pension providers raised any objections to the change or envisaged that any problems would be encountered, it was not deemed necessary to advise staff.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer what consultation was held with pension providers prior to the decision of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to withdraw from the direct debit scheme in relation to the payment of employer contributions to the personal pensions of MSPs&#39; staff and what the outcome of such any such consultation was.</p>

  <p>: The pension providers were notified in writing six weeks prior to the withdrawal of the direct debit system. At the same time they were advised that future payments would be made by cheque or by BACS if the pension provider advised the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body of the relevant bank details. The outcome of this was that many of the providers contacted the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to advise of their preferred method of payment. A few of the providers did not make contact, therefore, in accordance with the correspondence sent to them, regular monthly cheques were issued as a matter of course.</p>

  <p>: Under the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority rules an employer has an obligation to pay the correct amount of contribution over by the 19th of the month following the pay run in which the contributions are collected. Experience has shown that the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body cannot guarantee this under the direct debit system. As a result and to ensure that the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body continues to meet its obligations under the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority rules, there are no plans to reinstate the direct debit scheme.</p>
