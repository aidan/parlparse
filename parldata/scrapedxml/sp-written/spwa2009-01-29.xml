  <p>Information on the number of under 18s arrested for purchasing or attempting to purchase alcohol is not held centrally, only the number of offences recorded. There were 115 of these offences recorded in 2007-08 and 131 in 2006-07.</p>

  <p>Information on the number of under 18s charged for purchasing or attempting to purchase alcohol is not held centrally. Criminal proceedings data for 2007-08 is still being processed and the data is therefore not available at this time. The 2007-08 data is planned for release in April 2009. There were seven persons proceeded against in court for this offence in 2006-07.</p>

  <p>The statistics dealing with recorded crime and court proceedings are not directly comparable as a person may be proceeded against for more than one crime involving more than one victim and there is the possibility that the crime recorded by the police may be altered in the course of judicial proceedings. Also a crime may be recorded by the police in one year and court proceedings concluded in a subsequent year.</p>

  <p>Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education reported on the consistency, effectiveness and efficiency of education authorities in implementing the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 in November 2007.</p>

  <p>The report identified the need to improve the consistency with which the legislation surrounding co-ordinated support plans is interpreted. This includes co-ordinated support plans for children and young people with autism.</p>

  <p>I have asked officials to convene a short term working group to advise on co-ordinated support plan related matters and help facilitate the development of any further guidance or training. The group has held its first meeting. The key aim is to provide advice on how to improve the effectiveness of co-ordinated support plans for all children and young people who require them including those with autism. The initial outcomes of the group are expected to be available around spring 2009.</p>

  <p>The government will also soon publish <em>The Autism Toolbox</em>, an autism resource for Scottish local authorities and schools. This draws on a range of advice, experience and research to support education authorities and school staff to manage the day to day practice of supporting and teaching pupils with autism. The resource highlights the importance of multi-agency working including the preparation of co-ordinated support plans and considers the role of different professionals in supporting children with autism and their families.</p>

  <p>Capital charges and depreciation associated with the operation of the farms in and around Inverness can be found in the Annual Accounts section of the Crofters Commission Annual Reports for 2003-04 (Bib. number 33883), 2004-05 (Bib. number 37580), 2005-06 (Bib. number 40519), 2006-07 (Bib. number 43711) and 2007-08 (Bib. number 46774). These do not take account of any new investment required to refurbish the farms to a modern standard.</p>

  <p>The indicative cost of &pound;2,500 for future hire costs, at less than 120 bulls hired per annum, drawn from section 3.1 of the independent <em>Bull Hire and Stud Farms Option Appraisal</em> (Bib. number 47394), does not include an element for capital charges or depreciation. The cost of depreciation would require to be added in order to calculate the full costs of the Bull Hire Scheme, including for State Aid <em>de minimis</em> recording purposes. Inclusion of depreciation at the current level would have the effect of raising the estimated total hire costs to some &pound;2,900 per bull.</p>

  <p>Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a widely accepted international measure of economic performance and therefore an emphasis on GDP is relevant when measuring our economic performance against that of our European counterparts.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s Purpose is increasing sustainable economic growth, and the Government Economic Strategy identifies the need to balance economic growth and the important social, regional and inter-generational equity objectives of the government. Our purpose targets have been set to track progress in the drivers of economic growth and in the delivery of our desired characteristics of growth. These targets are further supplemented by our national outcomes, and indicators, as set out in the National Performance Framework &ndash; this includes a National Indicator on the Ecological Footprint.</p>

  <p>An Additional Measures of Progress Steering group was established in 2006 to review the evidence of the options for additional and improved ways of measuring progress. In concluding its work the Steering Group presented three recommendations on additional and improved ways of measuring progress to Scottish Government ministers in July 2008 &ndash; including a recommendation that the Scottish Government should continue to monitor developments in wider measures of progress that incorporate wellbeing. The Scottish Government is now taking forward each of these recommendations.</p>

  <p>NHS Ayrshire and Arran advise that there were 10 deaths in NHS Ayrshire and Arran between June and December 2008 which were directly attributed to Clostridium difficile. It should be noted that this is a provisional figure only.</p>

  <p>Official data on the number of Clostridium difficile related deaths, by NHS board and by hospital, is published by the General Register for Scotland (GROS) on an annual basis. I am advised that data for 2008 are not yet available but will be published by GROS in August 2009.</p>

  <p>The national HAI reporting template recently introduced now requires NHS boards to collect real time data on infection rates by hospital and specialty.

  <p>Health Protection Scotland (HPS) advise there is some evidence to suggest that the 078 strain can cause more serious disease but that cases present in a younger age group and are more likely to be community acquired. Further studies need to be undertaken to better understand the virulence of this strain. Meantime, control of clostridium difficile is best achieved by prudent prescribing and good infection control measures.</p>

  <p>The Office of Fair Trading is expected to publish its report on property managers in Scotland in February 2009. The Scottish Government will give close consideration to its conclusions and recommendations.</p>

  <p>We have announced we will work with the industry to support the establishment of a national accreditation scheme for residential property managers. It is intended that the scheme will be voluntary and open to all sectors offering property management services. It will be underpinned by an effective complaints system linking to robust third party redress and a requirement for its members to meet high standards of service. We have also issued an updated Planning Advice Note (PAN 65) which stresses the importance of ensuring long term management of new greenspace is considered in planning applications.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers cannot intervene in private disputes about the terms of contracts made between homeowners and property managers. The regulation of business associations and consumer protection are reserved matters.</p>

  <p>This issue is recognised in the Curriculum for Excellence (which covers all stages of primary and secondary education) experiences and outcomes which include pupils learning to assess and manage risk, protect themselves and others, and to reduce the potential for harm when possible.</p>

  <p>The national Violence Reduction Unit (VRU) - funded by the Scottish Government - promotes programmes and materials on the dangers of knife carrying to schools and young people as part of their anti-violence campaign. The VRU has received further funding to develop a new initiative working in partnership with senior medics from Glasgow - <em>Medics Against Violence</em>. This includes medical practitioners visiting secondary schools and talking with S2 pupils.</p>

  <p>It is up to individual schools, youth organisations and local authorities to decide on which resources to use from the wide range of materials and educational programmes available on the dangers of illegal knife carrying, as they are best placed to judge the needs of the children and young people in their communities.</p>

  <p>In the 12 months to 30 September 2008, 11,146 charges indicating breach of bail conditions were reported to procurators fiscal.</p>

  <p>The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service database is a live operational database which mainly tracks the processing of the substantive charges received from the Police and Specialist Reporting Agencies. While additional charges for breaching bail through failure to appear may subsequently be added as a separate charge in individual cases, accurate and complete statistical information relating to such charges is not available.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The information relating to charges indicating breach of bail has been extracted from the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service&rsquo;s Case Management Database. The database is a live, operational database used to manage the processing of reports submitted to procurators fiscal by the police and other reporting agencies. If a Procurator Fiscal amends a charge submitted by a reporting agency the database will record details only of the amended charge.</p>

  <p>2. The database is charge-based. The figures quoted therefore relate to the number of charges rather than the number of individuals charged or the number of incidents that gave rise to such charges.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has no specific control over the quality of bloodlines of bulls offered for hire by private enterprises. However, successor arrangements could set baseline criteria for the hire animals that would attract assistance.</p>

  <p>There is a range of central government funding streams from which bodies such as the Glasgow and Clyde Valley Green Network may benefit. This includes grant-aid under the Scottish Rural Development Programme (e.g. Forestry Challenge Funds, Forestry Options under Rural Development Contracts) for eligible woodlands within the network area. In addition, the Government provides funding to Greenspace Scotland, one of whose purposes is to support a Scotland-wide network of greenspace partnerships and organisations.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is providing local authorities with a total funding package this year and next amounting to &pound;22.8 billion. The vast majority of this funding will be provided by means of a block grant. It is the responsibility of each local authority to allocate the total financial resources available to it on the basis of local needs and priorities having first fulfilled its statutory obligations and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities.</p>

  <p>In light of the wide public interest at the time and the fact that urgent representations had been made by parliamentarians from four different parties expressing concern about the process and timetable for consideration of this development proposal by the planning authority (Cairngorms National Park Authority) and by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, I sought information from those bodies about those matters. The purpose of the briefing note which my Private Secretary sent to ministers on 7 December 2007 was therefore to provide them with information on the processes and timetable for the planning authority&rsquo;s consideration of the planning application. This included information which had been provided by Cairngorms National Park Authority (CNPA) about their timetable for handling issues raised by the highway authority as a consultee on the application. These issues were referred to in the papers issued to the CNPA Planning Committee (and also published on the CNPA website) on 7 December 2007.</p>

  <p>Schools Renewables Development Officers are working with Learning and Teaching Scotland (LTS) to ensure that the educational implications and benefits of the package of measures announced on 5 January are most effectively integrated into the Curriculum for Excellence. The Development Officers are working with individual authorities and schools, and the eco-schools programme, to help them all make best use of the learning opportunities presented by increased installation and use of renewable technologies.</p>

  <p>The announced package of measures will help meet the government&rsquo;s commitments to having renewable generation in every school and to contributing to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050. The educative benefits of &quot;greener&quot; school buildings and facilities are also important messages for the whole school community. LTS will therefore continue to support pupils and teachers in sharing knowledge, information and good practice in relation to how schools can reduce carbon emissions and make increased use of renewable technologies, including through to a Sustainable Development Education resource within their own website.</p>

  <p>The Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is the only salmonid species listed on Annex II of the EC Habitats Directive (species for which SACs are required to be designated) which is native to Scotland. Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) undertakes a rolling programme of Site Condition Monitoring (SCM) for all Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) in accordance with common standards agreed with other UK countryside agencies and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.</p>

  <p>SNH advises that its condition assessment of Atlantic salmon SACs is based on data from a variety of sources including the Scottish Fisheries Co-ordination Centre and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. SNH also commissions further data collection from other parties where necessary.</p>

  <p>Anyone who observes signs of any notifiable disease in wild salmonid stocks should contact the Fisheries Research Services in Aberdeen who will conduct an investigation.</p>

  <p>NHS Grampian has provided information on the value of Standard Rate VAT payments for the financial year 2007-08, the last financial year for which information is available. The total value of these payments is &pound;25.396 million set against combined Resource Limits of &pound;758.408 million (Revenue &pound;729.245 million and Capital &pound;29.163 million) for the same period.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3O-5488 by Nicola Sturgeon on 25 January 2009, what saving NHS Grampian can expect in relation to the reduction of the standard rate of VAT without consideration of other changes to VAT rules.</p>

  <p>NHS Grampian has provided very broad estimates of potential changes to their costs. The reduction is estimated at &pound;1.7 million (Revenue &pound;1.4 million and Capital &pound;0.3 million) during the financial year 2009-10 as a result of this one specific temporary change to the standard rate of VAT. This is set against an estimated draft Resource Limit baseline budget of &pound;699.6 million for 2009-10 (Revenue &pound;667.0 million and Capital &pound;32.6 million).</p>

  <p>Care must be taken with these figures which are one in a number of recent changes to VAT legislation, some of which are a recurring cost to NHS organisations. These additional costs relate to VAT rules for agency fees for medical staff, restrictions on reclaimable VAT on other agency staff, except for nurses, and the removal of a concession that currently allows employment businesses to exclude the wages element from the calculation of VAT. This will have an estimated recurring impact for NHS Grampian up to &pound;1.2 million.</p>
