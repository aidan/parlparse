  <p>The national forest estate has been subject to a portfolio analysis, objectively assessing each part of the estate against delivery of economic, social and environmental benefits. This analysis will be used to determine priorities for sale of national forest land which contributes little to the delivery of Forestry Commission Scotland&rsquo;s objectives. Details of the process will be published in the new year as part of a consultation on the framework strategic plan for the national forest estate.</p>

  <p>All trainee doctors with appropriate qualifications and experience can apply for specialty training posts. An additional 30 training posts at ST3 level have been created this year across medical specialities. This should ensure that there are sufficient places available for those who wish to apply for higher specialty training but who are not currently in an ST2 post.</p>

  <p>Local authorities, as strategic housing bodies are required to produce Local Housing Strategies which set out plans to address housing needs in their areas.</p>

  <p>In 2007 local authorities were specifically asked to consider, when updating their Local Housing Strategies, how they could take action on empty homes to help tackle housing need anywhere in their areas. Comhairle nan Eilean Siar intends to commission research into empty homes in the Western Isles.</p>

  <p>The Western Isles Local Housing Strategy 2004-09 contains an objective to bring back into use 15 empty homes to provide affordable accommodation in the Greater Stornoway area by 2009. The Strategy also contains an objective to support the inward migration of at least 30 households on average a year.</p>

  <p>Compliance with the reduction in working hours for doctors in training under the New Deal contract and the Working Time Regulations (WTR) is the responsibility of NHS boards as employers. The Scottish Government aims to help the NHS to achieve compliance and has issued a number of pieces of guidance, disseminated information on good practice arising from work carried out elsewhere in the UK and has held seminars and (Hospital at Night) H@N Forums.</p>

  <p>H@N is one of a series of measures NHS Scotland boards are currently introducing to help facilitate compliance with the European Working Time Directive by the target date of August 2009. Boards have appointed H@N co-ordinators whose task is to facilitate the introduction of H@N schemes and new ways of working to ensure the continued provision of safe and sustainable services for patients while maintaining the educational experience and reducing the hours that junior doctors work.</p>

  <p>The one enforcement notice was served on 11 July 2007 by North Ayrshire Council on Scottish Water under section 26 of the Water Services etc (Scotland) Act 2005 and was in relation to Largs wastewater treatment works in Ayrshire. At the time, the Largs waste water treatment works was in the commissioning stages and had not been formally adopted by Scottish Water.</p>

  <p>The enforcement notice was in relation to failure of the odour control unit, malodour arising from specific parts of the works and general housekeeping issues.</p>

  <p>Scottish Water ensured that remedial actions were undertaken to address the issues mentioned in the enforcement notice. Dialogue continued and there were site visits involving Scottish Water and local authority officers.</p>

  <p>In a letter dated 29 October 2007, North Ayrshire Council concluded that no further action was necessary in regard to the enforcement notice.</p>
