  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answers to questions S3W-36066 and S3W-36059 by Stewart Stevenson on 30 September 2010, whether its &quot;regular ongoing contact about ferry services in Scotland with a range of public bodies&quot; included discussions with (a) Orkney Islands Council, (b) Shetland Islands Council and (c) Argyll and Bute Council regarding its plan to extend the Road Equivalent Tariff pilot on the Western Isles routes for a further 12 months before that decision was (i) taken and (ii) announced.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what its position is regarding the judgement by the European Court of Human Rights in 2004 in the Makaratzis versus Greece case that there exists &quot;a primary duty on the State to secure the right to life by putting in place an appropriate legal and administrative framework defining the limited circumstances in which law-enforcement officials may use force and firearms&quot; and whether it has put such a framework in place.</p>

  <p>The responsibility to put in place an appropriate legal and administrative framework as required by Article 2 and Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights in relation to firearms lies with the UK Government. The Firearms Act 1968 puts in place the legislative framework for the control of firearms in the United Kingdom. The UK Government has also issued a code of practice, &quot;The Manual of Guidance on the Management, Command and Deployment of Armed Officers&quot; which is endorsed by the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to the supplementary to question S3O-11163 by Kenny MacAskill on 1 July 2010 ( <em>Official Report</em> , c.28175), that the police are only bound by those sections of the Firearms Act 1968 that specifically refer to them, whether this means that the police are not bound by other parts of the Act that do not specifically mention police officers or agents of the Crown.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-10-21.S3W-36630.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80341" speakername="Kenny MacAskill" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa1021.htm#3">

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s understanding is that Section 54(1) of the Firearms Act 1968 expressly applies only sections 1, 2, 7 to 13 and 26A to 32 of the Act to persons in the service of Her Majesty. Section 54(3) includes members of a police force within the definition of those in the service of Her Majesty. Our understanding therefore is that police officers are not bound by parts of the Act which are not specifically listed in Section 54(1).</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it considers that chief constables have the power to issue XREP shotgun Tasers to frontline officers without authorisation from ministers.</p>

  <p>Police forces are deemed to be in the service of Her Majesty under section 54(3) of the Firearms Act 1968 and they are therefore lawfully able to acquire items prohibited under section 5 of the Act, including X12 Tasers, which discharge XREP ammunition. The police do not need authorisation from Scottish Ministers in order to purchase, issue or deploy Tasers. No Scottish police force has used X12 Tasers.</p>

  <p>In response to intelligence in 2006 that organised crime groups were becoming increasingly involved in cannabis cultivation, distribution and supply, Scotland's police forces launched joint intelligence and enforcement operations right across the country to crack down upon these plants wherever and whenever they occurred. The figures provided show the results of increased enforcement and detection by the police to expose these criminal enterprises and bring those responsible to justice.</p>

  <p>The <em>Vision for the Vale of Leven Hospital</em> , approved by the NHS board and I during 2009, set the site for the new health and care Centre within the grounds of the Vale of Leven Hospital and adjacent to the main entrance to the hospital site.</p>

  <p>The outline business case for the new centre included a site options appraisal which considered all other sites in the locality, including the site at Mitchell Way, around which a possible expansion to the land available has most recently been considered. At the time of the site options appraisal it was not just the size of the site that resulted in it scoring lower than the preferred option at the hospital.</p>

  <p>In taking the project forward, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has now selected Laing O'Rourke as the principal supply chain partner, who will work with the board, under the Framework Scotland procurement process, to develop the design for the new centre, establish the target price for the new centre and contribute to the preparation of the full business case (FBC). The FBC will be the process that establishes the timelines for the construction, and subsequent occupation, of the new centre.</p>

  <p>Clinical nurse specialists for cleft lip and palate care in NHS Lothian and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde have not been withdrawn to cover general nursing duties.</p>

  <p>Over the last six months the two clinical nurse specialists for cleft lip and palate care in NHS Lothian have worked a total of 12 hours in theatre recovery at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh. This time has been used to refresh their skills and, more importantly, to facilitate education for non-specialist staff on the post-operative care of children with cleft lip and palate conditions. This latter element is a key component of the role of the clinical nurse specialist and entirely in keeping with our plans for continuous improvement of the quality of care for all patients. In NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde the hours and working patterns of the clinical nurse specialists in the cleft lip and palate service remain unaltered.</p>

  <p>The detailed information requested is currently being collated and I will write to the member as soon as the information is available and a copy will be placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 51883).</p>

  <p>Work on the Cabinet&rsquo;s summer programme was carried out across directorates as part of officials&rsquo; normal duties and is not therefore separately quantified.</p>
