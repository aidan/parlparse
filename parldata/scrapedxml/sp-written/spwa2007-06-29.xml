  <p>Discussions are still at a very early stage and the views and advice of key stakeholders, including the SFA and EventScotland, will be sought before a feasibility study of a Scottish bid for the 2016 European football championships is undertaken.</p>

  <p>However, the Scottish Government believes that the 2016 European football championships would be a great event for Scotland as they would boost Scotland&rsquo;s profile on the world stage, provide long-lasting benefits to Scotland&rsquo;s sporting infrastructure and provide a catalyst to increased sports participation leading to health benefits.</p>

  <p>Yes. Section 56(1) of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 provides:</p>

  <p>&quot;Subject to any express provision contained in this Act or any Act passed after this Act, a local authority may arrange for the discharge of any of their functions by a committee of the authority, a sub-committee, an officer of the authority or by any other local authority in Scotland.&quot;</p>

  <p>This would enable for functions of a planning authority to be discharged by an officer of the authority.</p>

  <p>The Planning etc (Scotland) Act 2006 will, when in force, require each planning authority to draw up a scheme of delegation to allow decisions to be made by its officers. It prohibits, however, delegation of certain cases of application requiring enhanced scrutiny.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers can, under general administrative legal principles, also delegate their decision-making functions to officials.</p>

  <p>As indicated in my response to S3W-419, the views of the local community and public opinion may carry some weight in the decision making process as material considerations. It is for the planning authority to determine, in the particular circumstances of the case, the extent to which representations, in whatever form, are material considerations and the weight to be attached to each. The authority should have regard to Scottish Planning Policy 1 in reaching such a determination.</p>
