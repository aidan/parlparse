  <p>Both Midlothian and East Lothian Councils&rsquo; schools PPP projects were regarded as pathfinder projects as they were the early projects in the development of the current &pound;2.5 billion schools PPP programme. Partnerships UK provided specialist advice and expertise in support of these projects and their involvement was beneficial to other local authorities taking forward future PPP proposals for schools. Specifically, expertise was gained on many management interface and commercial issues, and the Scottish Schools Standard PPP Contract was developed.</p>

  <p>Currently the contractual aspects of the Scottish passenger rail franchise are administered by the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) on behalf of and under direction from the Scottish ministers. The recent UK Government White Paper, <em>the Future of Rail</em> , announced the intended abolition of the SRA and that the direct management of the franchise will in future fall to the Scottish ministers.</p>

  <p>Under the terms of the contract, the franchisee's failure to meet financial commitments in three respects can lead ultimately to termination of the franchise:</p>

  <p>1. by a failure to keep the ratio of revenue to costs at or above the contracted level;</p>

  <p>2. by becoming insolvent, or by non-payment to SRA or Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive of any sum owed to them, and</p>

  <p>3. by breaching, to a material extent, any of the other provisions of the franchise which relate to financial elements of the agreement, for example, collection of fares at stations and on trains.</p>

  <p>In the event of any of the above occurring, the SRA, acting under direction from the Scottish ministers, can either issue a termination notice and terminate the franchise, or require the franchisee to remedy the breach.</p>

  <p>In January 2002 the Strategic Rail Authority set out a number of enhancements across the GB rail network which could be supported through their Incremental Output Statement programme.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive jointly funded a package of platform lengthening works in Scotland in 2003 which comprised the following Incremental Output Statement schemes:</p>

  <p>East Kilbride to Glasgow Central platform extensions to allow six-railcar working;</p>

  <p>Edinburgh Waverly to Bathgate platform extensions to allow six-railcar working, and</p>

  <p>Fife Circle platform extensions to allow six-railcar working.</p>

  <p>The total works, including additional platform extension works between Edinburgh Waverley to Dunblane, is around &pound;14 million. The Scottish Executive is providing &pound;5.9 million of funding, which is 42% of the total costs. The Scottish Executive has not funded any incremental output statements.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally. The employment and deployment of teachers in publicly funded schools is a matter for local authorities (LAs).</p>

  <p>To teach in a LA school a teacher must be registered with the General Teaching Council for Scotland, the professional body for maintaining standards in the teaching profession in Scotland. To do so they must satisfy the council&rsquo;s requirements with regards to academic qualifications, professional training and relevant experience.</p>

  <p>All schools are likely to rely on supply teachers to some extent to ensure the maintenance of educational provision for pupils when teachers are absent from their normal duties.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive carries out an annual teacher workforce planning exercise to ensure at a national level there are adequate numbers of teachers for publicly funded schools. From time to time in particular secondary subjects local supply and demand may not always be perfectly matched. As part of the teacher workforce planning exercise to help improve the position, subjects are prioritised for intake to initial teacher education courses with Higher Education Institutions having flexibility to adjust priorities to meet local demand. An element for supply teachers included in the teacher work planning exercise increased in 2004 from 5% to an allowance of 7% in primary education and 6% in secondary.</p>

  <p>Information on teacher vacancies by LA is contained in a set of tables <em>Full-time Equivalent Teacher Vacancies in Schools</em> a copy of which has been placed in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 32903).</p>
