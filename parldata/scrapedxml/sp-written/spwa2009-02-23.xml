  <p>A local community comprising a settlement of up to 10,000 people can register a community interest in land (and assets such as a sports ground and its related facilities). This threshold is applied by the Community Right to Buy (Definition of Excluded Land) (Scotland) Order 2006, which lists the settlements where the right to buy cannot be exercised.</p>

  <p>To be eligible to apply, a community body must comply with section 34 of the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003. If the sports ground and related facilities are already on the market, the community would need to submit a &quot;late application&quot; to register its interest under section 39 of the act.</p>

  <p><strong>Roseanna Cunningham: Forestry Commission Scotland published its <em>Climate Change Action Plan (2009-2011)</em> on 2 February (</strong><a href="http://www.forestry.gov.uk/ccapscotland" target="_blank">www.forestry.gov.uk/ccapscotland</a>), setting out what it will do to increase the contribution and response of Scottish forestry to the challenges of climate change. Effort will focus on protecting and managing existing forests, creating new woodland, using woodland for renewable energy, replacing other materials with wood and planning to adapt to our changing climate. These directions will be embedded in the <em>Forest Enterprise Scotland Framework Strategic Plan (2009-2013)</em> and <em>Forest District Strategic Plans</em>, all of which are now being reviewed following extensive public consultation in 2008 (<a href="http://www.forestry.gov.uk/fesplans" target="_blank">www.forestry.gov.uk/fesplans</a>).</p>

  <p>Specific actions, within the context of sustainable forest management and supporting the forestry sector&rsquo;s significant contribution to meeting the government&rsquo;s emission reduction targets, include Forest Enterprise Scotland maximising the potential for wind farms on the national forest estate; purchasing sufficient land to create around 6,000 hectares of new woodland over a three-year period, and making one half to three quarters of a million cubic meters of timber available for the biomass market each year.</p>

  <p>Such actions are continually reviewed as part of the Comprehensive Spending Review process and will also be informed by the review of the FCS Climate Change Action Plan in 2011.</p>

  <p>The Information and Statistics Division of NHS National Services Scotland continues to work with the Scottish Government, NHS boards, and independent health care providers to improve the quality of this data, and ensure high levels of completion. It is intended that this information should be published on a regular basis, when the data is of sufficient quality and completeness.</p>

  <p>The apparent increase in independent sector activity in some health boards for the year ending 31 December 2007 can be attributed to (a) improvement in the collection of these data in recent months, particularly at independent locations other than private hospitals (e.g. private nursing homes; hospices; homes run by local authorities or charities), and (b) the opening of the Scottish Regional Treatment Centre at Stracathro Hospital in 2006. However, as submission levels are believed to vary by location and over time, the figures should be considered of limited use and should be interpreted with caution.</p>

  <p>The following table shows available information for in-patient / day case activity that has been submitted for NHS patients treated by independent healthcare providers in Scotland.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to announce that the Scottish Government will continue the Healthy Living Centre (HLCs) transition fund in 2009-10. The fund will allow further time for HLCs to secure sustainable local funding for their services.</p>

  <p>We will provide up to &pound;70,000 per HLC in 2009-10. The fund will continue to be administered by local health boards using a rigorous set of criteria, similar to that in 2008-09, including HLCs having very good prospects of achieving sustainability by March 2010.</p>

We provide Parentline Scotland with over &pound;100,000 per annum to provide a free and confidential helpline for any parent or carer looking after a child in Scotland who need advice on a range of issues.

  <p>Community Justice Authorities (CJA) receive a share of overall funding calculated by an agreed formula drawing upon published workload statistics over the preceding three years. The total Scotland-wide allocation for Community Service for 2009-10 has increased from &pound;13,689,165 to &pound;15,425,618 as a result of the previously announced additional funding. Lothian and Borders CJA&rsquo;s percentage increase was lower than that for other CJAs because of a drop in their workload figures for Community Service over the preceding three years. The total Lothian and Borders CJA community service allocation has nonetheless benefited by a 5% increase from &pound;2,205,206 to &pound;2,312,420 for the year 2009-10 as a result of the overall increase in government funding for community penalties.</p>

NHS boards are asked to report on the level of investment in medical equipment as part of the financial information which supports Local Delivery Plans and to submit bi-annual returns identifying progress made with implementing the recommendations made in the 2004 Audit Scotland Report.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government Health Directorates have already introduced a system to monitor post project and post occupancy reviews. The timescales set out for such reviews in business cases will be monitored and reports followed up under the auspices of the Health Directorates&rsquo; Capital Investment Group.</p>

  <p>For projects not requiring Scottish Government approval, NHSScotland bodies will be required to undertake post project evaluations and submit an annual report of the key lessons learned across such projects. These lessons will be collated by Scottish Government Health Directorates to provide a useful resource for the benefit of NHSScotland as a whole.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally. The management of sickness absence within local authorities is a matter for individual local authorities as employers.</p>

  <p>Local authorities are required by law to provide Audit Scotland with information on sickness absence levels among local government staff on an annual basis.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what arrangements will be made to assist vulnerable British people who choose to leave Zimbabwe and resettle in Scotland.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-02-23.S3W-21182.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80396" speakername="Nicola Sturgeon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa0223.htm#19">

  <p>The UK Government has today made a statement regarding a scheme to support the resettlement of vulnerable British people from Zimbabwe. The Scottish Government will be playing a full part in that scheme and will work with local government and other agencies to ensure the necessary range of services to anyone returning who chooses to live in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The UK Government estimates that there are some 3,000 British citizens and British nationals in Zimbabwe with the right of abode in the UK aged 70 or over, or vulnerable because of care needs or medical conditions. For some time the UK Government has advised vulnerable British people and their families that if they are concerned about the situation in Zimbabwe, they should consider whether they need to remain there. This has remained unchanged since 2007. Despite the recent changes in the political situation, this advice remains unchanged.</p>

  <p>The UK Government is concerned about elderly and vulnerable British people who increasingly may be unable to support themselves in Zimbabwe but who are unable to move to the UK without assistance. The UK Government is therefore ready to offer those British people assistance to resettle in the UK. It is putting in place arrangements to receive, assess housing and care needs and provide on-going support to those British people who wish to resettle here. Discussions are on-going with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities regarding the practical arrangements for receiving those who may choose to return to live in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Older and vulnerable British people in Zimbabwe are being informed of the assistance available. It is difficult to anticipate the extent of interest in this offer, but it is estimated that up to 750 households may wish to come to the UK over the next 18 months or so. It is not clear how these would be distributed across the UK and how many might want to settle in Scotland. That will only become apparent as applications are made.</p>

  <p>The British Embassy is not advising people to leave Zimbabwe and it continues to provide a full consular service to those who remain.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to providing the necessary support to those vulnerable people who choose to settle here. The UK Government, Scottish Government and COSLA will work together to ensure that adequate resources are in place to support this scheme. I am confident that we will be able to meet the needs of any person who resettles in Scotland.</p>
