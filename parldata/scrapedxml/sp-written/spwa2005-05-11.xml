</table></p>

  <p>The number of overall incidents in the Cowal area has increased over the past three years (579 in 2002-03 to 826 in 2004-05). As the overall number of incidents has increased so has the number of occasions on which the ambulance based at Dunoon has had to go out of the area transferring patients to hospital in Paisley, Greenock and Glasgow. This in turn has led to the Inverary and Arrochar ambulances having had to travel much further down the Cowal Peninsula to attend incidents which resulted in a lengthening of response times.</p>

  <p>This risk has largely been addressed following recent investment in the area which has seen the ambulance service, on 4 April 2005, introduce an additional accident and emergency unit into Dunoon, which will help support patient transfers out of the area.</p>

  <p>The central heating programme will be completed by the end of March 2006.

  <p>Implementation of the recommendations in <em>Hungry for Success</em> , including decisions on vending issues, are a matter for local authorities. The Scottish Executive continues to work successfully with both authorities and the food manufacturing industry to discourage the sale of sugary fizzy drinks, and though formal interim evidence on the degree to which this dimension of <em>Hungry for Success</em> has been implemented will not be available until later in 2005, we are encouraged by the enthusiasm with which primary schools have tackled the issue of selling unhealthy drinks.</p>

  <p>Decisions on the number and deployment of such officers are operational matters for the Chief Constable of Tayside Police.

  <p>We already have experience of the use of telemedicine from the North of Scotland Accident and Emergency Network which links 15 community hospitals across the Grampian region to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. We are improving the national wide area telecommunications network through a contract recently signed with BT which will supply required broadband wherever it is needed. Central funding already covers primary care connections and will extend to hospital over the next two years to support applications such as telemedicine and PACS. We intend to use that infrastructure to enable telemedicine and tele-health applications to be implemented wherever they are clinically valuable or increase access to services by patients and clinical staff in rural areas.</p>

  <p>Access to GPs is dependent on a number of factors including the patient&rsquo;s clinical need. It is for each practice to ensure that it has arrangements in place to provide access to an appropriate health care professional within an appropriate timescale. The Scottish Executive published a commitment in the Partnership Agreement that from April 2004 anyone contacting their GP practice would have guaranteed access to a GP, nurse or other healthcare professional within 48 hours. Guidance has been issued to NHS boards to support the implementation of that target. There is guidance to support the implementation and monitoring of the new General Medical Services contract, including the Quality and Outcomes Framework and the Statement of Fees and Entitlements, covering arrangements to offer a range of appointments, and details of the 48 hour access target. In addition, guidance and support is provided to those practices participating in the Scottish Primary Care Collaborative, led by the Centre for Change and Innovation.</p>

  <p>No specific standards have been set for timescales for appointments in primary medical services. It is for each primary medical services practice to establish appropriate access arrangements in accordance with local circumstances. Access to primary medical services is determined by a number of factors including clinical need. The Scottish Executive published a commitment in the Partnership Agreement that from April 2004 anyone contacting their GP practice would have guaranteed access to a GP, nurse or other healthcare professional within 48 hours. Access is defined as including appointments, but also includes other arrangements which are appropriate to the patient&rsquo;s circumstances and clinical need.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what measures it intends to take to improve the sustainability of university research, with particular reference to addressing the costs of research commissioned by public bodies.</p>

  <p>Ensuring the long-term sustainability of university research is an essential feature of the Executive&rsquo;s science and innovation policy, which underpins the future success of the Scottish economy. However, successive reviews of the funding of university research in the UK have shown that, over a considerable period, universities have been significantly undercharging for their research activity, and this has placed an unsustainable burden on research infrastructure. In order to ensure the long term sustainability of research, UK universities have agreed with their funding bodies that that they will implement full economic costing of research activity. The intention is to reach a situation where universities secure sufficient income from all sources to ensure that the can cover the full economic costs of all the research that they undertake, taking one year with another, without detriment to their other activities or to their long term financial sustainability. In support of this policy, the Scottish Cabinet Ministers have recently agreed that, in common with Whitehall Departments, the Scottish Executive will in future expect to pay for the full economic cost of university research that it commissions. This policy will also apply to all of the Executive&rsquo;s Agencies and Non-departmental Public Bodies. The Executive will encourage similar action by businesses. Non-commissioned research for the public good, such as the response mode scheme in the Health Department, will be based on the proportion of full economic costs to be paid by the Research Councils. To avoid double funding, account will be taken of funds allocated through other funding streams to support the same academic research.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many children aged under 16 have been detained in each public sector prison in each of the last six years; how old they were; how long they were detained; what the reasons were for their detention, and why they were detained in prison rather than an establishment for children.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>There are two circumstances in which a child or young person may be admitted to the custody of the Scottish Prison Service. In the first, a child or young person remanded or committed for trial and considered by the Sheriff to be unruly may be detained in prison on an &quot;unruly certificate&quot;. In the second, a child who has been convicted on indictment and sentenced to be detained in such a place as the Scottish ministers direct may be held in a prison or young offenders institution.</p>

  <p>The available information on the number of children so held in Scottish Prisons are set out in the tables which follow.</p>
