  <p>We have regular high-level meetings with BBC Scotland to discuss potential improvements in terms of serving the Scottish public, including the provision of local news services and other public service broadcasting matters. We set out our views on regional and local news services in our response to Phase 3 of Ofcom&rsquo;s Review of Public Service Broadcasting, which can be found on the consultation responses section on Ofcom&rsquo;s website at <a href="http://www.ofcom.org.uk" target="_blank">www.ofcom.org.uk</a> .</p>

  <p>Regulation is an integral part of the cost of providing a service, and so it should normally be met by that service. Fee levels set by ministers and the Care Commission&rsquo;s charging regime both take account of smaller care service providers.</p>

  <p>In response to concerns from providers such as Crossroads the Executive has already:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>set different fee levels for different sizes of services, based on the whole time equivalent staff employed, and<br />
              discounted volunteers from that calculation.</p>
</blockquote></p>

  <p>In addition the Care Commission:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>offers a direct debit scheme for the payment of annual continuation fees, and<br />
                  is considering integrated fees where care at home and housing support services are delivered alongside each other.</p>

  <p>In 2004, the Scottish Executive commissioned a national needs assessment exercise which gained the views of professionals, pupils and parents on their need for anti-bullying activity. The evidence has been used to develop a new specification for a national anti-bullying programme that will take a strong, pro-active role in developing the role of professionals in all children&rsquo;s services in preventing bullying and responding effectively when it occurs.</p>

  <p>The recruitment and retention of teaching staff in individual schools is a matter for the Education Authority concerned. The Scottish Executive conducts an annual teacher workforce planning exercise with the aim of balancing supply and demand at a national level. Intakes to postgraduate teacher training courses have increased significantly in order to meet the Executive&rsquo;s commitment that education authorities should be employing 53,000 teachers by 2007. For 2005, Highland Council have been allocated 54 secondary probationer teachers on the Teacher Induction Scheme as compared to 39 in 2004. Allocation to individual schools will be a matter for the council.</p>

  <p>This issue was discussed at the first meeting of the Financial Services Advisory Board (FiSAB) on, 31 May. We agreed that any position on the EU Green Paper on Financial Services Policy for the next five years would be drawn up in consultation with the industry in Scotland. We also agreed that Scottish Financial Enterprise, in line with its core function as a representative organisation, would draw together industry views in response to the Commission&rsquo;s proposals. The response to the Commission will therefore come directly from the industry in Scotland, though Executive ministers and officials are prepared offer any appropriate assistance.</p>

  <p>Fresh Talent is a long-term initiative, and measuring its overall success will take time. However, there are some more immediate evaluations that will give us some useful data.</p>

  <p>For example:</p>

  <p>We will know how many people successfully apply to live and work in Scotland under the Fresh Talent: Working in Scotland scheme, and we are currently in discussions with the Home Office to develop a robust and workable arrangement for monitoring and evaluating the scheme.</p>

  <p>We will also know the number of people interested in living and working in Scotland via the number of enquiries to the Relocation Advisory Service and the numbers visiting the website.

  <p>In taking forward the Fresh Talent initiative, we recognise that tourists who have a good experience whilst in Scotland are more likely to consider, or recommend, Scotland as a great country to live and work. We are therefore putting in place a range of measures to showcase all facets of contemporary Scotland to visitors. For example, we have recently launched a campaign to welcome visitors to Scotland at our major airports and we are producing a CD-ROM and brochure on modern Scotland that will be distributed to the international press and visitors to G8 and major tourist events across Scotland this summer. We will target specific events that attract a high number of tourists such as the Edinburgh International Fringe where we will place a full page advert to promote Scotland, and we will run adverts at the major golf championships in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The commitment to introduce the Fresh Talent: Working in Scotland scheme first appeared in the policy statement, New Scots, published in February 2004. The proposal emerged from the work of the project team which was set up in 2003 to develop proposals to progress the Fresh Talent policy. The project team was supported in its work by a steering group, and worked closely with the Home Office.</p>

The police have been working closely with the Scottish Executive and other partner agencies to ensure that things go as smoothly as possible.

  <p>I am very aware of public concern, which ministers share, about the frequency with which the terms of bail granted are breached. This is why we asked the Sentencing Commission to review the use of bail and remand as a priority.</p>

  <p>We are currently considering very carefully the commission&rsquo;s recently issued report on the subject. Where it is necessary to legislate to tighten up the arrangements, we will do so.</p>

  <p>We have, however, recently made provision for electronic monitoring as a condition of bail. The court can impose an electronic monitoring condition in murder and rape cases. This is a significant tightening of the previous law where bail could be granted for those convicted of murder or rape without any additional safeguard.</p>

  <p>The First Minister and I announced on 24 February 2005 that an independent review team, lead by Owen Clarke CBE, would be set up to review the performance of NHS 24. I have now received the team&rsquo;s interim report which is available in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 36630) and in the Publications section of the Scottish Executive website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/publications" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/publications</a> . I am very grateful to Owen Clarke and his colleagues for their efforts and for producing their interim report on time.</p>

  <p>The interim report draws attention to the need to improve NHS 24 services by: reviewing risk assessment and management relating to call back and other factors affecting access times; further exploring possible solutions to quality and responsiveness of services in remote and rural areas, and more collaboration and co-operation between NHS boards and NHS 24 to ensure patients receive the high quality service they deserve. The interim report notes that a range of actions has been taken and is planned by NHS 24 in response to these recommendations. The Scottish Executive will assist in taking forward any actions that require our support.</p>

  <p>I am also today announcing that I have appointed Mr George King as interim Chair following the decision last week of Christine Lenihan to step down. Mr King will help lead NHS 24 forward into the next phase of its development. A substantive chair appointment will be made as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>I expect to see the review team&rsquo;s final report by the end of September.</p>

This average cost per meal is multiplied by the take-up of free school meals in order to estimate the cost to local authorities of providing free school meals.</p>

  <p>On this basis, it is estimated that free school meals cost LAs: &pound;36.4 million in 1996-97; &pound;32.9 million in 1997-98, and &pound;34.5 million in 1998-99. Comparable data are not available before 1996 and therefore we cannot estimate the costs for 1994-95 and 1995-96.</p>

  <p>These estimates may not include all the costs local authorities face when providing free school meals. In some cases the cost per meal figure may be underestimated due to the meals being provided under an external contract. In such cases, the figures may not include some elements of operating costs.</p>

  <p>We encourage the fullest possible use of all local authority resources, including school facilities. It is, though, for the local authorities to determine whether or what to charge for community use of such facilities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive maintains close links with the Network of Regional Governments for Sustainable Development which comprises 24 regions from across the world. We receive their papers and one of my officials attended a conference which the network arranged in Cardiff last year while another was a speaker at a seminar on sustainable development indicators that the network organised in Bilbao last autumn.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has considered carefully whether it should become a member of the network. On balance, we have concluded that we should concentrate our international work within Europe where other regions&rsquo; experience and social, economic and environmental circumstances are closer to our own.</p>

  <p>We are active members of the Environment Conference of Regional Environment Ministers (ENCORE) network which is the main forum for co-operation between the Regional Environment Ministers of Europe. One of my officials represents the UK on the ENCORE Steering Group. The Scottish Executive&rsquo;s agreements with Catalonia and Bavaria include co-operation on environmental and sustainable development.</p>

  <p>It is the responsibility of local authorities to draw up schemes to encourage recycling and, if they so wish, to seek financial support through the Strategic Waste Fund. Through the Strategic Waste Fund, we have funded a number of co-mingled kerbside collections of recyclate which include plastic bottles. In a number of other local authorities, plastic will be collected at recycling points and centres. Separate kerbside collection of plastic containers by themselves is not generally seen as viable at the moment, given the different types of plastic and the light weight of the materials. Information on recycling facilities across Scotland can be found on the &quot;Sort It&quot; section of the Scottish Waste Awareness Group&rsquo;s website at <a href="http://www.wascot.org.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.wascot.org.uk/</a> .</p>

  <p>For the current Spending Review period (2005-06 to 2007-08), we have allocated &pound;364.296 million to the strategic waste fund for local authorities and &pound;45.553 million to the other waste initiatives line.</p>

  <p>Through the strategic waste fund, we are providing resources to local authorities to prevent waste arising, to improve recycling and composting facilities, to invest in infrastructure to divert waste away from landfill and to support education and awareness campaigns. Through the other waste expenditure line we are supporting a variety of initiatives including: the community recycling sector (through our INCREASE programme); the Waste and Resources Action Programme, Remade, the Scottish Waste Awareness Group, the Community Recycling Network for Scotland, Envirowise, Business Environment Partnership, Eco-Schools, a project to help remove litter from the North Sea and research.</p>
