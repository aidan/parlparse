  <p>Decisions on care and support are matters for clinicians in consultation with the individual and the relevant multi-agency professional staff. Care arrangements should be based on individually assessed needs involving carers and family members as appropriate.</p>

  <p>A range of clinical, organisational and other guidance for agencies, users of services and carers has been published. The most recent guidance from the Scottish Executive was published in November 2004 (Bib. number 37332). The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network will publish updated clinical guidelines on the management of patients with dementia in March.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Office Education and Industry Department commissioned the University of Birmingham to carry out research, between 1995 and 1996, to scope the educational opportunities for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Interchange No. 46: Educational Provision for Children with Autism in Scotland, which reports the findings of the research, did not contain any specific recommendations for the Scottish Office to take forward. It did, however, contain several points for reflection for policy makers, teachers, parents and other professionals to consider when making decisions relating to the provision of education for children and young people with ASD.</p>

  <p>In the last 10 years there have been significant legislative changes as well as changes in policies and practices in meeting the needs of children and young people with ASD, many of which address the points made in the research. Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) is currently conducting a review of educational provision for ASD which is due to report in late summer. The report will highlight current good practice, identify gaps in provision and will make recommendations for the way forward.</p>

  <p>Source: Scottish Dental Practice Board Annual Report 2004-05.</p>

  <p>Note: 1. Number of principal dentists (excluding salaried principal dentists) at 31 March 2005.</p>

  <p>A number of principal dentists are on the lists of more than one NHS board area, which results in double counting, and for this reason it is not possible to provide the percentage of dentists currently eligible for commitment payments.</p>

  <p>Commitment payments are different to payments which have been introduced for NHS committed practices. Those dental practices which meet the definition of NHS committed are entitled to certain new payments, e.g. an additional 6% in respect of the general dental practice allowance. These payments are made to the practice. A total of 566 practices are NHS committed which represents 68% of all practices. This figure excludes specialist practices, such as orthodontic practices, as the criteria for determining the NHS commitment of such practices are currently being developed. The number and percentage of practices regarded as NHS committed in each NHS board area are not yet available. I will write to the member as soon as the information is available and will arrange for a copy of my reply to be placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 38797).</p>

  <p>The following table shows the percentage of the average salary of staff in Scottish Executive core departments who have self declared themselves as being from an ethnic minority background compared to staff who have declared themselves as white. Self-declaration is the only method of recording this information, therefore the data is necessarily subjective. A figure below 100% indicates that ethnic minority staff have been paid less on average than white staff, whereas a figure above 100% indicates that they have been paid more. The information provided is as at 1 April each year and refers to permanent staff.</p>

  <p>The Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 is primarily enforced by the Scottish Information Commissioner. The commissioner&rsquo;s decisions detail where, in the opinion of the commissioner, an authority has failed to comply, and the respect in which the authority has failed to comply, with the general entitlement of access to information, and the steps which the authority must take to comply. Decisions, including those concerning the Executive, are published on the commissioner&rsquo;s website <a href="http://www.itspublicknowledge.info/appealsdecisions/decisions/index.php" target="_blank">http://www.itspublicknowledge.info/appealsdecisions/decisions/index.php</a> .</p>

  <p>Records indicate that the Executive has not met the statutory 20-day response time in about 20% of cases.</p>

  <p>The Chief Scientist Office (CSO), within the Scottish Executive Health Department, has responsibility for encouraging and supporting research into health and health care needs in Scotland. It supports research projects of a sufficiently high standard initiated by the research community in Scotland. This role is well known and advertised throughout the healthcare and academic community.</p>

  <p>The CSO has no plans to instigate a study on haemochromatosis, but would be pleased to consider research proposals into its prevalence. These would be subject to the usual peer and committee review.</p>

  <p>The National Research Register (NRR), a UK wide research database, records two on-going projects and 10 completed projects on the prevalence of haemochromatosis. Details of these projects are available from the NRR, this can be found at the website <a href="http://www.update-software.com/national/" target="_blank">www.update-software.com/national/</a>.</p>

  <p>The response to the Kerr Report, <em>Delivering for Health</em> (Bib. number 37847) is explicit on work underway with all concerned to involve patients, carers and the wider public in the consideration of options for change.

  <p>The Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 introduces a new framework to ensure that all children and young people with additional support needs, including those with learning disabilities, benefit from education. The act also places new duties on education authorities and appropriate agencies to ensure early planning and preparation and effective exchange of information. This supports children and young people with additional support needs to make a smooth and successful transition to post-school life.</p>

  <p>Our widening access policy is helping to break down barriers to participation in further education faced by all groups including students with learning disabilities. Further education colleges receive additional funding in respect of students who either require to attend a special programme or who require additional support to undertake a mainstream course.</p>

  <p>The forthcoming Children&rsquo;s Report, from <em>The same as you?</em> implementation group, aims to raise awareness that it is the responsibility of every organisation and individual involved in service provision to give children and young people the opportunity to access mainstream services.</p>

  <p>As at 31 January 2006, there are a total of 1,574 personnel currently listed on the Scottish Police Elimination Database. 1,458 of these are police officers which is approximately 9% of serving police officers.</p>

  <p>The majority of these are thought to have provided their DNA sample voluntarily but precise figures are not available. The Police Elimination Database does not distinguish between samples from volunteers and samples from new recruits, who may be required to provide a sample for elimination purposes.</p>

  <p>We do not hold this information centrally. However, we sponsor two bodies to help develop markets for recycled products: REMADE Scotland and the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP). REMADE Scotland, working with WRAP, are preparing a report on Markets for Recyclable Materials and Recycled Products in Scotland. This will provide some information on the capacity to reprocess recyclable materials in Scotland and on exports of some materials from the United Kingdom and I will arrange for a copy to be forwarded to you once this has been finalised.</p>

  <p>However, obtaining full information on the proportion of the materials collected in Scotland for recycling which are then exported is difficult. There is a wide range of materials involved and materials are collected for recycling from commercial and industrial premises as well as from households. In addition, materials that have been collected may be transported from Scotland to other parts of the United Kingdom and may then be reprocessed in other parts of the UK or may be exported from other parts of the UK.</p>

  <p>Information held by the Scottish Waste Awareness Group indicates that of the 13 local authorities operating co-mingled recycling schemes, 12 of these local authorities are arranging for the materials to be sorted in Scotland.</p>
