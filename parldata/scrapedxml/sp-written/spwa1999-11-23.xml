  <p>The terms of reference for the review of the careers service are: &quot;To examine the role of the careers service in Scotland, and the scope for change and development of that role in the light of trends and initiatives in education, lifelong learning, and the labour market&quot;.</p>

  <p>All careers service companies are jointly owned by the relevant local enterprise companies and local authorities. The review&#8217;s remit suggests a concentration on the role, rather than the ownership and organisation of the careers service, but remains sufficiently wide to allow the committee to consider all options for the future of the careers service.</p>

  <p>An appropriate balance between schoolwork and play is a vital component of a rounded curriculum. Schools and pre-school centres have been given advice on the benefits of play as part of a balanced curriculum. Schools are also encouraged to provide pupils with experience of, and access to, a wide range of games and sports through the formal curriculum and through extra curricular activities. HMI reports comment on the delivery and breadth of the curriculum as well as on school ethos which includes an appraisal of school atmosphere and the extent to which pupils are positive and gaining pleasure from their work in school.</p>

  <p>The Scottish UfI will pay particular attention to the needs of small and medium-sized businesses.

  <p>I attended the Fisheries Council meeting on 22 November as part of the UK delegation along with the MAFF Fisheries Minister Elliot Morley.</p>

  <p>The Council agreed a regulation for financial aid in the fisheries sector under the new structural funds arrangements. The revised Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG) provides for a seven year funding programme beginning on 1 January 2000. It will enable a range of measures across the fishing industry including support for fish processors, quality initiatives, vessel modernisation and vessel safety. Grants for the renewal and modernisation of the fleet will be subject to a requirement for Member States to meet their overall annual capacity objectives. Where renewal or modernisation is proposed in a segment of the fleet that has not met its capacity targets, it will be necessary to withdraw 30% more capacity than is grant aided. This welcome innovation will help improve the balance between fish stocks and fleet capacity and restrain public funds being used across the community to augment fishing effort.</p>

  <p>The Council reached a broad political agreement on a reform of the fisheries marketing regime. The new regulation will provide lower tariffs for imports of fish which are important for our processing industry, while protecting the interests of our catching industry on sensitive species such as herring and cod. In particular, we have ensured that there will be no tariff suspension for herring, an outcome of great importance to the Scottish fleet. After a transitional period the agreed changes will reduce the overall costs of the regime.</p>

  <p>The Council also received a presentation on a draft Regulation to establish a Community framework for the collection and management of data needed to conduct the Common Fisheries Policy; this will return to the Council after detailed examination. The Commission reported that on 20 December there would be a meeting with the Moroccan Minister of Fisheries to take forward the EU:Morocco negotiations. There was an initial discussion of means of implementation of the new control arrangements adopted by the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission. Arrangements for the year 2000 will be considered at the next meeting of the Council on 16 and 17 December.</p>

  <p>The cost to the NHS in Scotland of making nicotine patches available on prescription can not be stated with any degree of confidence as it would depend on a number of factors which are currently unknown. For example the take up rate among smokers and the conditions on which prescriptions would be available would have a major influence on the eventual cost.</p>

  <p>If all smokers who have said that they want to give up were given the recommended course of treatment of around eight to twelve weeks the cost could be up to &pound;130 million for the first year.</p>

  <p>However, in practice the cost could be expected to be lower than this.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to estimate future savings if all drugs were written and dispensed generically as it cannot be known with certainty for which drugs a generic equivalent will be available and at what price. In addition in some cases a generic product may be inappropriate for clinical reasons. However, during financial year 1998-99, savings of about &pound;5.8 million could have been made in the FHS drugs bill, if all prescribed items, where a generic form exists, had been dispensed as a generic.</p>

  <p>There have been 3,955 grant applications made under the Agricultural Business Improvement Scheme (ABIS) since 1 August and up to the statutory closing date of 31 October 1999. All are currently being processed. The total grant value of these applications is estimated at &pound;22.8 million.</p>

  <p>As announced on 16 November, an extra &pound;1 million is being made available for ABIS, thus raising the total amount still to be allocated by 31 December 1999 to &pound;2.2 million. I announced on 16 November that, in the light of consultations, the money will be used to fund resource audits, information technology, alternative agricultural production, mobile sheep fanks and dippers, residential letting and self-standing systems for the storage and disposal of farm waste.</p>

  <p>This information is not available. The kinds of statistical information that have been collected for many years about road accidents in which one or more people are reported injured are shown in the example form on pages 128 to 130 of <i>Road Accidents Scotland 1998</i> , copies of which are available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre. <br /></p>
