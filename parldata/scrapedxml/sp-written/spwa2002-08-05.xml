  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Yes. As is presently the case with HMP Kilmarnock, any new private prisons would be able to take prisoners from other jurisdictions in the same circumstances as publicly operated prisons. Those circumstances are as follows:</p>

  <p>Under Schedule 1 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997, prisoners may be received in any Scottish prison from another UK jurisdiction for the purposes of maintaining family contact or to enable the prisoner to attend criminal proceedings in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Also, under the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons or a bilateral agreement based on that Convention, prisoners may be received in any Scottish prison from a foreign jurisdiction because they have been repatriated to the UK to serve the remainder of their sentence. The aims of the Convention and the bilateral agreements are entirely humanitarian - to enable prisoners to transfer to their home country to serve the remainder of their sentence. At present 48 countries are signatories to the Convention and the UK has agreements with a further 12 countries.</p>

  <p>Finally, prisoners may be received from other jurisdictions because they have been extradited either to stand trial or because they were unlawfully at large after conviction by a Scottish court. The United Kingdom has formal extradition relations with over 100 countries through two multilateral schemes &#8211; the European Convention on Extradition and the Commonwealth Scheme for the Rendition of Fugitive Offenders and a number of bilateral treaties.</p>

  <p>It is for local authorities, which are responsible for the administrative aspects of the Blue Badge scheme of parking concessions for disabled people, to monitor the levels of misuse of badges, within their areas.</p>

  <p>Given strong anecdotal evidence of misuse of badges, the Executive is promoting powers to give police officers, traffic wardens and local authority parking attendants the power to inspect badges and create an offence of refusing to produce a badge when requested to do so by these authorised persons. Guidance will be issued to local authorities and police, and all badge holders will be informed of the change in the system before the implementation of these powers later in the year.</p>

  <p>The UK-wide review of the Blue Badge Scheme is being taken forward by the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee (DPTAC) on behalf of the Department for Transport, the Scottish Executive, the National Assembly for Wales and the Department for Regional Development (Northern Ireland).</p>

  <p>The scheme, however, is a devolved matter and the Executive will therefore be considering whether any changes to the scheme recommended on an UK-wide basis by DPTAC should be addressed in a distinctly Scottish way.</p>
