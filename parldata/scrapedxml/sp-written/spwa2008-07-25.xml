  <p>The Scottish Government recognises that recreational sea angling can offer valuable opportunities for people to access and enjoy the marine environment, develop a range of practical skills, derive pleasure from their participation in an exciting and sometimes competitive sport and enjoy the eating of those fish &quot;caught for the pot&quot;. Recreational sea angling is a niche tourism market that can contribute to the economies of coastal communities, for example via bed and breakfasts or from hire of charter boats. However, there is currently very little objective or detailed data on the scale and economic impact of recreational sea angling in Scotland. To address this, the Scottish Government has commissioned Glasgow Caledonian University to undertake a study to look at these things. The study is ongoing, progressing well and scheduled to report in November this year.</p>

  <p>In addition to the statutory guidance which was last revised in 2006, the Scottish Government is working with DEFRA, the other devolved administrations, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the Environment Agency to review the current technical guidance on risk assessment, known as the Contaminated Land Exposure Assessment (CLEA) framework, used in the determination of contaminated land. This guidance, first issued in 2002, provides a methodology to help assess whether there is a significant risk to human health from exposure to a particular contaminant on a given site.</p>

  <p>Threshold values, established for various pollutants under the terms of the Groundwater Directive, are used in assessing the chemical status of a groundwater body. The exceedance of a threshold value is used as a trigger for investigations of whether the pressures on the groundwater body concerned would compromise the quality of drinking water sources, the quality of surface water into which the groundwater flows, or the quality of any wetlands connected to the groundwater. The standards applied for the regulation of pollution or the remediation of contaminated land are therefore specific to the groundwater body concerned.</p>

  <p>As I announced on the 19th June, the aim of Scotland&rsquo;s first national food and drink policy is to promote Scotland&rsquo;s sustainable economic growth by ensuring that the Scottish Government&rsquo;s focus in relation to food and drink, and in particular our work with Scotland&rsquo;s food and drink industry, addresses quality, health and wellbeing, and environmental sustainability, recognising the need for access to affordable food for all.</p>

  <p>I have set up a framework to ensure delivery of this aim. Acknowledging the momentum for change already built up through the National Discussion on Food, the framework going forward will encompass a high level of transparency and engagement.</p>

  <p>I will be chairing a leadership forum, whose remit takes an overarching view of the work being taken forward by five thematic working groups encompassing existing Scottish Government initiatives, alongside a number of new projects being commissioned by the five specific thematic work streams.</p>

  <p>The leadership forum exists to ensure a consistency of approach and overall adherence to the aim of the Food and Drink Policy. I will be inviting four key individuals to join the leadership forum, acting as &quot;champions&quot; for, respectively; sustainable economic growth; health; sustainability; and access to affordable food. In addition the forum will also include each of the chairs of the work streams, at least one other Scottish Government Minister and a representative of the drink sector.</p>

  <p>The five key themes are (1) Sustainable Economic Growth; (2) Food and Drink Choices; (3) Enhancing Scotland&rsquo;s Reputation for Food and Drink; (4) Walking the Talk; and, (5) Affordability, Access and Security. Each theme will be chaired independently, with support from Scottish government officials. The Chairs of each thematic group will be part of the leadership forum.</p>

  <p>It is important that the food and drink policy aims and initiatives for Scotland are not piecemeal nor static but remain flexible and adaptive to the rapid changes in domestic and food supply and consumption challenges. I will therefore be asking the work streams for their initial findings and recommendations in early 2009.</p>

  <p>My announcement on the 19 June also acknowledged the breadth of initiatives already underway across Government, it is important that we do not lose sight of these, nor the very enthusiastic resolve for real change.</p>

  <p>Through the Protection of Vulnerable Groups (Scotland) Act 2007, the Scottish Government is implementing a strengthened and robust vetting and barring scheme that will ensure that those who have contact with vulnerable groups through the workplace do not have a history of abusive behaviour and deliver a fair and consistent system that will be quick and easy for people to use and end the need for multiple, written disclosure checks.</p>

  <p>A date for the PVG scheme to go live is still to be determined and will be announced well in advance of commencement to allow organisations and groups who work with vulnerable groups adequate time to prepare. Implementation activity is well underway and work is currently ongoing on developing infrastructure, IT systems and information flows, preparing guidance and training materials and on ensuring that the Scottish scheme dovetails with the scheme being developed for the rest of the UK. In addition, Ministers are currently considering the detailed analysis (published on 27 June 2008) of the consultation on policy proposals for secondary legislation and expect to publish a response after the summer recess.</p>

  <p>The Protection of Vulnerable Groups (Scotland) Act 2007 will significantly reduce the need for employees (paid and unpaid) to complete multiple disclosure applications. It introduces a membership scheme that people working with vulnerable groups will join. They will need to complete a full application when first joining the scheme. Scheme records will then be kept updated, so that any subsequent checks, for example when an individual changes jobs, will be quicker, easier and, in most cases, cheaper to handle.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the Foreign Secretary&rsquo;s written statement to the House of Commons on 3 July (Hansard 58WS). The Scottish Government welcomes confirmation by the US Authorities that there has been no use of Scottish airports for rendition flights since September 2001, and their confirmation that there will be no use of UK territories by such flights in future without the express permission of the UK Government. As you will see, the Foreign Secretary has confirmed that such permission would only be granted if the UK Government was satisfied that the rendition would accord with UK law and our international obligations. The Scottish Government remains firmly opposed to rendition flights and believes that they could never be in accordance with domestic or international law. Therefore, we continue to expect that there will be no use of Scottish territory for this purpose under any circumstances.</p>

  <p>A total of 16,263 applications have been received to date under the Scotland Rural Development Programme, excluding Rural Development Contracts - Rural Priorities. The number of applications approved and rejected, for each of the seven mechanisms, is shown in the following table.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that each mechanism has its own data capture, assessment and approval processes and many of the applications received are still in the process of being data captured or assessed.</p>

  <p>Following detailed negotiations with the European Commission, we are submitting changes to the Scotland Rural Development Programme aimed at including an animal welfare management programme; including three additional food quality assurance schemes (the QMS Assurance Scheme - Cattle and Sheep, the QMS Assurance Scheme - Pigs, and the Scottish Quality Assurance Combineable Crops Scheme); and correcting a number of typographical errors in the Programme. During discussions with the Commission it became clear that, under the terms of the Rural Development Regulation (EC Regulation 1698/2005), it would not be possible to reinstate the farm visits programme.</p>
