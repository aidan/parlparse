  <p>Accessibility of new buildings and new building work to existing buildings are addressed through Scottish building regulations. These make provision for a range of physical access issues, to ensure that a building can be used and enjoyed by as wide a range of people as practical. For non-domestic buildings, Scottish building regulations are the equivalent of those elsewhere in the UK and, for domestic buildings, are the most demanding in the UK. The latest accessibility standards came into effect in May 2007.</p>

  <p>A duty to consider the accessibility of a building also exists under equalities legislation, the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 &amp; 2005 (DDA), which is reserved to Westminster. This legislation places a duty on service providers and employers to make reasonable adjustments to the way services are delivered, or facilities are provided, to prevent discrimination against persons on the basis of disability. This could include not only alteration of physical barriers to access and use, but also the manner in which a building is managed and operated. The DDA can therefore address certain access issues which lie outwith the scope of building regulations.</p>

  <p>Staffing levels at Wick Airport are sufficient to meet the airport&rsquo;s operational needs, principally scheduled flight movements. On 30 and 31 December 2008 there were 90 minutes of planned air traffic closures at the airport due to staff sickness. This had no impact on scheduled flights or general aviation traffic operating at Wick.</p>

  <p>On three days in February there will be minor notified closures to protect statutory air traffic control staff working time limitations. Again, this should have no impact on traffic.</p>

  <p>Highlands and Islands Airports Ltd regularly reviews staffing levels at all of its airports to ensure that they are appropriate for its operational needs.</p>

  <p>Audit Scotland&rsquo;s Financial overview of the NHS in Scotland 2007-08 identified a &pound;5 million underspend by NHS Education for Scotland in their Dental Action Plan allocation.</p>

  <p>NHS Education for Scotland were allocated funds under the Dental Action Plan to support five major work streams with 14 distinct projects. Part of the funding was to meet the revenue costs of the educational aspects of new teach and treat centres across Scotland. NHS Education for Scotland has had to commit revenue in support of each NHS board&rsquo;s business case in respect of these developments. Each major centre&rsquo;s revenue costs are in the region of &pound;500,000 and NHS Education for Scotland has had to hold this money against future revenue commitments. However, the centres have taken longer to complete than anticipated and this has therefore resulted in a revenue underspend for NHS Education for Scotland.</p>

  <p>NHS Education for Scotland protects its Dental Action Plan funding and the underspend in revenue is normally carried forward into the next year for future commitment within NHS Education for Scotland. This resulted in a large underpend being accumulated. Therefore in the interest of proper use of public funds, complete transparency and achieving best value for dental services across Scotland, as a one off exercise, the funds which were not required in 2007-08 were returned by NHS Education for Scotland to the Scottish Government.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government takes the provision of advice to disabled people very seriously, across all its areas of responsibility. Funding is provided to a wide range of organisations that provide such advice. We would highlight the following:</p>

  <p>Health:</p>

  <p>Self-Directed Support -</p>

  <p>In 2008-09, through section 10 (1) of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968, the self-directed support team made grants of &pound;210,000 available to organisations who advise people about self-directed support.</p>

  <p>Mental Health:</p>

  <p>Section 10 Organisations and payments 2008-09 -</p>

  <p>Alzheimer Scotland - &pound;100,000</p>

  <p>Bipolar Fellowship - &pound;27,825</p>

  <p>Dementia Services Development Centre - &pound;135,000</p>

  <p>Headway - &pound;72,500</p>

  <p>National Schizophrenia Scotland - &pound;74,620</p>

  <p>Penumbra - &pound;61,880</p>

  <p>Penumbra Respite - &pound;20,850</p>

  <p>Richmond Fellowship - &pound;31,500</p>

  <p>Scottish Huntington&rsquo;s Association - &pound;52,000</p>

  <p>Scottish Association for Mental Health - &pound;88,000</p>

  <p>Stresswatch - &pound;11,219.</p>

  <p>In addition, through section 16B of the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978, the Scottish Government provides grants totalling &pound;377,000 to a range of voluntary organisations which support people experiencing mental illness. The organisations that receive funding undertake various functions that include giving help and advice to members of the public who experience mental ill health and their carers. Examples of high profile organisations that receive money in this way are Alzheimer&rsquo;s Scotland, Cruse Bereavement Care (Scotland), Depression Alliance Scotland and the Scottish Association for Mental Health.</p>

  <p>Housing and Adaptations:</p>

  <p>Glasgow Centre for Inclusive Living provides a range of independent living advice, information and training support services to disabled people in and around Glasgow, and has been funded through the Housing Voluntary Grant Scheme to develop a disabled housing register. They received &pound;23,600 in 2008-09 and will receive &pound;24,072 in 2009-10.</p>

  <p>Education:</p>

  <p>Support for Learning -</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government fund the Scottish Sensory Centre (SSC) to promote innovation and good practice in the education of deaf, visually impaired and deafblind pupils. The Scottish Government also funds CALL Scotland, who provide specialist expertise in technology for children who have speech, communication and/or writing difficulties, in schools across Scotland. Both services are housed in the University of Edinburgh. In 2008-09, SSC were awarded &pound;219,861 and CALL &pound;317,760.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government also provided in 2008-09, &pound;424,260 funding for the provision of Enquire, the national organisation with links to local networks. Enquire provides free and independent information and advice to families of children with additional support needs.</p>

  <p>Disabled Children:</p>

  <p>The Butterfly Trust - 2008-09, &pound;64,575</p>

  <p>Care Co-ordination Network UK - 2008-09, &pound;47,281</p>

  <p>Contact a Family - 2008-09, &pound;64,062</p>

  <p>Sleep Scotland - 2008-09, &pound;75,030.</p>

  <p>Lifelong Learning:</p>

  <p>The Lifelong Learning Directorate (LLD) within the Scottish Government have for a number of years funded Skill Scotland to update the advice contained within Helping You Meet The Cost of Learning for 2008-09 - Disabled Learners. The LLD have also previously funded Skill Scotland to write the advice contained within a publication called the <em>Employing Own Support Workers in Higher Education</em>.</p>

  <p>SKILL Scotland also receives a Headquarters Grant which is administered via the Lifelong Learning Directorate. The grant for 2008-9 was &pound;52,871.</p>

  <p>Skill Scotland is a national charity promoting opportunities for young people and adults with any kind of impairment in post-16 education, training and employment. Skill Scotland operates an information and advice service, provides volunteering opportunities, informs and influences key decision makers, runs conferences and works with its members.</p>

  <p>Local authority funding for respite services for all care groups was not previously ring-fenced. Funding for respite and carer support services was included within the annual local government finance settlement and paid as part of the general block grant. That remains the case.</p>

  <p>In recognition of the importance of respite and short breaks in supporting both carers and those they are caring for, the Scottish Government included a commitment in our concordat with local government to make progress towards an additional 10,000 respite weeks a year. We have provided an extra &pound;4 million - on top of the total settlement to local government - to enable local authorities to deliver this commitment in full by 2011. These additional weeks should benefit a wide range of carers and those they are caring for, including disabled people.</p>

  <p>It will be at the discretion of individual local authorities how they develop and allocate these additional weeks, based on local needs and priorities. We have agreed with COSLA that they will monitor the delivery of the commitment and will report to the Scottish Government with total Scotland-wide figures.</p>

  <p>In cases where a road traffic offence punishable by imprisonment has been committed, Section 33A of the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988 provides the courts with the power to make an order for the forfeiture of a vehicle following an application from the prosecutor.

  <p>We consider analytical facilities to be an important component in the monitoring of the safety and standards of the public&rsquo;s food, water and other consumer products. Public analysts are a statutory requirement under the Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994 and adequate provision of these services enables local authorities to protect public health and to carry out their statutory responsibilities across a wide range of activities.</p>

  <p>There is also recognition by the European Union of the role of such facilities. As central competent authority for food safety and standards, the Food Standards Agency has a UK-wide responsibility under European legislation (Regulation 882/2004 on Official Food and Feed controls) to ensure that there is adequate laboratory capacity for the testing of food; a sufficient number of suitably qualified and experienced staff; and appropriate facilities and equipment to undertake official controls.</p>

The project also includes a review of current legislation relating to statutory notice requirements which should be completed by February 2009. Public Information Notices frequently have a statutory basis and the law of these could not be changed without parliamentary procedure. There will be consultation on the proposals and regulations will be drawn up which, if made, form the legal basis to allow certain notices to be published electronically.

  <p>Self referral of patients for physiotherapy services was piloted in Scotland between 2003 and 2005. Patients across Scotland can now self-refer into physiotherapy services. The Scottish Government is also funding the Working Health Services pilot in Dundee. Employees of small and medium-sized enterprises can self-refer for assessment and treatment through services such as physiotherapy, assisting recovery and minimising time off work.</p>

  <p>Similar services are being setup in NHS Borders and NHS Lothian.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government considers that good air links support Scotland&rsquo;s economy, including the tourism industry. The government has introduced the Scottish Climate Change Bill which sets a target of an 80% cut in Scotland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The target applies collectively across all sectors of the economy, including international aviation. Although the government is not in a position to assess the level of greenhouse gas emissions that will be generated by aviation resulting from Homecoming 2009 it is expected that the Homecoming Year may make flights to and from Scotland more fuel-efficient by filling empty seats.</p>

  <p>VisitScotland&rsquo;s promotional work for Homecoming Scotland 2009 is focussed on increasing overall tourism revenue from domestic and international tourism, rather than on straightforward visitor numbers. They will seek to measure the net positive difference which results from the intervention of EventScotland and VisitScotland in their marketing of Homecoming 2009.</p>

  <p>VisitScotland&rsquo;s European campaigns prioritise Homecoming Scotland, picking up on the culture, whisky and golf themes. VisitScotland has secured prominent positions for Homecoming Scotland throughout VisitBritain&rsquo;s web platforms and e-communications and PR programmes &ndash; this further extends the reach and impact of Homecoming.</p>

  <p>The Homecoming Scotland TV advert has been seen by over 60 per cent of the Scottish population in the week over St Andrews Day 2008. Tailored information on Homecoming has been mentioned in mailshots to 260,000 UK consumers through the Visitscotland relationship marketing programme last summer.</p>

  <p>Three hundred and fifty thousand UK consumers have received information about how to get involved and celebrate Burns through the World Famous Burns Supper campaign in November. 1.9 million UK consumers will have seen Homecoming press adverts in key magazines last autumn including <em>Coast Magazine</em>, <em>Good Housekeeping</em> and <em>Guardian Weekend</em>. Half a million London consumers have seen 25 large outdoor posters around the main arterial routes in London and digital advertising in over 30 underground stations last autumn.</p>

This will ensure a consistent approach to tackling energy efficiency across all sectors, and will allow for better alignment of reporting on implementation and carbon savings, which can then be accounted against the overall target of this bill.</p>

  <p>We will publish an outline of the action plan in the spring and will publish the final plan when the bill becomes an act.</p>

  <p>We will shortly be issuing revised guidance for implementation from April 2009 for operation of community service schemes. It has been agreed with the Association of Directors of Social Work that the overall aim should be for the work placement to start within 7 days of the order being made by the court. Whilst this will inevitably take time to achieve it should lead to significant improvements over current levels of performance.</p>

  <p>The planned audits of community service referred to in the reply to S3W-19200 answered on 15 January 2009 should provide an indication of the improvements achieved over the next financial year.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government have taken forward significant measures to tackle fine default. We are implementing summary justice reform which has brought improvements to the system and changes in the law under the Criminal Proceedings Reform Act. Fines enforcement officers were introduced under that Act.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Court Service is implementing a project to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of recovery of fines and financial penalties.</p>

  <p>Fines enforcement officers, currently 30 in number, are active in dealing with penalties payable to Sheriff Courts across Scotland and to Justice of the Peace Courts in those Sheriffdoms where the unification of the administration of the courts is in place. Fines enforcement officers are employed to advise those who have genuine difficulty in paying and to apply enforcement measures such as deduction from benefit where they refuse to pay.</p>

  <p>To reduce the use of custody in cases of low level fine default the Scottish Government also commenced provisions from 1 September 2007 requiring the mandatory use by courts of supervised attendance orders for fine default of &pound;500, where a custodial sentence would otherwise have been imposed.</p>

  <p>Discharge planning for prisoners with a diagnosis of severe and enduring mental illness will be undertaken in a multi-disciplinary way using the Care Programme Approach (CPA). CPA focuses on the care and treatment likely to minimise the risk posed. CPA will be initiated shortly before liberation by the prison&rsquo;s healthcare staff resulting in an additional case conference that focuses specifically on addressing clinical need.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are accountable for the quality of care and treatment they provide and for ensuring effective clinical governance arrangements are in place. NHS boards discharge these responsibilities by achieving the NHS Quality Improvement Scotland Clinical Governance and Risk Management Standards and by the work which they are taking forward on integrated care pathways, which will also be accredited by NHS Quality Improvement Scotland. This accountability applies to all patients including those who have been released from prison.</p>

Figures are available for the number of postholders affected by the reviews which have already been processed and this therefore allows a figure to be calculated for the number of postholders who are left and are, therefore, potentially affected by the outcome of outstanding review requests. These figures are presented in the following table. The figures are taken at 30 November 2008 and broken down by NHS board.</p>

  <p>Assimilation is being taken forward in partnership locally and I know that existing staff have generally been prioritised for assimilation over retirees. There will, therefore, be retirees waiting for assimilation in many parts of the country. The Scottish Government does not collect data on the numbers involved but these are likely to be relatively small in the context of the larger process.</p>

  <p>Significant progress on assimilation has been made during 2008. End of December figures indicate that over 138,000 substantive NHSScotland staff have now been assimilated to Agenda for Change. Health boards are continuing to work very hard to complete the assimilation process but some 960 substantive staff around the country remain to be placed on Agenda for Change scales.</p>

  <p>A proportion of those left to assimilate are cases where there is some difficulty with identifying the correct banding or where a special job evaluation process is required. Boards have left these posts till last and will be working through any issues which need to be addressed in assimilating these staff over the next few months in partnership with trade union and professional organisations.</p>

  <p>The launch of the Community Regeneration and Tackling Poverty learning network will be on Tuesday 27th January 2009. The network is new, but it builds on the work of earlier stakeholder fora supported by the Scottish Government. It now brings together in a more joined up way colleagues engaged in important linked areas such as community regeneration, financial inclusion, income inequality, employability and health inequalities.</p>

  <p>It will focus on practical issues highlighted by local partners, notably in the context of rolling out the Fairer Scotland Fund over the past year; and it will involve a series of workshops and other events designed to meet the learning needs identified by network members.</p>

  <p>The following table gives the maximum prisoner population during each calendar year from 1998 to 2008 and the date on which this maximum occurred.</p>

  <p>Early release of prisoners from prison on Home Detention Curfew (HDC) was introduced on 3 July 2006. For the purpose of providing a more complete reply the HDC figure for the relevant dates for 2006 to 2008 have been added as these prisoners would have otherwise been detained in prison and is more indicative of the overall prisoner population.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The SPS delivers a suite of prisoner programmes and approved activities that address issues or provide awareness pertaining to substance misuse, including alcohol. This suite of interventions is continually evolving to keep pace with current practice and changes in substance abuse trends in the community.</p>

  <p>Whilst the approved activity &quot;Alcohol Awareness&quot; specialises specifically on alcohol, and mainly the physiological effects of alcohol misuse, the other approved activities cover wider substance related awareness and issues, including alcohol.</p>

  <p>Currently this suite of substance related interventions includes the prisoner programme Substance Related Offending Behaviour Programme (SROBP) and approved activities Drugs Action for Change; First Step; Smart Recovery and Alcohol Awareness in public sector prisons.</p>

  <p>Currently HMP Kilmarnock delivers substance related approved activities &quot;Over-comers and Advanced Drug Awareness&quot; and plans are in place for Kilmarnock to introduce SROBP this year (2009-10).</p>

  <p>Currently HMP Dumfries delivers approved activity &quot;First Step&quot; and the Prisoner Programme &quot;Constructs&quot;. The aggregated risk and needs profile of prisoners at Dumfries indicates that this is the best use of the available resources at this time. Prisoners also have access to an Enhanced Addictions Casework Service (EACS) with interventions including alcohol assessment, one-to-one, group work and smoking cessation support.</p>

  <p>A total of 9,379 objections were received. Analysis shows that a total of 6,723 households submitted an objection. Of this 1,752 (26%) were from outwith the AB postcode area and came from other parts of the UK and overseas.</p>

  <p>Each objection was analysed individually. Some were postcards or e-mails raising standard points which could be answered quickly by providing standard answers and others raised a number of specific points requiring individual answers. Responding to what was a very large number of objectives has incurred a proportionate commitment of resources in terms of time and money, however it is not possible to accurately isolate this from the overall preparation costs.</p>

  <p>The cost of responding to objections is included in the consultants fees which are allocated across the scheme. Aberdeen City Council will pay 9.5% of the costs of the Northern Leg and Southern Leg as per the Memorandum of Understanding between the Project Partners.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-16500 on 2 October 2008.</p>

  <p>The Strategic Transport Projects Review (STPR) has recommended 29 transport interventions over the next 20 years that will let us plan for the delivery of an efficient, integrated transport network fit for the 21st century.</p>

  <p>The STPR has identified a hierarchy of maintaining and safely operating existing assets, making better use of existing capacity and finally adding targeted infrastructure improvements where there are strategic gaps to the road and rail networks.</p>

  <p>Taking forward the detailed design and development work arising from this hierarchy will confirm the extent of additional trunk road.</p>

  <p>Telephony Services used by the Scottish Executive are managed by Information Services and Information Systems (ISIS), a division of the Change and Corporate Services Directorate. Telephony services are supported by internal staff and delivered by a number of suppliers. There have been no significant changes to service and support contracts since May 2007.</p>

  <p>Telephony Services are currently provided by THUS, C&amp;W, and BT.</p>

  <p>The principal contract for hardware maintenance of Scottish Government telephony systems is held by Affiniti.</p>

  <p>The value for money in the provision of telephony services is regularly tested by procurement competition. The current voice services contract with THUS is due to expire in March 2009. A procurement competition is almost complete and due to award a new contract for voice services in January 2009.</p>

  <p>Suppliers&rsquo; terms vary but are typically 30 days. The Scottish Government is committed to helping businesses by paying invoices early and, to that end, the First Minister announced on 9 October 2008 the intention to pay invoices within 10 working days. Processes have been reviewed and amended as necessary to facilitate this and we have made significant progress in achieving this goal with 84% of invoices paid within 10 working days in December 2008 and 97% of invoices paid within suppliers terms over the same period.</p>

  <p>Whilst the question seeks information for a specific date, for the purpose of answering this question we have presumed the interest was for statistics relating to the year ending 31 March 2008.</p>

  <p>As reported in our answer to question S3W-16676 on 24 October 2008, there was a total of 150 sex offenders liberated from Scottish prisons in 2007-08.</p>

  <p>Of these 70 (49%) were deemed as suitable for participation on Sex Offender Treatment Programmes (SOTPs), 59 (39%) completed SOTPs before release from prison whilst the remaining 11 (7%) either dropped out of the programmes after starting, refused a place on the programmes when offered or had insufficient time left in their sentence to complete the programme before liberation when a place became available.</p>

  <p>The remaining 80 (51%) who were not assessed as suitable for SOTPs either refused assessment for SOTPs, indicated they would not participate on the programmes or had insufficient time in their sentence to complete the programme before liberation.</p>

  <p>These figures are consistent with expected trends for SOTP assessment, drop-out rates and delivery.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Rehabilitation treatment covers the full range of interventions and support services provided by SPS. These include: Prisoner Programmes, Approved Activities, Education &amp; Work opportunities, Links Support Services (accommodation, benefits, etc.), and health care and statutory supervision requirements. Due to the nature of their offence the majority of sex offenders are subject to statutory supervision and all will have had access to some of the services listed above, therefore all sex offenders will have received some form of rehabilitation treatment prior to release.</p>

  <p>The current policy on the management of mentally disordered offenders was established in January 1999 and is outlined in the document <em>Health, Social Work and related services for Mentally Disordered Offenders in Scotland</em> (Scottish Office, 1999). The overall aim of that policy has been to co-ordinate care and support for the benefit of the individual and to ensure public safety. The continuing direction of that policy since 1999 has resulted in the creation in Scotland of two regional medium secure facilities.</p>

  <p>The Orchard Clinic, which opened in 2000 in Edinburgh, provides 50 medium secure beds primarily for the population of the East of Scotland. The Rowanbank Clinic opened last year in Glasgow and provides 74 beds, primarily for the West of Scotland. The creation of these new units has seen a reduction in the number of beds required at the State Hospital. Plans are also being progressed for additional medium secure facilities at the Murray Royal Hospital, Perth providing 32 male beds.</p>

  <p>Further work has been taken forward by the Forensic Network, the three regional planning partnerships and the Scottish Government to model the future requirement for beds and the outcome of that work was published as a health department letter (HDL(2006)48) in 2006. That 2006 HDL set out the government&rsquo;s policy position with respect to the development of forensic mental health services in Scotland, the expectation that the forensic service configuration within Scotland is required to provide a full range of forensic inpatient services and the level at which those services should be commissioned. The commissioning structure recognised that it was not reasonable to expect each NHS board to provide services at each level in light of the relatively small numbers of patients involved and the specialised nature of the services (and staff) required to care for and treat these groups of patients. The expectation was and is that groups of NHS boards will come together to plan the provision of some services on a regional basis, and that these regional planning groups have to plan for all services outside the state hospital to ensure patients move through the system once out of the State Hospital. Discussions continue in that regard between health boards themselves as to how best to meet the need of these particular patient groups, and the Scottish Government continues to meet with the regional planning leads to monitor progress in relation to these services.</p>

  <p>A one pence cut in income tax via the Scottish variable rate would reduce the size of the Scottish Government Budget by approximately &pound;400 million. This would need to be funded by direct cuts in public services and infrastructure investment in Scotland. Given this binding constraint and the current economic climate, we have not considered this a credible economic policy option. Our analysis shows that government expenditure and accelerated investment, which as announced in the Budget Bill 2009-10 are supporting 4,700 jobs in the economy, are vital in supporting the economy at this time.</p>

  <p>Yes. Transport Scotland is an executive agency and its board is purely advisory; it has no statutory role. It is normal practice for the chief executives to chair the boards of executive agencies.</p>

  <p>1. The table does not include rail and trunk road contracts funded by the Scottish Government but where the Scottish ministers are not the contracting authority including the M74 Completion awarded March 2008 and A7 Auchenrivock awarded November 2008.</p>

  <p>2. For contracts marked with an asterisk, the tender value shown was calculated from indicative inputs for the services to produce a comparative cost of tender for the purposes of the tender competition. The actual value will vary and be determined by the actual scope of the services ordered by the employer.</p>
