  <p>&#163;4.5 million is being made available over three years to implement the inclusiveness recommendations from the Beattie Committee to improve support for students in further education. The BRITE (Beattie Resources for Inclusiveness in Technology and Education) Centre has been established through this funding. The centre offers a programme of staff development aimed at building the capacity of staff within colleges to identify and support the needs of students with learning disabilities such as dyslexia.</p>

  <p>A vast range of assistive technologies are available in the support of learners. I recently allocated an additional &#163;10 million to the Scottish Further Education Funding Council (SFEFC) to support colleges in the investment of major items of equipment and the purchase of auxiliary aids to support learners with special needs or disabilities.</p>

  <p>Dyslexia in Scotland raises awareness of dyslexia throughout Scotland and provides a national support and information service for people with, or who have an interest in, dyslexia. The Scottish Executive is providing funding of &#163;27,810 for 2002-03 to assist with the cost of maintaining its Scottish headquarters.</p>

  <p>The regulation and safety of medicines is reserved and is the responsibility of the Medicines Control Agency (MCA).</p>

  <p>The MCA has advised that Ritalin (methylphenidate hydrochloride) was assessed for quality, safety and efficacy at the time of licensing. As with all medicines, the safety of Ritalin is continually monitored by the agency and the independent expert advisory body, the Committee on Safety of Medicines. The authorised product information contains comprehensive information on the recognised side effects of treatment.</p>

  <p>There is the potential for abuse of Ritalin due to the nature of the drug. Ritalin has controlled drug status, which imposes restrictions on prescribing and handling. Caution is advised in patients who are emotionally unstable, such as those with a history of drug or alcohol abuse. The available clinical evidence indicates that treatment with Ritalin during childhood does not increase the likelihood of addiction in later life.</p>

  <p>The Committee on Safety of Medicines considered the issue of possible misuse of Ritalin in June 1999 and concluded that the product information contained adequate warnings and advice on prescribing.</p>

  <p>The clinical use of Ritalin for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) was reviewed by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) in 2000-01 who recommended that treatment with methylphenidate should only be initiated by child and adolescent psychiatrists or paediatricians with expertise in ADHD and that children on methylphenidate therapy should receive regular monitoring. When improvement has occurred treatment should be discontinued at intervals under careful specialist supervision, in order to assess both the child's progress and the need for continuation of therapy.</p>

  <p>In deciding whether to prescribe Ritalin for the treatment of ADHD, clinicians would be expected to take account of advice and guidance about the drug including the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) Guideline 52 on ADHD and the advice issued by NICE.</p>

  <p>It is thought that patient-held smart cards have the potential to put the patient in control of access to their records and that this might be especially beneficial when their health care providers span a number of health care organisations. For example, the card could contain a personal electronic signature which could unlock the information when used in conjunction with a card held by a clinician containing his/her electronic signature. This may contribute to the secure access infrastructure required for electronic health records.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are given a unified budget to enable them to meet the health care needs of their resident populations. There is no specific prescribing element uplift in the unified budget. It is for each individual NHS board to decide how much money to allocate to their prescribing budget.</p>

  <p>The Arbuthnott formula, which has a prescribing element, has informed NHS board allocations for financial years 2001-02 and 2002-03. On average each NHS board received a 6.5% increase in 2001-02 and a 7.2% increase in 2002-03. This was made up of a minimum increase for each NHS board of 5.5% in 2001-02 and 6.8% in 2002-03 and additional money for those NHS boards where their Arbuthnott shares were greater than their actual shares.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive provides funding to two recycling market groups, Recycling Market Development Scotland (Remade) and the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP). Through the support of Remade and WRAP the Scottish Executive has helped identify markets for recycled materials. Markets have already been identified for several new uses for recycled materials. For instance glass is now being used as an abrasive, a filtration medium, an aggregate and a fluxing agent in tiles and bricks. More information can be found on the WRAP and Remade websites, <a href="http://www.wrap.org.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.wrap.org.uk/ </a> and <a href="http://www.remade.org.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.remade.org.uk/</a> .</p>

  <p>The organisations are also working to further develop these and other markets. This work includes, appointing a WRAP Liaison Officer for Scotland, advising industry on the use of the materials and encouraging potential users to use them.</p>

  <p>As part of our "Know the Score" Drugs Communications Strategy, we are currently preparing a guidance leaflet for young people on the risks from drug-assisted sexual assault. In addition, it is likely that reference will be made to drug-assisted sexual assault in a new "clubbers guide" which is also under preparation. We hope to publish these materials by the end of the year. As part of this task, we are considering whether separate information and advice for licensees should be produced.</p>

  <p>Our guidance to medical professionals, <i>Managing Incidental Drug Misuse and Alcohol Problems in Mental Health Care Settings</i> , recommends that substance misuse is covered in assessments of patients with mental health problems. These assessments would address issues of self-harm.</p>

  <p>The <i>Guidelines on Clinical Management of Drug Misuse and Dependence</i> recommend that psychiatric issues should form part of assessments of patients seeking help with drug misuse problems.</p>

  <p>Further advice on developing integrated care for drug misusers was published this month. Integrated care aims to combine and co-ordinate all services required to meet assessed needs of drug misusers, including their mental health needs. Risks of suicide and self-harm form part of these assessments. We are also working with the Scottish Advisory Committee on Drug Misuse and the Scottish Advisory Committee on Alcohol Misuse to look further into the needs of people with drug and alcohol problems who may also have underlying mental health conditions.</p>

  <p>Treatment and disposal of municipal waste is the responsibility of the local authority, in this case Highland Council. The council is preparing a public private partnership (PPP) scheme as a long-term sustainable waste management solution which will be in accordance with the agreed Area Waste Plan. However, the council has informed the Executive of their intention to arrange for interim disposal of municipal waste, which is currently disposed of at Longman landfill site, in a landfill near Peterhead. The council has assessed that for this waste, traffic will amount to some 15 articulated vehicles per day.</p>
