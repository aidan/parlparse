  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what guidance it provides to local authorities in respect of the issuing of antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) to under 16-year-olds and whether it recommends that authorities try all other options before applying for ASBOs.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-09-20.S2W-28242.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80046" speakername="Hugh Henry" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0920.htm#se_Minister">

  <p>Scottish Executive guidance on antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) published in October 2004 makes clear that there are a wide range of interventions available to support young people and address troublesome behaviour before an application for an ASBO is considered. This guidance also states, however, that &quot;there must be flexibility to allow for use of an ASBO before the full range of options has been exhausted where there is a pressing need to protect the community&quot;.</p>

  <p>The full guidance is available on our dedicated antisocial behaviour website:</p>

  <p>Funding for the Crofting Counties Agricultural Grant Scheme (CCAGS) is not ring-fenced and there are no plans to introduce ring fencing. In recent years, resources for CCAGS have not been fully utilised due to the lack of demand from crofters and others currently eligible.</p>

  <p>Section 15 of the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 gives a power to local authorities and national park authorities to install and maintain means of contributing to the comfort and convenience of those exercising access rights, and in exercising this power they are required to have regard to the needs of people with disabilities.</p>

  <p>Scottish Natural Heritage has recently published a report on research aimed at finding out the special requirements that deaf people have when visiting the countryside. The report includes a number of recommendations that could be taken forward relatively easily and quickly by all bodies responsible for the provision of access, when running an event, providing facilities and having a centre or site that is open to the public.</p>

  <p>Part 1 of the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 gives access authorities the power to undertake the maintenance of core paths. Exercise of that power is a matter for the discretion of individual authorities and they will need to determine the extent of any such activity on the basis of their assessment of local needs and priorities and having regard to the availability of funds within their overall budget. Funding for work on paths is also available from other sources, including land management contracts under the Scottish Rural Development Programme. Decisions on funding for local government and other programmes beyond 2007-08 are a matter for the next Spending Review which is due to take place next year.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-26029 by Nicol Stephen on 6 June 2006, how its guidance issued to further and higher education colleges in May 2005 meets the requirements of HM Inspectorate of Education (HMIE); why HMIE has raised the issue of enhanced disclosure for staff in a position of trust with students under 18 or vulnerable adults in inspection reports, and why students under 18 and vulnerable adult learners are still exposed to risk as a result of non-compulsion of disclosure checks of college staff.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-09-20.S2W-26576.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80115" speakername="Nicol Stephen" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0920.htm#15">

  <p>HMIE&rsquo;s expectations in this area are founded on legislation, Lifelong Partners (the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s school-college partnership strategy), and its own evaluation of existing good practice. HMIE were heavily involved in both the policy development for Lifelong Partners, and in the production of the accompanying guidance documents. College review reports routinely comment on the effectiveness of child protection arrangements, including college policies and procedures and arrangements for disclosure. During its reviews, HMIE uses the <em>Standards and Quality in Scottish Further Education Quality Framework for Scottish FE Colleges</em> (May 2004). In line with this framework and relevant legislation, HMIE expects that colleges:</p>

  <p>have relevant policies and procedures in place (including disclosure) and that these are implemented effectively when necessary;</p>

  <p>have a nominated protection co-ordinator/s;</p>

  <p>undertake Enhanced Disclosure for staff working regularly with pupils and students under 18 years of age, and with vulnerable adults, and</p>

  <p>provide appropriate staff development and training in the area of protecting young people and staff.</p>

  <p>Where colleges fail to meet these expectations adequately, HMIE will raise the issue in inspection reports, and Colleges are required to submit an action plan to the Scottish Funding Council for Further and Higher Education to bring about improvement. Progress against this plan is then monitored by HMIE.</p>

  <p>On the general issue of compulsion of disclosure checks, the Protection of Children (Scotland) Act 2003 requires that educational establishments take reasonable steps to ensure that people working in them are not on the Disqualified from Working with Children List (DWCL). However, a new vetting and barring scheme, building on the current system and the recommendations from the Bichard inquiry, is currently being developed. According to this, there will be a list and arrangements for the protection of adults at risk as well as a need for all those working in child care or &quot;adult at risk&quot; settings to register with the new scheme. This will be done via an enhanced disclosure in the first instance, which can then be updated should any new information come into the system. Legislation to provide the framework for the new scheme is proposed for this autumn, with an implementation programme for the new scheme commencing at the end of 2007.</p>

  <p>While disclosure checks provide a valuable contribution to the protection of young people and vulnerable adults, this does not remove the need for robust recruitment practices and sound child protection policies and procedures.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not have the legal powers to ban the planting of any GM crop which has received European approval for cultivation. GM legislation requires that approved GMOs move freely in the single market. Under the legislation a country can take out emergency measures (safeguard action) where there is new evidence that an approved GMO represents a serious risk to human health and the environment.</p>

  <p>At present there are no GM potatoes with approval for commercial cultivation in Europe</p>

  <p>If a GM potato has received a consent under the Food and Feed Regulation 1829/2003 to allow it to be used as food or feed then it cannot be banned anywhere in the European Union.

The e-magazine connects Scots and those with an affinity to Scotland with modern Scotland. Showcasing Scotland as a great place to live and work, visit, study and invest.</p>

  <p>The scotlandistheplace.com website was set up as part of the Relocation Advisory Service to offer a comprehensive and interactive advice service to those interested in living and working in Scotland. The success of <a href="http://www.scotlandistheplace.com" target="_blank">www.scotlandistheplace.com</a> is assessed by tracking the number of visits to the web site and the number of enquiries that are made to the Relocation Advisory Service via the e mail links on <a href="http://www.scotlandistheplace.com" target="_blank">www.scotlandistheplace.com</a> .</p>

  <p>The Relocation Advisory Service is a three year pilot project and a review of phase 2 is currently underway. The phase 2 evaluation of the Relocation Advisory Service includes a survey of customers and qualitative research with customers, some of whom will have had cause to use the website. There will also be a specific survey of website users.</p>

  <p>Drawing up a plan of core paths by February 2008 is a statutory obligation for local authorities under the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003. Failure to meet statutory obligations is not an option for local authorities. This is a matter of prioritising within available funding consistent with the general principles of the local government funding arrangements.

The total amount estimated for 2004-05, as reported in the final audited return, is &pound;116,955,932. The provisional (not yet audited) figure for 2005-06 is &pound;130,667,734.</p>

  <p>These figures however are only indicative of the potential additional revenue that could be collected, as the rateable values of these unoccupied properties could be subject to revaluation following occupation, or a range of other forms of relief, depending on the status of the business.</p>

  <p>The delivery of business support is mainly a matter for Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise. However, there are a number of schemes delivered or funded directly by the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>Support is available under SMART, SPUR and SPUR<sup>PLUS</sup> grant schemes for newly-formed companies to carry out projects to develop new products and processes. Additional support through the SCORE programme is available to assist companies undertaking research and development projects in collaboration with the research base. The Innovators Counselling and Advisory Service for Scotland (ICASS) provides free and impartial expert advice on the development and protection of innovative ideas to Scotland&rsquo;s lone inventors and small innovative companies.</p>

  <p>In regard to investment, Regional Selective Assistance provides discretionary grants that create or safeguard jobs in Assisted Areas - areas designated for regional aid under European community law.</p>

  <p>The Executive funds the Carbon Trust in Scotland to assist companies in becoming more energy efficient, reducing their carbon emissions and saving on their energy bills. For new companies, the trust offers design advice to help them make the most of low carbon technologies, install effective energy controls and ensure that buildings are economically responsible.</p>

The accounts provide information on both gross (total operating income) and net (Grant in Aid) expenditure. The figures in the table below show gross expenditure and include the cost of delivering Careers Scotland services. Additionally, an amount is paid each year from the Department for Work and Pensions to Scottish Enterprise for the cost of training allowances paid to participants in some schemes, and that amount is shown separately.</p>

  <p>Licensing of medicines is reserved and is the responsibility of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Before a medicine can be placed on the UK market it must have a marketing authorisation either from the MHRA or the European Medicines Agency (EMEA). The MHRA has advised that Elaprase does not have a UK marketing authorisation, but an application is pending with the EMEA.</p>

  <p>Visitscotland.com acts as an important source of information to our many visitors who come to Scotland to participate in outdoor activities. It provides information about the outdoor activities on offer, as well as providing a facility for booking accommodation as part of the visit. It also provides and takes bookings for a range of pre-packaged products such as events-based breaks which include accommodation as well as a ticket for the event. It does not, however, take bookings directly for outdoor activities which are not part of these packages, although it will refer enquirers to the appropriate provider if they wish to make a booking.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has committed funding for a five year programme of work being undertaken by the Moredun Research Institute to monitor the impact of squirrel pox virus. A separate research tender is due to be published shortly to commission work on the transmission routes of squirrel pox virus.

  <p>Recent reports of an increase in the incidence of squirrel pox virus in the South of Scotland have required an urgent response from SNH and FCS both of whom have supported additional measures for red squirrel conservation which are now underway. Options for a longer term strategy have been evaluated by SNH and FCS at my request. SNH will take these into account in developing its plans for prioritisation of different species management programmes in their Species Framework and which I hope to discuss with them later this year.</p>
