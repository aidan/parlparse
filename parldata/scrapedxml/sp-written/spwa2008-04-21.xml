  <p>The information requested is given in the following tables. The figures are compiled on the basis of year of registration rather than year of occurrence. A breakdown of this information by local authority area is not held centrally by the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>This is a matter for local authorities. They should ensure that they have a range of suitable accommodation to meet the needs of their young people leaving care. Guidance on the Regulations on Supporting Young People Leaving Care makes clear that while there is no one model of accommodation provision, supported lodgings, shared accommodation and independent tenancies should be available for young people. Accommodation and support services should be flexible and focus on the individual needs of the young person.</p>

  <p>No. Local authorities have a responsibility to undertake Pathways assessments and planning with eligible young people prior to leaving care which should set out what kind of accommodation best meets the needs of the young person and how this is to be obtained.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-10537 on 13 March 2008. The implementation of <em>Getting it Right for Every Child</em> is continuing through pathfinding activity and in partnership with agencies, who are starting to test how readily they can put <em>Getting it Right for Every Child</em> into practice. If this suggests that legislation would help remove barriers to applying the getting it right approach fully, this would be considered at some future point.</p>

  <p>The research report <em>Disability Equality and Scottish Local Authorities: Access to Services</em> , was published in July 2005, prior to the introduction of the public sector duty to promote equality of opportunity for disabled people, which came into force in December 2006. The report was focussed on local authorities and neither the previous Labour/Liberal Democrat Executive nor the Scottish Government has taken any action specifically in response. However, the public sector duty to promote equality of opportunity for disabled people will help local authorities to address the issues raised in the report. A range of guidance documents produced by the Disability Rights Commission is available to assist public bodies to deliver the duty, including guidance specifically written for local authorities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to tackling domestic abuse and ensuring that all those affected by it are given the support they need and those perpetrating it are dealt with effectively.</p>

  <p>The National Strategy to Address Domestic Abuse in Scotland recognised the need to take account of the differing needs of women and children from black and minority ethnic (BME) communities, to ensure any provision is relevant and appropriate to them. Additional difficulties, for example, of racism, language, isolation or stigma may also be present and need to be addressed by service providers.</p>

  <p>More than &pound;44 million has been committed over the next three years to support organisations working with women and children and young people who have experienced domestic abuse or other aspects of violence against women. Included within this figure is support for a number of projects working specifically to address the complex needs of BME women and children experiencing domestic abuse, at both a local and national level.</p>

  <p>For example, over the next three years, funding of &pound;270,293 has been awarded to Amina to provide support to BME women experiencing domestic abuse and increase Muslim women&rsquo;s understanding and knowledge of domestic abuse. Funding of &pound;204,612.71 has been granted to Hemat Gryffe Women&rsquo;s Aid to enable them to provide temporary refuge accommodation to BME women and their children escaping domestic abuse. Hemat Gryffe also operate a drop in centre which BME women can use to seek support, advocacy and information on forced marriage, the two year immigration rule, and welfare rights among other issues. Shakti Women&rsquo;s Aid has also been awarded &pound;258,245 to provide the same type service as Hemat Gryffe in Edinburgh and the surrounding area.</p>

  <p>The national Rape Crisis Helpline uses services such as the language line to ensure that support can be provided to women in their own language. Work is also on-going with the Scottish Domestic Abuse Helpline to recruit, train and support volunteers from all BME communities.</p>

  <p>The redevelopment of the Ravenscraig site supports all the Scottish Government&rsquo;s strategic objectives, economic and social. For example, it is expected to create a range of flexible accommodation for a diverse range of local businesses, generate 12,000 new jobs and attract some &pound;1.2 billion of private sector investment over the life of the project. The project should also deliver a &pound;70 million state of the art campus for Motherwell College, with conference facilities and a public learning centre. It is expected to provide 446 training places and some 400 vocational qualifications as well as a &pound;30 million regional sports facility, cycle routes and adventure playgrounds, and retail and leisure space.</p>

  <p>The project is also expected to create some 3,500 new homes and become home to a new urban community of around 10,000 people. It will also embrace the principles of sustainable development in the creation of new natural habitats, renewable energy and good public transport links.</p>

  <p>Discussions are still continuing with Whitehall departments in efforts to find a solution to this problem. A letter emphasising the need to make progress with this issue was sent to the Secretary of State for Defence on 25 March.</p>

  <p>The chief complication is that the subject-matter of inquiries into military deaths is reserved. The Scottish Parliament at present cannot legislate only for military deaths because that would cut across the defence reservation in the Scotland Act 1998.</p>

  <p>Ministers are acutely aware of the sensitivity of this subject and will continue to explore with the UK Government how the investigations and inquiries into the deaths of Scottish-based service personnel can be dealt with in a way which minimises the additional distress for bereaved families caused by them having to travel to the south of England for inquest hearings.</p>

  <p>There are, however, difficult legal and policy issues which have to be resolved and which will take time to work through. They are likely to require changes in the law on both sides of the border.</p>

  <p>I met with Commissioner Borg in mid-March and discussed fuel issues with him. I am clear that there must be a level playing field across Europe &ndash; a point I made in our meeting and will continue to make in Brussels.</p>

  <p>The Commissioner said that he was aware of the Spanish and French aid schemes. His Services have looked at the information which is in the public domain and it would seem that the Spanish scheme falls under the <em>de minimis </em>provisions<em>. </em>In such cases, there is no obligation on the member state to notify the Commission. His Services are still assessing the aid notified by France.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to answer to question S3W-11482 on 10 April 2008, I have commissioned a report on the trends in fuel prices and the implications this has for our fleets &ndash; material which I will share with the industry as I review the potential options available to mitigate the increased cost. Once we have a better understanding of these potential options, I have agreed with Commissioner Borg that our officials will meet to evaluate them against state aid rules. I have already committed, for instance, that provided it is compatible with state aid rules, the Scottish Government will extend our payment of the installation warranty cover of tamper resistant vessel monitoring systems for a further three years.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to addressing forced marriage and in 2005 the previous administration along with the UK Government undertook a consultation on whether forced marriage should be criminalised. The majority of respondents felt that creating specific criminal legislation would not be the most effective way of tackling this very serious issue.</p>

  <p>Many reasons were given for this, including the potentially negative impact of legislation on victims; concern that children could be hidden overseas to escape the law, and that crimes would be difficult to define. But the biggest concern was over racial segregation and that this might be seen as a minority law.</p>

  <p>However, we are going to consult on whether civil legislation should be introduced to protect those who may be affected. This consultation will link with the work currently underway within communities to raise awareness of forced marriage.</p>

  <p>Members of the Forced Marriage Network are key to this activity and the network will reconvene in the next few months to further develop the Scottish Government&rsquo;s work in this area.</p>

  <p>It is not known how many cases of forced marriage have been reported in Scotland, as this information is not collected centrally. However, from January 2008 the Forced Marriage Unit has started to collect information, on a regional basis, on the number of enquiries they have received. To date eight enquiries from Scotland have been received.</p>

  <p>A wide range of actions is required to meet the 2012 target and it is for each local authority to decide the most effective methods of achieving the target in their area. It is also the responsibility of each local authority to allocate the total financial resources available to it on the basis of local needs and priorities. Central government funding formerly ring-fenced for homelessness services has been absorbed into the main local government settlement for 2008-11 and local authorities and their partners can access a wide range of resources in order to progress towards the target.</p>

  <p>The national performance framework includes an indicator relating to the entitlement of homeless households to settled accommodation by 2012. The Scottish Government will monitor and publish national performance against all indicators in the framework. The HL1 homelessness statistics system provides information on performance against this indicator at national and local authority levels. The indicator is available for use within the single outcome agreements which are currently being developed by local authorities and the Scottish Government. Local authorities also continue to work towards the 2009 interim targets set out in the ministerial statement on the abolition of priority need published in December 2005.</p>

  <p>The plans in place for dealing with bluetongue, should it arrive in Scotland, were described previously in the answer to question S3W-4395 on 16 October 2007. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="../../../webapp/wa.search" target="_self">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a> .</p>

  <p>The main focus of the immediate response would be to declare a 20km radius Control Zone around the infected premises, along with a minimum 100km radius Protection Zone and a Surveillance Zone extending 50km beyond this, and to introduce movement restrictions within these zones. Movement of animals within or out of these zones would only be permitted in certain circumstances and under licence with certain compulsory precautions, e.g. testing for disease or the use of insecticides.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Government has initiated tender procedures aimed at securing up to 12 million doses of inactivated bluetongue vaccine for the Scottish livestock industry. It has been agreed with stakeholders that this vaccine would be best used next winter when it is hoped that animals can be vaccinated before disease reaches Scotland, though this is subject to disease developments.</p>

  <p>The priority continues to be to keep bluetongue out of Scotland. The most important protection for Scotland continues to be by farmers on the ground being careful of where they source their livestock, being vigilant for signs of the disease and reporting any suspicions promptly.</p>

  <p>In the short term we are working with the council and the third sector to put in place new arrangements which will provide sustainable opportunities for those with learning disabilities in Aberdeen. The Minister for Enterprise announced on 16 April 2008 that the Aye Can project in Aberdeen will move to operate in the third sector under these new arrangements. We expect others to make that transition once their business plans have been examined. In the medium term we will await the outcome of the Account&rsquo;s Commission&rsquo;s public hearing which is scheduled to start on 13 May 2008. In the longer term, we are already committed to a review of the local government finance funding formula in time for the next three year settlement in 2011-12.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has held extensive discussions with small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) representatives including Scottish Chambers of Commerce, CBI Scotland and the Federation of Small Businesses. These discussions have led to the introduction of a number of measures to help SMEs gain access to more business opportunities from the public sector. These include a Suppliers Charter, National Advertising Portal and the Single Point of Enquiry. At the end of December 2007, Scottish Procurement Directorate were involved in launching the &quot;Tendering for Public Contracts&quot; document designed as a short guide to help SMEs participate in public sector procurement.</p>

  <p>For consistency with other parts of the Scottish Government in calculating spend, the Scottish Procurement Directorate defines businesses on number of staff:</p>

  <p>Small business - less than 50 staff.</p>

  <p>Small and medium-sized enterprises - less than 250 staff.</p>

  <p>The Federation of Small Businesses has agreed that numbers of staff should be used to define organisations in terms of small and medium-sized enterprises, where numbers of staff are not available, financial data should be used. There are no plans at present to change these definitions.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is taking forward a comprehensive implementation programme to deliver the provisions of the Protection of Vulnerable Groups (Scotland) Act 2007. This includes developing information flows with partners, preparing guidance and training, developing the infrastructure for the new scheme and the IT systems that will support it and ensuring that the Scottish scheme works in tandem with the scheme being developed for other parts of the UK. We are currently analysing stakeholders&rsquo; responses to the wide ranging consultation on related policy issues which closed on 12 February 2008. Some of these will have an impact on the date at which the scheme commences so we are not yet in a position to confirm when this will be. We will ensure that there is plenty of notice of that date to allow organisations time to prepare.</p>

  <p>The Fairer Scotland Fund (FSF) was introduced on 1 April 2008, and replaced seven previous funding streams. This was, in part, in response to a recommendation by the previous administration&rsquo;s Finance Committee to simplify and better co-ordinate funding streams aimed at tackling poverty and deprivation. The member was of course Convenor of the Finance Committee at that time.</p>

  <p>For the amounts allocated to each local authority area under each of these funding streams I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-8601 on 13 February, 2008. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="../../../webapp/wa.search" target="_self">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a> .</p>

  <p>Allocations of the FSF were based on an assessment of need. The FSF is allocated on a transparent, objective methodology, using the most up-to-date evidence available from the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) 2006. A similar method of allocation was used in the past to distribute the funding streams the FSF has replaced.</p>

  <p>The FSF is ring-fenced within the Local Government Settlement (LGS) in 2008-09 and 2009-10. In 2008-09 West Dunbartonshire&rsquo;s allocation will be &pound;5.946 million and in 2009-10 &pound;5.507 million. In 2010-11 the FSF will be rolled up into the LGS. It will be the responsibility of each local authority to allocate funds on the basis of national priorities and local needs. Using the latest GDP Deflator tables, the annual percentage change in real terms between 2008-09 and 2009-10 is -10%.</p>

  <p>This information is not collated centrally. It is a matter for local authority employers to determine relevant salary levels on an individual basis in line with the guidance provided by the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers. This is now contained in the handbook of conditions of service part 2, section 1.8 to 1.23.</p>
