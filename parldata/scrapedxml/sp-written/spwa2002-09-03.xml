  <p>The Executive has recently published a Know the Score booklet on cannabis, which includes a description of the risks to mental health posed by this drug. The booklet has been widely distributed; for example to GP practices, NHS boards and drug agencies throughout Scotland. People who may be concerned about cannabis misuse can also speak to trained operators at the free and confidential Know the Score information line, or they can log on to the Know the Score website.</p>

  <p>Our guidance to medical professionals <i>Managing Incidental Drug Misuse and Alcohol problems in Mental Health Care Settings</i> recommends that drug misuse is covered in assessments of patients with mental health problems. The <i>Guidelines on Clinical management of Drug Misuse and Dependence</i> recommend that psychiatric issues should form part of assessments of patients seeking help with drug misuse problems.</p>

  <p>Further advice on developing integrated care for drug misusers in Scotland will be published in October 2002. Integrated care aims to combine and co-ordinate all services required to meet the assessed needs of drug users including their mental health needs. We are also working with the Scottish Advisory Committee on Drug Misuse to look further into the needs of drug misusers with underlying mental health problems.</p>

  <p>A report from the statutory Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs suggests that cannabis misuse triggers long-lasting mental health problems in relatively few cases, although it can undoubtedly worsen pre-existing mental health conditions. We are not aware of any current research which suggests that cannabis misuse increases the risk of suicide.</p>

  <p>In the process of monitoring performance against the contract, the SPS requires Kilmarnock Prison Services Limited (KPSL) to provide detailed information on a wide range of outputs.

  <p>The Scottish Executive provides funds to the Scottish Road Safety Campaign for the production of key road safety education initiatives and publicity campaigns. The campaign&rsquo;s business plan for 2002-03 includes publicity on major causes of road accident fatalities and serious injuries such as speeding, drink driving and drug driving. There are no plans for a campaign on difficulties caused by oil or diesel spills.</p>

  <p>Out of a total of 14,707 injury road accidents in Scotland in 2001, there were 33 accidents, including one fatal, in which the presence of oil or diesel on the road was recorded. This represents 0.2% of injury accidents.</p>

  <p>No formal assessment of the impact of staff turnover on Inverclyde Social Inclusion Partnership (SIP) has been carried out by either the Scottish Executive or Communities Scotland, who now manage the SIP programme.</p>

  <p>Following concerns expressed by partners on the SIP board on staffing and other issues, officials from Communities Scotland did however attend the SIP board meeting on 16 July to establish the extent to which the SIP is addressing these issues.</p>

  <p>The support team was one of the items on the agenda. We are satisfied steps have now been taken to appoint staff and note that the SIP hopes to have the support team up to full complement soon.</p>

  <p>The Induction Implementation Group, established to develop the detail of the Teacher Induction Scheme, have been exploring the option of a second intake to the scheme. We have sought initial views from all councils and have discussed the matter at a meeting of the Association of Directors of Personnel.</p>

  <p>A final conclusion will be reached as soon as possible, however, it is clear a number of significant obstacles remain to creating a second intake point. Officials are therefore also examining whether alternative means exist of addressing the concerns of these graduates.</p>

  <p><i>The Cryptosporidium Directions 2002</i> (paragraph 3(1)(a)) require Scottish Water to monitor their raw water sources for the presence of cryptosporidium and these data are collected to provide an indication of likely challenges to the treatment plant. This monitoring is upstream of the critical control point monitoring that is undertaken on the treatment works. There is no time period specified in the regulations for the results of surface water samples to be reported. The cryptosporidum directions prescribe time periods of 72 hours and 24 hours respectively, for routine and emergency samples of treated water to be analysed and reported.</p>

However, a full report into the circumstances surrounding the water alert in Glasgow will be published by the Incident Control Team, which is chaired by a consultant in Public Health Medicine from Greater Glasgow NHS Board.</p>
