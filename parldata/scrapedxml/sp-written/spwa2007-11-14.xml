  <p>The following research, which will help to inform the review of the antisocial behaviour strategy, has already been published:</p>

  <p><em>Use of Antisocial Behaviour Orders in Scotland</em> (20 September 2007, Bib. number 43671);</p>

  <p><em>A Review of Dispersal Powers </em>(25 October 2007, Bib. number 43909);</p>

  <p><em>The Impact of Local Antisocial Behaviour Strategies at the Neighbourhood Level </em>(25 October 2007, Bib. number 44006), and</p>

  <p><em>An Evaluation of Local Authority Noise Nuisance Services</em> (25 October 2007, Bib. number 44007).</p>

  <p>In addition, as part of the review we are conducting interviews with each police force in Scotland and with most Scottish local authorities to develop our understanding of the use and effectiveness of key powers in the Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004. We are also conducting further research on the breach rate for Antisocial Behaviour Orders (ASBOs) to supplement the research on ASBOs referred to above.</p>

  <p>We may instigate further research as necessary during the course of the review.</p>

  <p>Since 2005, public satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the ways in which local authorities are tackling antisocial behaviour has been measured through a specific question in the Scottish Household Survey. In addition, many local authorities conduct their own public satisfaction surveys and solicit customer feedback and reflect this information in the annual outcome agreement reports they submit to the Scottish Government for assessment.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the review of the national antisocial behaviour strategy will consider the use and effectiveness of key measures in the Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004 and we will be consulting with communities on this as part of the review.</p>

  <p>No estimate has been made of the additional teachers required by individual local authorities to reduce class sizes in primary 1 to primary 3 to a maximum of 18. We carry out an annual national teacher workforce planning exercise which estimates the number of teachers that require to be trained in the years ahead taking into account demographic changes in the pupil and teacher populations. The General Registers of Scotland recently published revised population projections that will need to be taken into account in this year&rsquo;s exercise.

  <p>We are committed to ensuring that the implementation of the Protection of Vulnerable Groups (Scotland) Act 2007 is carefully managed and that all sectors and users are supported through the transition from the existing multiple disclosure regime to the new streamlined vetting and barring system. Resources will be made available for this purpose including for training and support to organisations that will use the scheme.</p>

  <p>Implementation of the Protection of Vulnerable Groups (Scotland) Act 2007 will establish a new vetting and barring scheme which will reduce bureaucracy around the disclosure process for individuals working with children and/or protected adults. Under the current system, individuals have to provide all the requisite personal information every time they make an application for enhanced disclosure. In future, such individuals will become members of the vetting and barring scheme so that subsequent applications for disclosure will be much more straightforward. There will also be no need for employers to repeatedly request disclosures for the same staff as they will be informed of any additional vetting information that brings into question the individual&rsquo;s continued suitability to work with vulnerable groups.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-5136 by Nicola Sturgeon on 30 October 2007, whether the decision-making process in the review of cleft lip and palate services in Aberdeen is the same as the process that will be used to review other areas of NHS Scotland&rsquo;s national service delivery.</p>

  <p>The highly specialised surgical element of the cleft lip and palate service is formally designated as a national service. All of these services are subject to regular review to make sure that they continue to meet the criteria for designation. The decision-making process used in the review of the cleft lip and palate surgical service was the same as that used in relation to reviews of any of the services which have been formally designated as national services.</p>

  <p>Our recently-published discussion document <em>Better Health, Better Care</em> made it clear that in making decisions about the future configuration of services there will be a clear presumption against centralisation. We accept that there may be occasions when it makes sense to concentrate services. Any such moves must, however, result in benefits to patients and be subject to meaningful consultation and independent scrutiny to ensure that they are based on the best available evidence and give due weight to the views of local people.</p>

  <p>Our housing discussion document, <em>Firm Foundations: The Future of Housing in Scotland, </em> sets out our proposals to challenge local authorities, developers and builders to increase the rate of new housing supply to at least 35,000 per year by the middle of the next decade. This increase in supply would apply to all tenures, both market and affordable housing and would require all new homes to be built by the high environmental standards set by the relevant planning requirements and building standards applicable at that time.</p>

  <p>Revised energy standards were introduced on 1 May 2007, for all new buildings and those which are converted, extended or altered. These measures are the best in the UK and are expected to save around 6,000 tonnes of carbon per year, on the basis of 35,000 new houses per year, which is an 18-25% saving compared with 2005. The energy standards required to be met by new houses are the functional standards for <em>Section 6: Energy in the Building (Scotland) Regulations 2004</em> as amended in 2006 and 2007.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers appointed an Expert Panel which met in September 2007 to advise on a Low Carbon Buildings Standards Strategy for Scotland. The report of the panel is likely to set out a number of workstreams on a wide range of energy efficiency and performance measures specific to buildings, including the use of low carbon equipment. The panel&rsquo;s report is due before the end of the year.</p>

  <p>The requirements of <em>Scottish Planning Policy 6: Renewable Energy</em> for the use of onsite zero and low carbon equipment to contribute to a reduction in carbon emissions will operate alongside, and in addition to, the requirements set out in building standards.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government analysed the amount of Housing Association Grant (HAG) that Communities Scotland paid out between 2002-03 and 2006-07 to support the construction of new houses for social rent. The analysis showed that the average amount of grant per house rose from &pound;52,000 in 2002-03 to &pound;79,000 in 2006-07: equivalent to an annual increase of 8% in real terms over the period.</p>

  <p>Factors that may have contributed to the increase include land and construction costs. In <em>Firm Foundations: the Future of Housing in Scotland</em>, the Scottish Government proposes to address these and other contributory factors, and ensure that public expenditure supports the largest possible programme of new social housing, through the introduction of arrangements for awarding HAG on a competitive basis.</p>

  <p>The purpose of the Housing Supply Task Force is to promote action and to make a practical difference to the delivery of housing across Scotland. The investigative work that the task force is undertaking is with the purpose of challenging those with responsibility for delivery and pressing for change where this is hampering housing supply.</p>

  <p>While increasing housing supply is vital, we recognise that the new homes need to be built to high standards of design and sustainability. Sustainability requires that homes can accommodate the needs of an ageing and diverse population, including the needs of people with disabilities. The new Scottish building regulations include requirements that will make homes more accessible and easier to adapt in future. We will also be stressing to local authorities the importance of taking into account the needs of this important group within our communities in the preparation of their next local housing strategies.</p>

  <p>As a government we are determined to deal with both the causes and effects of the court actions we have inherited relating to slopping out. I have today confirmed that the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) will invest on average &pound;120 million a year to build long-needed replacement prisons in the north-east and Bishopbriggs and end the conditions that leave the system open to these claims.</p>

  <p>Slopping out was first held by the Scottish courts to be in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights in Napier, a case relating to prison conditions going back to 1999 and decided in 2004.</p>

  <p>Further actions in the Court of Session and the sheriff court were sisted pending the outcome of the House of Lords decision in the related case of Somerville.</p>

  <p>In September 2006 the then Scottish Executive made a concession in the light of European Court of Human Rights jurisprudence to settle claims where prisoners had been detained in a shared cell with no access to in-cell sanitation. Offers of settlement were limited to those cases which then fell within the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s interpretation of the time bar in human rights cases. The Scottish Prison Service at that time made provision in its accounts against the possibility of further successful claims.</p>

  <p>On 24 October 2007 the House of Lords ruled that the Scotland Act 1998 does not provide an explicit time bar for human rights claims brought against Scottish ministers.</p>

  <p>In the light of this ruling we have concluded that we have no option but to settle outstanding court cases where an individual has been detained in the relevant conditions for a material period of time, subject to any general provisions on prescription and limitation of claims and delay. To continue to defend these cases would incur further costs for no public benefit. The cases will be settled using the provision previously made in SPS&rsquo;s accounts.</p>

  <p>The effect of the House of Lords ruling is to leave the Scottish Government as the only public authority exposed to claims of this kind without a one year time bar. I have made it clear to the UK Government that I regard that position as untenable and unacceptable and that action is required to restore the position to what we believe was intended in 1998 and was understood to be case before now. If that requires amendment of the Scotland Act, I believe the UK Government should be prepared to consider bringing forward legislation to that effect. I continue to discuss these points with the UK Government and will give further details to Parliament in due course.</p>

  <p>Bluetongue vaccine for the strain of virus currently circulating in England and parts of mainland Europe is currently under development and it is hoped that it will be available by mid-2008.

  <p>The deployment of resources is an operational matter for chief constables. The Scottish Government will continue to work with key stakeholders to ensure that more of the skills and experience of those officers recently retired or about to retire are retained.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to the UK Government&rsquo;s target to eradicate child poverty by 2020. As the new national outcomes and indicators that we published last week make clear, we will measure the effectiveness of our combined efforts to tackle child poverty in Scotland through the measure of relative child poverty, as reported annually in the Households Below Average Income statistics.</p>

  <p>The purpose of the Housing Supply Task Force is to promote action that will make a practical difference to the increase of housing supply across all tenures in Scotland. Membership of the core group has deliberately been restricted to those in a position to bring about change to the delivery of more housing. Through its activities, the Task Force will engage with a wider set of interests concerned with housing delivery.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises the particular housing needs of people with disabilities. We are determined to drive forward the integration of equality into all our policies and plans and, with this in mind, have specifically sought the views of disability organisations on the range of proposals set out in our recent housing discussion document <em>Firm Foundations</em>.</p>

  <p>The consultation process is being carried out through a combination of written correspondence and discussions with key stakeholders. The Scottish Government will take account of feedback from written responses, meetings and discussions before we announce our considered strategic decision on the future of sportscotland. The Scottish Government is very conscious that the final decision on the future of sportscotland will have an enormous impact on the lives and future of the staff at sportscotland. We have therefore made a commitment to announcing the outcome before the end of the year.</p>

  <p>All consultees were invited in September to submit their views. Many responses have already been received and will be taken into account in our consideration of strategic options, the outcome of which we will announce before the end of the year. Consultation with key stakeholders is an on-going process that will extend beyond the planned announcement, as detailed proposals are prepared. Accordingly, all responses will be given the fullest consideration that is possible at the time they are received.</p>

  <p>The following bodies have been formally invited to submit their views:</p>

  <p>Sportscotland</p>

  <p>Scottish Institute of Sport</p>

  <p>Scottish Cycling</p>

  <p>Scottish Gymnastics</p>

  <p>Flags are sourced from a variety of manufacturers in Scotland, the UK and overseas markets. The buying decision is made on quality, price and required delivery time. The flags used with the leaflet sent to pre-schools and Student Unions were sourced from Taiwan. In 2006 there was a larger distribution of Saltire flags, as part of a pack sent to all schools in Scotland. The same supplier arrangements were in place.</p>

  <p>The total cost for sending out an A5 flyer and merchandise to pre-schools, schools and universities was &pound;10,483.48. The pre-school and school flyers were met from the Schools Directorate Communications budget. The postage for Universities was met from Lifelong Learning budget. The Saltire flags for pre-schools and universities plus the pens, bookmarks and This is Scotland book for universities were met from the International Projects Budget.</p>

  <p>Saltire flags were not sent to schools this year as they were included in the St Andrew&rsquo;s Day packs sent to schools last year. There are approximately 2,800 schools in Scotland.</p>
