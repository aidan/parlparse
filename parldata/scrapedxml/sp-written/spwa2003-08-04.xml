  <p>Reducing waiting is a priority for the Executive. This was set out in the health white paper, <em>Partnership for Care</em> . On Friday 13 June the Minister for Health and Community Care launched the Outpatient Action Plan which will help Scotland achieve the maximum wait of 26 weeks for outpatient appointments by 2005.</p>

  <p>The Executive made a commitment to modernise audiology services in response to the Public Health Institute Report, <em>NHS Audiology Services in Scotland</em>.</p>

  <p>We have asked NHS boards to develop modernisation action plans for hearing aid services, and an additional &#163;1.5 million was made available earlier this year for the purchase of new audiology equipment. Seven hundred and fifty thousand pounds was made available during 2002-03 to reduce waiting times.</p>

  <p>In 2003-04 boards will receive an average increase of 7.8% in their budget allocations. We expect boards to use some of this funding to help implement these plans. In addition the Executive is making &#163;8 million of central funding available over the next four years to support the modernisation process, and will appoint a project manager to facilitate and co-ordinate modernisation over the next two years.</p>

  <p>The educational needs of these children and young people are, and will continue to be, supported through the provision of funds which are distributed to local authorities through grant aided expenditure. It is for individual local authorities to determine how much they allocate to each service, including special educational needs, from their unhypothecated revenue grant. Revenue grant will increase on average by 8.4% in 2003-04, with further above inflation increases in the following two years.</p>

  <p>Not all the children in categories (a), (b), (d) and (e) above will necessarily have special educational needs. However, in 2003-04 the Executive is providing local authorities with additional funding, for all children with special educational needs, totalling &#163;36 million, for inclusion purposes. This figure is set to rise by a total of 35% in 2004-05, lifting our annual spend in these areas to more than &#163;50 million per year.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer given to question S2W-832 for details of local authority net expenditure on special educational needs. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="/webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a>.</p>

  <p>When the draft Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Bill is introduced to Parliament during the 2003-04 session, it will be accompanied by a financial memorandum which will detail the financial implications of the new system.</p>

  <p>Planned expansion in the trauma and orthopedic surgery training posts has been in response to service pressures including waiting times.</p>

  <p>In the past year the National Workforce Unit and the National Workforce Committee have been established as part of the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s workforce development strategy. These bodies are now working with NHSScotland to develop new approaches to the way NHSScotland plans, develops and utilises its workforce at a national, regional and local level.

  <p>I have asked Dr Jon Hargreaves, Chief Executive of Scottish Water to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Between 2002 and 2006, Scottish Water is replacing in excess of 3,000 kilometres of water mains and this work is prioritised across Scotland to ensure improvements are made in those areas most affected by problems such as frequent bursts or other factors affecting the reliability of water services to customers.</p>

  <p>Scottish Water is committed to a cost effective, robust and achievable leakage policy and is in the process of developing a more detailed understanding of the optimum levels of leakage and cost implications which will ensure investment is targeted to those areas where active leakage control is proven to achieve operational and capital efficiencies. Scottish Water is developing information about leakage by District Metered Areas (DMAs) which will support the development of area-specific leakage policies. District metered areas are being established on 60% of the water network, and this includes Glasgow, Lanarkshire, Ayrshire, Argyll and Bute, Dumfries and Galloway, Inverness, Fife and Dundee.</p>

  <p>In many of these areas, Scottish Water has already developed leakage policies. Leakage reduction projects are currently underway in Fife and Glasgow, with further projects planned in the Black Esk and Inverness. Other smaller leakage initiatives are planned as part of investment being carried out to improve drinking water quality.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no involvement in this issue which is an operational matter for Scottish Water. However, our understanding is that Scottish Water and its predecessor, West of Scotland Water, have had considerable involvement with the community while plans at Millport have been developed and Scottish Water has kept residents informed by regularly attending community council and other public meetings.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for dealing with planning applications and local planning matters rests, in the first instance, with the planning authority. I understand following consideration of the planning application that North Ayrshire Council granted consent to the development, subject to conditions on 7 July. Now that planning permission has been granted the Scottish ministers have no locus to intervene.</p>

  <p>What is clear is that investment is needed at Millport to meet urban wastewater treatment regulations. While the deadline for this is December 2005, improvements need to be in place before the 2004 bathing season starts to ensure Kames Bay meets standards set under the bathing waters directive.</p>
