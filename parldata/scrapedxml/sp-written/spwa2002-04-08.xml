  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has any (a) powers and (b) plans to give financial relief to fish farms in respect of rents charged by the Crown Estates Commissioners and what information it has received on any such charges collected in other countries for the purposes of assessing their impact on the fish farming industry in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no powers and, therefore, no plans to give financial relief to fish farms, in respect of rents charged by the Crown Estates.</p>

  <p>The fish farming industry has described the effect that the rents have on their competitiveness, in comparison with other salmon-producing countries. However, this is a matter for the Crown Estate and the industry to take account of, in their rent reviews. In the course of the development of our aquaculture strategy, we are considering the future competitiveness of the industry.</p>

  <p>Information on the total number of patients ready for discharge, by health board area of treatment and selected age group is shown in the following table. Information on the gender, and on the specific ailment and/or diagnosis of patients ready for discharge, is not held centrally. The information shown is based on the number of patients who had waited over six weeks (i.e. the common local discharge planning period) at the 15 January 2002 census, the latest date for which information is held centrally.</p>

  <p>The British Railways Order Confirmation Act 1994 and the British Railways (No.3) Order Confirmation Act 1994 conferred powers on the British Railways Board, in respect of the proposed Larkhall-Milngavie rail link. The expiry of powers to make compulsory purchase orders is now a matter for Railtrack. However, I understand that the overall parliamentary powers expire in March 2004.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is in contact with Railtrack, the Strategic Rail Authority and Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive about moving this project forward.</p>

  <p>The last review of the trunk road network was launched in October 1994, with the consultation paper <i>Local Government Reform: Shaping the Trunk Road Network</i> . This made a number of proposals geared to provide the road user with a coherent, logical and recognisable trunk road network. The review did not propose extending trunk status to the A83 Kennacraig to Campbeltown. The Executive currently has no plans to revisit this decision.</p>

SCRA&rsquo;s IT system is currently being enhanced and improvements will include the ability to hold information that tracks persistent offenders. The Scottish Criminal Record Office maintains a criminal history database which contains details of persons convicted of offences through the Scottish criminal justice system.</p>
