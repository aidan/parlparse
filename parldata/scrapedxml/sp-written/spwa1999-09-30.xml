  <p>All nursing homes in Scotland are in the private sector. The quality and type of care delivered in each home are subject to statutory registration and inspection by health boards. This process seeks to ensure that the care delivered in each home matches the needs of each resident.

  <p>The Scottish Executive recognises the importance of Scotland's maritime heritage, and the need to protect it. For example, sites of five historic wrecks lying in Scottish waters are protected by orders made by Scottish Ministers under Section 1 of the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973. Such designation orders ensure that any investigation of the shipwrecks are carried out in a respectful and responsible way.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive seeks to establish equal treatment for underwater archaeology with similar activity on land. It also aims to promote interest in, and appreciation of Scotland's underwater archaeology. In natural heritage terms there are already 19 candidate Special Areas of Conservation in Scotland, proposed under the EC Habitats and Species Directive, for a range of marine interests. The Scottish Executive is awaiting advice from its statutory nature conservation advisers on the identification of areas appropriate for classification as marine Special Protection Areas under the EC Wild Birds Directive.</p>

  <p>Changes in the structure and titles of Departments making up the Scottish Executive reflect more closely the devolution settlement, the portfolios of Scottish Ministers and the collective priorities of Scottish Ministers in <i>Partnership for Scotland.</i> These are:</p>

  <p>A new Scottish Executive Justice Department, bringing together The Scottish Office Home Department and the Scottish Courts Administration. It includes Criminal Justice Social Work while responsibility for Community Care passes to the Scottish Executive Health Department and for Children&#8217;s Services to the Scottish Executive Education Department, as part of a newly created Children and Young People Group.</p>

  <p>A Scottish Executive Rural Affairs Department replacing The Scottish Office Agriculture, Environment and Fisheries Department and more accurately reflecting the Ministerial priority given to rural development.</p>

  <p>A Scottish Executive Education Department with a firm continuing focus on Primary and Secondary Education, a new broader role through the creation of the Children and Young People Group, and expanded responsibility for Culture, including the arts, cultural and built heritage, architectural policy, sport and Gaelic.</p>

  <p>A Scottish Executive Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Department comprising the Business and Industry functions of the former Scottish Office Education and Industry Department, together with responsibility for Lifelong Learning and Further and Higher Education.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive Development Department will continue to be responsible for Social Inclusion, Housing, Local Government, Local Government Finance, Transport, Planning, Building Control, and European Structural Funds, with architecture and heritage issues passing to the Scottish Executive Education Department.</p>

  <p>The contract to provide a training programme for residential child care staff requires that the successful bidder provides or facilitates a full range of education and training for all residential child care staff, including induction, vocational and professional education and training. Children in residential child care are among the most vulnerable children who are being looked after. It is imperative that the education and training for staff to serve this group of children have the best education and training that is available. This has not hitherto been the case. In view of the complexity of the task required of the successful contractor and the need to ensure that the right decision is made it has been necessary to delay the award of the contract until October.</p>
