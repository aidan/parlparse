  <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service has national infection control policies in place, including a well defined cleaning and disinfection policy. Processes require that vehicles should have both a daily and a weekly clean and that the interior of the vehicle is wiped down after each patient. These practices are subject to regular audit and review.</p>

  <p>The service is working towards implementation of the NHS Scotland National Cleaning Services Specification and Monitoring Framework. A pilot delivering this through joint working with the local NHS Domestic Services Department in two of the largest stations (Edinburgh and Paisley) was successful. The service are in the process of rolling this model out to the other stations within the boundaries of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and NHS Lothian. Once in place, vehicle cleaning at these stations will be monitored monthly in line with the national monitoring framework developed by Health Facilities Scotland.</p>

  <p>The service is considering the most effective option to deliver the National Cleaning Standard and Monitoring Framework across the rest of Scotland.</p>

  <p>It may be that a Scottish airport could be persuaded to seek BIP status if it was satisfied that the likely volume of trade justified the cost of providing the necessary facilities. If the Scottish aquaculture industry trade organisations can build such a case I would be happy to support it.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government announced on 1 October 2008 that it considered the Bull Hire Scheme to be unsustainable in its present form and would end it by the summer of 2009, with the resources presently allocated to the Bull Hire Scheme remaining within crofting. It proposes to replace the scheme with new arrangements designed to facilitate private bull hire and to support community ownership in remote areas where the costs of transport or overwintering might otherwise prove prohibitive for crofting communities.</p>

  <p>The future of the farm land is still under consideration.</p>

  <p>There were no licences suspended in the remaining 23 local authorities.</p>

  <p>The legislation under which these licences were granted does not make provision for the revocation of a licence. However, legislation has recently been passed which does make such a provision and will come fully into force in 2009.</p>

  <p>The figures available for the amount of test purchases undertaken by Scottish police forces are for the period December 2007 to September 2008.</p>

  <p>The 2007 figures do not include test purchases which were part of the Fife Constabulary test purchasing pilot. This commenced in June 2006 and ran for one year in which 415 on-sale premises and 443 off-sale premises were tested.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Information technology (IT) is regarded as core skill to be offered to Scottish prisoners and all learning centres in Scottish prisons, including those who hold young offenders, offer a range of IT courses at different levels.</p>

  <p>No prisoner in Scotland has direct access to the internet. The Scottish Prison Service has however identified the options for developing a nationally available secure prisoner intranet as a strategic issue. This would have the potential to enhance the training and learning opportunities for Scottish prisoners using new technologies while maintaining appropriate levels of security for both prisoners and the public.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will give an assurance to whisky distilleries that offer guided tours of their distillery that the proposals in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s forthcoming alcohol strategy will not include the barring of distilleries from offering a free dram with the tour and promotion of their goods at the visitor centre.</p>

  <p>I have already given such an assurance in respect of drams provided as part of a distillery tour when I met the Scotch Whisky Association and toured Dewar&rsquo;s World of Whisky on 21 July 2008. Wider issues concerning the promotion of alcohol are being considered in light of the responses to the Scottish Government&rsquo;s consultation <em>Changing Scotland&rsquo;s Relationship with Alcohol</em> but we are clear that we do not propose ban promotions that explain the method of production, history and heritage of Scotland&rsquo;s quality products. Again, we have already given the Scotch Whisky Association an assurance that we will discuss these matters with them before proposing any regulatory action to end the irresponsible promotion of alcohol.</p>
