  <p>The provision of additional resources to assist Drug Action Teams (DATs) directly in implementing the Government&#8217;s strategy <i>Tackling Drugs in Scotland: Action in Partnership</i> , is currently under consideration. Funding for drug misuse services, is provided through the constituent agencies represented on the DATs and it is for them to decide the priority to be attached to the problem. Spending on drug treatment in Scotland over the next year has already been boosted as a result of the &pound;6 million increase in drug treatment funding for the three year period from April 1999. Additional resources allocated to Fife, Forth Valley and Tayside Health Boards in this financial year amount to &pound;102,702, &pound;64,699 and &pound;176,292 respectively.</p>

  <p>Additional resources have also been provided to Scottish local authorities in 1999-2000 for their social work services. These include services for people with drug related problems, which cannot be separately identified. Social Work spending in Scotland will increase by &pound;43 million in 2000-01 and a further &pound;36 million in 2001-2002. These resources have still to be allocated to individual Councils.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is consulting with the police, Customs, the Scottish Crime Squad, the National Criminal Intelligence Service and other relevant agencies in developing proposals for taking forward the Drugs Enforcement Agency concept. When this process has been completed over the summer we will make an announcement about the emerging plans including membership, strategy, structure, staffing, resources, links with police forces, links with other organisations, timescale for implementation, and other relevant matters. It is important that this process is carried out carefully to ensure that the arrangements which emerge build on the efforts of the existing organisations charged with fighting crime.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to identify the number of patients with Multiple Sclerosis who are currently being prescribed Betaferon. Data collected centrally relates only to prescribed items dispensed by community pharmacists and dispensing doctors. It does not specify individual patient data and information on the number of patients given specific drugs in hospitals is not available centrally.</p>

  <p>In 1995, guidance about new drugs for multiple sclerosis, and clinical advice from the Standing Medical Advisory Committee, was issued to all Health Boards. The guidance asked Health Boards, in consultation with other key interests, to develop and implement local arrangements to manage the entry of these drugs into the NHS and, in particular, to instigate and continue prescribing through hospitals.</p>

  <p>The implementation of that guidance is a matter for each Health Board.</p>

  <p>The operational responsibility for allocating houses must be transferred to new community landlords if they are genuinely to have control over their own affairs. Local authorities will, however, need to ensure that they have access to sufficient housing to enable them to meet their statutory obligations, including their duties in relation to homeless persons. The contract of sale between the authority and the acquiring landlord should clearly define the rights and responsibilities of both parties in this area. The Housing Green Paper invited views on whether there was a case for changing the legislation to introduce further safeguards for access for vulnerable groups and we are currently considering the responses.</p>
