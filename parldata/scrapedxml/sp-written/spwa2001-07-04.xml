  <p>The Scottish Executive has not published any further research on very sheltered housing since its 1991 report entitled <i>The Housing Needs of Elderly</i> <i>People in Scotland</i> and is not aware of any other research on this specific area of housing. There are no plans to commission any further reports at this time while we consider the various elements of care mosaic through the work of the Care Development Group, the Regulation of Care Bill, the consultation on the Long Term Care Bill and the implementation of <i>Supporting People</i> . All have implications about how and where care is offered to older and disabled people and will inform expectations about future needs for sheltered and very sheltered housing.</p>

  <p>The target of reducing by one third of the days lost every year through exclusions from school and truancy is set out in Milestone 10 in the Social Justice Action Plan. No timescale is specified in this target, but I expect education authorities to deliver year-on-year improvements. The recent report of the Discipline Task Group made a number of recommendations which will help to reduce exclusions and truancy. Headteachers should continue to use exclusion as a last resort, but our efforts need to concentrate on positive learning environments for young people. Targets will now be set with this in mind.</p>

  <p>Careful consideration is being given at present to the possibility of some transactions through markets being permitted this autumn.

  <p>The Executive, in conjunction with other agricultural and interested departments, is examining options for a return to export status for meat, meat products and live animals. I recognise the pressure for an early, and possibly staged, resumption of trade abroad from areas of Scotland that have been free of foot-and-mouth disease. It is likely that Europe will set very tough conditions before exports can resume.</p>

  <p>In 2000-01 the Scottish Executive achieved its target of recycling 25% of waste from the main Scottish Executive buildings. The new target is to achieve 50% recycled waste by March 2002. The table shows waste collected and recycled from the main Scottish Executive buildings.</p>

  <p>Figures for each year are not comparable because of a change in waste contractor between 1999-2000 and 2000-01. The previous contractor used to count the number of bags uplifted and did not consistently weigh the contents of the bags. The new contractor provides us with information about the weight of waste removed and recycled. We believe this to be a more appropriate way of measuring waste and recycling.</p>

  <p>Since June 2000, the only new appointment to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) central management team was that of Dr Campbell Gemmell to the post of Strategic Planning Director in April 2001. There have been two retirements during the same period, resulting in an overall reduction in the number of Directors, so that the team now comprises the Chief Executive and four Directors. The only appointment to the SEPA Board during the past 12 months was that of Mrs M. Patricia Henton, on her promotion to the position of SEPA Chief Executive in October 2000.</p>
