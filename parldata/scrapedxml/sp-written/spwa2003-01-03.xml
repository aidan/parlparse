  <p>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a complex condition that has been and continues to be the subject of a considerable body of research worldwide. While it is theorised that the condition may be linked to an imbalance of dopamine in the brain which may be due to a faulty gene or combination of genes, there is no definitive proof that these are the only causal factors. Environmental and other factors may also be involved.</p>

  <p>The Department of Health in England maintains a National Research Register with details of all on-going and recent research into a wide variety of medical conditions including ADHD. This is available on regularly updated CD-ROM in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre and online at:</p>

  <p>We have no such plans. However, in the answer given to question S1W-30915 on 25 October 2002, my colleague Mr Andy Kerr announced additional reviews which will provide further opportunities for rural areas. Organisations covered by the relocation policy will be required to identify small units of work which, following more detailed appraisal, might prove suitable for relocation to more remote areas without compromising efficiency. Circumstances of individual organisations vary and it would therefore be inappropriate to set specific targets for the number of jobs to be relocated to rural areas following these appraisals.</p>

  <p>Radioactive material has not been dumped at sea by the UK since 1982. Scottish ministers retain the position held by the UK Government at the time of devolution - that radioactive material will not be dumped at sea under any circumstances.</p>

  <p>Routine discharges of low-level radioactive waste to sea are controlled under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 within the terms of authorisations issued by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) to nuclear site operators such as British Energy. Authorisations provide stringent controls under which such discharges may be made. Releases are carefully regulated by SEPA. Should an unauthorised release occur, the site operator is required to notify SEPA as soon as possible. SEPA, as the regulator, will investigate the incident thoroughly and determine any action necessary, including potential legal action and invoking contingency plans to notify relevant bodies.</p>

  <p>SEPA carries out a comprehensive programme of monitoring of environmental radioactivity in Scotland, concentrating on the monitoring of the marine and coastal environments. SEPA publishes the results of its monitoring annually in <i>Radioactivity in Food and the Environment </i>(RIFE<i>)</i>, jointly with the Food Standards Agency. RIFE presents results of measurements of radioactivity in the environment. Copies of the reports, including the current report RIFE-7, are available from the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre, or from the SEPA website at the following address:</p>

  <p>A cross-cutting approach is employed in the Executive&#146;s delivery on Gaelic issues. Gaelic is taught as a second language in both the schools sector and the post-school sector. The Minister for Education and Young People holds policy responsibility for the former and the Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning holds policy responsibility for the latter. In connection with implementing policy on Gaelic in these sectors, ministers work with the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport, who holds policy responsibility for the support and promotion of Gaelic language and culture.</p>

  <p>The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) applies to measures affecting trade in services taken by central, regional or local governments and authorities and by non-governmental bodies in the exercise of powers delegated by such governments and authorities. Progressive liberalisation under the GATS concerns the reduction or elimination of the adverse effects on trade in services of such measures as a means of providing effective market access for foreign service suppliers. Requests for liberalisation by World Trade Organisation members do not seek the privatisation of state supplied public services. The GATS recognises the right of member governments to regulate and to introduce new regulations on the supply of services to meet national policy objectives.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are responsible for ensuring that patients residing in their area have access to clinically appropriate treatment, including new drug treatments such as the atypical antipsychotic drugs.</p>

  <p>On 25 July 2002, the Health Technology Board for Scotland (HTBS) issued a comment on the NICE Guidance on the use of atypical antipsychotics for schizophrenia. The guidance recommends that the newer (atypical) antipsychotics should be considered alongside the older, existing medicines as one of the options of first choice to treat people with newly diagnosed schizophrenia. NHSScotland is expected to take account of advice and evidence from the HTBS and ensure that recommended drugs or treatments are made available to meet clinical need.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is not aware of a formal evaluation of compliance with the particular HTBS recommendations referred to. NHS boards are responsible under clinical governance arrangements for ensuring that appropriate treatments, including drug treatments recommended by HTBS, are available where clinically appropriate for patients resident in their areas. The Health Department has made clear that, if evidence emerges that a treatment recommended by HTBS is not made available other than for clinical reasons, that will be followed up proactively with the NHS board concerned.</p>

  <p>Tuition fee support is not generally available to students to undertake a higher education course leading to a qualification at a level which they have already achieved.

  <p>Local authorities, with the agreement of Historic Scotland and on the basis of standard guidelines, set up and manage Town Schemes and make the individual awards of grant. Historic Scotland provides matching funding and makes payments to the local authority, not the individual applicant. Therefore, only information on payments made to local authorities is held centrally in a convenient form.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will make representations to Her Majesty&#146;s Government about increasing the number of inquiries undertaken by the Inland Revenue into the financial affairs of any person convicted of supplying drugs under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 and about whether such inquiries could consider obtaining an explanation from such people about whether their assets had been lawfully acquired.</p>

  <p>Under the Proceeds of Crime (Scotland) Act 1995 where a person is convicted of a drug trafficking offence (which includes supplying drugs) under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, the court can order the confiscation of all assets obtained by him over the previous six years. Where the court does not make such an order, the Inland Revenue could make an appropriate investigation. Similar provisions are contained in the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 which will be implemented over the next few months. In addition that act introduces significant new powers for the Director of the Assets Recovery Agency to tax the suspected proceeds of unlawful conduct even where a person has not been convicted of a criminal offence.</p>

  <p>SEPA&#146;s annual accounts provide figures for income and expenditure on regulation under the Radioactive Substances Act (RSA) 1993. Figures for the last three years are as follows:</p>

                  </p></td>

</table></p>

  <p>Expenditure which is not recovered through charging is funded from Grant-in-Aid (GIA) provided by the Executive. These figures cover all regulation under RSA, which includes storage and disposal of radioactive materials and waste, as well as environmental discharges.</p>

  <p>It is possible that there are some aspects of radioactive substances monitoring that are not included in the above figures if they are not related directly to regulation. These activities will be funded from GIA, but GIA is not ring-fenced for specific purposes.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) has published a Policy Statement on Enforcement. It can be found on SEPA&#146;s website at <a href="http://www.sepa.org.uk/" target="_blank">www.sepa.org.uk</a> . This states that where SEPA is aware of a breach of legislation, which it is responsible for enforcing, the agency has a number of enforcement options available to it. These include the sending of a final warning letter, the issuing of an enforcement notice or the reporting of the breach to the Procurator Fiscal recommending prosecution. Prosecution will be recommended to the Procurator Fiscal where justified in order to punish offenders, to avoid recurrence and to encourage general compliance. Where the circumstances warrant it, a case may be referred to the Procurator Fiscal without prior warning or recourse to alternative methods of enforcement.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has not carried out any specific assessment of sectarianism in schools.</p>

  <p>Tackling sectarianism is part of the promotion of equal opportunities in schools. One of the National Priorities for education focuses specifically on teaching respect for others, interdependence with other members of the neighbourhood and society, and the duties and responsibilities of citizenship.</p>

  <p>The curriculum offers a number of opportunities for pupils to be made aware of sectarianism within the subject areas of personal and social development, religious and moral education, and other social subjects within environmental studies. It is for schools and teachers to promote positive attitudes and to address inappropriate behaviour.</p>

  <p>Following a recent meeting between the First Minister and Rangers and Celtic Football Clubs, the Scottish Executive plans to commission an education pack for schools aimed at tackling sectarian attitudes among young people, in partnership with the football clubs.</p>
