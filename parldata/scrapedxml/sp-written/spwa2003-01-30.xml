<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2003-01-30.S1W-33558.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80155" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-03/wa0130.htm#1">

  <p>The Scottish Executive is today publishing the Scottish farm income figures. The estimated figures show that Total Income from Farming (TIFF) rose by 15% in 2002, to &#163;329 million. The rise in the Scottish figures reflects the recovery from foot-and-mouth disease in 2001, as well as some improvements in both livestock commodity markets and the value of the euro against sterling.</p>

  <p>Average net farm income (NFI) for all farm types is forecast to have risen by 75% between 2000-01 and 2001-02, from &#163;6,000 to &#163;10,500. This figure relates to farms not directly affected by foot-and-mouth disease culling. There is considerable variation in income trends by farm type, with dairy and Less Favoured Area livestock farms showing significant increases in NFI whilst specialist sheep and cereal farms saw a decline in their performance. Detailed estimates of the outputs, inputs and income for 2001-02 at both the aggregate level and by farm type will be published this morning and will be placed in the library of the Scottish Parliament.</p>

  <p>I welcome these forecast rises in income. However, I recognise that agricultural incomes remain well below the recent peak in the mid 1990s.</p>

  <p>One of the key priorities from the national debate is to involve parents more in their children&rsquo;s education by providing new national guidelines giving parents access and by reviewing and reforming the role of School Boards and Parent Teacher Associations.</p>

  <p>Within its devolved competence to encourage equal opportunities, the Scottish Executive is leading by example by carrying out its own equal pay review.

  <p>It is for individual insurance companies to decide applicants&rsquo; insurance premiums taking account of actuarial calculation of risks, company underwriting practice, and the commercial environment in which they operate. The Financial Services Authority regulates the insurance industry. Complaints against insurers&rsquo; decisions are dealt with by the Financial Ombudsman Service.</p>

  <p>In 1994, the Association of British Insurers issued guidance to their members recommending that they should not ask insurance applicants whether they had taken an HIV test, had counselling with such a test, or received a negative test result. Insurers should only ask if the applicant has had a positive test, is awaiting a test result, or receiving treatment for HIV/AIDS. The guidance remains in force and was reiterated in 2002 in joint guidance with the British Medical Association on medical information and insurance.</p>

  <p>The Chief Medical Officer has today published guidance on incident and outbreak management, for consultation. NHS Scotland, local authorities and other stakeholders have been invited to comment on the guidance by 30 May 2003. Their views will be taken into account when the guidance is next reviewed.</p>

  <p>The guidance will be reviewed and updated periodically, taking account of feedback from stakeholders and lessons learned from future incidents or outbreaks.</p>

  <p>The guidance was developed as a consequence of recommendations made by the Ad Hoc Group on Health and Public Water Supply, which was established following cryptosporidium-related incidents in Glasgow and Edinburgh in August last year.</p>

  <p>The UK event to commemorate Holocaust Memorial Day, which was held in the Usher Hall in Edinburgh on 27 January this year, was sponsored by a partnership between the Home Office, the City of Edinburgh Council and the Scottish Executive, and organised with the support of a broadly-based planning group.

  <p>In keeping with this year&rsquo;s theme of Children and the Holocaust, the City of Edinburgh Council organised a full programme of supporting events, designed to increase knowledge of the Holocaust and to encourage young people to engage with the issues it raises. The supporting events included:</p>

  <p>"In Your Shoes, In My Shoes" &ndash; a creative arts exhibition at the Traverse Theatre from 20 January.</p>

  <p>"Out of Europe &ndash; Children of the Holocaust" - drama performed by young people at the Traverse Theatre on 21 and 22 January.</p>

  <p>The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service has reviewed the policy for prosecutions under sections 1 and 3A of the Road Traffic Act 1988. Having regard to the range of sentences currently being imposed by courts in Scotland for such offences, the Home Office&rsquo;s proposals to increase the maximum penalty from 10 years to 14 years imprisonment, and the public concern about such cases, I have decided that there should now be a presumption that offences under sections 1 and 3A of the Road Traffic Act 1988 will be prosecuted in the High Court of Justiciary. Prosecutions in the sheriff court will take place only where there are particular circumstances which appear to mitigate the offence.</p>

  <p>This policy, which applies to all new indictments taken from 13 January, will be kept under review, and, in particular, will be reconsidered in the light of any increase in the sentencing power of the sheriff court arising out of the review into the High Court by Lord Bonomy.</p>

  <p>Library services are a matter for individual local authorities. The COSLA Public Library Standards have been in place since 1995 and these include recommendations on extending library opening hours, provision for the needs of disabled users and access to services by the residents of care homes and sheltered housing. Local authorities are responsible for setting library opening hours, within their budgets. Local authorities must comply with current legislation on access, ensuring that buildings are physically accessible to users.</p>

  <p>The People's Network Project, which has included a massive investment in libraries to connect them to the internet, specifically &#163;50 million for the development of content, &#163;2.7 million for staff ICT training and &#163;11.5 million for computer hardware, software and internet connection, will also extend access to e-Learning, cultural content and information.</p>

  <p>The People's Network will make specialist equipment and software available in certain libraries across the country. Two local pilots (North Lanarkshire Sheltered Housing Project and North Ayrshire Jump Leads Project) are also offering computer access to those unable to visit the library. The Scottish Library and Information Council also aims to develop a best practice framework for libraries to offer those with disabilities access to the internet.</p>

  <p>Last April, I announced consultation on the proposed action programme measures for farmers in nitrate vulnerable zones. During the consultation period stakeholders raised concerns about the cost of the proposed action programme measures. I have listened to these concerns and have today introduced programmes which aim to produce the required nitrate savings at a significantly reduced cost for the farming community. We are taking this forward in partnership with farmers, and regulations providing for a 40% grant scheme to assist them with slurry storage requirements have also been introduced today.</p>

  <p>Guidance will shortly be issued to all farmers in nitrate vulnerable zones, providing advice on implementation of the action programme measures. These have been designed in consultation with National Farmers' Union Scotland and other stakeholders, and incorporate changes arising from the concerns raised by them during the consultation period.</p>

  <p>Proposals to re-open a particular station are a local transport matter and as such are the responsibility of the relevant local transport authority or transport partnership to take forward.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is always keen to engage with local authorities and others who wish to develop major rail infrastructure projects. Funding is in principle available from the Executive's Integrated Transport Fund for such projects if a robust business case can be made. We would in particular wish to see that such proposals are founded in well-prepared and widely accepted local or regional transport strategies that clearly contribute to the Executive's vision of a modern, safe, reliable and integrated transport system and lever in private investment.</p>

  <p>The investment programme presently being implemented by Scottish Water for the period 2002 to 2006 is that identified following the Quality and Standards 2 assessment. That process involved both consultation with industry stakeholders including the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA), the Water Services Unit (Drinking Water Regulation Team) of the Scottish Executive, the Water Industry Commissioner (WIC) and public consultation.</p>

  <p>Full details are available in <i>Water Quality and Standards 2002-2006</i> as approved by Scottish ministers. This document was lodged with the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre on publication &ndash; (Bib. number 15676).</p>

  <p>In addition, as owner, the Scottish Executive has on-going discussions with Scottish Water regarding quality and standards, including the maintenance of the public water supply.</p>

  <p>I announced a 12-point Action Plan for the social services workforce on 18 April last year. This is being delivered in full. The current recruitment and awareness campaign has had a significant impact. It is clear from responses that many people aspire to a career in the sector, including services for children and families.</p>

  <p>On the 27th of January 2003 I announced a package to achieve more qualified social workers quickly. This includes:</p>

  <p>A scheme which offers the possibilities of reimbursement of undergraduate social work student loans up to &#163;9,000 per student;</p>

  <p>an invitation to COSLA to set up a pilot fast track graduate trainee scheme;</p>

  <p>around &#163;2 million over this financial year and the next to improve and increase practice placements;</p>

  <p>increased funding for universities for practice placements costs of &#163;1,500 per undergraduate student per degree;</p>

  <p>an additional &#163;500,000 over the next two years for e-learning projects;</p>

  <p>a Return to Practice programme to enable those who qualified in the past and have left the profession to return to the workforce, and</p>

  <p>an additional &#163;92,000 to the voluntary sector to increase the numbers of staff undertaking qualifying training programmes.</p>
