  <p>We are not aware of research of this nature currently being carried out in Scotland. However, the CJD Surveillance Unit, based in the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, has confirmed that although they carry out a number of tests on blood and tissue samples taken from CJD victims, they do not routinely test for the disorders mentioned in the question. Therefore we have no evidence to date to establish a link.</p>

  <p>Patient registration figures at 31 May 2000 indicate that there has been an overall decrease of 1.7% in the number of children registered on the NHS with a general dental practitioner compared to the position in May 1999. The percentage of young children who are being registered with a general dental practitioner has risen by the same percentage over this period. Children do not register for treatment with a community dentist.</p>

  <p>A number of measures are currently in operation. Scottish Ministers are continuing to approve salaried dentist posts for areas where patients are experiencing difficulty in obtaining treatment on the NHS. Enhanced monthly capitation fees are paid to dentists who register young children from deprived areas on the NHS. The Scottish Dental Access Initiative offers grants to dentists establishing or expanding NHS practices in areas of unmet patient demand or high oral health need.</p>

  <p>The primary function of Fisheries Research Services (FRS) is to provide information and scientific advice to the Scottish Executive in support of the latter&#8217;s national and international responsibilities for fisheries. Approximately 75% of the funding paid to FRS is used in direct support of these responsibilities, the remainder being spent on underpinning research.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s funding for FRS is currently not available for tendering to other laboratories and there are no plans at present to change these arrangements. Other laboratories will, however, continue to be considered for ad hoc research programmes.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no plans to require information which is additional to the existing statutory requirements to be provided on food labels.</p>

  <p>European legislation prohibits member states insisting on country of origin labelling on products produced within the European Union. However, recent guidance to local authorities has made it clear that labelling a product &quot;British&quot; when the main raw material is imported could be interpreted as misleading.</p>

  <p>Packaged food products must contain a &quot;lot&quot; mark which enables them to be traced to their factory and production batch. Eggs must contain details of their packing station and may only be marketed as &quot;free range&quot; or &quot;barn or perchery&quot; where certain specified criteria are met. All food production methods must conform to existing animal welfare regulations.</p>

  <p>Rises in confirmed notifications of meningococcal infection over the winter of 1999-2000 were associated with the unusually large outbreak of influenza, a well-recognised association. On 14 January the Executive issued a press release, SE0059/2000, confirming this and urging vigilance to identify early signs of meningococcal infection and urging parents to bring their children forward when invited to receive vaccination against meningococcal group C infection.</p>

  <p>The Executive is meeting the costs of the meningococcal C immunisation programme which began in November last year, and which is aimed at reducing numbers of cases of group C meningococcal infection. The cost of the programme is &pound;31 million over the three years to 2001-02.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health (SCIEH) has recently implemented an enhanced surveillance programme, in liaison with the Scottish Meningococcal and Pneumococcal Reference Laboratory (Stobhill), to study in detail the effects of the vaccination programme and to allow targeting of other interventions as appropriate or which may be available in the future.</p>

  <p>Reported levels of infection have now declined to low levels in accordance with what would normally be expected at this time of year.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. During 1998 there were at least 20 weekdays for which information was unavailable. Any warrant information entered on these days could be lost. This means that receptions of prisoners serving only a day or two, such as fine defaulters, may not be counted. Because of this, the currently published figure of 8,400 fine default receptions may be under-estimated by a factor of up to 10%. Revised figures will be published on 30 August 2000 in the forthcoming News Release &quot;Provisional Prison Statistics, Scotland, 1999&quot;.</p>
