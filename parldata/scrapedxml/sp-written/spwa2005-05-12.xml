  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The total expenditure on the warm deal programme from April 1999 to March 2004 was &pound;52.228 million, inclusive of the managing agent fees for warm deal in the private sector, and expenditure on the 1999 Home Energy Efficiency Scheme and New Energy Efficiency Deal for Scotland (NEEDS) schemes that were a precursor to the warm deal programme. The table below shows the number of properties benefiting from warm deal grants from April 1999 to March 2004. As the figures for 2004-05 are not yet complete they have not been included.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive will not produce or publish a separate national reform programme relating to the revised Lisbon strategy.</p>

  <p>The UK position on economic reform is consistent with that of the Executive. The refocus of the Lisbon Strategy towards growth and employment aligns policy priorities in the EU with those that currently exist in the UK and in Scotland. The Executive&rsquo;s priorities are outlined in the <em>Framework for Economic Development </em>in <em>Scotland </em>and<em> A Smart, Successful Scotland</em>.</p>

  <p>The Executive consults regularly with key stakeholders through various forums, ensuring that all views are represented. Many of the reforms necessary to meet the Lisbon objectives have already been through a consultation process in Scotland and the UK as part of their implementation. Any new commitments will follow a similar process in accordance with normal government practice.</p>

  <p>No consideration has been given to nominating a Scottish city to date. Discussions regarding the financing of the European Institute for Gender Equality are still on-going and this is affecting all future plans to set up the institute. When these are resolved and location considered, nominations for the institute&rsquo;s headquarters may be sought from member states. This process is reserved and ultimately a matter for the UK Government. Scottish ministers will liaise with UK counterparts about any potential Scottish locations.</p>

Collection of this type of information was not previously considered necessary for the purposes of monitoring the annual deficit grant funding to Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd. The company&rsquo;s accounts are audited on an annual basis and the company&rsquo;s auditors have indicated that they are satisfied that it has in place measures to ensure that the passenger only deficit funding is applied appropriately.</p>

  <p>Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd carried out an analysis of the costs of providing peak sailings on the Gourock-Dunoon route in the mid-1980s, indicating that these additional out of undertaking sailings could be provided on a commercial basis. In 1986, the Scottish Transport Group, which the company then operated under, approved the introduction of the additional sailings. The peak sailings were absorbed into the undertaking in 2003 in order to remove any ambiguity about whether these sailings should be included in the final tender specification for this route.</p>

  <p>The disposal of the MV Pioneer by Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd was carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Scottish Public Finance Manual, which states that &quot;holdings of assets should be kept under constant review with a view to disposing of surplus assets as quickly as possible&quot; and &quot;the best possible price should be obtained for surplus assets. Assets should therefore normally be sold on the open market.&quot;</p>

  <p>It is important to note that these instructions do not require that in all cases assets must be sold on the open market.</p>

  <p>In this case, I understand that Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd obtained an independent valuation of the vessel last year and placed it in the hands of ship brokers for disposal. Following four expressions of interest and a firm offer to purchase the vessel, the CalMac Board took the collective decision to accept that offer, which was 22.2% in excess of the independent valuation that had been obtained. The board also took into account savings in lay up costs from an early disposal.</p>

  <p>The vessel was not sold on the open market, but was disposed of privately at a price some 22.2% higher than a current independent valuation and that minimised lay up and other costs. The company acted reasonably in its disposal of this surplus asset and secured an acceptable price in accordance with Scottish Public Finance Manual best practice.</p>

  <p>In 2004 Scotland issued 14 European Arrest Warrants (EAW) so far in 2005 two European Arrest Warrants have been issued.</p>

  <p>Of those issued in 2004, eight have been executed and two were withdrawn by Crown Office before they were executed, as the fugitives returned voluntarily to Scotland. Four remain outstanding.</p>

  <p>Seven European Arrest Warrants were issued to Spain. Two of these were in respect of the fugitives who returned voluntarily to Scotland. The remaining five were in relation to offences of assault to severe injury and permanent disfigurement, attempt to defeat the ends of justice, a contravention of Section 27(7) Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995, embezzlement, a contravention of Sex Offenders Act 1997 Section 2(6E)(A), theft, a contravention of the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Act 1993 Section 17(5). All of these warrants were executed in Spain, and the fugitives returned to Scotland.</p>

  <p>Scots Criminal Law is largely based on the common law. As a result there is a wide variety of offences and aggravations available to meet a very large number of circumstances. It is not possible to compile an exhaustive list of the offences in Scots Law and it would not be practical or helpful to do so. Where consideration is given to the issuing of a European Arrest Warrant, in all cases the list of offences in Article 2.2 of the Council Framework Decision would be examined to see whether the offence involved would be covered by one of the offences on that list.</p>

  <p>The civil service nationality rules are a reserved matter.

  <p>Our standard Design and Build contract conditions, which are proposed for the construction of the M74 completion scheme, place most of the risk for delays due to unforeseen circumstances on the contractor, since he is best placed to manage the consequence of reprogramming the works.</p>

  <p>The contract documents for the M74 completion scheme are not yet finalised and we will take a view on all relevant risks throughout their development. A copy of the draft M74 contract conditions will be placed in the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre once these have been issued to tenderers.</p>

  <p>We will proceed to tender once the statutory procedures are secure and will consider with tenderers the appropriate sharing of risk in relation to all potential issues.</p>

  <p>Through the Scottish Social Services Council we have introduced a number of actions that support the continuing professional development of social workers. This includes registration for all social workers from April 2003 and the requirement to undertake at least 15 days post registration training and learning over three years. The council is consulting on proposed additional post registration training and learning requirements for newly qualified social workers to ensure that they are properly supported to consolidate their knowledge and skills in practice.</p>

  <p>We fully endorse the <em>Continuing Professional Development Strategy</em> agreed by the council on 14 September 2004 and which sets out new arrangements for the continuing professional development for all social service workers, including social workers.</p>

  <p>Decisions have still to be made on whether a bid should be mounted for Glasgow to host the Commonwealth Games in 2014. It is therefore too early to solicit the support of the other devolved administrations. However, the other devolved administrations and the UK Government are aware of the feasibility work being undertaken to consider whether a bid should be made through the regular meetings that take place at ministerial and official level on sport and major event issues.</p>

  <p>France is very important to Scotland, not least as a major tourism market. As part of the centenary of the Entente Cordiale in 2004, the Executive delivered a very successful programme of cultural events linking Scotland and France. In order to build further on the many cultural and other achievements of last year&rsquo;s programme, we are talking to the French Government, and we expect to make an announcement in the near future.</p>
