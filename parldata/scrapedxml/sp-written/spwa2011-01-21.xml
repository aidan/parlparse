  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive to what extent abstinence-based alternative treatments to methadone are available to NHS patients, in light of evidence of the impact of methadone on the brain revealed by the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2011-01-21.S3W-38516.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80306" speakername="Fergus Ewing" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-11/wa0121.htm#4">

  <p>Information on the availability of specific abstinence-based treatments to NHS patients is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>However, the National Drug Treatment Waiting Times Framework collects information on the number of offers of different types of treatment made to clients on a quarterly basis. This framework provides some detail on the range of services which are available:</p>

  <p>For the first three quarters of 2010 (1 January to 30 September) there were:</p>

  <p>5,811 offers of appointment for structured preparatory intervention;</p>

  <p>5,145 offers of appointment for community rehabilitation;</p>

  <p>3,305 offers of appointment for prescribed drug treatment, and</p>

  <p>496 offers of appointment for residential rehabilitation made across Scotland.</p>

  <p>These figures indicate that prescribed drug treatments (including methadone) are by no means the only, or most common, type of treatment offered to clients.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that not all those offered an appointment may enter treatment and once they are being treated within a service, they may receive different interventions later that are not recorded in the waiting times system.</p>

  <p>Further information can be accessed via the Waiting Times Framework at the following link:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.drugmisuse.isdscotland.org/wtpilot/reports.htm" target="_blank">http://www.drugmisuse.isdscotland.org/wtpilot/reports.htm</a>.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises it is important that a range of drug treatment and support services, including abstinence based programmes, are available locally to support people with drug problems towards recovery and a drug-free life. Supporting people towards recovery is the underpinning principle of the national drugs strategy, The Road to Recovery.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not promote one form of treatment over another. Decisions about the most appropriate type of treatment to prescribe in each case are for clinicians and practitioners, in discussion with their clients and in line with national prescribing guidelines and the British National Formulary, which is used by clinicians to support prescription of medication and the management of a patient&rsquo;s condition. It is important that individuals are offered the type of treatment which best suits their needs and circumstances, based on a person-centred treatment and support plan.</p>

  <p>To support the delivery of recovery-focused treatment and support services, this government has made record investment in frontline drug treatment services. This investment, allocated to NHS boards, totalled &pound;81 million between 2008-09 and 2010-11. Funding for frontline drugs services in 2011-12 has been protected and will be maintained at 2010-11 levels (&pound;28.6 million), subject to parliamentary approval. It is for local partners to use this funding to support the development and delivery of recovery-focused treatment services in their area, based on an assessment of local needs and priorities.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how it will ensure that the frontline service provided by the Fife Fire and Rescue Service will be maintained despite the recruitment freeze, reduced numbers of operational firefighters and continued budget pressures on the local authority.</p>

  <p>In our statement on 12 January 2011, we set out the Scottish Government&rsquo;s ambitions for improving the performance, local accountability and financial sustainability of Scotland&rsquo;s fire and rescue services.</p>

  <p>I understand that Fife Fire and Rescue Service is now facing cuts in its funding which may have an impact on frontline delivery this year.</p>

  <p>Operational decisions are a matter for individual fire authorities. However, this situation clearly demonstrates why the Scottish Government is about to consult on options for structural reform of the Fire and Rescue Services. Only by doing so will we ensure that the frontline services that are of importance to the public in Fife, and throughout Scotland, are protected.</p>

  <p>New national guidance for child protection published in December last year contains advice to all agencies including NHS boards, for dealing with situations where parents or carers fail to engage with services.

  <p>A public consultation seeking views on the recommendations contained in the review group&rsquo;s report was carried out by the Scottish Government over August/November 2009. A Scottish Government report on summary of responses was published in March 2010.</p>

  <p>The formal Scottish Government response to the <em>McManus Review Report</em> was published on 1 October 2010. That response indicates how ministers would intend to take forward the issues relating to advance statements, advocacy, named persons, medical matters and tribunals (all of which were covered in the review group&rsquo;s review of the legislation).</p>

  <p>The full Response by the Scottish Government to each of the original recommendations by the review group may be found on the Scottish Government Mental Health Division law website pages:</p>

  <p>As indicated in the response, primary legislation would be required to take forward some of the agreed recommendations, others will require secondary legislation, whilst certain other recommendations would be taken forward by means of policy initiatives (such as guidance). It is intended that any amendments to the 2003 Act will be taken forward as part of a future legislative programme.</p>

  <p>The recent severe winter weather resulted in the rail industry in Scotland adopting Network Rail&rsquo;s Key Route strategy. This was introduced to ensure core passenger and critical freight routes on the rail network remained open with agreed amendments to the timetable and frequency. Regrettably, this did mean that in prioritising some routes the rail industry was unable to offer other routes.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally. Health and Safety Regulations, including The Control of Asbestos Regulations 2006, require duty holders who are responsible for the maintenance and repair of buildings in their control to manage the risks arising from asbestos.

  <p>In 2006-07 and 2007-08, funding to support area data sharing partnerships was provided as part of the ring-fenced Efficient Government Fund. From 2008-09, a small residual sum for area data sharing partnerships to fund the post of a data sharing manager, continued to be paid out as specific allocation.</p>

  <p>This change in the funding arrangements for 2008-09 was part of the package of measures that accompanied the concordat and the greater financial freedoms resulting from the new partnership between the Scottish Government and local government.</p>

  <p>No dedicated funding was provided to data sharing partnerships in 2009-10 and 2010-11 and none will be provided in 2011-12</p>

  <p>Mr Neil&rsquo;s comments were made in his capacity as an MSP and were referring to the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman&rsquo;s (SPSO) performance of two years ago.</p>

  <p>Complaints and concerns about the SPSO have already been considered in some detail and key recommendations for improvement have already been enacted:</p>

  <p>By government, in measures introduced in the Public Services Reform Act 2010</p>

  <p>By the Parliament, in measures introduced in the Scottish Parliamentary Commissions and Commissioners Act 2010<strong>.</strong></p>

  <p>Changes will build on an already improving SPSO performance. In 2009-10, there were 22% more complaints resolved than 2008-09. Over the same period the open caseload reduced by 52%. In 2009-10, there were 123 published investigation reports with over 400 recommendations about more than 300 separate issues in 50 different public sector bodies.</p>
