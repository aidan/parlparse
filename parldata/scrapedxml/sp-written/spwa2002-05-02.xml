  <p>There has been a marginal increase in the average length of time the emergency service has been taking to respond to 999 emergency calls. But in the Angus area, the service is still exceeding the national target that is designed to provide for 50% of emergency calls receiving a response within eight minutes. The service is currently achieving 52.3% in Angus. This may be seen against the background of a 28% increase in the numbers of patients seen.</p>

  <p>An additional seven front line emergency ambulance staff are now operational in the Angus area and there are another two vacancies waiting to be filled. All the ambulance stations in the area are now operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week. A paramedic-led thrombolytic service has been introduced to reduce the "pain to needle" time for cardiac patients who require thrombolysis. There are also plans to introduce some dedicated "GPs' urgent" resources in the near future.</p>

  <p>There has been an improvement in the performance in response to GPs' urgent calls. These calls mostly concern the admission of patients to hospital following a doctor's home visit. Here the service aim to transfer 95% of such requests to hospital within 15 minutes of the time agreed with the doctor, which might typically be two or three hours from the time the request is made. In Angus the service is currently transferring 90.7% of such cases to hospital within 15 minutes - an improvement of 2% on the previous reporting period.</p>

  <p>There are a range of complex issues surrounding the ability of fire brigades to fight fires at sea and these have been examined by HM Fire Service Inspectorate.

  <p>Very substantial progress has been made towards achieving the target of ending mixed sex hospital wards. At present, of the 1,629 wards in Scotland, 1,559 are fully compliant. This represents 96% compliance and 4% non-compliance. Of the 70 non-compliant wards, 22 will be fully compliant by May 2002, bringing the total to 97%. We shall ensure that the rest are compliant in the shortest possible time. In the meantime, trusts have also been required to agree with their local health council a local policy to ensure that the dignity and privacy of patients is respected at all times in non-compliant wards.</p>

  <p>Fires at sea are a maritime safety issue, which is reserved. Commercially operating vessels are required to report accidents to the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) if they are UK registered or carrying passengers to or from a UK port. The statistical information shown in the following table has been obtained from the MAIB and relates to a category of accident entitled "Fires/Explosions". The MAIB records indicate that there were no reports of assistance from coastal fire brigades in Scotland for any of the incidents recorded in the table. Information about recreational vessels e.g. yachts is being obtained from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and I will write to the member and place a copy in the Parliament's Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>As we made clear in our response to the final report of the Bristol Inquiry, patient safety and the quality of clinical care are paramount within NHSScotland.</p>

  <p>To achieve that general aim, a variety of safeguards are in place. In relation to medicines, it is the responsibility of the Medicines Control Agency to ensure that all medicines on the UK market meet appropriate standards of safety, quality and efficacy. Clinical trials may also be used to assess the effectiveness of new treatments or technologies, such as new ways of carrying out operative procedures or new radiotherapy regimens. Prior to the start of NHS clinical trials, they should be appraised by the appropriate NHS research ethics committee.</p>

  <p>In relation to new interventional procedures, such as surgery and interventional cardiological and radiological examinations and treatments, the former Safety and Efficacy Register for New Interventional Procedures was taken over by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence with effect from 1 April this year. This is a UK initiative which will continue to apply to the introduction of new interventional procedures in NHSScotland.</p>

  <p>Highly specialised services are introduced only when the Executive has been assured by the National Services Advisory Group that this can be done without compromising patient safety.</p>

  <p>The safety and effectiveness of medical devices is the responsibility of the Medical Devices Agency, which operates on a UK basis.</p>

  <p>As was made clear in my reply to the question S1W-23296, decisions regarding staffing levels for primary care nurses and the need for any specialist posts in the field of coronary heart disease are the responsibility for NHS boards. Information on the need for posts and how this is addressed is not held centrally. There is no specific guidance on appropriate staffing levels in relation to the provision of service in this area.</p>

  <p>Social inclusion policy should be an important aspect of the consideration which local authorities give to the education service they provide. Social inclusion issues are relevant to all schools. Local authorities should therefore have regard to these issues in considering the specification of their requirements in any school Public/Private Partnership proposal. The responsibility for the provision of education in a school lies with the education authorities - whether or not the school is included in a Public/Private Partnership. For these reasons, no specific guidelines are issued by the Scottish Executive in relation to assessing the impact on social exclusion policy of proposed Public/Private Partnerships.</p>

  <p>The following works are being progressed on the A84/A85:</p>

  <p>The Traffic Regulation Order promoting a 30 mph speed limit on the A85 through Lochearnhead will be published shortly and providing there are no objections the new speed limit should come into force in early September 2002. The village gateway signing and countdown markers will be erected at the same time as the new speed limit.</p>

  <p>The Lochearnhead footway has been designed. Construction will commence once the necessary land has been acquired.</p>

  <p>Improvements to the A84/A85 junction at Lochearnhead are programmed for completion by October 2002.</p>

  <p>A scheme for the provision of street lighting at Lochearnhead has been prepared and will be implemented, subject to competing priorities and the availability of funding. Improvements to the street lighting in Callander are also being considered.</p>

  <p>Three minor improvement schemes in Glen Ogle are being prepared and will be implemented subject to competing priorities and the availability of funding.</p>

  <p>Verge safety fences are being upgraded both on the A84 and A85.</p>

  <p>Alterations to the pelican crossing in Callander are expected to be completed by the end of May 2002.</p>

  <p>Operation of the traffic lights in Callander is being monitored closely so the phasing of the lights can be adjusted to provide optimum performance.</p>

  <p>Carriageway warning signs will be erected at Glen Ogle by the end of May 2002.</p>

  <p>Strathyre village gateway signs are programmed to be completed before the start of the tourist season.</p>

  <p>Advice from the European Commission indicates that a single application covering multiple schemes on the same TENs corridor would be possible in principle, although in practice it may be less likely to attract support due to it's greater complexity and potential for delay. In addition, the constraints on resources estimated to be available in the next TENs funding round, and the Commission's stated preference for non-road based projects limits the likelihood of any such bid being successful.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-24177 by Ms Margaret Curran on 2 April 2002, how it ensures that social inclusion partnership (SIP) boards make funding allocation decisions in the public interest and what sanctions are available for use against board members who fail to make such decisions in the public interest.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-05-02.S1W-24747.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80144" speakername="Ms Margaret Curran" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0502.htm#29a">

  <p>As stated in the response to S1W-24177, SIP boards are responsible for making funding allocation decisions, and for ensuring that these decisions are made in the public interest and not in the interests of any one individual. Communities Scotland has a monitoring role in relation to SIPs through the annual reporting and appraisal mechanisms. In the course of these annual appraisals, any matters of concern to Communities Scotland, whether they relate to funding or any other aspect of SIP activity, are raised with SIP boards.</p>

  <p>Beyond that, various responsibilities are placed on the local authority as grant recipient in relation to SIP funding decisions. General guidance issued to local authorities as grant recipients under the new terms and conditions for SIP fund grant applicable from April 2002 state that:</p>

  <p>Activity receiving SIP funding must be free of any political bias and must not involve political campaigning;</p>

  <p>It is important that all decisions about the use of SIP grant are made in the public interest and not in the interests of any one individual or group of individuals, and</p>

  <p>Grant recipients should ensure that all members of partnerships and their sub groups declare any relevant personal interests they have and that these interests are recorded in a central register. The grant recipient should keep a central register of these interests, which must be made available for inspection by Communities Scotland, grant recipients and members of the public on request.</p>

  <p>On sanctions, in general terms Communities Scotland may reduce, suspend or withhold payment of grant, or require all or part of the grant to be repaid if it appears that an activity, or any part of it, has not been undertaken in accordance with these terms and conditions or for the purposes intended or with any other conditions Communities Scotland impose at the time the grant offer is made.</p>

  <p>At SIP level, however, it would be for the SIP board to implement their own sanctions against board members should they feel that these members were not making decisions in the public interest.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive continue to work very closely with local authorities to meet the guarantee of a one-year training contract for all eligible probationary teachers. Considerable progress has been made.</p>

  <p>Sufficient funding is being made available to meet this guarantee. This, along with other steps being taken will minimise the impact on teachers currently on temporary contracts.</p>

  <p>Voluntary organisations will face the same 1% increase in employer National Insurance contributions as all other employers. But they will benefit from a range of budget measures, including the introduction of tax relief for gifts to charity of land or buildings, VAT relief for charity buildings including residential care homes, and changes to the rules for Gift Aid.</p>

  <p>The Executive recognises that young people run away from home for a number of reasons, and it is important that agencies such as the police and social work, work together to assist young runaways. We are helping to fund Aberlour's pilot project, Running Other Choices, which aims to find effective ways of helping to prevent young people from running away. We have also set up a working group to develop national inter-agency guidance on prevention and support for runaways.</p>
