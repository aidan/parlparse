  <p>Good progress is being made in delivering the <em>Plan for Action on alcohol problems</em> . Key Executive action to date includes additional funding for local Alcohol Action Teams, development of a national alcohol information resource, publication of an alcohol problems support and treatment services framework and appointment of national alcohol liaison officer to support the work of local teams. We are currently analysing local alcohol action plans and reviewing the national alcohol communications strategy to ensure that it covers all key target groups. A full review of progress in delivering the plan will be carried out by the end of 2003.</p>

  <p>The Agriculture Council reached agreement on reform of the CAP early this morning (26 June). The deal is a very good one for Scotland. It is a major step towards making Scottish agriculture more responsive to the market place and sees an end to bureaucratic regimes. We have achieved the flexibility required to tailor support in the best interests of our farming sector, secured transitional arrangements under modulation and improved the position for our dairy and cereals sector.</p>

  <p>We will work with stakeholders to implement these radical reforms in order to achieve the best outcome for Scotland.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the outcome was of the Common Agricultural Policy reform negotiation at the Agriculture Council on 25 and 26 June 2003.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2003-06-26.7.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80032" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-03/wa0626.htm#5">

  <p>The Agriculture Council reached agreement on a CAP reform package at around 7.00am on 26 June after an all-night sitting. This was the culmination of detailed final discussions and negotiations over the last three weeks.</p>

  <p>The deal is a very good one for Scotland. The central element of it is breaking the link between subsidies and production (known as decoupling), which allows producers to respond to market signals and consumer requirements and sees an end to bureaucratic regimes.</p>

  <p>We have pressed the case throughout these difficult and protracted negotiations for the necessary degree of flexibility to enable Scotland to manage the reform process. This deal provides that flexibility both on the decoupled elements of the package and in the use of targeted support to assist transition to the new arrangements.</p>

  <p>The provision to transfer funds to support rural development has been much improved from the Commission's original proposals. Scotland will now be able to retain at least 80 per cent of the funds taken from subsidising production to support rural development.</p>

  <p>Tying support to promoting best practice on our farms will help in our drive to raise standards across the industry.</p>

  <p>Decisions on proposals to reduce subsidies further (known as degression) have been deferred. A new financial discipline will trigger action to reduce subsidies if CAP expenditure is in danger of exceeding the agreed ceilings.</p>

  <p>This deal represents a significant improvement on earlier proposals. In the face of January&#146;s damaging proposals for Scotland&#146;s dairy industry, we have achieved a lower reduction in milk prices and an increase in compensation for farmers. We have maintained the cereals price against a proposal for a 5 per cent cut. There will, however, be a reduction of 50 per cent in the monthly increments. This compares with an initial suggestion to remove increments altogether.</p>

  <p>We have substantially achieved our objectives. We have the option of decoupling for our livestock industry, achieved the flexibility required to tailor support in the best interests of Scotland farming, secured transitional arrangements under modulation and improved the position for our dairy and cereals sectors. Overall, the reforms will contribute to improving the sustainability of our farming sector and help us meet the commitments in <em>A Forward Strategy for Scottish Agriculture</em>.</p>

  <p>We will work with all interests to implement these radical reforms in order to achieve the best outcome for Scotland.</p>

  <p>Patient information is recognised in the Scottish Diabetes Framework as an essential part of diabetes care. The objective is for all people with diabetes and their carers to have access to information which is relevant, consistent and appropriate to their needs. High-quality patient information does exist, although it is recognised that at present it is not universally available. Action plans covering both patient information and patient education are currently being developed by the Patient Focus Implementation Group, a sub-group of the Scottish Diabetes Group (the national group responsible for monitoring and implementing the Scottish Diabetes Framework).</p>

  <p>The Scottish ministers transmitted to the United States the application for the child&#146;s return to Scotland; supplied the necessary factual information and documentary evidence to support it; provided relevant information about Scots law in connection with the question whether Ms Fawcett had &quot;rights of custody&quot; under the Hague Convention, and liased with the US Central Authority, Ms Fawcett&#146;s Attorney and her Scottish solicitors concerning progress with the case. The Scottish ministers have performed all the functions of a requesting Central Authority under the convention, and will continue to do so in connection with any future proceedings in the USA.</p>

  <p>Provision of legal aid in foreign court proceedings does not form part of the obligations of a requesting Central Authority under the convention. The US authorities have a responsibility to ensure that left-behind parents are properly represented there, as Ms Fawcett has been so far.</p>

  <p>The Integration of Scottish Criminal Justice Information Systems programme commenced in 1992 and supports the development of IT links between existing computer systems in the various Scottish criminal justice organisations by developing agreed data standards. The principal exchanges take place between the police, the procurator fiscal and the sheriff courts and links between these were introduced area by area in Scotland, beginning in 1999 and concluding in 2002 in Strathclyde.</p>

  <p>Implementation of the links affected the conduct of business in all areas but the only substantial difficulties arose in Strathclyde Police, in the preparation of reports for submission to the procurator fiscal. The Crown Office drew the existence of a backlog to the Justice Department&#146;s attention in September and inquiries were made of the force at that time. They confirmed that there was a backlog of reports and that they, in consultation with procurators fiscal, were introducing procedures aimed at improving the quality and timeliness of reports. As background, they explained that the volume of reports had increased in 2002 as a result of higher detection rates and that this had added to existing difficulties in transcribing reports for transmission to the procurator fiscal and other IT problems experienced at that time. The force have advised that the proportion of reports submitted within eight weeks of charge in May was 45% compared to 29% in November 2002 and that work is continuing to further improve this.</p>

  <p>The process of police reporting and in particular delays in reporting will be covered by an HMIC thematic report into crime management due to be published later this year.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is in close discussion with Whitehall colleagues about the potential designation of the Darwin Mounds as a special area of conservation under the EC Habitats Directive.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers and the UK Government as a whole are committed to ensuring the conservation obligations contained in the EC Habitats Directive are met, and to protecting those internationally important species and habitats that occur within UK jurisdiction.</p>

  <p>The UK Government has been drafting legislation that will provide the legal mechanism to designate and protect important conservation areas outwith the territorial sea under the Wild Birds and Habitats Directives. The Scottish Executive has been closely involved in the development of this proposed legislation, in relation to which the UK Government will shortly issue a consultation document.</p>

  <p>The <em>Supplement to the Thirty-Second Report 200</em> 3 of the Review Body on Doctors and Dentists (DDRB) pay was published on 25 June.</p>

  <p>This supplementary report covers general dental practitioners (GDPs), those in the salaried primary dental care services, General Medical Practitioner (GMP) Registrars and salaried GMPs employed by a primary care organisation. The DDRB will report later on General Medical Services. The main part of their report, which covers career grade hospital doctors and dentists, doctors and dentists in training and ophthalmic medical practitioners, was published on 19 May and the recommendations for pay for 2003-04 for these groups were accepted in full and without staging.</p>

  <p>I am grateful to the chairman and members of the review body for their hard work in dealing with their remit groups.</p>

  <p>The review body has recommended an increase to the out-of-hours supplement payable to GMP Registrars. It has also recommended for the first time a pay range for salaried GMPs employed by primary care organisations.</p>

  <p>Salaried dentists accepted a three-year pay offer in March, linked to a review of salaried dental services. For GDPs, the DDRB has recommended an increase in the feescale of 3.225% from 1 April 2003 and an increase in the NHS commitment scheme of &#163;1 million for Scotland.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to confirm that the Scottish Executive has accepted the recommendations on pay contained in the supplementary report of the DDRB for 2003-04 in full and without staging.</p>

  <p>Scottish Water is the only public corporation in Scotland. I refer the member to the answer given to question S2W-164 on 9 June 2003. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&#146;s website, the search facility for which can be found at:</p>

  <p>Tourism is one of Scotland&#146;s biggest business sectors bringing in over &#163;4 billion to the Scottish economy and employing nearly 200,000 people. The key public bodies supporting tourism, including VisitScotland, the enterprise networks, local authorities, Historic Scotland and the European Union invest over &#163;80 million per year into Scottish tourism.</p>

  <p>We are continuing to take new action to increase the number of tourists visiting Scotland. The Interim Route Development fund of &#163;6.8 million is already showing signs of being a great success with a number of new routes direct to Scotland from Europe up and running. VisitScotland and Scottish Enterprise have been central to deciding on what routes will be best for Scotland focussing on bringing in leisure and business tourists. VisitScotland has been quick to react to this opportunity and is putting more emphasis than ever before on business tourism with over &#163;1.7 million being allocated this year to this area alone.</p>

  <p>We will continue to invest in tourism to achieve our key strategic aims. We will continue to build a strong and successful brand for Scottish tourism; we will drive for better quality and value and we will have a local structure for tourism delivery that is right for Scotland now and for the future. We are also working with the enterprise networks, Careers Scotland and others to give tourism a higher career choice profile, and to improve skills and training performance in the sector by encouraging businesses to invest more in their people.</p>

  <p>Tourism is everyone&#146;s business, and we all have a duty to encourage it, and to make Scotland a must-visit, must-return destination.</p>
