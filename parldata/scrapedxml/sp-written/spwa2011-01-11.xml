  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. While all overdose/poisoning chief complaints are 999 emergency calls, the codes can be Category A, B or C determinants.</p>

  <p>2. The dispatch code is determined through questioning of a caller and is based on information available at the time of call. As such, the numbers within the specific heroin and cocaine determinant cannot be considered as a complete picture of overdose in respect of these two drugs as in many cases, the reason for overdose will not be apparent until paramedics arrive on scene.</p>

  <p>3. SAS does not currently record incidents where drugs and/or alcohol have been a factor beyond that provided above. SAS cannot, therefore, provide any analysis on a combination of drugs or whether drugs were a factor in any other incidents</p>

  <p>4. SAS does not record details of &quot;outcomes&quot; for patients as their data systems only record ambulance service information; that is, up to the point at which they have completed treatment on scene or handed a patient over at hospital.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to increasing learning through the arts and culture, and enabling young people to develop creative skills. We are providing ongoing support for the Youth Music Initiative, which provides young people with opportunities to get involved in music. In 2011-12, &pound;10 million will be invested in the scheme, incorporating the allocation of &pound;8 million for local authorities to widen access to free music tuition for primary pupils.</p>

  <p>We have also published the <em>Education and the Arts, Culture and Creativity Action Plan,</em> being delivered in partnership with Learning and Teaching Scotland and Creative Scotland, with the aim of developing the role and impact of the arts and creativity within and across Curriculum for Excellence. Furthermore, curriculum guidance sets out the opportunities and progression routes learners have through the Expressive Arts Experiences and Outcomes to develop their skills in performing and creating music.</p>

  <p>Guidance on preparing for all types of emergencies for local authorities, and other agencies which are charged by legislation with responding to them, is contained in <em>Preparing Scotland: Scottish Guidance on Preparing for Emergencies</em> , published by the Scottish Executive in 2007, a copy of which is available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 52269).</p>

  <p>Scottish emergency planning and response is based on the principles of Integrated Emergency Management (IEM). Under IEM both preparation and response to emergencies should focus on the effects of events rather than their causes. The underlying aim of IEM is to develop flexible and adaptable arrangements that will enable effective joint response to any crisis whether foreseen or unforeseen, including severe weather. It is intended to build the resilience of communities in Scotland to deal with any emergency and, where necessary, to make specific arrangements to deal with particular risks. Preparing Scotland makes it clear that arrangements and plans of local responders are the basic building blocks of response to an emergency. Scottish civil protection is founded on a &quot;bottom-up&quot; approach, in which control of operations is exercised at the lowest practical level. This approach has been proven to be robust in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Being a good neighbour and clearing paths of ice and snow is the kind of practical step that many of us can take during spells of cold weather.</p>

  <p>The legal position is that there is no law preventing people from clearing snow and ice on the pavement outside or on paths to their house, business or any other building. Provided they are careful, use common sense and don&rsquo;t do anything which would be likely to cause harm or distress to others, it is highly unlikely that they will be found responsible for any accidents. Indeed, it is equally important that users of areas affected by snow and ice also take personal responsibility for their own safety.</p>
