  <p>The Head of the Home Civil Service, acting on the advice of the Senior Appointments Selection Committee, is responsible for the process of appointments to Permanent Secretary. The Civil Service Commissioners' Recruitment Code makes explicit provision for consultation with the relevant minister, in this case the First Minister, whose agreement is required to any proposed appointment. Formal responsibility for making Permanent Secretary appointments lies with the Prime Minister.</p>

  <p>There are a number of posts that carry the title of policy adviser in the Policy Unit and elsewhere. This role is not confined to a single band and the occupants are, in almost all cases career civil servants. They cover a wide range of duties within divisions and heads of division will determine job descriptions and job titles according to management needs.</p>

  <p>From time to time ministers and senior civil service colleagues require particular expertise and advice and in these exceptional circumstances the Executive may appoint specialist policy advisers. Specialist advisers may be appointed on secondment or hold temporary appointment as civil servants.</p>

  <p>Last year, the Scottish Executive submitted two applications through the UK Government to the European Commission to permit a less stringent standard of treatment than the norm for the urban waste water discharges at Lerwick and Stornoway.</p>

  <p>The Commission is currently in the process of reviewing the applications, but in the meantime, following a review of treatment in these areas, it has been decided to enhance the sewerage treatment facilities. I refer the member to the answer given to question S1W-27812 today.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what its position is with respect to designations under the Urban Waste Water Treatment Regulations.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has withdrawn the High Natural Dispersion Areas (HNDA) status for the coastal waters in the String, Kirkwall; Lerwick Harbour and the Minch, Stornoway. The consequence of this is that Scottish Water will provide secondary treatment for urban waste water discharges at Stornoway and Lerwick; it has already upgraded the sewage treatment works at Kirkwall. The provision of secondary level treatment will provide further protection to the waters in these areas, resulting in general environmental benefits.</p>
