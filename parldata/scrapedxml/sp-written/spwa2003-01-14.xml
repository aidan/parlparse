  <p>The <i>Plan for Action on alcohol problems</i> , published in January last year, sets out a range of measures to reduce alcohol-related harm in Scotland. Action is grouped into the areas of culture change, prevention and education, providing support and treatment services, protection and controls for individuals and the wider community and delivery. The two key priorities of the plan are to reduce binge drinking and reduce harmful drinking by children and young people.</p>

  <p>In September last year we published an <i>Alcohol Problems Support and Treatment Services Framework </i>to provide guidance to those involved in planning, commissioning and managing services. This identified a range of ways in which services could respond to specific and more general needs.</p>

  <p>Alcohol education forms part of health education in schools, specifically within drug education. Guidelines already exist in the form of 5-14 Health Education Guidelines which were published in October 2000, together with a Guide for Teachers and Managers.

  <p>Local authorities have powers under the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 to provide short-term refuges for children who appear to be at risk of harm. The role of the local authority in providing refuge is to provide the child with somewhere safe to stay and any other services consistent with safeguarding the child&#146;s welfare.</p>

  <p>The Executive has established a working group containing a range of external experts to consider the support needs of children who run away from home and children abused through prostitution. The working group has suggested that the Executive should undertake an assessment of how local authorities are meeting the needs of young people for refuge, the levels of demand and examine models of good practice before issuing additional guidance on the provision of refuge support.</p>

  <p>The Executive has identified up to &#163;600,000 in funding to take forward work on refuge provision and &#163;57,000 for a study led by Barnardo&#146;s to identify effective services for young people abused through prostitution, with a particular focus on ensuring that there are alternatives to secure accommodation.</p>
