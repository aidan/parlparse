  <p>The National Research Register (NRR), a UK-wide research database, records that there are 32 on-going research projects in the UK on autism. On the more specific question of the cause or causes of the rise in diagnosis, three of the studies are looking at the prevalence of autism but the NRR does not appear to record any on-going projects looking specifically at this area.</p>

  <p>On research on autism more generally, eight of the 32 on-going projects recorded on the NRR are being funded by the Medical Research Council at a cost of over &pound;5 million. These are aimed at understanding both the biological and psychological causes and effects of autism.</p>

  <p>Details of these projects are available from the NRR, a copy of which is in the Parliament's Reference Centre (Bib. number 17404).</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-4264 by Mr Tom McCabe on 5 December 2003, what level of funding under the Carers Strategy has been utilised for respite care provision by each local authority since April 2000.</p>

  <p>The Executive's monitoring of local authority expenditure under the Carers Strategy sought to establish through Community Care Plans, and annual updates, how much was being spent on respite and on other services to support carers. Despite Executive guidance on the data required, in the first two years of the strategy, authorities provided information in differing formats. This made meaningful comparisons difficult. To improve matters, information on local authorities' expenditure on respite, and other services to support carers, is now being collected through centralised financial returns. Figures for 2002-03 will be available shortly. These returns will indicate expenditure on respite and on other services to support carers. They will not identify how much of the spending on respite comes from Carers Strategy resources, as these are only part of the total resources from which authorities may finance such expenditure.</p>

  <p>The figures in the tables are estimates only derived from a sample survey, the Family Resources Survey (FRS). The sample size of the FRS in Scotland is small, and so these estimates are subject to considerable sampling variability.</p>

  <p>Equivalisation is the process whereby household income is adjusted to take account of the size and composition of the household in order to make comparisons of living standards between different household types. This adjustment reflects the notion that a family of several people requires a higher income than a single person in order for both households to enjoy a comparable standard of living.</p>

  <p>In anticipation of the impact of the Debt Arrangement and Attachment (Scotland) Act 2002, the Executive has provided an additional &pound;3 million per annum to boost the number of money advisers in Scotland. This funding resulted in an extra 120 advisers across the sector in 2002-03.</p>

  <p>The decommissioning of redundant nuclear submarines is a reserved matter. Any proposal in Scotland will be subject to environmental regulation and planning controls. This would be done by the independent regulator, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), under the terms of authorisations for the disposal of radioactive waste, granted by SEPA under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 and if Crown Immunity is to be applied within the terms of a letter of agreement with SEPA. It is for the planning authority in the first instance to consider whether a particular planning proposal falls within the descriptions in the environmental impact assessment regulations. Both procedures are subject to widespread consultation.</p>

  <p>All employers must comply with the Working Time Regulations. The regulations came into force in 1998 for all NHS staff, except doctors in training who will be included progressively from August 2004.

  <p>An intention to review future control room arrangements in Scotland was expressed in our policy consultation paper <em>The Scottish Fire Service of the Future</em> published in April 2002 and confirmed in our recent publication <em>The Scottish Fire Service: Proposals for Legislation</em> . Mott MacDonald were commissioned in October 2003 to provide independent advice as an extension to a contract placed by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. The contract was placed with Mott MacDonald as they have particular experience of the very specific area of fire service control rooms. The remit of the study is as follows:</p>

  <p>consider the impact and implications of <em>New Dimension</em> on the operational and management arrangements of the fire service and the associated risks, opportunities, and issues in the context of control rooms;</p>

  <p>consider the impact and implications of the consultative documents <em>The Scottish Fire Service of the Future</em>, <em>The Scottish Fire Service: Proposals for Legislation</em> and the proposed modernisation of control rooms;</p>

  <p>investigate the operational effectiveness of existing control rooms and arrangements during the industrial dispute together with lessons learned that might be derived from this experience;</p>

  <p>investigate and report on new international experience, particularly the operational outcomes of 11 September 2001 and the associated lessons that may inform any future arrangements;</p>

  <p>to explore the issues associated with electronic service delivery and the potential impact on control room operations;</p>

  <p>to make recommendations and provide an outline implementation plan for their delivery.</p>

  <p>The value of the contract placed is commercially confidential. Mott MacDonald will submit their recommendations by early January 2004 and they will be considered, together with responses to the consultation exercise, as part of the preparations for the planned Fire Services Bill.</p>

  <p>The Terms of Service for GPs are set out in the National Health Service (General Medical Services) (Scotland) Regulations 1995. These require a GP to provide for patients all necessary and appropriate treatment of the type which might reasonably be expected from GPs as a class. They also require a GP to exercise professional judgement as to the degree and standard of such treatment. In exercising this professional judgement it is open to a GP to refuse to provide particular treatment which the GP deems inappropriate.</p>

  <p>Professional advice from the General Medical Council makes it clear that GPs may take reasonable steps to protect their health or safety as required before investigating a patient's condition or providing treatment.</p>

  <p>Draft guidance on staff screening for health care associated infections (HAI) is being drawn up by a working group of the Ministerial Task Force on HAI as part of a wider document on management of HAI outbreaks.

  <p>Routine testing for MRSA is not currently recommended. The carrier state for MRSA in healthy individuals is usually brief and transitory, which makes routine screening difficult to apply and to interpret.</p>

  <p>Table 1 shows the number of units of public sector normal letting stock vacant as at 31 March of each year. Housing association voids figures are collected by Communities Scotland, but related previously to number of re-lets throughout the year and were therefore not comparable to data collected by the Scottish Executive prior to 2003. Table 2 shows the number of vacant units for housing associations as at 31 March 2003. Table 3 shows the number of new build completions by financial year.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive will continue to use the Scottish House Condition Survey (SHCS) 2002 to inform the development of policy where useful and appropriate.</p>

  <p>On 16 December 2003, I announced the Executive's response to the recommendations of the Housing Improvement Task Force and the SHCS 2002 will be an important source of information in taking forward the necessary work. We have also made extensive use of the results in developing the Scottish Housing Quality Standard and I will be making an announcement about this shortly.</p>

  <p>On disability and housing, a ministerial response to the report of the Strategy Forum: Equipment and Adaptations, <em>Equipped for Inclusion</em>, will be produced in due course which will take into consideration relevant information from the SHCS 2002.</p>

  <p>The Executive's Central Heating Programme and Warm Deal will continue to tackle the issues identified in the SHCS by providing insulation and central heating. A follow-up SHCS 2002 report on fuel poverty will be produced in March 2004 that will help us see where fuel poverty is most prevalent and what further interventions we can make to improve energy efficiency.</p>

  <p>The Executive's response to the Housing Improvement Task Force's final report was announced on 16 December 2003.</p>

  <p>The Executive has identified some &pound;10 million per annum for implementing the recommendations of the task force. This is intended to meet the cost of introducing specific new initiatives recommended by the task force and is in addition to the direct grant (Private Sector Housing Grant) the Executive now provides to local authorities to fund their expenditure on assistance to private owners.</p>

  <p>Since 1999, the Executive's overall housing budget has increased by 26% in real terms. These resources will also generate substantial additional investment. For example, the housing transfers which have been concluded in Glasgow, Dumfries and Galloway and Scottish Borders will deliver investment of nearly &pound;2 billion in the first 10 years.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2004-01-13.S2W-5226.r0" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Colin Boyd QC" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-04/wa0113.htm#16">

  <p>Officials from the National Archives of Scotland began the cataloguing process in March 2003 and are hoping to have it completed by February 2004 in accordance with NAS business objectives. This target is now formally included in the NAS corporate plan for 2003-04.</p>

  <p>The cataloguing process involves reading each document fully and providing a summary of its content. The productions from the inquiry consist of 106 sections of documentation, consisting of 36 lever arch files and additional miscellaneous documents running to many tens of thousands of pages. It is estimated that the material under the extended closure occupies five metres in length of storage space at NAS. When cataloguing is complete consideration requires to be given to releasing material that does not identify children and does not contravene data protection legislation by disclosing personal data in relation to living individuals.</p>

  <p>The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) is liasing closely with NAS and officials from both organisations met recently to review the material catalogued thus far. COPFS officials will be providing me with recommendations about what material can be released in its entirety, what material can be released in an edited format to &quot;anonymise&quot; data and what is unsuitable for release. This is an extremely resource intensive exercise but when it is complete I will be able to reach a decision on release.</p>

  <p>Naltrexone hydrochloride is licensed as an adjunct to prevent relapse in detoxified, formerly opiate dependent addicts. It is not licensed for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) and there is no information held centrally on its effectiveness when used in the treatment of MS. Anecdotal evidence would suggest that Low Dose Naltrexone is not being used by MS specialists in Scotland. However, a clinician can use a medicine outwith its licensed indications if it is considered to be an appropriate treatment for an individual patient. In these circumstances the clinician bears a greater degree of responsibility for the use of the medicine.</p>

  <p>The Executive does not hold information on the use of Low Dose Naltrexone in Ireland or America. Some information on the use of Low Dose Naltrexone in multiple sclerosis, including in America, can be found on the Multiple Sclerosis Research Centre website at <a href="www.msrc.co.uk" target="_blank">www.msrc.co.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>The Chief Scientist Office (CSO) within the Scottish Executive Health Department has responsibility for encouraging and supporting research into health and health care needs in Scotland. CSO is largely a response mode funder of research and this role is well known and advertised throughout the health care and academic community.</p>

  <p>CSO is not currently directly funding any research, including clinical trials, on multiple sclerosis (MS). This is due to the fact that no research proposals on MS have been received in recent years.

  <p>The drug costs per patient per year of the beta interferons included in the scheme are: Avonex - &pound;8,502; Betaferon - &pound;7,259; Rebif - &pound;7,513 lower dose, &pound;8,942 higher dose.

  <p>The Arbuthnott Formula is considered to be an appropriate way of allocating NHSScotland capital funds as it ensures an equitable distribution of capital resources. Thereafter it is for each NHSScotland board to decide, locally, how best to utilise these funds to meet the health care needs of its resident population taking account of national and local priorities. The Arbuthnott percentages for future years will increase or decrease to take account of population movements as the formula is revised annually. Firm allocations for 2004-05 and 2005-06 will be calculated on the basis of the updated percentages.</p>

  <p>Charitable funding of equipment or other such donations, whilst welcome, is not central to the national budgetary calculation or financial planning arrangements for NHSScotland boards. The level of capital resources allocated to NHSScotland boards is not and should not be dependant upon them.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive issued guidance to NHSScotland on dealing with violent patients in January last year as part of the &quot;Managing Health at Work&quot; Partnership Information Network (PIN) Guideline. The guideline has dedicated sections on protecting the health, safety and welfare of people working alone and protecting against violence and aggression at work and includes the ability to withhold treatment in certain circumstances.</p>

  <p>NHS employers are required to meet or exceed PIN Guidelines and they form an integral part of the Staff Governance Standard. The Managing Health at Work PIN states that arrangements for supporting staff should include, for example, rapid access to medical treatment if necessary, time off work to recover from the physical or psychological effects of an incident, access to counselling and support from management when dealing with the police and with any subsequent court proceedings.</p>

  <p>PIN Guidelines are prepared in partnership with the trade unions, professions and NHSScotland and are intended to be reviewed every two years.</p>

  <p>I recently launched the violence and aggression campaign to raise public and staff awareness and arrangements are being made to follow this with a conference at the end of February to develop a strategy with the Service to take forward action on violence and aggression.</p>

  <p>The question of which illnesses can be defined as chronic health conditions is among the issues that the review will address. The detailed remit of the review is still under consideration and the consultation process has yet to be determined. However, it is our firm intention to consult widely with patient interest groups, NHS professionals and other stakeholders. This will ensure that the interests and concerns of as many people as possible can be taken into account. We expect the review to commence within the next few months.</p>

  <p>We have made good progress with the relocation policy. Lifelong learning staff were relocated to Glasgow; the Food Standards Agency has been set up in Aberdeen; the Public Guardian's Office in Falkirk; the National Office of the Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care and the Offices of the Scottish Social Services Council in Dundee; Scottish Public Pensions Agency in Galashiels; Scottish Water in Dunfermline; the headquarters of Scottish Natural Heritage will be set up in Inverness, the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator will be set up in Dundee, the Scottish Executive Inquiry Reporters' Unit will move to Falkirk, the headquarters of Forestry Enterprise Scotland will be located in Inverness, the headquarters of Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education will be located in Livingston, the Risk Management Authority will be located in Paisley, the Accountant in Bankruptcy in Ayrshire, and there will be a significant movement of jobs in the Common Services Agency of the National Health Service in Scotland from Edinburgh initially to Aberdeen and to Glasgow, and some VisitScotland headquarters posts will be identified for dispersal from Edinburgh in due course.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to ensuring that government in Scotland is efficient and decentralised as part of the wider vision of more accessible, open and responsive government. Relocation policy is part of this vision. It can also help us to address particular problems in certain parts of the country.</p>

  <p>Relocation can provide more cost effective solutions for service delivery by allowing organisations to operate away from some of the pressures of the Edinburgh market. It can assist areas with particular social and economic needs. The impact of a relocation such as the Accountant in Bankruptcy on communities in Ayrshire can be significant. Our small units policy also addresses this issue though with the focus on smaller and more remote communities. The final main objective of relocation policy relates to our vision of a decentralised Scotland. We do not wish to see devolution mean a concentration of all things in Edinburgh or indeed in the central belt.</p>

  <p>We will continue to look at relocation opportunities on a case-by-case basis, considering both the particular circumstances of the body concerned and its fit with our relocation objectives. In examining the value of relocating organisations to particular parts of the country we will take into account indicators of social and economic need and the wider issues of promoting a decentralised Scotland. Important considerations will continue to include the operational effectiveness of the organisation, the level of investment required and the position of staff concerned.</p>

  <p>Headquarters functions of the Scottish Executive departments are currently based in Edinburgh and Glasgow because of the frequent meetings with ministers and the Scottish Parliament. There are, however, a wide range of other organisations covered by the policy where relocation reviews will be carried out.</p>

  <p>Decisions are expected during 2004 on reviews of NHS Health Scotland, NHS Education Scotland, the Mental Health Tribunal Service, the Scottish Building Standards Agency, the Scottish Arts Council, <strong></strong>sportscotland, NHS Quality Improvement Scotland and Registers of Scotland, and the Mental Welfare Commission in 2005.</p>

  <p>Rolling this relocation programme forward, I can announce today that we will examine a relocation option for the following bodies:</p>

  <p>Scottish Further and Higher Education Funding Councils, decision, during 2004</p>

  <p>Royal Fine Arts Commission for Scotland (Architecture and Design Scotland), decision, end 2004.</p>

  <p>Consideration is being given to setting up the following bodies:</p>

  <p>Proposed Single Agency for the Administration of Custodial and non-Custodial Sentences</p>

  <p>Proposed National Transport Agency.</p>

  <p>If the Executive decides to proceed in setting up both the above bodies, and subject as appropriate to parliamentary approval, their location and that of the Royal Fine Arts Commission for Scotland (Architecture and Design Scotland), will be determined in accordance with the relocation policy with the presumption against an Edinburgh location. The Scottish Further and Higher Education Funding Councils have come into the programme following lease breaks. They will conduct a location review in which options outwith Edinburgh must be considered.</p>

  <p>These organisations will be examined on a case-by-case basis, with the aim of finding the best location for each organisation, within the context of relocation policy. As part of the process the organisations concerned will continue to consider how most efficiently to conduct their work in line with the most up-to-date practices and the use of technology. There will be opportunities for representations to be made about different locations and full consultation with the organisations concerned and relevant trade unions.</p>

  <p>Information on the administrative costs is also published by the Scottish Executive (Bib. number 293820). This relates to the whole school meals service. The administrative duties relative to free school meals can vary between authorities and we are unable to provide a further breakdown of cost. Entitlement to free school meals is, however, passported through the benefits and tax credits system, the administration of which is a reserved matter. Pupils or parents present evidence of receipt of the appropriate benefits and/or tax credits to the local authority who will arrange for the child to receive free school meals.

The plan offers a programme of action covering prevention and education, protection and control and the expansion of smoking cessation services and another &pound;4 million will be made available with effect from 2005-06.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to provide a meaningful figure for the average annual increase in water and sewerage charges for domestic charges in the last five years. This is because there were six widely different sets of charges across Scotland five years ago compared to two sets (one for north area and one for east and west areas) in 2003-04, to which where applicable, further discounts were and are applied.</p>

  <p>Whilst all customers must contribute to services provided which include the provision of safe drinking water and the treatment of waste water before it is returned to the environment, provisions exist to assist vulnerable groups. These include improving efficiency at Scottish Water, which will ease pressure on charges for all customers and by retaining the link between water charges and council tax banding and discount arrangements.</p>

  <p>Yes, it is consistent. Ministers set the strategic direction for charges for the period 2002-06, setting the maximum level of revenue that can be collected and the principles that charges should be harmonised across Scotland and reflect the costs of provision. Scottish Water and the Water Industry Commissioner in setting charges for individual customers act within this framework.</p>

  <p>The general principles governing relations between the UK Government and the Executive on matters of mutual interest, including legislation, are set out in the published <em>Memorandum of Understanding</em> .</p>

  <p>In respect of the Water Industry (Scotland) Act 2002 (Directions in the Interests of National Security) Order 2002, the Scottish Executive invited the UK Government to make provision for the central purpose of reinstating powers in respect of Scottish Water that had existed in respect of its predecessor authorities under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994. In general the functions of these organisations had transferred to Scottish Water under the Water Industry (Scotland) Act 2002. However, as the reinstatement was beyond the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament and could not be achieved under the act, it was made by the order under powers conferred for such purposes on UK ministers by the Scotland Act 1998.</p>

  <p>As a general rule, the intention would be to notify the Scottish Parliament of such orders as and when a significant impact on devolved areas of policy is expected. In this case, information about the laying and commencement of the order was provided to the Scottish Parliament in answer to question S1W-26219 and copies of the draft Order (SI 1264 (S4)) were lodged in the Scottish Parliament's Reference Centre (Bib. number 21338). Additionally, directions made by Scottish ministers under that order were notified to the Scottish Parliament in December 2002 and January 2003.</p>
