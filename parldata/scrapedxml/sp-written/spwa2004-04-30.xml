  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, the Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>It is expected that the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme Amendment (Scotland) Regulations 2004 allowing the central heating programme to be extended to include the over 80s with partial or inefficient central heating will come into place on 10 May 2004.</p>

  <p>Primary responsibility and authority for anti-terrorism measures lies with the Security Service, which works closely with police forces, and in particular Special Branches, in providing the UK's counter terrorist response. Terrorism is reserved in terms of the Scotland Act 1998.</p>

  <p>Responsibility and authority for the emergency services' response is vested in their respective Chief Officers and is delivered through standing procedures.</p>

  <p>The Financial Services Strategy Group (FSSG) held its first meeting in Edinburgh on 24 November. Eighteen of the 19 non-Scottish Executive members were present. A steering group has been formed on behalf of the full FSSG to oversee the work of a number of sub-groups. Six non-Scottish Executive FSSG members have to date participated in these steering group meetings. The next full meeting of the Financial Services Strategy Group is scheduled for 25 May 2004.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has two grant schemes that support harbours work, namely approximately &pound;7.5 million for the provision of harbour facilities supporting lifeline ferry services in the Highlands and Islands and &pound;400,000 for emergency repairs to fisheries harbours. However, responsibility for the repair and maintenance of small piers and harbours, including such matters as accelerated low water corrosion problems and dredging requirements consistent with expected usage, is a matter for the relevant owners. Funding support may also be available from local authorities, local enterprise companies, the European Union and the National Lottery Fund.</p>

  <p>This is not possible to predict. The amount of electricity exported depends on a number of factors including the mix of generation available in Scotland at the time, local and other demand for electricity and the prevailing market conditions.</p>
