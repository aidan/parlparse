  <p>The timetable for the construction of a new crossing at Kincardine depends on how the detailed proposals are received locally. The earliest date when construction of the new crossing could be started is towards the end of 2003.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-7804 by Iain Gray on 26 September 2000, what the timetable is for (a) the submission of plans by local authorities outlining how they will use the additional monies and (b) the disbursement of the &pound;10 million to help tackle delayed discharges and whether this &pound;10 million allocation will be ring-fenced.</p>

  <p>Each local authority was requested to submit its proposals for the additional monies by 15 September 2000. The letters indicated that, where local authorities could resolve problems of delayed discharge without using all the resources allocated, they could propose to deploy the balance to improve the level and extent of other services.</p>

  <p>All authorities provided proposals which, after some adjustment, were considered satisfactory. Letters confirming this were sent to authorities on 5 October. They indicated that, in mid-January 2001, we will require confirmation that the respective proposals (or revised proposals) are being successfully acted upon. Following that, the monies will be disbursed later this financial year as part of the local authority&#8217;s Revenue Support Grant.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, following sight of the most recent scientific studies in the Inner Sound and Lochs Torridon, Carron, Kishorn, Duich, Alsh and Hourn, what measures it proposes to take with regard to creel and trawl fishing in these areas.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-11-01.6.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80135" speakername="Rhona Brankin" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa1101.htm#10556">

  <p>As part of the most recent review of inshore fishing prohibitions under the Inshore Fishing (Scotland) Act 1984, the Scottish Executive received a large volume of representations from creel and trawl interests in the Loch Torridon area.</p>

  <p>The latest scientific work carried out by Fisheries Research Services indicates that nephrops stocks in the Torridon area are reasonably healthy and a mixed gear fishery appears to be sustainable.</p>

  <p>The Executive has maintained that any change to the existing closures would be best decided by local dialogue and agreement. The two groups have worked up proposals which are broadly acceptable to the Executive and which we consider offer the best opportunity for progress in the area.</p>

  <p>We have therefore decided to implement the following measures to be monitored by Fisheries Research Services subject to review after five years in operation:</p>

  <p>an all-year closure to mobile gear fishing in the area between Red Point, including Loch Torridon, and the south end of the BUTEC Range in the Inner Sound;</p>

  <p>remainder of area to retain existing seasonal closure to mobile gear vessels;</p>

  <p>no multiple gear to be used in existing closure area;</p>

  <p>demersal trawlers fishing the area limited to under 12 metres registered length, and</p>

  <p>Consideration to be given to a creel-free zone in area to enable parallel trials with trawl-free area.</p>

  <p>We will also give further consideration to the case for HIFA to be represented in the Scottish Inshore Fisheries Advisory Group (SIFAG). This would require consultation with SIFAG members.</p>

  <p>We aim to include measures related to the proposed closures in the forthcoming inshore fishing Order. The creel-free measure will be subject to discussion between creel and trawl interests, FRS and the department.</p>

  <p>I hope this will promote better relationships between all fishing interests in the area. I also welcome the additional voluntary measures which creeling interests in Loch Torridon are promoting.</p>

  <p>The appointment of a contractor for the Forth Rail Bridge maintenance and refurbishment programme is a commercial decision for Railtrack and not a matter in which the Scottish Executive has any locus. I understand that the contract for the Forth Rail Bridge works is out to tender and the process is expected to finish mid-November.</p>

  <p>Railtrack meets with Historic Scotland on an annual basis to discuss issues relating to the rail bridge. This year&#8217;s meeting is expected to be held soon.</p>

  <p>Within the additional &pound;1.2 billion investment in local government grant over the next three years announced last month, allowance is included for substantial increases in support for councils&#8217; expenditure on community care services. Provisional settlement allocations for individual councils will be announced later this year. The use of resources is largely a matter for local determination as long as it is consistent with legislation and takes account of national policy. We will seek agreement with authorities on the outcomes to be achieved in community care with the additional resources. Guidelines for community care will be issued thereafter.</p>

  <p>In my statement to the Parliament on 28 September regarding the Executive&#8217;s transport spending priorities I said that road traffic is likely to grow by more than 50% in the next 30 years.</p>

  <p>There is no set list of projects where the Executive is minded to lever in private investment. Past projects such as the completion of the A74(M)/M74 DBFO project demonstrate how capital infrastructure projects can be brought forward more quickly by use of private finance. Accordingly, we will continue to seek opportunities to work in partnership with the private sector, and to lever in private investment for transport infrastructure and services where this is appropriate and offers value for money.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-8789 by Sarah Boyack on 28 September 2000, whether any environmental costs of transporting timber from Kielder through the Southern Borders by road as opposed to rail have been considered as part of the assessment of the value of transporting harvested timber by rail; what the reasons are for the inclusion or otherwise of such consideration in this assessment, and whether it would commission a supplementary report to the Scott Wilson study if the price of timber was projected to rise.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-11-01.15.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80134" speakername="Sarah Boyack" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa1101.htm#10373">

  <p>The Borders Railway Feasibility Study states that the impact of the railway would be to make it environmentally more acceptable to extract the timber. However, the overriding conclusion of the report remains that under current market conditions a Border railway would be unlikely to improve the competitiveness of Border forests with other sources of timber.</p>

  <p>Timber prices are at an historic low point in real terms because of a combination of events: the strong exchange rate, the impact of recycling, the impact of cheap imports from the Baltic countries and consequential effects of the downturn in the Asian economy.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no plans to commission a supplementary study to the Scott Wilson study. Any study to explore further potential markets for the Kielder Forest is a matter for the timber industry.</p>

  <p>The Transport (Scotland) Bill provides a toolkit of options for local authorities to improve bus services, journey times and reliability. It will be for individual authorities at a local level to measure the effectiveness of the provisions they choose to put in place. The Bill requires local authorities to submit annual reports to the Scottish Executive on the effectiveness of Quality Partnership and Quality Contract schemes. This will enable the Executive to assess the impact of the Bill&#8217;s provisions at a national level, and to disseminate best practice guidance.</p>
