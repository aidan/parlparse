  <p>I am not aware of maladministration having taken place in the handling of the scheme. The financial allocation for the scheme has been fully committed. In addition, on 16 November, I announced that an extra &pound;1 million is being made available. This followed consultation with the industry about the prioritisation system to deal with the very late surge in scheme applications which regrettably will result in a number of applications not being funded.</p>

  <p>The pay and conditions of nursery nurses are the responsibility of their employers, whether local authorities or operators in the private and voluntary sector, and, as such, are determined through local pay bargaining.</p>

  <p>The Executive is working with the early years sector to develop the careers structure for nursery nurses and other staff in early education, childcare and playwork. To date, this work has included:</p>

  <p>The establishment of an Early Years National Training Organisation;</p>

  <p>The development of a new qualification suitable to senior practitioners;</p>

  <p>Improved careers information.</p>

  <p>The Executive will bring forward proposals for further action later in the year.</p>

  <p>An additional &pound;115.7 million over five years was announced in the July 1997 Budget under the New Deal for Schools. We have, in partnership with CoSLA, enhanced authorities&#8217; ability to prioritise their capital expenditure in favour of school building work. This is complemented by public private partnership schemes in 10 authorities with a capital value of around &pound;430 million.</p>

  <p>Scottish schools have the opportunity to inform their pupils about issues connected with the Holocaust through subject areas ranging from history and modern studies to religious and moral education and English language. The Government has recently announced that 27 January 2001 will become the UK&#8217;s first Holocaust Memorial Day and I am confident that Scottish schools will find appropriate ways to involve their pupils in marking this day.</p>

  <p>No school board members are appointed by outside organisations. School boards are made up of elected parent and staff members and other members co-opted by the school board. In denominational schools, one of the co-opted members must be nominated by the relevant denominational body. Information on numbers of school board members is not collected centrally.</p>

  <p>The term &quot;non-mainstream schools&quot; is taken to mean special schools ie. not primaries and secondaries.</p>

  <p>All pupils educated and based in special schools are in full-time education and therefore qualify as being educated for more than one third of the week.</p>

  <p>The answer has been prepared based on the most recent available figures i.e. as at September 1998.</p>

  <p>Under the Environmental Protection Act 1990, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) is the waste regulation authority. Operators of waste management facilities, including landfills, are required to apply to SEPA for a licence to operate the site. In considering the application, SEPA may set conditions which are designed to ensure that the environment and health are protected. SEPA then monitors the operation of the site to ensure that the licence conditions are complied with, and take appropriate action if non-compliance is detected.</p>

Revenue projects under the European Regional Development Fund already approved can continue until 31 December 2001. We are working with the various partnerships through plan teams to ensure that the new plans are agreed with the European Commission as early as possible so as to avoid undue dislocation between programmes.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has been in close contact with Scottish fishing representatives throughout the entire TAC process. I was grateful for the opportunity to meet with them both immediately before the December Council, and in Scotland House in Brussels during a break in Council proceedings. They provided a valuable contribution which I am sure helped us achieve a positive outcome to the negotiations.</p>

  <p>Treatment of Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) by amputation is designed to relieve symptoms which are distressing patients. In some patients with this particularly unusual psychiatric problem, the amputation of a limb may provide relief of distress. However, determination of appropriate treatment is very much a matter of joint psychiatric and surgical assessment in each case. The matter is being considered by the Ethics Committee of the Trust whose report will in course be passed to Ministers.</p>

  <p>The recently published <i>Occupational Health and Safety Services Strategy</i> made clear that NHS in Scotland employers must risk assess tasks and activities and should adopt best practice and training to reduce needle stick and contaminated sharps injuries. A Scottish Executive Working Group is in the process of being set up to review available data and information on retractable needles and make recommendations to Ministers on their practical use within the NHS in Scotland.
