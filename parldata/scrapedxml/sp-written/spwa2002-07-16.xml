  <p>The Scottish Executive values the role played by foster carers. However, it is for local authorities to consider whether there are sufficient foster carers in their area to provide the type of care required. I met recently with members of the Fostering Network to discuss a range of issues concerning foster care.</p>

  <p>Allocations for each local authority area (2002-03) are noted in the table. Proposals have been received against all 32 allocations. The overall aim of the Changing Children&#146;s Service Fund is to encourage better integration of all resources available for children&#146;s services across the statutory and voluntary sectors. Proposals are therefore expected to demonstrate evidence of genuine partnership working across these sectors.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the actual number and nature was of the serious crimes referred to by the Deputy First Minister and Minister for Justice in his evidence to the Justice 2 Committee on 18 June 2002 as having been referred to the children&#146;s hearing system last year.</p>

  <p>The number of offences registered per child in the 40 offence classifications has not been collected previously. SCRA&#146;s new information technology system, which is currently being rolled out, is now collecting this data. Relevant material will be developed and published in due course.</p>

  <p>As the Deputy First Minister made clear in his evidence, the decision on which cases to refer to the children&#146;s hearings system is a matter for the Lord Advocate, who exercises his discretion independently of ministers. The Lord Advocate&#146;s guidelines list the offences to be reported to the prosecutor fiscal for consideration of prosecution in either the High Court of Justiciary or the sheriff court. These include murder, attempted murder, rape, firearm offences, assault to sever injury amongst many others and any other offence which in the opinion of the Chief Constable is so serious to warrant the instruction of solemn proceedings by the Lord Advocate in the public interest. These guidelines apply to children as defined in the Children (Scotland ) Act 1995.</p>

  <p>Communities Scotland does not have a landlord role, therefore there is no obligation to comply with the <i>Code of Practice for Tenant Participation in Stock Transfers</i> . Scottish Homes does encourage tenant participation in the transfer process; methods of consultation are put in place to satisfy tenants&#146; local preferences.</p>

  <p>In Scotland, the curriculum is not prescribed by statute and delivery is a matter for local authorities and schools. The Scottish Executive&#146;s policy is to ensure that guidance to education authorities and schools and the framework of national qualifications provide opportunities for raising awareness of child sexual abuse and domestic violence at every level of the school curriculum.</p>

  <p>All education authorities in Scotland have guidelines and procedures for child protection to ensure the safety and well being of children and young people and to protect those adults working with them.</p>

  <p>There are no plans to change current policy.</p>

  <p>Where the right of an employee to transfer is provided by the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981, it would be outwith the competence of the Scottish Parliament (by virtue of section H1 of part II of schedule 5 to the Scotland Act) to legislate so as to take away any rights to which the employee is entitled under those regulations. In general, it would be within the competence of the Parliament to legislate as to the terms of transfer of particular employees where the transfer is not one to which the 1981 regulations or any other employment legislation covered by section H1 applies.</p>

  <p>The matter of pensions is in general reserved by virtue of section F3 of part II of schedule 5 to the Scotland Act. However, an exception is made in respect of employees of a Scottish public authority with mixed functions or no reserved functions and the Parliament may therefore legislate as to the pensions payable to such persons.</p>

  <p>NHS Education for Scotland (NES), a new Special Health Board, was set up by the Scottish Executive on 1 April 2002 to promote multi-disciplinary training and education for all healthcare professions. This new organisation incorporates the Scottish Council for Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education (SCPMDE), the Post Qualification Education Board for Pharmacists (PQEB) and the National Board for Nursing Midwifery and Health Visiting for Scotland (NBS), but will also extend its remit to cover those staff groups who do not currently have specific, structured educational support.</p>

  <p>Supporting Continuing Professional Development of all staff; to include-</p>

  <p>Identification of the Continuing Professional Development (CPD) needs of primary care workers caring for people with mild to moderate mental illness.</p>

  <p>Identification of CPD needs of health visitors and school nurses to strengthen their contribution to public health.</p>

  <p>Development of a strategy for CPD in Scottish General Practice.</p>

  <p>Development of an occupational health toolkit for primary care workers.</p>

  <p>Extension of nurse prescribing.</p>

  <p>Introduction of a national recruitment process for GPR and GP VT schemes in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Development of a strategy for GP training in Scotland for the next five to 10 years.</p>

  <p>Supporting development and maintenance of skills of primary care workers in remote and rural areas.</p>

  <p>Supporting access and operation of the Scottish School of Primary Care.</p>

  <p>Schedule 10 to the National Health Service (General Medical Services) (Scotland) Regulations 1995 lists those drugs and other substances which general practitioners may not prescribe on the NHS. Schedule 10 is known as The Selected List.</p>

  <p>Amendments to Schedule 10 are made by Statutory Instrument.</p>

  <p>The selected list was introduced in 1985 and extended in 1992 and it has been amended on a number of occasions. There have been two amendments since July 1999. NHS (General Medical Services) (Scotland) Amendment (No 2) Regulations 2000 added Propecia to the list. The NHS (General Medical Services) (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 2001 removed nicotine replacement therapies from the list. Corresponding amendments were made to Schedule 10 to the National Health Service (General Medical Services) Regulations 1992 in England.</p>

  <p>The Framework Document &quot;Better Homes Stronger Communities&quot; made it clear that a shared aim of the housing transfer was to promote local community empowerment, control and ownership. This was reinforced in both the Stage 1 and Stage 2 consultation documents. A network of local housing associations has been established across the city to be responsible for the day to day management of their housing.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Glasgow Housing Association will work with local housing organisations who wish to take on the ownership of their own homes if the majority of tenants in the area support this. A draft outline paper on the development of second stage transfers is currently out for consultation.</p>

  <p>The Executive plans to continue to work with the local authority, private and voluntary sectors to improve the quality of pre-school education. The new arrangements for integrated inspection by the Commission for the Regulation of Care and Her Majesty&#146;s Inspectorate of Education will be an important part of this.</p>

  <p>The Executive has been working to improve the quality of all parts of the early years workforce, and recently allocated an additional &#163;7.2 million for the financial years 2002-04, to support workforce expansion and development in the sector.</p>

  <p>The Executive will continue to promote better links between pre-school education and other agencies, so as to provide better integrated services for children, and will look at better programmes and facilities for supporting children's physical development and movement.</p>

  <p>The Executive is also working with Learning and Teaching Scotland and others to improve children&#146;s transition from pre-school education to primary school, and to review the use of ICT in pre-school education.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what factors contributed to the differential in quality identified in the recent HM Inspectorate of Education report, <i>Standards and Quality in Scottish Pre-school Education 1997-2001 and in Early Education and Childcare Workforce Survey Final Report</i> which highlighted that local authority nursery schools performed consistently and substantially better in the quality of learning experiences and that 13% of their staff have a teaching degree compared with 6% in the private and 5% in the voluntary centres and how it will ensure that quality will not be diminished under the new staffing guidelines.</p>

  <p>Local authorities have had a long history in the provision of pre-school education through nursery schools and classes. By contrast, most private and voluntary providers have only recently begun providing funded pre-school education. The report found that overall standards in the private and voluntary sectors have improved during the last four years. This is encouraging for new players in provision. The report did not define the percentages of staff in sectors who had teaching qualifications and no causal link could be drawn from the qualifications of staff in the different sectors.</p>

  <p>The new staffing guidelines should allow all providers &#150; whether in the private, voluntary or local authority sectors &#150; to deploy teams of staff in a way which uses their individual expertise and enhances the quality of children&#146;s experience. All pre-school education providers will be inspected annually under the New National Care Standards by the Commission for the Regulation of Care. The Commission for the Regulation of Care will also be undertaking joint inspections with Her Majesty&#146;s Inspectorate of Education, in order to assess the quality of pre-school education. These inspections should ensure that quality is not diminished under the new staffing guidelines.</p>

  <p>The <i>Guidance on the Involvement of Teachers in Pre-School Education</i> , which I launched in January this year, does not make any changes to staffing requirements. The guidance discusses how teachers and all staff involved in pre-school provision can contribute to the quality of children&#146;s experience by working as a team. The key message of the guidance is that local authorities now have the flexibility to decide how best to involve teachers in the delivery of pre-school education.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive Education Department (SEED) has received a number of representations regarding the Scottish Exchange of Educational Data (ScotXed) project. Most of these representations have been queries from parents asking for clarification on issues of data confidentiality and the collection of information on ethnic background and national identity of pupils, in the 2002 Scottish School Census.</p>

  <p>SEED has provided explanations on the importance of collecting accurate information on the ethnic background and national identity of all pupils in order to meet the requirements of the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000. Although SEED encourages all pupils and parents to provide this information, SEED also appreciates the sensitivity of collecting this information and has provided an option for pupils and parents to state that they do not wish to disclose this information.</p>

  <p>SEED has given assurances that pupil level information to be transferred through ScotXed as part of the September 2002 School Census will be dealt with in strict accordance with the Data Protection Act and with the National Statistics Code of Practice.</p>

These powers are exercised on the First Minister&#146;s behalf by civil servants in accordance with the rules and principles set out in the <i>Civil Service Management Code</i> and in the <i> Civil Service Commissioners&#146; Recruitment Code</i> .</p>
