  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what steps it has taken to review the potential for equalisation of business rates for off-trade and on-trade licensees as referred to in evidence by the Scottish Licensed Trade Association to the Health and Sport Committee on 10 March 2010, ( <em>Official Report</em> c. 2897).</p>

  <p>Business rates are a property based tax calculated using the rateable value of a property. Rateable values are set independent of the Scottish Government by the Scottish Assessors.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has put in place a number of measures to support on-trade licensees through business rates relief schemes. From 1 April 2010 the thresholds for the small business bonus scheme and rural rate relief were uplifted, both of which will benefit on-trade licensees, including many public houses.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of the UK Government&rsquo;s decision to require the NHS in England to report rates of MRSA bacteraemia and Clostridium difficile infections weekly, what steps it is taking to provide the same level of information in Scotland.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-07-05.S3W-34752.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80396" speakername="Nicola Sturgeon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa0705.htm#3">

  <p>NHS boards in Scotland already provide information on MRSA, Clostridium difficile, hand hygiene and environmental cleaning compliance and the causes of adverse incidents. This is published on NHS board websites and discussed publicly at bi-monthly NHS board meetings.</p>

  <p>A national HAI reporting template used to capture and report this data has recently been revised and issued to NHS boards with a six month review date. This places a requirement on boards to publish hospital level cases of Clostridium difficile, MSSA and MRSA bacteraemia on a monthly basis. We will consider the merits of increasing the frequency of reporting as part of our ongoing review process.</p>

  <p>Improvements in our local monitoring arrangements, that go beyond those limited to MRSA and Clostridium difficile in England, are allowing NHS boards to identify issues early and take the necessary action to ensure infection control practices and procedures are being applied effectively at local level.</p>

  <p>Hospital car park charges were abolished at NHSScotland operated car parks with effect from 31 December 2008. That did not end the duty of NHS boards to manage their car parking appropriately, balancing the car parking needs of patients, visitors and staff.</p>

  <p>S3W-34286 was answered on the basis of a specific analysis by the Information Services Division of NHS National Services Scotland which was limited in the extent to which it could fully reflect the true prevalence of errors in surgery. Accordingly, there are no plans for this analysis to be repeated. NHS boards collect information on adverse events, which will include those arising from surgery. In contrast to hospital discharge records, the source used in the previous analysis, locally held adverse event data give an indication of whether or not harm occurred. Monitoring these data is the responsibility of NHS boards and they are not collated or evaluated centrally.</p>
