  <p>The Scottish Executive is determined to improve the quality and consistency of business information and advice provided by the Enterprise Network throughout Scotland. For example we are currently working with Scottish Enterprise to implement a number of improvements in this area recommended by a joint Scottish Office/Scottish Enterprise review report completed earlier this year. This will include steps to improve the first stop shop approach adopted by the existing structure of Business Shops as the main gateway to support service provision in the Scottish Enterprise area.</p>

  <p>Details of Scottish research activities into genetically modified organisms (GMOs) whether carried out under Contained Use or Deliberate Release Regulations are listed in a Public Register which is held by the Health &amp; Safety Executive, Office for Scotland, 59 Belford Road, Edinburgh, EH4 3UE. The information held on individual notifications and consents includes details of any infringements that have resulted in the issuing of a formal prohibition or improvement notice, or in a prosecution.</p>

  <p>The only formal enforcement action required under the Genetically Modified Organisms (Contained Use) Regulations 1992 in relation to premises in Scotland was against Edinburgh University in 1999. This resulted in a successful prosecution.</p>

  <p>In relation to the Genetically Modified Organisms (Deliberate Release) Regulations 1992, two sites in Scotland had improvement notices imposed on them during the period April 97-March 98. In the same year there were three other deviations from the terms of the consent, which were rectified without formal action. All the active release sites in Scotland have been inspected this year and all complied with the terms of their Consent at the time of inspection. While information on formal action in the period 1992 and March 1997 is publicly available from the Health &amp; Safety Executive under Open Government provisions, it has not been collated and is held by reference to individual consents and is not readily available.</p>

  <p>Arrangements are now being developed to hold enforcement information in a more readily accessible format.</p>

  <p>Local authorities in Scotland already have powers which can be used to deliver the main features of &quot;Home Zones&quot;. They can introduce:</p>

  <p>traffic calming measures, under the Roads (Scotland) Act 1984, designed to reduce the speed of vehicles; and</p>

  <p>10mph speed limits, after receiving consent from the Scottish Ministers, under the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984.</p>

  <p>A feature of many continental &quot;Home Zones&quot; is a provision that drivers are held responsible for injuries to pedestrians and cyclists. Any proposal for the introduction of a similar provision in Scotland would have to be considered in light of the existing law on civil liability, and criminal responsibility, for road accidents.</p>

  <p>When assessing the case for wider powers, the Scottish Executive will take note of all relevant information, including the conclusions of research now taking place, in England, into both the extent to which the aims of &quot;Home Zones&quot; can be achieved by traffic management measures introduced under existing legislation and the need for additional legislation.</p>

  <p>On 16 June, the United Kingdom Government removed the statutory requirement for local authorities to obtain the Secretary of State&#8217;s consent before making 20 mph speed limit orders. As a result, local authorities in Scotland now have freedom to set 20 mph speed limits in locations where they feel this would be appropriate.</p>

In other locations, including on the A77, the police monitor the situation and enforce the speed limit using mobile VASCAR equipment. <br /></p>
