  <p>There are no present plans to change the statistical collection system for ME/CFS. Information is collected from two sources: (1) records diagnoses in a sample of over 60 general practices in Scotland; (2) records hospital inpatient and day case discharges. Diagnoses recording on national systems is based on two types of classification, Read coding and the World Health Organisation&#146;s International Classification of Diseases (ICD). Neither of these classification methods allows for the separate identification of ME, for which there is no definitive diagnostic test.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what its plans are for consultation on the proposed level of fees for cattle passports.</p>

  <p>The Cattle Tracing System (CTS) was launched in September 1999 and is run by the British Cattle Movement Service (BCMS). It supports our European and domestic obligations and provides for full traceability of cattle throughout their lives, enabling the livestock industry to provide the level of guarantees and assurances that their customers demand.</p>

  <p>Since its launch, BCMS has issued in excess of 2.3 million passports, or over 11,500 per day. Of these, 90% are issued within 3 working days of an application being received. In addition, since last September, nearly 1.5 million cattle movements have been recorded on the CTS database, and nearly a quarter of a million calls have been handled by the BCMS call centre.</p>

  <p>When the Government announced in February 1998 that it would pay for the set up costs of the CTS, and its running costs during the first full year of operation, it was also made clear that industry should expect to meet future running costs. It is therefore proposed to introduce charges from 27 September 1999 and a consultation document has today been issued seeking views on the level of charges, explaining what they cover and on methods of payment.</p>

  <p>In line with earlier predictions, we propose that the fee should be &pound;7 per cattle passport. This does not include the cost of checks carried out by the Meat Hygiene Service (MHS) at abattoirs which, it is further proposed, will be recovered directly. We estimate the cost to the abattoir sector is likely to be around &pound;2m per annum.</p>

  <p>There are no plans to charge for temporary passports, known also as calf passports, as it is recognised that these animals are less valuable than older animals. However, the fee will become payable if a temporary passport is submitted for conversion to a full cattle passport.</p>

  <p>A copy of the consultation package, including a draft Regulatory Impact Assessment, has been placed in the Library of the Parliament. Comments are sought by 9 August. There will be separate consultations by the administrations in England and Wales, but it is expected that the fee will be at the same rate in all three countries of Great Britain.</p>

  <p>No decision has been made on the introduction of road user charges on any trunk road or motorway, the roads for which the Scottish Executive is responsible. If any such proposals are developed in the future, they will be the subject of full consultation. In terms of other roads, the proposed Transport Bill will legislate to allow local authorities to introduce road user charging on roads for which they are responsible. The coverage of any such schemes will, therefore, primarily be a matter for individual authorities but all schemes will require the approval of Scottish Ministers.</p>

  <p>We are working with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and transport operators to devise a scheme which will provide blind people with free concessionary travel on bus and rail services throughout Scotland. I am hopeful that such a scheme can be introduced on 1 December this year. The Scottish Executive also encourages local authorities to take into account, in developing future plans for roads and transport infrastructure, the guidelines issued to councils in January this year titled &#145;Guidance on the use of Tactile Paving Surfaces&#146;.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it plans to commission estimates of the cost to the NHS of road accidents on the A77 and other trunk routes which are included in the review of Scotland&#146;s Strategic Roads and, if so, whether it intends to publish these details.</p>

  <p>The appraisal framework developed for the Scottish Strategic Roads Review takes into account the estimated reduction in the number of accidents which would follow implementation of the schemes under review and the resulting savings in medical costs. We expect to report to Parliament on the review after the summer recess.</p>

  <p>The appraisal framework developed for the Scottish Strategic Roads Review takes into account the estimated journey time savings which would accrue to road users if the schemes under review were to be implemented. A monetary value is then calculated for these savings using long-established appraisal methodology. We expect to report to Parliament on the review after the summer recess.</p>

  <p>Funding is one of the issues being considered in the Strategic Roads Review. We expect to report to Parliament on the review after the summer recess.</p>
