  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-2646 by Nicol Stephen on 1 October 2003, what funding it will make available for the Edinburgh to New York air service for the next three years; how much has been paid from the Route Development Fund for the service to date, broken down by individual payment; to whom such payments have been made, and what funding was provided prior to the awarding of the route in order to secure it.</p>

  <p>The amount of the investment from the fund offered to secure the forthcoming service between Edinburgh and New York is commercially confidential.</p>

  <p>Investment from the fund goes to the airport operator to enhance the discount it offers for new direct air services. No payments from the fund for the Edinburgh to New York service will be made prior to the commencement of the service.</p>

  <p>Animal Health Inspectors from local authority trading standards departments and the State Veterinary Service are the statutory agencies responsible for enforcing animal welfare legislation in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does, therefore, not make any financial contribution to the SSPCA for the work it undertakes in assisting to enforce animal welfare legislation and prosecution in cases of alleged cruelty or neglect.</p>

  <p>Statistics relating to the numbers of NHS hospital auxiliary staff can be found on the ISD website at www.isdscotland.org/isd.</p>

  <p>All NHSScotland trusts and private companies operating within them have adopted the provisions set out in the NHSScotland Low Pay Agreement, whereby no member of staff should earn less than &#163;5.18 per hour. The two trusts who have most recently adopted these provisions are Lanarkshire Acute Hospitals Trust and Lothian Primary Care Trust. Both trusts have agreed to fund the shortfall in wages paid by their private contractors and are currently in the process of implementing this agreement.</p>

  <p>The Executive has set out its proposals for amending the present framework of water and sewerage regulations in the draft Water Services (Scotland) Bill, which it published for consultation today. The purposes of the draft bill's provisions are to:</p>

  <p>Protect public health and the environment by prohibiting common carriage on the public networks.</p>

  <p>Safeguard the Executive's social objectives by prohibiting anyone other than Scottish Water from serving household customers.</p>

  <p>Establish a licensing regime to regulate the provision of retail services to non-household customers.</p>

  <p>Subject to the outcome of the consultation exercise, the Executive intends to introduce the bill during 2004.</p>

  <p>Copies of the draft bill have been placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 29575). Further copies can be obtained from the Scottish Executive, Environment and Rural Affairs Department, Water Services Unit, Area 1-H, Victoria Quay, Edinburgh EH6 6QQ; tel. 0131 244 0275. The deadline for comments on the draft bill is 9 January 2004.</p>
