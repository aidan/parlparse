<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2004-08-20.1.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80128" speakername="Allan Wilson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-04/wa0820.htm#se_Minister">

  <p>The SCIMAC guidelines are guidelines only, developed by the industry themselves to facilitate the management of herbicide resistant GM crops. As such, they were not legally binding on farmers participating in the farm scale evaluations; either in Scotland, or elsewhere in the UK. It was, however, our clear expectation that farmers would follow these voluntary guidelines. We are satisfied that, as far as possible, they did so.</p>

  <p>The SCIMAC guidelines are entirely separate from the consent which is required before any GMO can legally be released. Consents - including the limitations and conditions set out within them - are legally binding. The terms and conditions for trial consents in Scotland were based on the advice of our statutory Advisory Committee on Release to the Environment and were the same as those in England in all material respects. Copies have been placed in the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 33245).</p>

  <p>Compliance with the consents was monitored and enforced by the Executive&rsquo;s GM Inspectorate.</p>
