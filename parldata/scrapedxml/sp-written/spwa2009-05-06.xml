  <p>The Scottish Government commissioned Young Scot to engage children and young people in the legacy planning of the 2014 Commonwealth Games. Through a national survey, peer led investigation teams and a national discussion day children and young people were able to explain to officials what they want from the 2014 games. Work is currently underway to ensure that they continue to have an integral, active and sustained role in the shaping of the 2014 Commonwealth Games legacy and are able to both shape it and benefit from it.</p>

  <p>We will use the 2014 Commonwealth Games to provide opportunities for everyone, irrespective of age or ability to become more active. Central to this goal will be the CommonHealth Programme. This will aim to create a popular and high-profile movement which motivates people across Scotland to become more active in the run up to the 2014 Commonwealth Games and beyond. It is a unique and ambitious programme which will bring together and build on the wide range of health, sports and physical activity initiatives already in place. It will be delivered in partnership with local councils, health boards, voluntary organisations and businesses across the country. It will also will work alongside the other legacy programmes and national initiatives to improve the nation&rsquo;s health such as the <em>Take Life On </em>campaign.</p>

  <p>We will help establish the infrastructure for sport at local level and by specifically implementing a network of Community Sports Hubs across Scotland. Community Sports Hubs is a new, fresh concept that builds on existing good practice. The hubs are the vibrant communities in which physical activity and sport take place using existing resources in new ways. They will provide significant additional impetus to the achievement of Reaching Higher objectives, in particular the development of strong organisations and well trained people. The hubs will be a central focus for schools, local sports clubs and youth groups to get together raising participation and improving social networks. Whether in an urban or rural setting, the hub could be centred on a community or based at a secondary school, a local authority or trust sports facility, an higher/further education sports centre or a locally run community facility.</p>

  <p>The Apprenticeship Summit provided a very important opportunity to talk directly to employers about how we can support them in their skills investment during the current economic climate and beyond.</p>

  <p>There were 150 delegates at the Apprenticeship Summit. 100 of which were representing employers from the public and private sectors, seven representing the Scottish Trade Unions Congress, five representing Sector Skills Councils, five representing private training providers and five representing Scotland&rsquo;s Colleges. In addition, there were 15 facilitators from a mix of employer and umbrella bodies and 15 scribes from Scottish Government and Skills Development Scotland.</p>

  <p>Follow on sessions with Sector Skills Councils, other sector representative bodies, training providers and colleges, led by ministers, will ensure further engagement with stakeholders.</p>

  <p>The changes to legal aid that came into force on 7 April 2009 extended the financial eligibility thresholds, allowing a million more Scots to be potentially eligible for legal aid if they have a disposable income of &pound;25,000 or less. In addition to financial qualification, applicants must meet two other statutory tests: they must have a legal basis for the case and it must be reasonable in the particular circumstances of the case that they should receive legal aid. This applies to all applicants, including those seeking to make claims in relation to historic child abuse.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not hold individualised data on any crimes or offences recorded by the eight police forces in Scotland, and as such does not hold information on the victims of crimes or the location at which the crime took place. As such it is not possible to identify how many crimes were committed in each hospital in the Lothians region in each of the last five years.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-13481 by Jim Mather on 5 June 2008, whether it will provide an update on the steps it is taking to encourage choice of broadband provider in the Western Isles and confirm how many broadband providers have gained access to the Connected Communities network.</p>

  <p>A choice of broadband providers is available from all of the exchanges that BT enabled commercially on the Western Isles. The responsibility for encouraging a choice of providers on the Connected Communities network falls to Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) which deals with all operational matters around the network&rsquo;s design and delivery and management. The Connected Communities network is a wholesale network which is open to any broadband provider who wishes to offer its services, however currently, only one such provider has taken advantage of this opportunity. HIE continues to market the network to other broadband providers, and is currently in discussion with a number of providers who may be interested in providing an alternative service over the network.</p>

  <p>Highlands and Islands Enterprise, which deals with all operational matters around the design, delivery and management of Connected Communities, has advised me that there is no alternative broadband service covering the whole of Barra, to which to transfer the Connected Communities network. It is not possible to know if an alternative broadband service would provide wider coverage than that provided by the Connected Communities network. Furthermore, the Connected Communities network is providing broadband services to those end-users unable to obtain a broadband service from the BT broadband-enabled exchange in Castlebay in the south of Barra. There have been no reported instances of any end-user from the Northbay and Eoligarry areas in the north of Barra who has requested a service from Connected Communities but who has been unable to be provided with one.</p>

  <p>Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE), which deals with all operational matters around the design, delivery and management of Connected Communities, has confirmed that 23 Barra residents currently have access to a reliable broadband service through Connected Communities, with another 21 &quot;live&quot; orders which are ready for installation now. Connected Communities&rsquo; orders in Barra therefore currently total 44. This comprises 26 connections in the Northbay area, and also another 18 in the Castlebay area, from premises unable to receive a BT broadband service due to distance from the exchange.

  <p>There is no plan to review the procedures for processing applications at this time. Disclosure Scotland currently has in place quality assurance and quality improvement procedures.

  <p>It is still not possible to access foreign conviction information unless that information has been transferred to the UK and recorded in the central records searched by Disclosure Scotland.</p>

  <p>We are working with colleagues in the UK Government to secure access to information from a number of countries elsewhere in the world where the national law of those countries allows information about their citizens to be transferred to Scotland for the purposes of criminal record checks.</p>

  <p>To prepare for such agreements, we have brought forward an amendment in section 79 of the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Bill that will, if enacted, give Disclosure Scotland access to information from outwith the UK subject to our reaching agreement with overseas jurisdictions to share information with us for the purposes of Part 5 of the Police Act and PVG Scheme, and Parliament approving the necessary Order.</p>

  <p>Separately, Disclosure Scotland has been working with Irish counterparts and the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland to enable information from Ireland to be requested in connection with enhanced disclosure applications. Agreement has now been reached and a Memorandum of Understanding to support it will be signed in the near future.</p>

  <p>We have no plans to review the service level target now. We intend to introduce the PVG Scheme in Scotland next year and a consequence of that will mean that around 90% of applications for the enhanced disclosure carried out under Part 5 of the Police Act 1997 will transfer into the PVG Scheme. The PVG Scheme will also introduce a number of new checks and service level targets for that work. At that time we will also reappraise the service level targets for the work under the Police Act 1997.</p>

  <p>The installation of oil storage tanks used for heating or cooking facilities to all building types is covered by the Building (Scotland) Regulations 2004.</p>

  <p>Such structures may require an application for planning permission to the planning authority. However, permitted development rights (PDR) grant a Scotland-wide planning permission, removing the need for a planning application, for various developments, in areas ranging from householder developments to development at airports, which might cover these structures depending on the circumstances. Specific PDR apply, for example, to a container for the storage of oil or liquefied petroleum gas within the garden of a dwelling house. These particular PDR are subject to conditions on size and location to protect visual amenity.</p>

  <p>The maintenance of oil tanks is not covered by the building regulations. However, action may be taken under Section 28 (Defective Buildings) of the Building (Scotland) Act 2003 where a local authority considers that a tank has defects that require to be dealt with to prevent significant deterioration.</p>

  <p>The eHealth Programme is currently being advised by the Clinical Change Leadership Group (CCLG) to prioritise which types of electronic information is most important to clinicians in NHS Scotland. The advice from CCLG will be used to inform a clinical portal programme, which will give health boards the capability to deliver a virtual Electronic Patient Record by assembling the agreed information elements of the electronic patient record and displaying it in the clinical portal. It is expected that a clinical portal technology pilot will be completed in one health board during 2009.</p>

  <p>Safeguarding patient confidentiality is important, hence parties not directly involved with patients have no control over disclosure of patient data for non care-related purposes such as teaching, clinical trials and disclosure to the media. A few exceptions in law exist, such as notifiable diseases. The NHS also requires explicit consent from the patient for sharing information with other agencies such as social work.</p>

  <p>It may be helpful to be aware of the &quot;Caldicott Principles&quot; set out below which underpin the approach that NHS organisations take to restrict access to person identifiable information:</p>

  <p>Principle 1 - Justify the purpose(s) for using confidential information</p>

  <p>Principle 2 - Only use it when absolutely necessary</p>

  <p>Principle 3 - Use the minimum that is required</p>

  <p>Principle 4 - Access should be on a strict need-to-know basis</p>

  <p>Principle 5 - Everyone must understand their responsibilities</p>

  <p>Principle 6 - Understand and comply with the law.</p>

  <p>The Fair for All agenda seeks to ensure that &quot;whatever the individual circumstances of people&rsquo;s lives, they have access to the right health services for their needs&quot;.</p>

  <p>Guidance entitled <em>Achieving fair access</em> was produced and issued to the NHS by the Fair for All &ndash; Disability team in April 2007 and is available at <a href="http://www.healthscotland.com/documents/2033.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.healthscotland.com/documents/2033.aspx</a>.</p>

  <p>Section 4 of the guidance covers Accessible service delivery and Section 4.4 provides advice on Admission to health services.</p>

  <p>The six strands of the Fair for All initiative were mainstreamed within NHS Health Scotland with effect from 1 April 2008.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is supporting NHS boards to take forward a change programme to address the health inequalities facing people with a learning disability and/or autism spectrum disorder. A learning network of NHS boards will give them a forum to share learning and good practice including the role and effectiveness of liaison nurses.</p>

Consultation has taken place with all key stakeholders and relevant policy areas within the Scottish Government, and we have used events such as the Procurex conference, Scottish Sustainable Network conference, The Scottish Sustainable Network Working Group on Sustainable Procurement meetings and the Association of Public Service Excellence conference to discuss the plan with interested parties.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not hold individualised data on any crimes or offences recorded by the eight police forces in Scotland, and as such does not hold information on the victims of crimes or the location at which the crime took place. It is not therefore possible to identify the number of offences on public transport recorded by the police in 2008.</p>

  <p>Where the Land Register is inaccurate (whether due to an error by the Keeper or for any other reason) a person may apply for rectification of the Register. The circumstances in which the Keeper may rectify the Register to remove an inaccuracy are set out in section 9 of the Land Registration (Scotland) Act 1979.</p>

  <p>Subsection (1) of section 9 confers on the Keeper a general power to rectify any inaccuracy in the register, either on his own initiative, or on being requested to do so. It also requires the Keeper to rectify an inaccuracy on being so ordered by a court or the Lands Tribunal for Scotland.</p>

  <p>Subsection (3) of section 9 limits both the Keeper&rsquo;s power to rectify the Land Register and also the power of the court or the Lands Tribunal for Scotland to order the Keeper to rectify. If rectification of the Land Register would prejudice a proprietor who is in possession of the registered title the circumstances in which rectification is permissible are limited. These are: where everyone whose interests are likely to be affected by the rectification have agreed; where the rectification is to note an overriding interest (a form of right that does not require to be constituted in a conveyancing deed such as certain forms of access right); where the inaccuracy has been caused by fraud or carelessness, or where the title is not fully guaranteed (this can happen where there is an element of uncertainty in the underlying title).</p>

  <p>If rectification is not legally permissible and the person seeking rectification has suffered loss as a result of that they may be entitled to be indemnified by the Keeper in respect of that loss. If rectification is legally permissible, a person who suffers loss as a result of the rectification may equally be entitled to be indemnified by the Keeper.</p>

  <p>The entitlement to indemnity is provided by section 12 of the Land Registration (Scotland) Act 1979 and is subject to a number of exceptions. Examples include where the Keeper has expressly excluded his indemnity when registering the title or where specified matters could not have been known to the Keeper, and on occasion the applicant, when an application was presented for registration.</p>

  <p>Where the Keeper refuses an application to rectify, that decision may be challenged in a court or the Lands Tribunal for Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Land Register is designed to be definitive as to the nature and extent of title. Section 5 of the Land Registration (Scotland) Act 1979 requires the Keeper to complete registration in respect of a property title by making up a title sheet for it in the Land Register. The content of the title sheet is set out in section 6 of that act and includes a description of the property, the names of the proprietors, details of any charges over the property and title conditions and rights affecting the property. The title sheet also includes a title plan on which the extent of the registered property is shown. The Keeper creates a title sheet for a property based upon the deed submitted for registration, accompanying documentation including the application form, and where the property is being registered in the Land Register for the first time, prior deeds relating to that property as recorded in the General Register of Sasines.</p>

  <p>The General Register of Sasines is a register of deeds in which conveyancing deeds are lodged. The fact that a deed appears in the General Register of Sasines does not guarantee its validity, merely that it is competent to be recorded. The state and quality of a title to a property must be deduced by examination of the relevant deeds relating to that property as recorded in this register.</p>

  <p>By contrast, the Land Register is a register of title whereby title flows from the entry for a property in the Register. Section 5 of the Land Registration (Scotland) Act 1979 requires the Keeper to complete registration in respect of a property title by making up a title sheet for it in the Land Register. The title sheet includes a description of the property, the names of the proprietors, details of any charges over the property and title conditions and rights affecting the property. The title sheet also includes a title plan on which the extent of the registered property is shown. Except for &quot;over-riding interests&quot; as defined in section 28 of the Land Registration (Scotland) Act 1979, the title sheet is determinative of title. (An overriding interest is, in relation to an interest in land, a right or interest that does not have to be constituted in a conveyancing deed, for example certain types of access right.)</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the original budget allocation was for the (a) agri-environment, (b) business development and (c) forestry elements of the Rural Priorities scheme.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-05-06.S3W-22664.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80340" speakername="Richard Lochhead" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa0506.htm#33">

  <p>The Scottish Rural Development Programme (SRDP) financial tables set out the funding available for each of the 30 European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development measures the programme draws on. These are grouped under eight broad headings in the Scottish Government budget. The different parts of the SRDP are funded through one or more of these budget lines.</p>

  <p>In order to retain budget flexibility and in response to stakeholders&rsquo; views, the budget provision for Rural Priorities was not ring-fenced in total or within each budget line. Rural Priorities spending comes from budget headings which also fund other SRDP spending, for instance on Land Managers Options and on &quot;legacy&quot; payments for agreements entered into under the previous programme.</p>

  <p>At the start of the SRDP, taking assumptions for the amount of spending on the other elements within the relevant budget headings, around &pound;500 million was expected to be available for new commitments under Rural Priorities overall. The amount actually available for new commitments under Rural Priorities will depend on a number of factors, including the level of uptake for demand-led elements within the relevant budget headings, and any future policy changes.</p>

  <p>Of the &pound;500 million, the following sums fell within the budget headings for agri-environment, business development and forestry:</p>
