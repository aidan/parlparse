  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many binge drinkers there were in each of the last 10 years, broken down by (a) age, (b) gender and (c) area.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-11-28.S2W-29855.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80064" speakername="Lewis Macdonald" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa1128.htm#1">

  <p>Binge drinking is defined in the Executive&rsquo;s Plan for Action on Alcohol Problems as &quot;drinking an excessive amount on any one occasion&quot;. The Scottish Health Survey defines binge drinking for adults as drinking more than twice the recommended daily benchmark on a person&rsquo;s heaviest drinking day (more than eight units for men and more than six units for women). For young people under 16, consumption of five or more drinks on a single occasion has been used as a measure of binge drinking.</p>

  <p>Adults</p>

  <p>Table 1.9 of the <em>Scottish Health Survey report, volume 2</em>, provides information on units consumed by adults on the heaviest drinking day in the past week, broken down by age and gender for 1998 and 2003. <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/76169/0019729.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/76169/0019729.pdf</a></p>

  <p>Analysis of the Scottish Health Survey by NHS board area is available on the Scottish Executive website via the following link <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/11/25145024/50256" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/11/25145024/50256</a>.</p>

  <p>The table entitled Daily Drinking provides similar information for units consumed by men and women on the heaviest drinking day in the past week. Due to the small sample sizes involved, it is not possible to break this information down by age.</p>

  <p>Young People</p>

  <p>Information on the drinking habits of young people is provided by the <em>Scottish Schools Adolescent Lifestyle and Substance use Survey </em>(SALSUS). A question on consumption of five or more drinks on a single occasion was first included in 2002.</p>

  <p>Table 3.17, provides information on the frequency of drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion in the last 30 days, by age and gender for 2002 and 2004.</p>

  <p>The most recent breakdown of this information at NHS board level is for 2002:</p>

  <p>The Standing Orders of the Scottish Parliament require all Executive Bills on introduction to be accompanied by a Financial Memorandum which sets out the best estimates of the administrative, compliance and other costs to which the provisions of the bill would give rise, best estimates of the timescales over which such costs would be expected to arise, and an indication of the margins of uncertainty in such estimates.

  <p>The Executive has not hitherto had a stand-alone strategy for the creative industries; instead we have sought to help the sector through policy initiatives and funding provided by the enterprise agencies and the Scottish Arts Council (SAC). In the period 2001-02 to 2005-06, the budget allocated to the Digital Media and Creative Industries cluster by the Scottish Enterprise Board has been &pound;26 million, which included a large element of capital for infrastructure projects. SAC&rsquo;s budget for its Creative Industries Action Plan between 2003-04 and 2006-07 was &pound;877,500. In addition, SAC also recently awarded The Lighthouse &pound;74,470 towards the cost of developments to enhance access, circulation and the visitor experience on the ground floor.</p>

  <p>Our policies towards the sector are encompassed in <em>Scotland&rsquo;s Culture</em>, our response to the Cultural Review. In that document, I signalled our intention to develop a new strategy to guide the support which will be given to the creative industries sector in future by Creative Scotland once it is set up. As part of that work, we will assess the extent to which there are gaps in support and whether the services could be provided more effectively.</p>

  <p>The Executive is working with the STUC to tackle violence against all workers serving the public. We are now in the third year of an awareness campaign. Its objectives are to raise awareness of the issue, emphasise that violence, whether physical or verbal, against those who serve the public is unacceptable, encourage workers to report any incidents and employers to put in place systems to assess and address these issues. The campaign website and advice line will refer enquirers to guidance and advice on best practice. The Executive has provided &pound;516,000 for this programme. <a href="http://www.infoscotland.com/violenceatwork" target="_blank">http://www.infoscotland.com/violenceatwork</a> .</p>

  <p>The preferred source for earnings estimates is the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE), which is carried out by the Office for National Statistics.</p>

  <p>The median gross weekly pay for full-time employees, excluding overtime, in Scotland in 2006 was &pound;403.60. The median is the recommended measure of average earnings as opposed to the mean.</p>

  <p>The following table shows the number of households with one, two, three or more than three working adults. The number of households are also expressed as a proportion of total households with at least one working adult.</p>

  <p>By definition the proportion of adults earning over the median wage is 50%. Therefore the best estimate for the number of people earning over the median wage is 1,169,000.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what plans it has to make additional investment to maintain the provision of science and engineering subjects at universities and colleges, in light of reports that the Higher Education Funding Council for England has announced an additional &pound;75 million funding for this purpose at tertiary education institutions in England.</p>

  <p>The additional allocation just announced by the Higher Education Funding Council for England is &pound;25 million per year over the next three years. This has been made to sustain capacity in some science departments which are vulnerable because of low student demand.</p>

  <p>The allocation of funding to Scotland&rsquo;s colleges and universities is a matter for the Scottish Funding Council (SFC). Their assessment is that the number of students studying science in Scottish universities is currently rising with provisional figures showing an increase in 2005-06 of 4% on the previous year. Average funding per science student, at &pound;7,580, is already significantly higher than the &pound;6,326 in England. Following the record additional allocations to the SFC in the last Spending Review, the SFC has also made very significant investments in strategic areas of science research, such as &pound;59 million for pooling in Physics, Chemistry, Engineering and Geosciences. These are already helping to strengthen teaching as well as research capacity, and helping to attract potential students. The SFC therefore have no plans to provide additional funding to support particular departments. However, the SFC is currently undertaking a review of its teaching funding methodologies, which will include examining how closely funding relates to the costs of delivery.</p>

  <p>Ensuring we have enough people studying science to enable the needs of the country to be met is a key aspect of our science and innovation strategy. We are planning to publish a study of the available data in this area in the next few months. We are also currently consulting on the science and innovation strategy and plan to update it next year.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S2W-29836 on 28 November 2006. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="../../../webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a> .</p>

  <p>In the financial year 2005-06, &pound;42.9 million was spent on pathology laboratory services provided by Scottish hospitals. This includes services provided to all parts of NHSScotland. It is not possible to identify the proportion of expenditure related to work originating from primary care services alone.</p>

  <p>These actions include measures aimed at harm reduction, improving the accessibility of testing services, actions to identify and offer hepatitis C testing to those who are at risk and to develop or improve local community-based treatment, care and support services for people who have been diagnosed with hepatitis C. Information about how much each NHS board will spend on needle exchanges is not yet available centrally. NHS boards will report to the Scottish Executive on their spending of the Hepatitis C Action Plan funding by March 2007.</p>

  <p>In addition to the funding allocated for the Hepatitis C Action Plan, the Scottish Executive has allocated over &pound;8.6 million in 2006-07 to NHS boards for blood-borne virus prevention work. These funds are used in a number of ways, including the provision of awareness raising, publicity materials highlighting the risks of unsafe sexual practices and the provision of needle exchange facilities to prevent the spread of bloodborne viruses through the sharing of dirty injecting equipment.</p>

  <p>Source: Households Below Average Income, DWP.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>The income used in the low income estimates is called equivalised net disposable household income. This equivalised income allows the comparison of living standards between households that vary in size and composition.</p>

  <p>Net disposable household income: Total income from all sources (including Tax Credits) after deductions for income tax, National Insurance contributions, council tax, pension contributions and maintenance payments.</p>

  <p>Housing costs: Rent/mortgage payments, water charges, structural insurance premiums, ground rent and service charges.</p>

  <p>Absolute low income: Individuals living in households whose equivalised income is below 60% of inflation adjusted GB median income in 1996-97. This is a measure of whether those in the lowest income households are seeing their incomes rise in real terms.</p>

  <p>Relative low income: Individuals living in households whose equivalised income is below 60% of the GB median income in the same year. This is a measure of whether those in the lowest income households are keeping pace with the growth of incomes in the economy as a whole.</p>

  <p>The Standing Orders of the Scottish Parliament require all Executive Bills on introduction to be accompanied by a Financial Memorandum which sets out the best estimates of the administrative, compliance and other costs to which the provisions of the bill would give rise, best estimates of the timescales over which such costs would be expected to arise, and an indication of the margins of uncertainty in such estimates. The Financial Memorandum must distinguish separately such costs as would fall upon (a) the Scottish Administration, (b) local authorities and (c) other bodies, individuals and businesses.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-28477 by Nicol Stephen on 6 October 2006, whether the statements in the answer that &quot;Expenditure on student support can be split into two main categories. Expenditure from the Scottish Executive Budget and expenditure from outwith Total Managed Expenditure&quot; and &quot;Treasury has now re-classified student loan advances and repayments as Annual Managed Expenditure (AME) as from 1 April 2006. This brings this net expenditure within the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s Total Managed Expenditure&quot; mean that student loan advances and repayments should now be regarded as being part of the Executive&rsquo;s budget.</p>

  <p>The Reclassification of Student Net New lending from Outwith Total Managed Expenditure (OTME) to AME has no budgetary effect.</p>

  <p>This reclassification simply improves the transparency of the Treasury&rsquo;s cash requirements. By virtue of the Public Finance and Accountability (Scotland) Act 2000 the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s budget for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning has always included the cash requirement to fund Student Net new lending.</p>

  <p>The previous categorisation of student loans as Outside Total Managed Expenditure meant that student loans were shown as part of the Governments overall cash requirement and not specifically pertaining to the total managed expenditure of the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-28476 by Nicol Stephen on 6 October 2006, how many student loan borrowers domiciled in Scotland and now in repayment status had their payments outweighed by the charges shown as interest on their statements in cash terms in each of the last five years.</p>

  <p>The number of student loan borrowers who had ICR full-time loans that entered repayment in April 2004 who had their repayments outweighed by interest in each financial year is:</p>

  <p>2003-04 is 15,981</p>

  <p>2004-05 is 36,312.</p>

  <p>Due to the nature of the repayment under the Income Contingent System it is not possible to provide this information prior to 2003-04.</p>

  <p>Interest is only charged at the rate of inflation, therefore, any repayment made, no matter how small, would always result in a borrower owing less in real terms.</p>

  <p>Government Expenditure and Revenues in Scotland 2003-04 estimates receipts from corporation tax in Scotland at &pound;2.4 billion. The &pound;1.4 billion figure results from dividing this by the current rate and multiplying by the proposed rate.</p>
