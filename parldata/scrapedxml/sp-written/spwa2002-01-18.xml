  <p>Our Plan for Action on alcohol problems is published today. The plan sets out a powerful package of national and local measures for a range of organisations and individuals to reduce alcohol-related harm in Scotland. Action proposed covers changing some of the cultures surrounding drinking, prevention and education, support and treatment services for people with alcohol problems and protection of individuals and the wider community.</p>

  <p>The success of the plan will depend upon partnership working. Our aims are ambitious, and it will take time to see changes. However, the Executive believes the Plan for Action offers an important opportunity to reverse the current worrying trends in alcohol problems in Scotland. We will review progress in delivering the plan by the end of 2003.</p>

  <p>Copies of the plan have been placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 18608) and it is also being published on the Scottish Executive website.</p>

  <p>The Chief Scientist Office (CSO) of the Scottish Executive Health Department has responsibility for encouraging and supporting research into health services and patient care within NHSScotland. This role is well advertised throughout the healthcare and academic community. CSO is always happy to consider robust proposals for research projects, which would be assessed against the normal peer review and committee procedures and criteria.</p>

  <p>The CSO portfolio includes more than 30 cancer related projects with an annual spend of approximately &#163;1.4 million, the findings of which will be relevant to all tumour types. The CSO also funds the indirect costs of cancer research. In 2000-01 approximately &#163;7.1 million of the general funding allocated to the NHSScotland for research was used in support of cancer studies.</p>

  <p>Further information on CSO funding is available at www.show.scot.nhs.uk/cso.</p>

  <p>LECs do report their performance against network priority targets to Scottish Enterprise and Highlands &amp; Islands Enterprise in a consistent manner, for internal management purposes, and these figures are reflected in network-wide performance measures when they are published. Until recently, the presentation and format of LEC Annual Reports was determined by the requirements of local stakeholders, and specific local conditions. The change in the status of LECs to become wholly owned subsidiaries of Scottish Enterprise and Highlands Islands Enterprise will be accompanied by greater consistency in reporting arrangements at local level.</p>

  <p>Comprehensive figures in the form requested on the total numbers applying for a student loan, either through the Student Awards Agency for Scotland (SAAS) or direct to the Student Loans Company (SLC), could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.</p>

  <p>Students apply for support to the Student Awards Agency for Scotland (SAAS), which assesses whether applicants are eligible for a student loan and the maximum amount of loan to which they would be entitled, based on the information provided in the application. This information is then sent to the Student Loans Company (SLC).</p>

  <p>Where a student does not apply for a loan as part of their original application for support, SAAS nevertheless assesses entitlement and provides information on the amount the student would be entitled to borrow. The student may then apply for a loan later in the academic year, by applying directly to SLC, without requiring to inform SAAS.</p>

  <p>The figures can be provided for the number of students assessed by SAAS as eligible for a loan. These will be higher than the number of students who applied for a loan.</p>

  <p>The information cannot be provided in the format requested.</p>

  <p>As well as means-tested loans and bursaries, the full financial support to which a full-time higher education student is entitled may include supplementary grants, such as Disabled Students' Allowance, Lone Parent's Grant and travel grants. The Student Awards Agency for Scotland (SAAS) cannot know whether any particular applicant has applied for all the supplementary support to which they may be entitled. In addition, some students may only apply for tuition fee support and the minimum student loan and therefore are not required to provide any income details. In these cases, the agency in unable to judge whether or not the loan applied for is the maximum to which the student is entitled.</p>

  <p>Data on the number of applicants in each category and for each year, who applied for the maximum value of general living cost support to which they were entitled, on the basis of details provided and income declared on their application forms, could only be obtained at a disproportionate cost.</p>

  <p>Information on student awards issued, by place of study and level of course, is available in the SAAS Annual Report, a copy of which is available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre and on the agency's website (www.saas.gov.uk).</p>

  <p>The Executive has made resources available to councils for independent advice to tenants. The amounts paid to each Independent Tenant advisor are a matter for individual councils. No information is held centrally on sub-contractors employed by tenant advisors.</p>

  <p>The Executive has decided in principle to establish a Scottish Human Rights Commission. No decision has yet been taken on the timetable or on the detailed structure and membership of such a body. I intend to put forward proposals on those issues for consultation during the course of this year. No decision has been taken on the location of a commission.</p>

  <p>The Executive is clear that a Scottish Human Rights Commission should not in any way cut across the remits of the existing statutory equality bodies. The detailed proposals for the establishment of the commission will be drawn up with that firmly in mind. However, we anticipate that a Scottish commission will want to work closely with these bodies on matters of mutual interest, and we envisage that the new body, once established, will wish to draw up a memorandum of understanding to facilitate this working relationship.</p>

In addition, professional staff from the State Veterinary Service (SVS) in Scotland have attended a training course on the diseases and their symptoms. This information has been cascaded to other Scottish SVS staff. Thus the awareness of the disease has been increased within the profession.</p>

  <p>Gate fees are negotiated between individual companies and the Rural Payments Agency for work relating to the operation of the Over Thirty Month Scheme (OTMS). These fees are agreed following negotiations based on bids submitted to the agency through competitive tendering procedures. At no time are these fees publicly released as to do so would breach these procedures, could jeopardise current contracts and might prejudice future tendering exercises relating to the scheme. The Rural Payments Agency has confirmed that OTMS gate fees have not been disclosed in the House of Commons.</p>

  <p>Planning and providing maternity services in Argyll and Clyde is in the first place a matter for NHS Argyll and Clyde. They are responsible for ensuring that services are safe, of high quality, and meet the needs of users. Any proposals to change significantly the current pattern of services would be subject to comprehensive public consultation, and would ultimately require the approval of the Health Department.</p>

  <p>In addition, NHS boards are required to demonstrate to the department that their maternity services follow the Scottish <i>Framework for Maternity Services</i>, published in February 2001. The framework set out clear action points and recommendations intended to ensure that NHSScotland continues to provide modern, safe maternity services that are appropriate to the needs of women in Scotland.</p>
