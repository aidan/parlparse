  <p>Clinical guidelines are developed by the SIGN Council, which is independent of the Scottish Executive. A SIGN guideline for autistic spectrum disorder is currently being developed for children and young people up to the age of 18 years. The guideline will address assessment, diagnosis and clinical interventions. I understand the SIGN Council presently has no proposals to develop clinical guidelines for adults with autistic spectrum disorders.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive will shortly be publishing a quality standard for autistic spectrum disorder diagnostic services that will provide a checklist for multi-disciplinary teams, including the consideration of appropriate referrals and clinical interventions for both children and adults.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is funding two projects which are in the early stages of developing one-stop shops for adults with autistic spectrum disorders. Funding includes an element for evaluation, which is intended to assist other areas in developing models of service to meet local needs. The decision to develop one-stop shops in other areas will be a matter for local agencies.</p>

  <p>The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) are responsible for the safety, quality and efficacy of medicines available on the UK market.</p>

  <p>In the case of analgesics and other medicines, before a medicine is classified for General Sales List (GSL) availability, the Medicines Act 1968 (reserved legislation) requires UK ministers to be satisfied that the medicine can, with reasonable safety, be sold or supplied other than by or under the supervision of a pharmacist. Patient safety is always the main consideration in a decision to classify a medicine and must be supported by information on its safe use without professional advice.</p>

  <p>The MHRA keeps the safety of all medicines under review and whenever necessary takes appropriate action to safeguard public health.</p>

  <p>Detailed information about the legal classification of any medicine in the UK can be accessed on the MHRA website <a href="http://www.mhra.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.mhra.gov.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Needs Assessment Programme (SNAP) issued its report on Huntington&rsquo;s Disease, Acquired Brain Injury and Early Onset Dementia in February 2000 in order to assess progress in implementation. The Scottish Executive Health Department then commissioned a review to report on what changes had been made. The aims of the review were:</p>

  <p>To affirm the Executive&rsquo;s commitment to meeting the needs of people with these conditions.</p>

  <p>To raise awareness of these conditions at a strategic level.</p>

  <p>To examine what progress had been made since the SNAP report.</p>

  <p>To summarise key issues.</p>

  <p>Following receipt of the review report the Chief Medical Officer wrote, in July 2003, to chief executives of NHS boards and NHS trusts, Directors of Public Health and of Social Work and a number of other bodies including the Scottish Head Injury Forum and Alzheimer Scotland drawing attention to the key areas still to be addressed in promoting best practice. A full copy of the review report has been made available to any respondents who requested it. It is therefore already in the public domain and a copy has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre.</p>

  <p>The Tenth Report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, <em>Getting the Balance Right: Implementing Standards of Conduct in Public Life</em> , was submitted to the Prime Minister on 19 January 2005 and the UK Government will respond in due course. The Scottish Executive provided the committee with evidence on the Scottish situation with regards to certain areas of ethical standards and public appointments which are devolved areas. We intend to monitor the developments and will consider what, if any, action need be taken by the Scottish Executive. It should be noted that there were no recommendations made to the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>To date, extra-parliamentary representations regarding progress on a Vulnerable Adults Bill have been received from a range of organisations and individuals, and as a result of the Help the Aged&rsquo;s New Years Resolution campaign.</p>

  <p>We will take all such representations into account as we develop our legislative proposals.</p>

  <p>The shooting of birds or animals is not recognised by the Sports Councils in the UK as a sport.</p>

  <p>The shooting of wild animals or birds will be outside the scope of the new Animal Welfare Legislation which we hope to introduce to Parliament in September.</p>

  <p>This matter has been considered. As it is not foreseeable that the SPCB would ever be responsible for another project of this magnitude and significance it was thought unlikely that wider powers in this respect would be needed. This decision was intimated to the Convener of the Finance Committee in my letter of 24 February.</p>

  <p>The SPCB has no plans to initiate a debate on this matter in the Parliament.</p>
