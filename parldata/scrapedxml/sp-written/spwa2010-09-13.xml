  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive which cancers are not audited for the purpose of determining whether they meet the cancer waiting times targets, broken down by (a) regional cancer network and (b) NHS board.</p>

  <p>In answer to this question we will note which cancers are audited. There are no regional or NHS board differences, so the following are valid across NHSScotland. All monitoring is for new diagnoses only, not recurrent disease. The cohorts are applicable for patients treated from 1 July 2010.</p>

  <p>There are three different cohorts monitored against cancer waiting times targets:</p>

  <p>1. All patients with a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia or acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, biphenotypic or bilineal acute leukaemia are audited against a target of one month (31 days) from referral to treatment.</p>

  <p>2. All patients aged under 16 diagnosed with cancer (ICD-10 C00-C96, excluding C44 M-809 (basal cell carcinoma)) are audited against a target of one month (31 days) from referral to treatment.</p>

  <p>3. The following cancer types are monitored against the two targets announced in <em>Better Cancer Care</em>, namely 62 days from urgent referral with a suspicion of cancer to first treatment and 31 days from decision to treat to treatment:</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-30747 on 25 February 2010. The latest cost to date of the core programme of Scottish Government National Conversation events and publications, including branding and staging, remains around &pound;400,000. We do not hold the costs broken down into the categories requested.</p>

  <p>The total cost of printing and publication of the draft Referendum Bill consultation was around &pound;8,000. This figure includes a Gaelic and a British Sign Language translation.</p>

  <p>The member will also be aware of the published costs of approximately &pound;625,000 incurred by the UK Government and the Scottish Parliament to support the work of the Commission on Scottish Devolution.</p>

  <p>I have asked John Ewing, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service, to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Both HMP Kilmarnock and HMP Addiewell contribute to the reduction of re-offending by offering a range of programmes aimed at reducing offending by prisoners. At Kilmarnock this is based on a more traditional industrial and occupational model, whereas Addiewell provides a more educational based regime, operating as a learning prison with all purposeful activity designed to have a learning element.</p>

  <p>We can confirm that there will be consultation on the revisions to the Ayrshire and Inverclyde rail passenger timetables, brought about as a consequence of the additional capacity arising from the Paisley Corridor Improvements project. This process has not yet commenced although it is envisaged that this will happen late autumn 2010 to enable implementation during the course of the winter 2011 timetable revision. As you will be aware there is a requirement for timetable options to have been worked up to a sufficient level of detail to demonstrate that they are: operationally and economically viable; and in the case of timetables for the ScotRail franchise, that they accord with the wider aspirations of the Scottish Government in delivering its overarching purpose, to increase sustainable economic growth, before they are taken to consultation.</p>

  <p>The consultation process referred to is the standard industry process related to the development and implementation of changes / revisions to passenger rail services. As is industry practice the consultation will involve key industry stakeholders (e.g. Network Rail, Regional Transport Partnerships (RTP) etc) and rail user groups (e.g. Passenger Focus). These stakeholders do have the rail user&rsquo;s interests at the foremost of their minds and due to their composition, e.g. as RTPs have local councillors sitting on their various committees, they are generally seen as representing the views of local constituents.</p>

  <p>No. The Glasgow Airport Rail Link Act (2007) authorises the construction and subsequent maintenance of certain specified &quot;authorised works&quot; associated with railway infrastructure.

  <p>Works on the PCI project continue on schedule and budget. Key delivery milestones which have been reached are:</p>

  <p>1. The commissioning and bringing in to use of two new platforms (platforms 12 and 13) at Glasgow Central Station in May 2010. The introduction of these two new platforms had an immediate positive impact upon reliability and capacity at what is Scotland&rsquo;s busiest railway station.</p>

  <p>The PCI project is being delivered by Network Rail Infrastructure Limited in accordance with the rights and obligations conferred by the Glasgow Airport Rail Link Act (2007) and its supporting documentation.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland has no plans to change the Act, any proposed changes being a matter for the Parliament.</p>

  <p>However, for clarification, should there at any time in the future be a change to the Act or its supporting documents, e.g. Code of Construction Practice (CoCP), then the cost and schedule implications on the PCI project would be considered and quantified under the Office of Rail Regulations &quot;Change Control Process&quot;. Noting that in the case of the CoCP, the Act sets out at Schedule 9, the mechanism by which that document may be amended from time to time.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will provide greater detail on the likely capacity of the third Paisley Corridor Improvement (PCI) track, in light of claims that it is likely to have an extra four trains per hour in comparison with the original Glasgow Airport Rail Link&rsquo;s (GARL) proposal of an extra six trains per hour.</p>

  <p>The original proposal for the GARL passenger service, as envisaged in the &quot;Glasgow Airport Rail Link Bill - Promoters Memorandum&quot; was as follows:</p>

  <p>DETAILS OF THE PROPOSED SCHEME</p>

  <p>14. The proposed scheme is shown schematically in Figure 1. The scheme (referred to hereafter as GARL) will provide a new rail service between Glasgow Central Station and a new station to be provided at Glasgow Airport. This will allow air passengers, airport employees and other travellers to reach the airport in a fast (16 minute journey time), frequent (4 trains per hour), reliable, high capacity and modern service. It will bring the airport within 1 interchange stop of 143 rail stations in west Scotland and via Glasgow Central and Paisley Gilmour Street bring the benefit of good airport accessibility and related economic benefit to the whole region.</p>

  <p>The winter 2011 timetable revisions resulting from the West of Scotland railway investment programme, which includes the PCI project, will future proof the Paisley corridor in terms of capacity provision. The extent to which that additional capacity will be utilised incrementally over the coming years forms part of the current timetable development activity.</p>

  <p>The provision of rail passenger services in Scotland is regulated by UK and European legislation. A primary aim of the legislation is to ensure that the right to provide such services is open to competition. Scottish Ministers as franchising authority must therefore invite tenders under the UK Railways Act 1993.</p>

  <p>That Act prevents a range of public bodies, including Scottish Ministers and their Executive Agency Transport Scotland, from being the franchisee and also prevents such bodies operating the franchise through a company controlled by them.</p>

  <p>Section 30 of the Railways Act makes Scottish Ministers responsible for securing ScotRail services in the absence of a franchisee, until a replacement can be secured.</p>
