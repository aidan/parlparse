<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-02-12.2.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80396" speakername="Nicola Sturgeon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa0212.htm#1">

  <p>The staff in post table in the nursing and midwifery section of the Workforce Statistics website at <a href="http://www.isdscotland.org/workforce" target="_blank">www.isdscotland.org/workforce</a> gives the whole-time equivalent (WTE) and head count of school nurses employed in NHS Scotland by NHS board and region and by agenda for change band. Information is not available at local authority area level. WTE adjusts headcount to take account of part time working. Latest available data is at 30 September 2007.</p>

  <p>(Our intention is that those school aged children and young people in areas of greatest need will in the future have improved access to a wider range of nursing and other health care support. A health care model targeted at deprived and other areas with high numbers of disadvantaged children will be developed in 2008.)</p>

  <p>Details of the number of interception warrants issued by the Scottish ministers are contained in the Interception of Communications Commissioner&rsquo;s annual reports, which are laid before this Parliament.

  <p>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The review undertaken by the Scottish Prison Service will be in two parts. It will consider the individual circumstances of the decision to transfer Robert Foye to the SPS Open Estate and allow his access to the community, and it will review the operation of the open prison estate, its role and the process of transferring prisoners there from closed prisons.</p>

  <p>The review will be carried out by members of staff from the Partnerships and Commissioning Directorate of the Scottish Prison Service and not those who are already involved in the management of the open estate or the transfer of prisoners to it.</p>
