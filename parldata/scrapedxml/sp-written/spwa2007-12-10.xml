  <p>The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) is the sole public prosecution authority in Scotland. It is for the Procurator Fiscal to decide, in the public interest, on the appropriate summary court where prosecution in court is merited.

  <p>The Scottish Government will be providing local government in Scotland with record levels of funding over the period covered by the spending review 2008-11. The vast majority of the funding, including the element from the Violence Against Women Fund will be provided by means of a block grant. It is the responsibility of each local authority to allocate the total financial resources available to it on the basis of local needs and priorities having first fulfilled its statutory obligations and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities including the Scottish Government&rsquo;s key strategic objectives and manifesto commitments.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is continually looking to see how it can improve what is done to address domestic abuse in Scotland. We recognise that there is under-reporting of incidents of domestic abuse. The increase in reported incidents of domestic abuse may be attributed to more people recognising that all forms of domestic abuse are wrong and reporting such incidents to the police.</p>

  <p>The rise in the number of reported incidents may also be attributed to the highly successful publicity campaign, which runs annually from 26 December until the end of January, evaluation of which has shown that over 78% of the population have seen or heard of the campaign. The campaign will run again this year.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s strategic approach to domestic abuse focuses around the themes of protection, prevention and provision. All three themes contribute not only to stopping abuse occurring but also to tackling repeat incidents. We will continue with this approach in the coming period.</p>

  <p>It is widely acknowledged that many incidents of domestic abuse go unreported to the police. There are a number of reasons for this, for example, victims experience fear and shame as common effects of domestic abuse. In addition, under reporting may also be caused by a perpetrator physically preventing a victim reporting the domestic abuse. A priority for the Scottish Government is to ensure the interests and needs of victims are central to the way the criminal justice system responds to crime.</p>

  <p>There has been a rise in the number of incidents being reported to the police, and this may be attributed to the highly successful publicity campaign, which runs annually from 26 December until the end of January, evaluation of which has shown that over 78% of the population have seen or heard of the campaign. The campaign will run again this year.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to tackling domestic abuse and ensuring that those affected by it are given the support they need and those perpetrating it are dealt with effectively. It will continue to look at how it can improve what it does to address domestic abuse.</p>

  <p>The increase in the number of domestic abuse incidents involving an ex-spouse or ex-partner mirror the overall increase in reporting. This increase may be attributed to more people recognising that all forms of domestic abuse are wrong and reporting such incidents to the police.</p>

  <p>The rise in the number of reported incidents may also be attributed to the highly successful publicity campaign, which runs annually from 26 December until the end of January, evaluation of which has shown that over 78% of the population have seen or heard of the campaign. The campaign will run again this year.</p>

  <p>When an initial evaluation of the Protection from Abuse (Scotland) Act 2001 was carried out in 2003, it was found that the act had been successful in increasing access to powers of arrest. In 2005 the then Executive wrote to over 180 organisations to remind them of the various legal provisions in Scotland designed to protect against abuse. In addition to this, during the engagement with key stakeholders during the passage of the Family Law (Scotland) Bill it was identified that solicitors were familiar with the 2001 Act. The Law Society of Scotland said in its written evidence to the Justice 1 Committee that the 2001 Act &quot;is the principal piece of legislation containing powers of arrest and is most widely used&quot;.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive why it listed the Children&rsquo;s Services &ndash; Women&rsquo;s Aid Fund and the Violence Against Women Fund on page 75 of <em>Scottish Budget: Spending Review 2007</em> as being rolled up into settlement in 2008-09 if these funds are not to be rolled up into the local government settlement.</p>

  <p>The budget document listed the Violence against Women Fund and the Children&rsquo;s Services Women&rsquo;s Aid Fund but did not clarify that it was only an element of these funds which was being rolled into the local government settlement. However, the Minister for Communities and Sport made clear to Parliament on 22 November 2007 that only an element of the Violence Against Women Fund and the Children&rsquo;s Services Women&rsquo;s Aid Fund is to be rolled up into the local government settlement.</p>

  <p>Under the concordat agreed between Scottish ministers and COSLA, an element of the funding ring-fenced in the Violence Against Women Fund and Children&rsquo;s Services Women&rsquo;s Aid Fund will from 1 April 2008, be absorbed into the main local government settlement.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will be providing local government in Scotland with record levels of funding over the period covered by the spending review 2008-11. The vast majority of the funding, including the element from the Children&rsquo;s Services Women&rsquo;s Aid Fund and Violence Against Women Fund will be provided by means of a block grant. It is the responsibility of each local authority to allocate the total financial resources available to it on the basis of local needs and priorities having first fulfilled its statutory obligations and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities including the Scottish Government&rsquo;s key strategic objectives and manifesto commitments.</p>

  <p>We are monitoring the effectiveness of current regulations and how they can contribute to safer and stronger communities. Although there was an encouraging reduction of 26.5% in the number of fireworks or bonfire related incidents reported to the police this year during the seven weeks around 5 November 2007, to the lowest figure since records were first collected in 2002, it is too soon to decide if further controls are required. If we feel the regulations are not as effective as we would wish, then we will of course look at what further measures might be required.</p>

  <p>As a result of this year&rsquo;s Spending Review, SEPA will receive additional Grant in Aid provision of &pound;19.8 million over the period 2008-09 to 2010-11. This settlement reflects the Scottish Government&rsquo;s acknowledgement of the range of unavoidable new duties, including responsibilities flowing from implementation of the EU Floods Directive that will fall to the organisation over the spending review period.

  <p>Funding allocations to the 14 territorial health boards for the provision of Hospital and Community Services and GP prescribing are currently based on shares calculated through the Arbuthnott formula, and this will continue for at least the first year of the next three-year spending review period. This formula includes an adjustment for the additional needs for healthcare associated with &quot;morbidity and life circumstances&quot; &ndash; reflecting the greater healthcare needs of disadvantaged areas. Progress towards achieving the full Arbuthnott targets will increasingly result in shares which take account of these additional needs. A number of further healthcare resources are allocated on the basis of different funding formulae, ensuring that specific funds are directed to the appropriate target populations. Many of these are therefore targeted specifically at disadvantaged areas. This approach will continue throughout the next three-year spending review period.</p>

  <p>The Arbuthnott formula has been reviewed by the NHSScotland Resource Allocation Committee (NRAC). The NRAC recommendations propose adjustments to the Morbidity and Life Circumstances element of the formula which they believe will more accurately reflect the increased need for health care services in areas of deprivation and poor underlying health, taking account of different patterns of need in different service areas. I am currently considering the committee&rsquo;s recommendations, along with the views of NHS boards and the Health and Sport Committee. Any change to health board allocation formula resulting from my decision will not take effect until 2009-10 at the earliest.</p>

  <p>Yes. During the last year, including under the previous administration, the Scottish Government has received representations about the future of the Janny&rsquo;s Hoose Healthy Living Centre in Inverness.</p>

  <p>Community health initiatives, such as healthy living centres, can play a vital role in complementing public services, through effective approaches to improving people&rsquo;s health in hard-to-reach communities. The Scottish Government provides funding to health boards and local government to support local services. It is then a matter for boards and local authorities to determine their local priorities.</p>

  <p>The Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing wrote to the chairs of the territorial health boards on 25 November 2007 asking them to consider the importance of community health initiatives in their area and what support can be offered to ensure that valued activities for health improvement in the community are not lost.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is currently implementing the December 2006 recommendations from the Community-led Supporting and Developing Healthy Communities Task Group. This will deliver a range of measures designed to improve access for community-led and voluntary bodies to skills and advice to enable them to improve delivery of services, to demonstrate effectiveness in improving health and to work better with funders in meeting the needs of the communities served. Tailored local support will bring funders and service providers together to enable better joint working in the future.</p>

  <p>The LIFT initiative &ndash; our Low-cost Initiative for First-Time buyers &ndash; is a key part of the package of measures to revitalise Scotland&rsquo;s housing set out in the <em>Firm Foundations</em> discussion document published on 31 October 2007.</p>

  <p>LIFT currently includes a mix of government grants to private developers, Registered Social Landlords and individuals to support a range of low cost home ownership schemes, particularly shared equity. However, through the <em>Firm Foundations</em> consultation process, we are seeking views on other potential measures which could be incorporated within LIFT. The number of households in both West and East Dunbartonshire who will be eligible to apply for support through LIFT will therefore depend on LIFT&rsquo;s future composition. At this stage it would be difficult to estimate how many applications will be successful. However, under existing LIFT schemes, we aim to assist at least 1,800 households in to home ownership this year.</p>

  <p>East Dunbartonshire Council, as the strategic housing authority for Bearsden and Milngavie, has statutory responsibility for assessing and addressing local housing market needs, including shortages of affordable housing in the area. In its most recent housing needs assessment (2005) it identified an annual need for an additional 79 affordable units in Bearsden and eight in Milngavie over the next five years to 2010.</p>

  <p>In our recently published discussion document, <em>Firm Foundations: the Future of Housing in Scotland</em> we have set out proposals for improving the supply and choice of affordable housing nationally. Last month&rsquo;s Spending Review announcement set out plans to invest over &pound;1.5 billion in affordable housing over the next three years. The Scottish Government expects that this increased budget will deliver more new affordable homes &ndash; including social rented houses and houses for low cost home ownership &ndash; than planned for 2005-08. Decisions have yet to be taken on the detailed composition of the affordable housing investment programme for the new spending review period, 2008-11.</p>

  <p>It is incorrect to say that funding for affordable housing is no longer ring-fenced. Table 21.03 of the Scottish Budget document published on 14 November 2007 shows the affordable housing budget for the years 2008-11. In addition, there is a further &pound;119.1 million a year for affordable housing which is ring-fenced in the local government budget.</p>

  <p>In total, the spending plans for affordable housing over the period 2008-11 are 19% higher than the spending plans for the period 2005-08. With the additional funding provided as a result of the Spending Review, we expect to approve over the period 2008-11 more new affordable houses than will be approved over the period 2005-08. Precisely how many more will depend on how the social housing sector responds to the proposals in our discussion document, <em>Firm Foundations: the future of housing in Scotland</em>, for achieving better value from available public expenditure.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the time bar of 1964 will still apply to any further proceedings being taken in connection with cases of historical institutional abuse in the care sector, following the publication of <em>Historical Abuse Systemic Review: Residential Schools and Children&rsquo;s Homes in Scotland 1950 to 1995</em> .</p>

  <p>The <em>Historical Abuse Systemic Review: Residential Schools and Children&rsquo;s Homes in Scotland 1950 to 1995</em> does not affect the law on damages. The Scottish Law Commission (SLC) Report on Personal Injury Actions: Limitation and Prescribed Claims was published on 5 December. The report recommends, amongst other things, that claims in respect of a personal injury extinguished by negative prescription before 1984 (i.e. claims relating to events alleged to have taken place prior to 26 September 1964) should not be revived and that a special category in respect of personal injury resulting from childhood institutional abuse should not be created. The Scottish Government is currently considering all the recommendations contained in the commission&rsquo;s report. Ministers are very sympathetic to survivors of historic in-care/institutional childhood abuse and, as well as considering the recommendations in the SLC Report, specific proposals for survivors of historic in-care and institutional abuse are being developed as part of the wider Survivor Scotland Strategy.</p>

  <p>There has been no target date set for the conclusion of the implementation of Agenda for Change pay. However, I can confirm that health boards are very close to completing this process, with around 18,000 of the 140,000 plus substantive staff across NHSScotland still waiting to assimilate to the new pay bands. A substantial number of these staff are actually in receipt of their job evaluation outcome, and therefore know which of the pay bands they will be moving to.</p>

  <p>Health boards are aware of the need to conclude assimilation as quickly and effectively as possible, and progress towards this continues to be monitored and supported by the Scottish Government.</p>

  <p>We are currently in the early stages of gathering data on the number of job evaluation review requests which have been received by health boards. Initial indications are that approximately 20% members of staff are seeking a review of their Agenda for Change job evaluation outcome across NHSScotland. The information held centrally does not break this down by health board or profession.</p>

  <p>Of the reviews processed to date 14% have resulted in post holders being awarded a higher band while in 85% of cases the initial decision was found to have been correct. 1% of cases were re-directed to another Agenda for Change process related to job evaluation and are currently under further consideration.</p>

  <p>Lower Nithsdale NVZ was designated following a risk assessment undertaken by the British Geological Survey (BGS) and the Macaulay Land Use Research Institute in 2001-02. Groundwater sites in the Nith Valley were reported by BGS in 2002 and again in 2004. Designation of the NVZs must be reviewed at least every four years.

  <p>The level of teacher involvement required in pre-school education will depend on the characteristics of each individual centre. Different models of teacher involvement, including peripatetic teachers, may be appropriate depending on the type of centre and the way it operates.</p>

  <p>We will be developing guidance in partnership with local government on the deployment of teachers in pre-school education.</p>

  <p>The number of teachers required to provide every pre-school child with access to a teacher will depend on the way in which teachers are deployed. The concordat with COSLA includes an agreement to give every pre-school child access to a teacher as soon as possible. We are working with partners in local government to take forward this commitment. We expect to have 20,000 teachers in training between 2007-11 as support to workforce requirements, class size reductions and teachers for nursery age children.</p>

  <p>There have been no new non-departmental public bodies set up since May 2007. The VAT status of a public body is set out in the VAT Act 1994 and is dependent on a bodies legal status. When setting up any body, the ability of that body to carry out its functions to the best of their ability, and not VAT implications is the overriding factor in deciding on its status. So there is no question of any public body losing their ability to reclaim VAT since May 2007 - nor is there value in reviewing their individual status.</p>

  <p>In view of the very tight spending review settlement from the UK Government the degree of flexibility available to us will be much less than in the past.
