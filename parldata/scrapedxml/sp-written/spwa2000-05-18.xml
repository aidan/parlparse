  <p>- to release mid-year population estimates for 2001 based on the 2001 Census by August 2002;</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive fully recognises the crucial role parents can play in cultivating their children&#8217;s skills, knowledge and enthusiasm for books and reading. At the pre-school stage, the Framework for Curriculum 3-5 encourages parents to assist in their children's learning through play by participating in sessions at their child's pre-school centre or helping with their learning at home.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&#8217;s Early Intervention Programme to raise standards of literacy and numeracy in the early years of primary school also assists local authorities to involve parents in developing their children&#8217;s abilities in reading and other literacy skills.</p>

  <p>The only previously existing Nitrate Vulnerable Zone (NVZ) in Scotland, at Balmalcolm in Fife, was designated during 1996 on the basis of criteria set out at Annex IA(2) of the EC Nitrates Directive. Nitrate concentrations from water samples taken from the borehole at Balmalcolm indicated pollution in excess of the levels permitted by the Directive. Studies demonstrated that agriculture was the principal source of the nitrates. The boundaries of the NVZ were defined as the source catchment of the groundwater which was determined by modelling and the study of relevant hydrological features.</p>

  <p>The Ythan Nitrate Vulnerable Zone has been designated on the basis of criteria set out at Annex IA(3) of the EC Nitrates Directive(91/676/EEC) i.e. that the estuary is eutrophic, or in the near future may become eutrophic.</p>

  <p>During its 1997 review of eutrophic waters, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) concluded that the Ythan estuary met three of the criteria for eutrophication set out in guidance issued by the Scottish Office to regulatory authorities on assessing the eutrophic status of estuaries and coastal waters. These included changes in macrophyte growth, changes in fauna, and elevated nitrate concentrations.</p>

  <p>SEPA also supported the conclusion of its predecessor body, the North East River Purification Board, that agriculture is the main source of nitrate pollution in the Ythan catchment. In these circumstances, Article 3 of the Directive requires all known areas of land which drain into the estuary to be designated as a vulnerable zone.</p>

  <p>Additional evidence of high levels of nitrate in the surface waters of the Ythan catchment was reported by SEPA in 1999.</p>

  <p>Waters are assessed by the Scottish Executive against criteria in the EC Nitrates Directive (91/676/EEC). Article 3(1) of the Directive requires waters affected by pollution, and waters which could be affected by pollution if action pursuant to Article 5 is not taken, to be identified in accordance with criteria set out in Annex I. The criteria are:</p>

  <p>1. Whether surface freshwaters, in particular those used or intended for the abstraction of drinking waters, contain or could contain, if action pursuant to Article 5 of the Directive is not taken, more than the concentration of nitrates laid down in accordance with the Drinking Waters Directive (75/440/EEC);</p>

  <p>2. Whether groundwaters contain more than 50mg/litre nitrates or could contain more than 50mg/litre nitrates if action pursuant to Article 5 is not taken; and</p>

  <p>3. Whether natural freshwater lakes, other freshwater bodies, estuaries, coastal waters and marine waters are found to be eutrophic or in the near future may become eutrophic if action pursuant to Article 5 is not taken.</p>

  <p>The Directive requires member states in applying these criteria to take into account:</p>

  <p>1. The physical and environmental characteristics of waters and land;</p>

  <p>2. The current understanding of the behaviour of nitrogen compounds in the environment (water and soil); and</p>

  <p>3. The current understanding of the impact of the action taken pursuant to Article 5.</p>

  <p>Article 3(2) requires all areas of land which drain into such waters to be designated as vulnerable zones.</p>

  <p>I sympathise with those affected by last month&#8217;s flooding and acknowledge the part played by the local authorities and emergency services in assisting those affected by flooding.</p>

  <p>Local authorities have a duty to meet the needs of local communities in emergency situations. Ministers may activate the Bellwin Scheme to meet councils&#8217; relevant revenue costs in alleviating the immediate after-effects of an emergency situation. Only Edinburgh City Council have made any approaches to the Executive on this to date.</p>

  <p>The repair or replacement of damage to property is a matter for the owners concerned, and their insurers, not the Executive. The level of insurance cover that property holders arrange is a decision that only they can take.</p>

  <p>An impact of climate change is likely to be increased rainfall and storminess which may lead to increasing flood risk. The Executive has recently commissioned research to consider effects of climate change on flooding occurrences and flood prevention design standards.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, flood prevention in general is a matter which Scottish Ministers have given and are continuing to give a high priority. Addressing flooding concerns will require action to be taken by all the interests involved including the Executive.</p>

  <p>We are making good progress. There has been an excellent response to the Executive&#8217;s consultation document <i>An Open</i> <i>Scotland</i> published last year. Most respondents welcomed the general thrust of the proposals. We will be considering carefully the points raised as we prepare a draft Bill.</p>

  <p>A copy of all of the responses received has been placed in SPICe and on open access in the Executive&#8217;s library. A summary of the responses will be published next week.</p>

  <p>The Chancellor&#8217;s announcement referred to spending plans for health, education, justice and transport. However the Executive has raised this year&#8217;s budget for the Warm Deal to &pound;13 million, &pound;1 million more than last year. About &pound;210 million will also be spent on improving and repairing local authority stock and we plan to spend &pound;214 million on New Housing Partnerships. These substantial resources, together with the new Winter Fuel Payment of &pound;150, will make a real impact on fuel poverty in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Yes. The White Paper, <i>Towards a Healthier Scotland</i> , sets out the principal strategy being pursued by the Scottish Executive to achieve better health and life expectancy for all Scots. An additional &pound;26 million, drawn from this year&#8217;s budget increases in tobacco taxation are being allocated, exclusively, to taking forward the Executive&#8217;s health improvement agenda in 2000-01.</p>

  <p>Existing safeguards around the prescribing of drugs, including appetite suppressants, apply equally wherever prescribing takes place. Only a doctor registered with the General Medical Council may prescribe appetite suppressant drugs. Where there is a question over the integrity or competence of any doctor, disciplinary action could be taken through the disciplinary committees of the council. In addition, the Medicines Control Agency is responsible for the enforcement of medicines legislation throughout the UK.</p>

  <p>Where a clinic was providing more complicated treatments which involved, for example, invasive procedures, the administration of anaesthetics etc., the clinic would require to be registered as a private hospital under the Nursing Homes Registration (Scotland) Act 1938 and clearly those performing these procedures etc would have to be registered with the appropriate professional body.</p>

  <p>Note: Although the current local authorities were not in existence until April 1996, the numbers of sales which took place before then have been assigned to the new areas. Where an old district became divided between more than one new local authority area, population figures for new and old areas at 1996 were used to allocate the sales to the relevant areas on a pro-rata basis. For some areas, therefore, the figures are estimates only.</p>

  <p>In response to bids from councils, the New Housing Partnerships Steering Group recommended the earmarking of resources for councils which are considering or progressing stock transfer proposals. The group's decisions were set out in the February 1999 Report of the NHP Steering Group, a copy of which has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre. I am not aware of any council progressing its proposals without the appropriate approval. However, any council can launch stock transfer proposals without NHP funding.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what impact the reduced availability of private sector housing grants within Highland Council area has had upon the quantity of stock in that sector and how many houses it estimates would have received grants had the total sum spent been maintained in real terms at the 1995-96 level in each subsequent year.</p>

  <p>The vast majority of private sector grants are for the improvement or repair of existing houses. It is therefore unlikely that their availability has much bearing on the quantity of stock in the private sector. The amount of grant payable depends on the nature of the works and so can vary considerably between cases. It is therefore not possible to make an estimate of grants which Highland Council might have awarded since 1 April 1996 had the budget for the years concerned been as described.</p>

  <p>This is a very technical and complex case and sufficient time will be required to give full and proper consideration to the report of the public local inquiry. The conclusions of the Scottish Executive will, however, be made known to parties as soon as is reasonably practicable.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-4698 by Mr Jack McConnell on 14 April 2000, what locations are being considered for the relocated offices of the Local Boundary Commission for Scotland and how it will ensure that this relocation meets its policy objectives set out in the answer to question S1W-1555 on 15 September 1999.</p>

  <p>The last Policy and Financial Management Review (PMFR) of the Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland (LGBC) took place in 1995 and the recommendation that it be relocated to premises of its own was implemented that same year. The lease on the LGBC&#8217;s premises at 3 Drumsheugh Gardens, Edinburgh is not due for renewal until February 2004 but at that point consideration will be given to the merits of a further relocation in the context of the relocation policy for the Scottish Executive and its agencies prevailing at that time.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what targets have been set for the implementation of Agenda 21 strategies by local authorities and how the progress of such strategies is being monitored.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-05-18.S1O-1733.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80134" speakername="Sarah Boyack" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa0518.htm#1733">

  <p>In June 1997, at the UN General Assembly in New York, the Prime Minister challenged every local authority to have a Local Agenda 21 strategy by the end of the year 2000. LA 21 was established at the Rio Summit in 1992 as a programme for local authorities. Setting LA21 targets therefore is a matter for each council.</p>

  <p>Scottish councils are making a strong effort to meet the Prime Minister&#8217;s challenge. A survey by CoSLA in February 2000 showed that 26 councils intend to adopt a strategy by December, and two have already so done. The others are at varying stages of development. Monitoring is carried out by CoSLA and the Scottish Executive provides &pound;60,000 per year to fund a LA21 adviser at CoSLA.</p>

  <p>Scottish observers on the main working group and the children's group have reported informally that good progress continues to be made on both groups. Progress briefings are available on the Department of Health website at www.doh.gov.uk/cfs-me.htm.</p>

  <p>Funding for a major research project to run in association with the group has been agreed by the Department of Health. The project will review all recently published research on CFS/ME, in the hope of pointing the way towards consensus on the causes and treatment of the condition. Because of the need to incorporate the findings of this project it is likely that the working group's final report, which was originally scheduled for autumn this year, will be delayed until 2001.</p>

  <p>The average waiting time for a cardiac operation under the NHS in the Greater Glasgow Health Board area for the year to 30 September 1999 was 122 days, the most up-to-date figure available based on the health board&#8217;s waiting list for that period. This covers all kinds of cardiac operation: individual types of operation have different average waiting times. Waiting times are not broken down into urgent and non-urgent categories: the service is responsive to clinical need and this means that a number of emergency and urgent cases are treated almost immediately and, therefore, do not appear on a waiting list.</p>

  <p>Information on waiting times for private cardiac treatment is a matter for those who provide such treatment.</p>

  <p>The project proposals outlined in Railtrack&#8217;s <i>2000 Network Management Statement</i> <i>for Scotland </i> will help inform the Scottish Executive&#8217;s consideration of the strategic priorities for the Scottish railway network. These priorities will underpin the directions and guidance that will be issued to the Strategic Rail Authority for the passenger services that begin and end in Scotland. The directions and guidance will not contain detailed prescription about infrastructure. It will be for the train operating company, in conjunction with Railtrack, to ensure the availability of the necessary infrastructure and rolling stock to meet the terms of the franchise.</p>

  <p>Individual infrastructure projects may of course be eligible for support from public resources, for instance from the Public Transport Fund or the Railway Passenger partnership fund. These funds have already assisted a number of rail projects in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Testing for chlamydial infection and other sexually transmitted infections is part of the appropriate clinical care of patients who present with relevant symptoms.</p>

  <p>My answer to question S1W-5086 by Kay Ullrich outlined developments in respect of sexual health services including detection. I can now confirm that the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network has issued clinical guidelines on the management of genital c<i>hlamydia trachomatis</i> infection. Testing should be offered to all Genito-urinary Medicine clinic attenders and all women undergoing termination of pregnancy. Testing should also be offered to all sexually active women under 25 years of age and considered for women over 25 with a new sexual partner or two or more partners in the past 12 months.</p>

  <p>Laboratories across the UK are moving towards the introduction of recently introduced molecular tests which are more accurate and more suitable for use in symptom-free individuals in the case of chlamydial infection. A wide range of laboratory tests are available for the diagnosis of other sexually-transmitted infections.</p>

These include formal professional qualifications, such as those in family planning, as well as opportunities for continuing professional development run by professional and education bodies and by the NHS.

  <p>- A number of Scottish universities provide short courses in sexual and reproductive health, which are available to qualified nurses. In addition, all district nurses and health visitors hold a specialist practitioner qualification in community practice and for health visitors in particular, this will include an element on sexual health.</p>

This training is available to all NHS pharmacists in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Guidance was issued to local authorities in July 1997 about the new police powers to confiscate alcohol from young people under 18 found drinking in public places introduced by the Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Act 1997. Local authorities also received the promotional briefing pack covering the new powers.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) has recently carried out consultation about the proposed modification to licence conditions for Paterson&#8217;s landfill site with statutory consultees, local community councils and members of the public who have shown concern.</p>

  <p>Licensing is a regulatory matter and is therefore for SEPA. As Scottish Ministers could become involved at a later stage, should an appeal be lodged about the licence conditions, it is not appropriate for me to comment on the details.<br /></p>
