  <p>We regularly meet the alcohol industry to discuss rebalancing Scotland&rsquo;s relationship with alcohol and have had constructive discussions with a wide range of producers and retailers. That process will continue through the Scottish Government Alcohol Industry Partnership and through other meetings and events. However, as made clear in our discussion document, any minimum price would be set independently of those connected either directly or indirectly with the manufacture, supply or distribution of alcohol products or any other connected activity.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive for what reasons the example minimum unit price of alcohol of 35p is identified in its discussion paper on its alcohol strategy; what evidence it can provide on how this figure was reached, and what impact this price would have on alcohol harm.</p>

  <p>The example minimum unit price of alcohol used in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s discussion paper was an illustrative figure only. As stated in the discussion paper, this figure is lower than the off-sales average price and would impact most on those products priced low relative to their strength. Further work would be needed assess the potential impact of different minimum prices before firm proposals were brought forward.</p>

  <p>Various studies have been carried out on the pricing of alcohol and its misuse, some of which are referenced in the discussion paper. Given the link between consumption and harm and the evidence that affordability is one of the drivers of increased consumption, addressing price is an essential component of any long-term strategic approach to tackling alcohol misuse.</p>

  <p>Section 49(2) of the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006 defines an &quot;inspector&quot; in the context of any particular provision under part 2 of the act (the animal welfare part) as a person:</p>

  <p>(a) appointed as an inspector by the Scottish ministers, or authorised by them, for the purpose of the provision, or</p>

  <p>(b) appointed as an inspector by a local authority for the purpose of the provision.</p>

  <p>Veterinary advisors employed by the Scottish Government are automatically appointed as inspectors under this section. Scottish ministers have appointed the veterinary staff of the Animal Health agency (formally the State Veterinary Service) as inspectors and have authorised named inspectors of the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Scottish SPCA) to be inspectors under the act. Local authorities appoint their Animal Health and Welfare Officers as inspectors under the provision of this section.</p>

  <p>Officials employed by the Animal Health agency and the Scottish SPCA are appointed or authorised as inspectors on an individual basis, rather than the organisations being designated as an inspection agency. Local authorities have the power to appoint their own inspectors.</p>

  <p>We have no plans to extend the authorisation to individuals employed by other organisations.</p>

  <p>Eligibility for the central heating programme inherited from the previous administration is laid down in the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme Regulations (HEES). The HEES regulations specify that it is pensioners who are eligible for the programme rather than people receiving disability-related benefits. From April 2009, the programme will be replaced with the Energy Assistance Package: a one-stop shop providing a holistic approach to tackling fuel poverty through benefits checks, energy tariff advice and physical energy efficiency measures. For the first time, low income families with a disabled child under 16 may be able to receive help beyond basic insulation measures. To implement this change, new regulations are being prepared which will be laid before Parliament in January.</p>

  <p>We are committed to ensuring that Scotland has a vibrant, confident fishing industry, which supports the communities dependant on this industry.</p>

  <p>Support is available under the European Fisheries Fund to organisations, such as fishing co-operatives to carry out projects of common interest whose scope is broader than that of private enterprises and which help meet the objectives of the common fisheries policy.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government opened the European Fisheries Fund for applications in September 2008.</p>

  <p>I wrote to stakeholders on 16 December providing an update on our plans for quota management and licensing in Scotland. This set out in broad terms our plans to have a phased implementation of quota and licensing arrangements in Scotland during 2009. A report summarising the views received to the consultation was also released at this time.</p>

  <p>Due to the focus on the very important year end fisheries negotiations, I considered it sensible to delay final decisions until early in 2009. An interim outcome of consultation report setting out the Scottish Government initial response to the consultation will be issued in January. Following a short period of consultation, measures to be adopted under a Scottish quota and licensing system will then be set out in a final outcome report.</p>

  <p>We issued revised guidance on 12 December 2008 to ensure that marketing is based on realistic valuations but also to enable properties which cannot be sold within a reasonable timescale to be converted to mid-market rent or social rent, rather than remain empty.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Federation of Housing Associations has welcomed this guidance saying:</p>

  <p>We are delighted that the Scottish Government has listened to our members concerns and revised guidance. A number of housing associations who have developed shared equity houses have experienced difficulties caused by the economic downturn. Our members have alerted us to the issues and an extremely productive meeting has led to this revised guidance.</p>

  <p>Scotland was largely compliant with the European Framework Decision on the Standing of Victims in Criminal Proceedings when it was promulgated. A detailed response to the framework decision, <em>Victims in the Scottish Criminal Justice System: The EU Framework Decision On The Standing Of Victims In Criminal Procedure, The Scottish Perspective</em> , was published in 2002. Further work was undertaken to ensure compliance with articles that did not need to be implemented until 2004.</p>

  <p>The European Commission has recently instigated research into compliance with the terms of the framework decision across the European Union and is currently expected to review the current framework decision in the light of the research findings.</p>

  <p>I have no plans to change the application processes at this stage, other than those proposals set out in <em>Revitalising Justice &ndash; Proposals to Modernise and Improve the Criminal Justice System</em> which to be contained in the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Bill. However, I am happy to consider any representations about how the application forms and processes might be improved following completion of the transition period. Any changes to forms after transition will need to maintain the balance between being relatively simple to complete and providing the licensing board with enough information to allow them to take a decision.</p>

  <p>Aberdeenshire, where the area is served by three licensing boards covering North; Central, and South Aberdeenshire.</p>

  <p>Highland, where the area is served by four licensing boards covering Ross, Skye and Lochaber; Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, and Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross.</p>
