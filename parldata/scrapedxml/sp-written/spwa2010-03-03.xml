  <p>The exact number of GP consultations that were directly connected with alcohol-related conditions in Scotland, is not available centrally. However, national estimates can be given based on the number of consultations there have been relating to alcohol abuse, from a sample of Scottish general practices participating in PTI (Practice Team Information).</p>

  <p>Based on PTI data, the estimated number of consultations with a GP for alcohol abuse in Scotland, during the financial year 2007-08, was 102,268. This equates to a rate of 19 per 1,000 registered patients.</p>

  <p>These figures are likely to considerably underestimate the true number of GP consultations</p>

  <p>connected with alcohol-related conditions in Scotland</p>

  <p>. The figures relate only to consultations with a</p>

  <p>GP where alcohol abuse was specifically recorded as an issue. Many other consultations may have been due to alcohol-related conditions even though alcohol abuse was not specifically recorded. Furthermore, other members of the practice team (such as nurses) will also see patients for alcohol-related problems.</p>

  <p>Information on estimated costs of consultations for alcohol-related conditions is not available centrally. Although figures on general practice expenditure are collected and published routinely, the data are not split down to provide a measure of costs associated with individual reasons for each GP consultation.</p>

  <p>Local authorities have a duty to commission community care services. They may provide these services themselves directly or they may commission care services in line with their local commissioning strategy. Where they commission, or provide directly, services of a type which is regulated under the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001, those services are required to be registered with the Care Commission. The commission inspects all registered services against the relevant statutory provisions and the National Care Standards in order to ensure that people using care services receive good quality care.</p>

  <p>Given the complexity of social care procurement, it is necessary to consider the desirability of national contracts and pricing frameworks on a case-by-case basis. The Scottish Government, COSLA and Scotland Excel (the procurement Centre of Expertise for local authorities) are working together to explore best practice in relation to social care contracts and pricing frameworks. Scotland Excel is currently consulting local authorities on the opportunities for joint commissioning of services.</p>

  <p>Decisions on the most appropriate treatment for individual clients are taken by clinicians who determine the most appropriate form of treatment, taking account of the needs and circumstances of each client. Their aim is to ensure that the treatment package will provide the most effective support for the individual concerned.</p>

  <p>The national drug strategy &ndash; The Road to Recovery - recognises the importance of providing person-centred care, support and treatment opportunities that suit individual choice and need. We are interested in evidence-based treatments and care approaches which benefit those with substance misuse problems. This is why the Scottish Government commissioned a National Drugs Evidence Review<em>, </em>on behalf of the National Drugs Evidence Group, whose role is to advise Scottish Ministers on the research and information priorities required to deliver the national drugs strategy.</p>

  <p>This is why the Scottish Government commissioned a National Drugs Evidence Review<em>, </em>on behalf of the National Drugs Evidence Group, whose role it is to advise Scottish ministers on the research and information priorities required to deliver the national drugs strategy. The purpose of this review is to assess the adequacy of the existing evidence base from Scotland and UK and internationally with a view to understanding more about &lsquo;what works&rsquo; for people in drugs recovery. This research will also identify gaps in existing knowledge and set out the priorities for addressing these.</p>

  <p>However, because drug users may experience various treatment types over the course of their recovery, it is not possible to say definitively, from the evidence available, that one type of treatment is more effective than another. Furthermore, because drug treatment should be tailored towards the needs of individuals, different treatment types may have very different client groups, for example, in terms of their experiences and their motivation to recover.</p>

  <p>It is well established that early intervention and treatment can be effective in preventing more serious alcohol problems developing in the first place. This is why the Scottish Government has invested record funding in alcohol support and treatment services and established a NHS target for the delivery of alcohol brief interventions and are introducing a NHS target to reduce drug and alcohol treatment service waiting times.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has established a working group, through the Scottish Ministerial Advisory Committee on Alcohol Problems (SMACAP), to update core services for alcohol treatment and support. This group is revisiting the principles underpinning the Alcohol Treatment Services Framework; identifying and updating effective interventions, and setting out guidance on development of integrated care pathways which take into consideration multiple and complex needs.</p>

  <p>The Essential Services working group will report at the end of the year.</p>

  <p>The <em>Scottish Alcohol Needs Assessment</em> (SANA) 2009 research report, which considered current provision of support and treatment services for alcohol, found that community and residential alcohol services provided a range of treatment interventions. Community services most commonly provided structured psychological/cognitive interventions, advice (including on abstinence), and brief interventions, while residential agencies provided residential rehabilitation (including detoxification) and inpatient treatment.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has established a working group, through the Scottish Ministerial Advisory Committee on Alcohol Problems (SMACAP), to update core services for alcohol treatment and support. This group is revisiting the principles underpinning the Alcohol Treatment Services Framework; identifying and updating effective interventions, and setting out guidance on development of integrated care pathways which take into consideration multiple and complex needs.</p>

Alcohol and Drug Partnerships (ADPs), supported by National Support Co-ordinators (NSCs), consider the evidence on effective interventions when commissioning services, and build in arrangements for assessing treatment outcomes.</p>

We are interested in evidence-based treatments and care approaches which benefit those with substance misuse problems. This is why the Scottish Government has commissioned a National Drugs Evidence Review<em>, </em>on behalf of the National Drugs Evidence Group, whose role it is to advise Scottish Ministers on the research and information priorities required to deliver the national drugs strategy.</p>

  <p>The purpose of this review is to assess the adequacy of the existing evidence base from Scotland, the UK and internationally with a view to understanding more about &quot;what works&quot; for people in drugs recovery. The research will also identify the gaps in existing knowledge and set out the priorities for addressing these.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s efforts to address the economic downturn and steer Scotland&rsquo;s economy towards recovery have evolved as the impacts of recession have unfolded.</p>

  <p>The <em>Scottish Economic Recovery Plan: Accelerating Recovery</em>, copies of which are available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 50311), sets out a comprehensive range of measures to accelerate economic recovery in Scotland. This includes development of a low carbon economy, supporting internationalisation, further improvements to the planning system, managing labour market pressures, a renewed focus on commercialisation, and improved access to finance.</p>

  <p>Shaped by discussions with key stakeholders, this latest update demonstrates the importance of alignment across the public sector to deliver a comprehensive range of measures to accelerate recovery. The plan continues to focus on the three key areas for recovery and sustainable economic growth: investing in innovation and industries of the future; strengthening education and skills, and supporting jobs and communities.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it plans to allow for legal representation of core participants, such as the family of the deceased, at fatal accident inquiries.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-03-03.S3W-31681.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80341" speakername="Kenny MacAskill" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa0303.htm#10">

  <p>Core participants can already be represented at fatal accident inquiries (FAI) and bereaved families may receive legal aid if they cannot afford to pay for that representation.</p>

  <p>The purpose of a fatal accident inquiry is to investigate the circumstances of death in the public interest - to try to avoid similar incidents in future.</p>

  <p>Procurators fiscal have a public duty to fulfil at the inquiry, including leading evidence to establish the cause of death. The fiscal will meet with the family to discuss the conduct of the FAI. They will inform the family as to the witnesses and evidence they intend to produce and what line of questioning they intend to pursue. Often the fiscal will ask the family if there are any particular questions or issues that they wish raised.</p>

  <p>In some circumstances, however, the families may have questions that the fiscal does not feel it would be appropriate to ask in the public interest. Families may wish to ask questions intended to establish whether there are grounds for civil proceedings following the fatal accident inquiry. In such cases the families may instruct their own legal representative.</p>

  <p>If the family cannot afford to pay for legal representation, they may be eligible to receive legal aid. The Scottish Legal Aid Board can make legal aid available where a person entitled to be represented at a fatal accident inquiry can show that they have concerns which the procurator fiscal is not going to raise at the Inquiry.</p>

  <p>Any application for legal aid will be subject to the usual statutory tests of financial eligibility, probable cause and reasonableness, that is, whether it is reasonable in the particular circumstances of the case that legal aid should be provided.</p>

  <p>Lord Cullen has recommended that relatives of the deceased should not have to justify the reasonableness of the granting of legal aid for their representation at the FAI and that Scottish Ministers should consider increasing the limit for legal aid in FAIs and the extent to which legal aid is available within that limit. Scottish Ministers will consider this proposal in conjunction with the Scottish Legal Aid Board.</p>

  <p>Under the existing legislation, sheriffs&rsquo; recommendations are not binding on the parties or bodies to whom they are directed and Lord Cullen has not recommended in his report that they should become binding or that they should have general application.</p>

  <p>Lord Cullen considered that to make it mandatory to comply with recommendations would carry significant disadvantages. He thought that it would introduce an adversarial element into the fatal accident inquiry (FAI), &quot;since a body which might be faced with a possible imposition of a duty would require notice and might well seek to contest it. Provision might have to be made for an appeal. These factors would make for an unwelcome addition to the length and complexity of the FAI. By the time that the sheriff came to the question of the imposition of a duty, circumstances might have so changed that an originally conceived duty was no longer appropriate&quot;.</p>

  <p>Lord Cullen also commented that &quot;The imposition of a duty [to comply with a recommendation] would be pointless without some form of sanction for non-compliance, and it was not clear what sanction would be practicable&quot;.</p>

  <p>Justice officials constructed a database in 2006 which recorded sheriffs&rsquo; recommendations from fatal accident inquiries (FAI), but not their entire determination (since to publish the details of the death may be distressing to relatives). The database recorded the cause of death, date of death and dates of when the inquiry started, even if there were no recommendations.</p>

  <p>The database also identified the body or party to whom a recommendation had been directed by the sheriff, including their contact details. The purpose of the database was to assist interested parties to contact those to whom recommendations had been addressed to find out what action had been taken in relation to compliance with those recommendations.</p>

  <p>The database was established because it was concluded that officials in justice and government generally have neither the resources nor the expertise to monitor whether recommendations have been complied with. Furthermore, it was considered that in many cases the recommendations from a particular FAI may have no general application, a point also noted by Lord Cullen.</p>

  <p>Lord Cullen has not recommended that the Scottish Government should begin to formally monitor implementation of recommendations made at a fatal accident inquiry. He suggested that when a recommendation is made by a sheriff, the entity or body to whom it is directed should be under a duty to make a written response to an appropriate department of the Scottish Government, within a period set by the sheriff, stating whether and to what extent it has implemented, or intends to implement, the recommendations or, if not, for what reason or reasons. This replicates the new arrangements under the system of coroners&rsquo; inquests in England and Wales under the Coroners and Justice Act 2009.</p>

  <p>Lord Cullen further recommended that the relevant department should publish an annual report of the recommendations and the responses to them. It would not, however, be responsible for ensuring compliance.</p>

  <p>The government is considering Lord Cullen&rsquo;s recommendation in this regard.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government believes that only full independence will offer the Scottish Government the widest set of fiscal and economic policy levers which would allow us to properly determine the best approach to the development and regulation of financial services in Scotland, including making decisions on which institution(s) should be involved in each of the main aspects of ensuring an efficiently functioning market, financial stability and consumer protection</p>

  <p>It is clear that although the importance of the financial system to national economies means that financial regulation will remain primarily a national issue - international and European rules are increasingly becoming more important in order to ensure a global response to the current financial crisis and the development of systems to help identify and mitigate these types of risk in the future.</p>

  <p>It is vital that Scotland is in a position to influence the development of measures to regulate systemic risk in the financial services sector, taking into account the continuing, and welcome, presence of major banks and wider financial services sector in Scotland.</p>

Historic Scotland has recently commenced a detailed evaluation of possible options in order to help support the eventual decision-making process. These options are: Managed Deconstruction of the vessel; Removal to Sunderland; Removal to Adelaide in South Australia, and Retention in a different location in Scotland. None of these options is straightforward, but by undertaking this exercise we will be able to take a fully informed and open decision as to the best outcome for the vessel.</p>

  <p>NHS Quality Improvement Scotland&rsquo;s (NHS QIS) Clinical Governance and Risk Management Standards include a requirement to ensure the dignity and privacy of patients is safeguarded at all times.

  <p>If for any particular reason a hospital cannot meet the guidelines, patients should be advised of this prior to admission, allowing them to choose to defer admission until suitable accommodation is available.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Data have been rounded to the nearest hundred.</p>

  <p>2. Estimates for 2005 and earlier are on a different basis to those from 2006 onwards, mainly due to a change in the survey reference date &ndash; this may give rise to discontinuities. More information is available from: <a href="https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/articles/news/files/ABI2006discontinuities.doc" target="_blank">https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/articles/news/files/ABI2006discontinuities.doc</a>.</p>

  <p>3. The data for 2003 onwards is based on the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) 2003 which differs from previous years Annual Business Inquiry data (based on SIC 1992) &ndash; this may give rise to discontinuities. More details are available from:</p>

  <p>These figures relate to direct jobs only. The representative body, Oil and Gas UK, estimate that in 2008 the industry supported around 195,000 jobs in Scotland. This comprised 24,500 directly employed by oil and gas companies, plus around 94,000 within the wider supply chain, with another 36,500 jobs supported by the economic activity induced by employees&rsquo; spending. In addition, export activities were estimated to support a further 40,000 jobs.</p>

  <p>In response to concerns about the sustainability and fairness of current and future care for older people in the face of financial and demographic pressures, a major work programme &ndash; Reshaping Care for Older People &ndash; is being taken forward in partnership with NHS Scotland and COSLA through the Ministerial Strategic Group on Health and Community Care.</p>

  <p>The programme aspires to develop practical ideas for change that are sufficiently radical to meet the changing needs of Scotland&rsquo;s population by enabling people to stay at home or in a homely setting, with maximum independence, for as long as possible. A key aim is to ensure that appropriate arrangements are in place to enable service providers to respond effectively to future demand for services. An Integrated Resource Framework is also being developed and tested across four sites in Scotland, from which evidence is being gathered about how resources can be used most effectively across health and social care.</p>

  <p>So far the programme has focussed on discussion with colleagues with a professional and clinical interest in delivering services for older people. The emerging proposals are moving towards more anticipatory and preventative approaches, more rehabilitation, more &quot;re-ablement&quot;, and a greater emphasis on self-care and supported self care, with consequential support for unpaid carers and volunteers.</p>

  <p>As part of a wider engagement process and to further analyse and develop emerging proposals, the programme will from March 2010 until the summer seek views from the public and from a wider range of stakeholders including patients, service users and service providers.</p>

  <p>The police recorded crime statistics collected centrally are based on an aggregate return, and do not record the occupation of the victim. However, following the introduction of the Emergency Workers (Scotland) Act in 2005, a new distinct crime classification of Minor assault of an emergency worker was created. This will include minor assaults of police officers during any course of their duties.</p>

  <p>The following table shows the number of offences of minor assault of an emergency worker recorded by the police, by police force area, in each year since the act came into force.</p>

  <p>Offences of minor assault of an emergency worker recorded by the police by police force area, 2005-06 to 2008-09</p>

  <p>Note that the increase in the number of offences recorded by Lothian and Borders Police from 2007-08 to 2008-09 is the result of a change in recording practice. Prior to August 2008, some of these offences were recorded as &quot;minor assaults&quot; and were not separately identified in the statistics submitted by Lothian and Borders Police to the Scottish Government.</p>

  <p>All serious assaults are recorded under a separate crime classification. However, the Scottish Government does not hold the number of serious assaults on police officers, as the occupation of the victim is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government issued guidance in October 2008 encouraging the Scottish Public Sector to use the minimum specification standards and, where possible, the best practice standards described in the &quot;Buy Sustainable - Quick Wins&quot; list of technical specifications. The list includes advice and specifications for the use of energy efficient light bulbs and lighting systems. Although the sole use of LED lights is not mandated they can be used as long as they meet the minimum specifications. The list can be found as follows:</p>

  <p>In October 2009 the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth launched the Scottish Sustainable Procurement Action Plan which is mandatory for the core Scottish Government. The plan commits core Scottish Government to implement the &quot;Buy Sustainable - Quick Wins&quot; minimum environmental standards with effect from 1 February 2010.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government Travel Plan encourages all staff to avoid or minimise the need for travel through the use of alternatives such as video conference, email and telephone. Where travel is unavoidable staff are encouraged to use low carbon options and to opt for public transport wherever possible.</p>

  <p>In the period 2005-06 to 2008-09 the use of private car mileage undertaken in the delivery of Scottish Government business reduced by almost 10% while over the same period rail passenger miles more than doubled.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Funding Council does not require institutions to allocate funding internally using the same formula as the council has used to determine their grants for teaching. This is a matter for institutions to decide in light of their particular circumstances and priorities. As autonomous bodies, higher education institutions, are responsible for managing their own funding in light of these individual priorities.</p>

  <p>Local authorities are expected to follow the guidance on winter maintenance contained in <em>Delivering Best Value in Highway Maintenance &ndash; Code of Practice for Maintenance Management July 2001</em> which has been endorsed by amongst others, Scottish Government, SCOTS And COSLA. It is for each local road authority to determine how best to implement this guidance in exercising its statutory duties under the Roads (Scotland) Act 1984.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government have been in correspondence with COSLA over additional funding to local authorities following the recent spell of inclement weather with &pound;5 million being allocated to share among councils to repair damaged roads. It is however for each local road authority to determine how best exercise its statutory duties under the Roads (Scotland) Act 1984 to repair, maintain and improve their local road network.</p>
