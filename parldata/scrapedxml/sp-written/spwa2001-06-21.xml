  <p>I am of course well aware of the far-reaching implications that such a standstill would have for Scottish farming. I am also aware, however, that we must do all we can to prevent any repetition of the rapid and unchecked spread of foot-and-mouth disease which has had such devastating effects on almost everyone in rural areas.</p>

  <p>Local authorities have been asked to provide details by 29 June of the total amount of registration fees to be refunded for their area as a result of the Registered Establishments (Scotland) Act 1998. Only Highland Council so far has submitted details, and refunds totalling &pound;12,632 have been approved by the Executive for payment by them.</p>

  <p>With <strong></strong> sportscotland we continue to drive forward the targets set by Sport 21. Our priorities for the further development of sport over the next three years were outlined during the debate on sport in November last year when we announced a 20% increase in funding for <strong></strong> sportscotland and, over the next three years, an additional &pound;3 million from the Lottery Sports Fund. This funding will enable <strong></strong> sportscotland, amongst other things, to expand the Active Primary Schools Programme, to develop further the School Sport Co-ordinator Programme and to work with the Social Inclusion Partnerships to help increase the numbers of people participating in sport who live in areas of economic and social disadvantage. We also intend to develop a major events strategy this year.</p>

  <p>The proposal to create a single water authority included in the consultation on the Water Services Bill was supported by a substantial majority of those commenting on the issue. The Transport and Environment Committee in its report on the water industry, which was published today, indicated that it also supports the proposal. I am pleased to announce therefore that we will introduce legislation later this year to create a single public water authority for Scotland that will work in the interests of its customers by improving standards and efficiency, modernising its infrastructure and competing effectively in a rapidly developing market.</p>
