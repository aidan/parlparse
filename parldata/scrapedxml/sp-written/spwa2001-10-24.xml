  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-17561 by Sarah Boyack on 6 September 2001, whether it will detail the work it is undertaking in conjunction with Highland Council and Highlands and Islands Enterprise to safeguard the Inverness to Gatwick route and whether it is involved in any similar work in relation to the restoration of an Inverness to Heathrow route.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has supported the case by The Highland Council for the imposition of measures to ensure access to Gatwick from Inverness. <strong> </strong> The Minister for Transport and Planning wrote to the UK Government on 8 October with a formal request to impose a Public Service Obligation on the Inverness-Gatwick route and to implement measures which will secure the slots required to maintain the service. No similar work is being undertaken in relation to the restoration of an Inverness-Heathrow route.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether any maintenance work will be required on the land erosion affecting an exposed pile at pier 19 of the Kincardine Bridge; whether it will give details of any such work; when this problem was first identified; whether it has been reported to it by any agencies since and, if so, by whom and on what dates; whether it will detail any damage that has been caused to the bridge; over what timescale any such damage has occurred; what the timetable is for any repair work; how much such repairs will cost; whether the cost has risen since the problem was first identified, and, if so, by how much in both percentage and real terms.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2001-10-24.2.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80134" speakername="Sarah Boyack" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-01/wa1024.htm#se_Minister">

  <p>A potential scour problem at pier 19 of the Kincardine Bridge was first identified some years ago, and both the Forth Local Authority Consortium and Amey Highways Ltd have subsequently monitored the situation. Scouring of the bed of a river is a complex process and it is often the case that scour holes can be refilled by changing river patterns. In 1999, the Forth Local Authority Consortium (FLAC) put forward a bid to undertake remedial works involving the installation of rock protection around the base of the pier. It was then agreed with FLAC that this should be programmed for the current financial year and the work is due to be undertaken by Amey Highways Ltd in January 2002.</p>

  <p>Whilst the erosion has partially exposed the piles below the pier, no structural damage has occurred as a result. The estimated cost of these measures is &#163;50,000.</p>

  <p>In relative terms the type and cost of repairs today is no different than it would have been had the protection measures been required at an earlier stage.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to disaggregate the cost of work on nutrient inputs and their effects from the more general environmental support provided by Fisheries Research Services (FRS). The advisory and monitoring work of FRS is generally of a long-term and strategic nature with no firm end date.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has however commissioned an &#163;80,000 study to develop a large-scale strategic model covering the Scottish and North sea marine environment. The model will be used to examine nutrient enrichment and the potential for eutrophication in Scottish coastal waters. The consortium involved includes FRS and a report is expected in the spring.</p>

  <p>The Continuous Plankton Recorder project (CPR), maintained by the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation, provides important information on the composition and abundance of algae present in the north east Atlantic. The data generated by this project are utilised as part of many assessments of the marine environment. Their particular relevance to the assessment of the environmental effects of aquaculture is in the observation of changes in coastal plankton and the influence of fluctuating oceanic currents on this process. A report using CPR data is being prepared on this question with regard to the issue of eutrophication in UK coastal waters. It is expected to be available in mid-2002.</p>

  <p>The report highlighted six issues to be addressed by the Executive. Progress has been as follows:</p>

  <p>Most telecommunications developments have been removed from the scope of the General Permitted Development Order (GDPO) and brought within full planning control. This work has taken priority over reducing the complexity of the GPDO itself.</p>

  <p>The pro-forma for collecting development control performance data from local authorities has been revised. Performance against the revised targets will be measured from 1 October 2001.</p>

  <p>Work is on-going to revise the Town and Country Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Areas) Regulations 1987. Work on this theme is also continuing as part of more general initiatives to modernise the planning system.</p>

  <p>A consultation paper on a new building standards system was issued in July 2001. It recommends that local authorities should make access to the building standards and planning systems as closely linked as possible, and that for certain small, simple projects joint planning/building warrant applications be considered. Responses are requested by 31 October 2001, with final proposals for a new system due next spring.</p>

  <p>As far as the issue of trunk roads and development control is concerned, all the action points from the Audit Report have been or are being acted upon.</p>

  <p>Planning Advice Note 40: <i>Development Control </i>has been revised and has been well received.</p>

  <p>The progress that has been made on these issues has been achieved in the context of the main thrust of the Executive&#8217;s planning agenda this year which has included the review of strategic planning, a proposed consultation exercise on public involvement in the planning system and the preparation of a policy statement on design and quality.</p>
