  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has obtained any report by the Standing Veterinary Committee on amnesic shellfish poisoning and, if so, when it will publish a response; whether it has any plans to introduce a replacement method of tiered testing of scallops and, if so, when any necessary subordinate legislation will be brought forward.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for this issue rests with the Food Standards Agency who have advised me that this matter was discussed by EU scientific experts on 3-4 April. The formal report of the meeting is expected shortly, though it is expected to be generally supportive of the principle of the tiered approach. The agency will consider the scientific report, along with the requirements for an enforcement regime to maintain consumer safety, before making final recommendations. If changes to subordinate legislation are required, these will be brought forward at the earliest opportunity.</p>

  <p>Policing issues related to asylum seekers in Glasgow are operational matters for the Chief Constable. Strathclyde has a force policing strategy which requires divisions receiving asylum seekers to appoint asylum liaison officers to develop links with asylum seekers and monitor racial incidents. Among the measures introduced are additional police patrols in areas of particular concern; Community Safety and Community Officers working closely with schools to help address tensions between local children and asylum seekers, and joint initiatives involving the police, the local authority and the voluntary sector.</p>

  <p>It is essential that rural residents are fully counted in the Census alongside those from urban areas because very substantial resources are allocated on the basis of Census statistics. The Registrar General for Scotland has made arrangements for postal delivery of Census forms to households, where normal delivery by enumerators is not possible because the area is infected or where access is limited.</p>

  <p>In infected areas enumerators are instructed not to hand deliver forms to any livestock holding premises or to any rural premises where the approach would involve driving off a metalled road.</p>

  <p>In all areas enumerators are instructed to observe scrupulously any signs restricting access and will comply at all times with any local disinfecting arrangements in place at the time.</p>

  <p>The arrangements made by the Registrar General, in consultation with the Government Veterinary Service, have the support of the National Farmers Union of Scotland, the Scottish Landowners Federation and the Scottish Crofters Union. A copy of the News Release issued by the Registrar General on 20 March is held on the Scottish Executive website pages covering foot-and-mouth disease:</p>

  <p>No. Local authorities have already begun the process of installing central heating systems under the Executive-funded &#163;350 million programme. Scottish Homes is making arrangements for the delivery of the programme in qualifying housing association properties. The Executive is also in the process of appointing an agent to manage the delivery of the central heating programme to owner occupiers.</p>

  <p>That is a matter for individual health boards in light of local circumstances and priorities. Boards are required to submit to the Scottish Executive by 30 April proposals for spending the &#163;10 million which have been agreed with local authority partners.

  <p>The electronics industry is presently undergoing worldwide restructuring and it is crucial that the industry in Scotland acquires the skills to compete for high value work. Scottish Enterprise is currently conducting an audit of existing skills in the sector aimed at developing a strategy to meet the future requirements of the hi-tech industry.</p>

  <p>The new Future Skills Scotland unit will also have a key role in identifying current and future skills needs, and the labour market information and intelligence required to ensure relevant education and training provision to meet these needs.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers have proposed a modification to the Glasgow and the Clyde Valley Structure Plan in order to make provision for new employment opportunities through the expansion of the West of Scotland Science Park. As the proposed modification relates to a strategic provision, it is not site specific and it would be wrong to assume that it represents a threat to the amenity woodland at Dawsholm Park. Any consequential land allocations would be a matter for the Glasgow City plan which is currently approaching consultative draft stage.</p>

  <p>The proposed modification has been the subject of a substantial number of representations which are being carefully considered prior to a final decision on the submitted structure plan.</p>

  <p>The spread of foot-and-mouth disease between livestock units appears mainly to have been by direct animal to animal contact or through people who have been in contact with animals acting as a conduit. Foot-and-mouth disease has been a particular problem in sheep, which have acted as a reservoir for the disease.</p>

  <p>We have had constructive discussions with the European Commission on a wide range of issues. Examples of the positive results achieved thus far include:</p>

  <p>(a) the Commission has agreed to consider an EU contribution towards the costs of compensation to livestock producers who have had stock culled;</p>

  <p>(b) payment of around &#163;46 million in EU livestock subsidies at the earliest date permissible under EU legislation. Payments under the new Less Favoured Area Support Scheme, which also receives EU funding, bring the total of subsidies paid to Scottish producers in the last month to around &#163;100 million;</p>

  <p>(c) Commission agreement to EU funding towards the costs of agri-monetary compensation, which will be worth around &#163;24 million in total to Scottish producers.</p>

  <p>Other EU funding, such as the Structural Funds and the resources allocated to the Scottish Rural Development Plan, will also bring significant benefits to rural areas affected by the outbreak. However, we have already confirmed with the Commission that these resources could not be redeployed to compensate individuals or businesses for economic losses caused by the foot-and-mouth disease emergency.</p>

  <p>The impact of local spending decisions are reviewed from the individual to the strategic perspectives through the work of the visiting Mental Health and Well Being Support Group, the Scottish Health Advisory Service and others in the reviewer network field. This process combined with the on-going performance management function of the Scottish Executive provides a broad-based review of local spend decisions and the difference they make to users of services.</p>

  <p>This approach recognises that money alone is not the solution and, as stated in <i>Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change</i>, resources must be put to best use through efficient working and improved work practices so that sustained and real improvements can be made in the care and support delivered.</p>

  <p>The Executive is already taking actions to help local authorities improve their waste management. <i>The National Waste Strategy: Scotland</i> , which we adopted in 1999, outlines the ways in which we intend to change the way waste is dealt with in Scotland. Eleven Waste Strategy Area Groups have been set up to establish the best practicable environmental option for dealing with waste in each area. These groups are preparing Area Waste Plans, which are planned to be ready by the end of this year.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to a more sustainable future for waste management in Scotland and, as Sarah Boyack explained in answer to question S1W-10588, has made available considerable resources for the implementation of Area Waste Plans by local authorities. This includes the Strategic Waste Fund which has &#163;50.4 million over the three years 2001-02 to 2003-04. The Strategic Waste Fund also provided a &#163;3 million grant to local authorities last year to &quot;kick-start&quot; recycling and composting plans.</p>

  <p>Sarah Boyack also announced in question S1W-10588 that we are contributing &#163;2.1 million to the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) over three years. WRAP will have a business focus and will concentrate initially on market facilitation, promoting investment in recycling, research and information management and the provision of guidance, advice and technical support. In addition, the Executive will continue to fund the Recycled Markets Development (ReMaDe) Scotland programme which takes a hands-on, local approach to identifying and developing markets for recycled materials.</p>

  <p>The Accounts Commission Overview identified low market prices as one reason why some local authorities had withdrawn separate collections of recyclable materials such as paper. By tackling the barriers to recycling through WRAP and ReMaDe we aim to lay a sound foundation upon which we can improve Scotland&#8217;s poor recycling record.</p>

  <p>Provisional figures indicate that last year the total sick absence rate in the whole Executive amounted to an average of 8.51 days per staff member. Stress-related illness, however caused, accounted for 6.76% of the total days lost because of these absences. Training on stress management is available and staff who are experiencing difficulties can obtain support from the Counselling and Welfare Service. There are plans to introduce new policies and procedures aimed at improving the management of all types of sick absences. The possible introduction of further support measures is being discussed with the trade unions.</p>

  <p>The Executive aims in all its work to ensure that the particular needs, circumstances and choices of all Scotland&#8217;s communities including travelling people are taken into account. To further that aim, work is in hand, under the Executive&#8217;s Equality Strategy, published in November 2000, to develop a communication strategy and to improve consultative mechanisms with specific communities of interest such as travelling people. The Scottish Executive/Scottish Homes commissioned a specific survey of travellers in 1999 and local authorities have the power to undertake their own surveys, for example in connection with Best Value reviews. The Executive&#8217;s Memorandum to the Equal Opportunities Committee&#8217;s Inquiry into Travelling People describes policies being pursued across the Executive which deal with issues of key concern for travelling people.</p>

  <p>In these circumstances, the Executive has no plans to establish a specific forum for the consideration of issues relating to travelling people. This is in line with the views of the former Advisory Committee on Scotland&#8217;s Travelling People which, during its final term of office, examined options for the future. Following consultation, the committee concluded that a successor organisation with executive powers would be counter-productive, potentially divisive and could in fact inhibit the objective of travellers becoming fully accepted as part of the Scottish community.</p>

  <p>There are no plans to review all existing legislation to assess its impact on any particular group. However, all Executive Bills must be accompanied by a statement of their potential impact on equal opportunities. In addition, the process of mainstreaming will move us towards integrating equality considerations into legislation, policy development, service design and delivery.</p>

  <p>The council&#8217;s intention to carry out a fundamental review of its policies and methods of funding research was announced in March 1999. The early announcement was intended to give higher education institutions and other interested parties an opportunity to plan ahead for the review. The overall timetable for the review was published in the initial consultation document in February 2000 which included details of the timing of the second stage consultation.</p>

  <p>The timing of the review was designed to ensure that the council was able to undertake a fundamental review of its policies and methods of funding research and to consult a wide range of stakeholders including, but not limited to, higher education institutions. The timing of the second stage consultation was also designed to ensure that proposals for new funding methods could be published and consulted upon well in advance of their introduction.</p>

  <p><i>The National Waste Strategy: Scotland</i> has waste minimisation as one of its key objectives. The strategy includes a target to reduce municipal waste arisings by 1% per annum.</p>

  <p>The Waste Minimisation Act 1998 gives local authorities powers to make arrangements to minimise the generation of waste in their areas. The Area Waste Plans currently being prepared across Scotland will include proposals for the implementation of waste minimisation plans.</p>

  <p>The Packaging (Essential Requirements) Regulations 1998 require manufacturers of packaging to keep its weight and volume to a minimum and to allow reuse and recycling to minimise its impact on the environment.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive encourages waste minimisation which forms a key objective of the <i>National Waste Strategy: Scotland</i> . The Waste Minimisation Act (1998) gives local authorities the powers to address the minimisation of waste in their area. This provides them with the opportunity to play a more active role in promoting and financing local waste minimisation initiatives such as reusable nappy schemes.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive supports waste minimisation initiatives such as Real Nappy Week as waste minimisation is one of the key objectives of the <i>National Waste Strategy: Scotland</i> .</p>

  <p>As with all waste producers, the National Health Service would be encouraged to look at ways in which they can minimise waste as this brings not only environmental benefits but cost savings too.</p>
