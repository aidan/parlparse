  <p>Consumer protection and Health and Safety at work are reserved matters. Responsibility for promoting awareness in the UK lies with the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), whose publicity campaigns to increase awareness of the dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning include Scotland.</p>

  <p>As part of its ongoing national programme on home safety awareness, the DTI last year issued 20 million safety leaflets enclosed with gas bills to alert the public to the dangers of carbon monoxide. The bills also carried an &#145;on-bill&#146; Government safety message. In addition to this, leaflets were placed in GPs surgeries throughout the UK and TV advertising further raised public awareness.</p>

  <p>The HSE has an ongoing programme providing guidance with an emphasis on the legislative aspects of gas safety. They also issued millions of leaflets last year in a national campaign. The HSE are at present conducting a fundamental review of the Health and Safety regime for the installation and use of gas to consider and determine the extent of any changes necessary to the current system. The document should be ready for public consultation later in the year.</p>

  <p>The Chief Medical Officer wrote to all doctors in Scotland on 7 September 1998 to promote greater vigilance amongst health professionals of the signs and symptoms of CO exposure in their patients.</p>

  <p>Salaries are set at &pound;33,360 for Ministers and &pound;17,305 for Deputy Ministers, with the exceptions of the First Minister (&pound;64,308), the Lord Advocate (&pound;86,186) and the Solicitor General (&pound;73,755). Scottish Ministerial salaries, therefore, should total &pound;697,539 in the current year.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to say what the equivalent costs will be in each of the next 3 financial years. The Review Body on Senior Salaries recommended that salaries for Ministers should be uprated each year in line with the mid-points of Senior Civil Service pay bands below Permanent Secretary. We cannot anticipate what this uprate will be.</p>

  <p>Dunoon Pier is owned by Argyll and Bute Council and its maintenance and upgrading is a matter for the Council. However, the Government has made allowances for Argyll and Bute&#146;s special needs in respect of piers and harbours generally, by providing additional resources to the council through a special needs allowance through the non-housing capital allocation formula.</p>

  <p>Glasgow City Council has already been awarded &pound;4.75m from the Public Transport Fund towards the cost of developing the Faifley to Baillieston bus corridor. Bids for <strong> </strong> the next round of allocations are due by 16 August and I am looking forward to receiving a range of innovative initiatives to improve public transport.</p>

  <p>Local authorities are also due to submit draft local transport strategies by 30 July. I expect these to contain proposals to reduce traffic, to promote public transport and to explain how proposals for new road building contribute to the integrated and sustainable transport strategy to which the Scottish Executive is committed.</p>

  <p>The advertisement for the post of Chairman to Caledonian MacBrayne Limited stated that all applications would be treated strictly in confidence. It would therefore, be a breach of that confidence to name the applicants who applied for this appointment. I can however, advise that forty one applications were received and five candidates were interviewed. The criteria were decided at the outset and included:</p>

  <p>analytical and strategic skills;</p>

  <p>effective presentational communication and negotiating skills;</p>

  <p>ability to provide direction;</p>

  <p>strong leadership;</p>

  <p>inspiration and motivation for the CalMac Board and staff;</p>

  <p>excellent chairmanship ability;</p>

  <p>broad knowledge of Highlands and Islands issues;</p>

  <p>knowledge of passenger ferry services;</p>

  <p>knowledge of NDPBs/Nationalised Industries and the Public Policy Framework; broad knowledge of transport issues;</p>

  <p>proven experience at board level in the areas of commerce, finance or shipping; and</p>
