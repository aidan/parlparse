  <p>Housing Benefit (HB), including overpayment, is a reserved matter under the responsibility of the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).</p>

  <p>In April 2002, the DWP published a comprehensive set of performance standards for the administration of HB, including standards relating to the recovery of HB overpayments. In addition, the DWP provides a dedicated advice line for local authorities on HB overpayment matters and plans to issue a new overpayment guidance manual to HB staff towards the end of the year.</p>

  <p>Our annual report for 2002 is being published today. The report sets out progress made in 2002 across the four pillars of our drugs strategy, namely young people, communities, treatment and availability. Also outlined is the action we plan to take with our partners over the next 12 months.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to say that the report provides plenty evidence of how our record levels of investment are making an impact in communities across Scotland. New and improved treatment and rehabilitation services for drug misusers are being rolled out and there are examples of support for families and communities which are being affected by drug misuse. However, balanced against the many positive developments in the report are continuing concerns about the numbers of drug-related deaths, and waiting times for drug treatment in several areas. We are working with the Drug Action Teams and other agencies to address these problems, and there certainly is no room for complacency.</p>

  <p>Copies of the annual report have been made available to the Parliament's Reference Centre (Bib. number 26254) and it has also been published on the Executive's website, the ISD website (<a href="http://www.drugmisuse.isdscotland.org/" target="_blank">www.drugmisuse.isdscotland.org</a>) and the Know the Score website (<a href="http://www.knowthescore.info/" target="_blank">www.knowthescore.info</a>).</p>

  <p>The company will be consulting with the unions over the next few weeks and I hope that compulsory redundancies can be kept to a minimum. The Clyde Shipyards Task Force Redundancy Management sub-group will be meeting shortly to provide support as necessary, to those affected through a dedicated local response team under the Executive's PACE (Partnership Action for Continuing Employment) framework.

  <p>The Scottish Executive provides annual core funding of &#163;234,000 to Keep Scotland Beautiful, which runs a number of anti-litter initiatives. Over the last year, additional funding of &#163;900,000 has been secured to bolster this programme, including the Have Some Pride anti-litter poster campaign, launched in March 2002.</p>

  <p>As part of the Executive&rsquo;s Quality of Life Initiative, in addition to the &#163;95 million allocated to local authorities this year, a further &#163;180 million has been provided over the next three years to fund local initiatives that will improve the local environment and quality of life. Around &#163;3 million of this year's allocation has been committed to litter reduction schemes and councils can use this money to raise awareness through publicity campaigns.</p>

  <p>Local authorities fund environmental initiatives from monies distributed by the Executive and from their own resources. As part of the Executive&rsquo;s Quality of Life Initiative, &#163;95 million was allocated to local authorities this year, and a further &#163;180 million has been provided over the next three years, in addition to regular annual funding. These additional resources were made available to fund local initiatives that will improve the local environment and quality of life. Around &#163;3 million of this year's allocation has been committed to litter reduction schemes. In addition, the Executive has made &#163;20 million available over the next three years to put in place a network of community wardens, one of whose tasks will be to combat littering.</p>

  <p>In the main, European Regional Development Fund and European Social Fund payments are made in order of receipt. The Scottish Executive aims to pay correctly completed claims within 30 days of receipt of a valid claim but always seeks to respond sympathetically to requests from vulnerable organisations for urgent payment.</p>

  <p>Fast-track hearings in the three pilot areas &ndash; East Lothian and Scottish Borders; Dundee, and North, East and South Ayrshire &ndash; will begin operating tomorrow. The pilots will run for two years and are designed to address the behaviour of around 8% of young offenders who account for just over one third of youth crime in the pilot area communities.</p>

  <p>Extra services have been put in place across the pilot areas to ensure that programmes are available to tackle offending behaviour. The Executive has funded extra intensive support places, specialist foster care support, educational support places, and additional programmes in residential and secure accommodation. The pilots will be subject to independent evaluation. Guidance has been issued, copies of which are available in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 26222). This has been developed by all partners &ndash; pilot authorities, reporters, police, children&rsquo;s panel representatives and the voluntary sector.</p>
