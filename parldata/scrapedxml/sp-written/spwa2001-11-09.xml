  <p>The Aggregates Tax is a reserved matter. The Scottish Executive has no plans to prevent material exempt from the Aggregates Tax being incorporated into Public Finance Initiative or Design, Build, Finance and Operate projects. Where the Scottish Executive is the client it does not, as a rule, specify the provenance of the materials to be used. It is hoped, however, that contractors will choose materials, such as recycled aggregate, that come from more sustainable sources.</p>

  <p>Operational matters, including decisions on which ambulance stations should operate on a full-time basis, are for the Scottish Ambulance Service in the first instance. Health Department officials have discussed with Ambulance Service management the implications of converting to full-time operation a number of ambulance stations in Scotland, alongside other operational issues. The Ambulance Service will make decisions about these matters in light of information about patient care benefits, expected performance improvements, legal requirements, competing priorities and availability of resources.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has allocated the Ambulance Service a total recurring revenue budget of &#163;101.1 million in 2001-02, an increase of 5.8% on last year. For 2002-03, the service has been given an indicative allocation of &#163;107.6 million &#8211; a further 6.3% increase.</p>

There are also services dealing with non-sexual abuse by children. An example of this is the funding that the Executive provides to the Anti-Bullying Network, which aims to help schools combat all forms of bullying.</p>

  <p>The breadth of primary and secondary Initial Teacher Education (ITE) programmes does not permit detailed consideration of any one topic. The 1998 Guidelines, with which all courses of initial teacher education must comply, contain a set of competences which teachers are expected to have acquired by the end of their initial training course. Competences relating to personal and social development and health education offer the scope to address the issue of violence against women. These competences will be replaced, in autumn 2002, by the Benchmark Standard on ITE, which builds upon, and updates, the competencies on personal and social development, placing particular emphasis on teachers being able to impart a high regard for equality and social justice to their pupils. Courses are not prescriptive, however, and each training institution will develop its own programme within the context of the Guidelines.</p>

  <p>Earlier this year, the Executive funded a pilot of the &quot;Respect&quot; education package developed by the Zero Tolerance Charitable Trust. Training for teachers and youth workers is included in the &quot;Respect&quot; package and was provided to all those involved in delivering the materials.</p>

  <p>It is the responsibility of local authorities to ensure that a wide range of continuing professional development opportunities is available for qualified teachers. I would expect training aimed at equipping teachers to deal with issues relating to violence against women, such as that provided through the &quot;Respect&quot; package, to be recognised as one such appropriate opportunity.</p>

  <p>During the past five years the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency carried out 1,390 boardings, of fishing boats which were fishing for shellfish within the six mile limit. As a consequence of these boardings, five infringements of the rules were reported for prosecution. The table gives the details on a year by year basis.</p>

  <p>The Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act (1997) (Section 123(1)) states that carrying out development without the required planning permission constitutes a breach of planning control.</p>

  <p>Planning authorities have the power to serve an Enforcement Notice, if appropriate, requiring the alleged breach to be remedied. The notice must, among other things, specify the matters which appear to the planning authority to constitute a breach of planning control, the steps which require to be taken, the date on which the notice takes effect and the period allowed for compliance with its' terms.</p>

  <p>In addition, where the planning authority considers it expedient that any &quot;relevant activity&quot; should cease before the expiry of the compliance period in the Enforcement Notice, it may also serve a Stop Notice prohibiting the carrying out of that activity on the land to which the Enforcement Notice relates, or any part of that land.</p>

  <p>A planning authority may also seek to restrain or prevent any breach of planning control, whether actual or threatened, by applying to the court for an interdict. Applications may be made either to the Court of Session or to the Sheriff.</p>

  <p>Guidance on the range of enforcement action available to planning authorities is outlined in the SODD Circular 4/1999: <i>Planning Enforcement</i> and Planning Advice Note (PAN) 54: <i>Planning Enforcement</i>.
