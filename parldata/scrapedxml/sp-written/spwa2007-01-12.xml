  <p>The increase in air passenger duty will have a minor impact on the Scottish economy as a whole. However, the increase will bring a commensurate increase in the cost of fares under the Executive&rsquo;s Air Discount Scheme on every return journey from an airport outwith the Highlands and Islands.</p>

  <p>This increase will affect fuel prices throughout the UK and could put around 50 pence on an average tank of petrol. We recognise the concerns of residents of rural Scotland who experience higher than average fuel prices and can be dependent on private transport. We are spending substantial sums through our Rural Transport Fund to improve transport services in rural areas.</p>

  <p>The taxation of fuel is a matter reserved to the UK Government. However, Scottish ministers will continue to ensure that Scotland&rsquo;s interests on fuel costs are firmly on the agenda in Whitehall through direct contact with Treasury Ministers.</p>

  <p>Landlords are required, under the Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations 1998, to have all gas appliances and flues checked annually and to issue a copy of the gas safety certificate to the tenant. There is no duty on landlords to supply carbon monoxide detectors. However, the Scottish National Core Standards and Good Practice Guidance for Private Landlords recommend that they should be provided. These standards are published by Communities Scotland, for use by voluntary landlord accreditation schemes, and represent higher standards than the minimum legal requirements.</p>

  <p>If a landlord provides a carbon monoxide detector, and the tenant or another occupier of the house is deaf or hard of hearing, the landlord may be required to provide a detector with a suitable alarm mechanism, such as a flashing light, as a reasonable adjustment under the Disability Discrimination Act.</p>

  <p>Real progress has been made in tackling sectarianism in Scotland and I am proud of what has been achieved. The reconvened Summit on Sectarianism, held on 12 December 2006, allowed the Executive and key stakeholders to reaffirm their commitment to working in partnership to eradicate sectarianism once and for all and we will continue to work together to drive this agenda forward.</p>

  <p>There is a great deal of activity taking place in addition to the positive work which is being taken forward in relation to football and parades. For example, we have:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p align="justify">Made the anti-sectarian education resource <i><strong>Don&rsquo;t Give It, Don&rsquo;t Take It</strong></i> available to all schools in Scotland;</p>
<p align="justify">Published the <i>Building Friendships and Strengthening Communities</i> guide to twinning denominational and non-denominational schools;</p>
<p align="justify">Been working closely with the Scottish Council of Voluntary Organisations to support and share knowledge and experience among anti-sectarianism groups working in the voluntary sector;</p>
<p align="justify">Supported research to quantify the problem of sectarianism in the workplace, and</p>
<p align="justify">Been working with the independent Task Group on Tackling Sectarianism in Scotland to develop new ideas and initiatives such as the development of a rehabilitation programme to tackle the anti-social attitudes of those involved in sectarian activities.</p>
</blockquote></p>

  <p>An update on progress made on the <i>Action Plan on Tackling Sectarianism in Scotland</i> is available at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2006/12/11133338/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2006/12/11133338/0</a></p>

  <p>To March 2006 we spent almost &pound;276 million on fuel poverty programmes. Over 2006-08 we have allocated nearly &pound;108 million to these programmes.</p>

  <p>In each of the years 2006-08 we have allocated &pound;5 million to the Warm Deal. From this year&rsquo;s Warm Deal resource, &pound;2.5 million has been allocated to work in the private sector and &pound;2.5 million to local authorities and housing associations to deliver Warm Deal measures in their properties.
