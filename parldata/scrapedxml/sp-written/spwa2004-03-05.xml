  <p>The last UK survey on black grouse was in 1995-96 when it was estimated that there were 4,960 lekking male black grouse in Scotland. The next UK survey will be conducted in 2005-06.</p>

  <p>Further information on the black grouse and the associated conservation efforts can be found on the UK Biodiversity Action Plan for black grouse website: www.blackgrouse.info</p>

  <p>In 1990 the ptarmigan population was estimated to be 10,000 breeding pairs. The 1988-91 British Trust for Ornithology New Atlas of Breeding Birds found that the distribution of ptarmigan in Scotland had not changed substantially since the previous Atlas Survey in 1968-1971. The Atlas Survey for 2008-2011 will be the next official survey of this species.</p>

  <p>The Executive undertakes a number of actions to ensure that the output from our further and higher education institutions is appropriate to the workforce needs of NHSScotland. For example: the annual student nurse intake planning exercise undertakes this responsibility in respect of nurses and midwives and has resulted in year on year increases to the number of student nurses and midwives in training; we have provided funding for additional student places in areas such as radiography and speech and language therapy, and are working in partnership with higher education institutions, NHSScotland and the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council to support more therapists in training; steps have been taken to increase dental undergraduate places to secure an increased annual output of 130 dental graduates; and a review of basic medical education in Scotland has been commissioned and is expected to make recommendations shortly on numbers of medical students.</p>

  <p>In general terms, the process for assessing the undergraduate intakes and outputs required to supply NHSScotland with the many different types of healthcare professionals it needs is complex. It is closely linked to issues of workforce planning and development, including retention and recruitment strategies and the development of multi-professional teams, and also to the alternative routes to training that may be available. I therefore also refer Mr Davidson to the answer given to question S2W-6002 on 5 March 2004.</p>

  <p>The developing regional workforce networks and their constituent NHS boards will advise on future staffing requirements in their areas in response to the demand for services they are responsible for providing at regional and local level. Based on this advice, the National Workforce Committee will make recommendations on the future size and shape of the NHS workforce in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Executive aims to develop its first national workforce plan by the end of March, to coincide with the establishment of the new boards throughout Scotland. The plan will provide a comprehensive position statement and scenarios for the future. The new boards, the regional service and workforce planning networks will be able to draw on the national plan to inform their planning processes in the longer term and, in turn, they will inform further development of the national plan. In addition, the Executive will be better able to ensure that the supply of staff matches the service&#39;s demand for them.</p>

  <p>The Arbuthnott formula determines the increase in boards&#8217; financial allocations on the basis of an overall assessment of relative needs, taking into account the influences of demography, deprivation and remoteness. The planning and provision of services are matters for NHS boards within those resources, national guidelines and overall priorities. The Ombudsman rejected the complaint and indicated that this was a resource allocation issue for the trust.</p>

This is available on the SCIEH website, to which all practitioners have access and is widely distributed to environmental health officers and public health consultants.</p>

  <p>At a national level, we have established the Scottish Partnership Forum and the Human Resources Forum. This is a tripartite arrangement between the Scottish Executive Health Department, NHSScotland employers and trade unions/professional organisations. They are formally constituted with an equal number of places offered to the Scottish Executive Health Department/NHSScotland employers and the STUC affiliated trade unions and professional organisations. The mechanism and process for selection of trade union/professional organisation representatives on these national fora is determined and undertaken by the trade unions/professional organisations.</p>

  <p>Each NHS system has developed and agreed locally a partnership agreement which sets out the membership of the Area Partnership Forum. Membership is drawn from recognised trade unions and professional organisations and management representatives. The number of seats is a matter for local determination. It is for staff side organisations to determine the chair and this individual is automatically nominated as the employee director for the system subject to ministerial approval of their appointment to the NHS board.</p>

  <p>The only real criteria required of all members of local and national fora is an agreement that all parties will work together towards improving the service provided by the NHS, to both patients and staff, and that all decisions on its future will be made through genuine partnership working.</p>

  <p>The new consultants&#8217; contract provides a number of specific advantages, not least a considerable increase in the contracted time devoted to direct patient care, up from 21 hours per week to at least 30 hours per week for each full-time consultant. The overarching benefit to be derived from the contract is to provide NHSScotland with the tools to more effectively manage consultants&#8217; time and workload. The job planning process allows managers, for the first time, to critically examine and transparently timetable all of a consultant&#8217;s activities, and to agree how consultants&#8217; working commitments and practices can best contribute to NHS objectives. In this way managers will be able to explicitly and more effectively manage consultant activity in order to secure the capacity they require to improve services to patients and, where appropriate, take forward the re-design of services.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how much funding it has made available to upgrade private water supplies to enable compliance with new EU regulations or connection to public water supplies; who is responsible for the disbursal of such funds, and how owners of private water supplies can apply for funds.</p>

  <p>Currently, funding to upgrade private water supplies is available from a number of sources. <strong></strong> Housing Improvement Grants can be awarded to households for a range of purposes including the upgrade of the water supply. Citizens wishing to apply for a housing improvement grant should contact their local authority.</p>

  <p>In Scottish Water&#8217;s current investment programme, some &#163;41 million has been made available for investment to address development constraints and provide first time connection in rural areas. Ministers will give final approval to the allocation of this money later this year. Information on households requiring connection to the public water supply has been provided to Scottish Water by local authority environmental health officers.</p>

  <p>Finally, the Scottish Executive aims to bring into force a dedicated private water supplies improvement grant scheme to assist citizens and business to comply with new private water supply regulations. Proposals on this matter will be subject to full public consultation, planned for later this year.</p>

  <p>We are aware of the pilot weather forecasting service recently introduced into Wales and have asked the Mountaineering Council of Scotland to monitor and evaluate its operation during its trial period. We will then consider whether a similar service might be introduced in Scotland.</p>
