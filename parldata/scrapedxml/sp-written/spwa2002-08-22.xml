  <p>Earlier this year the Scottish Executive commissioned a research study to assess the impact of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 in its first eighteen months of operation in Scotland. The study involves in-depth interviews with key stakeholders, service providers, asylum seekers and local community organisations. It also includes elements to identify and assess good practice and to monitor media content and coverage of asylum seeker issues. Fieldwork will conclude in summer 2002 and the report will be published in autumn 2002.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive requires trusts to report on compliance with the contractual requirements of the New Deal for junior doctors and available data covers whether junior doctors meet the limit of 56 hours per week. Considerable efforts have been focussed on ensuring that accurate information is recorded and gathered from trusts on this key objective.</p>

  <p>It is the responsibility of trusts to ensure compliance with New Deal. Trusts are currently further updating their information systems to ensure that working patterns of junior doctors, including the average hours worked, are recorded for junior doctors.</p>

  <p>The answer given to question S1W-25569 does not indicate that the incidence of Class A drugs has been more than twice as high as other classes of drugs in years two and three. It was a record of the number of performance points not of incidents. An incident also may reveal the presence of other classes of drugs.

The Executive concluded that a Business Improvement Plan (BIP), using mainly in-house provision, would provide the best overall value for the Executive. The BIP involves the reorganisation of in house teams and for their role to expand as some current contracts will not be replaced as they end.</p>

  <p>The BIP aims to both improve facilities management services and reduce costs by &#163;2.1 million per annum by 2004-05. Over the period 2002-03 to 2004-05 a number of changes will be made to the organisation of services delivery, to the number and extent of the contracts which support this work, and the way in which staff gain access to services. Every effort will be made to ensure that staff surpluses do not arise and redundancies are avoided through establishing staff preferences, reskilling, retraining and redeployment.</p>

  <p>Social Inclusion Partnership Fund grant expenditure is audited at a number of levels. At project level the accounts are subject to an annual audit by a qualified accountant. Where the council is the nominated partner, the council&#8217;s management is responsible for ensuring that its systems for handling grant and accounting for it are sound. These systems may be subject to scrutiny by the council&#8217;s internal auditors. Non-local authority nominated partners are responsible for ensuring that their systems for handling grant and accounting for it are sound and for ensuring that their final grant claim is audited by professionally qualified external auditors. At the partnership level, partnerships&#8217; final claims are periodically certified by auditors appointed by Audit Scotland. The role of these external auditors is to ensure that expenditure is properly accounted for and used for the intended purposes.</p>

  <p>No.</p>

  <p>The funding available to Scottish Water during the current four year investment cycle is described in some detail in <em>Water Quality and Standards Investment Priorities for Scotland&#8217;s Water Authorities 2002-2006</em> (Bib. number 15676). The purpose of wastewater treatment works is to treat discharges of wastewater to a standard which will benefit the environment.</p>

  <p>Scottish Water&#8217;s investment programme is already very substantial and is based upon the advice of a wide range of bodies including Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the Water Industry Commission. It reflects a balance between our meeting environmental and public health considerations on the one hand, and the affordability of charges to customers on the other.</p>
