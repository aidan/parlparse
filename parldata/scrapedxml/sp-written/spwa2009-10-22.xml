  <p>Section 68 of the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 inserts section 46A into the Title Conditions (Scotland) Act 2003. Section 46A lays down that &quot;on and after the day on which this section comes into force, it shall be competent to create a real burden&quot; in relation to climate change. Section 6(1)(a) of the 2003 act lays down that &quot;a real burden is created by registering against the land which is to be the burdened property a deed which is granted by or on behalf of the owner of that land&quot;. Therefore, once section 68 is commenced, any owner of land, including the UK Government, may create a climate change burden. However, it is not mandatory for them to do so.</p>

  <p>The focus of this government is firmly on delivery. We are establishing a new Drugs Strategy Delivery Commission and have published a new framework for action on alcohol and drugs. We are setting up a Scottish Drugs Recovery Consortium whose role will be to advocate, catalyse and lobby for recovery to be the mainstay of drug services. Frontline services are also benefiting from an 18% increase in funding since 2006-07, and for the first time we are developing a national HEAT target that will offer people with drug problems faster access to a range of appropriate drug services to promote recovery.</p>

  <p>Scottish housing associations are expected to be able to access the &pound;50 million of European money from The Housing Finance Corporation (THFC) from around December 2009. This depends on completion of the formal loan agreement between THFC and the European Investment Bank, and on housing associations which have applied for a share of the money successfully getting through THFC&rsquo;s credit appraisal.

  <p>The rate of interest to be charged will only be known when the loan agreement between the European Investment Bank (EIB) and The Housing Finance Corporation is finalised. Because the EIB is AAA-rated, it is able to source funds from the international capital markets at competitive rates otherwise only available to sovereign states. One of the conditions of EIB funding is that the same rate is charged by The Housing Finance Corporation when it subsequently lends the money on to individual housing associations.</p>

  <p>Yes. The Housing Finance Corporation is only permitted to lend to registered social landlords (housing associations) and the European Investment Bank only allows funds for housing, provided through The Housing Finance Corporation, to be used to fund homes for rent.</p>

  <p>All lenders, even not-for-profit bodies like The Housing Finance Corporation, incur administrative costs which need to be paid for. Lenders recover these costs from their customers and The Housing Finance Corporation charges a fee to its customers in order to meet its administrative costs.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-27347 by Kenny MacAskill on 24 September 2009, what the cost was of recent advertisements seeking applications for membership of prison visiting committees and how such members will fit into the new committees.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service, to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The cost of the recent advertisements seeking applications for membership of prison visiting committees to fill expected vacancies at the three Young Offender Institutions at Polmont, Cornton Vale and Perth was &pound;2347.59.</p>

  <p>Young Offender Institution visiting committee membership requires that at least one third and a minimum of two members will be women. The most recent recruitment campaign is aimed at addressing shortfalls in this area and maintaining the required level of women visiting committee members.</p>
