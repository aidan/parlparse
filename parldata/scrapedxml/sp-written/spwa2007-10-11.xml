  <p>Contrary to recent press reports, the Scottish Coastal Archaeology and the Problem of Erosion (SCAPE) Trust&rsquo;s report has not yet been published. Indeed, it has yet to be submitted in final form to Historic Scotland, who commissioned it and will be paying for it. As I said in my response to Hugh Henry&rsquo;s oral question on 4 October 2007, we recognise the importance of the issue of coastal erosion of historic sites, we already protect several important sites and we will take action to ensure that key sites which cannot be saved are properly recorded. We are working with other interested parties to achieve this and Historic Scotland looks forward to receiving the SCAPE report, which will assist in setting priorities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish coal mining industry makes a significant contribution to energy supplies, currently supplying around 25% of UK coal production. Our policy opposing new nuclear power stations in Scotland, the installation of flue gas desulpherisation equipment at Longannet power station, and the future development of clean coal technologies, are all factors expected to increase the size of the potential market for Scottish coal production. We maintain regular contact with the sector and participate in the UK Coal Forum.</p>

  <p>Improving services for those with dementia and their carers is a priority for the Scottish Government and further options for change and improvement are being explored through the <em>Better Health, Better Care</em> consultation which runs to 12 November 2007. The outcomes will complement the range of initiatives already underway to increase support available to those with dementia.</p>

  <p>I have also appointed a Dementia Forum to inform and advise current and future attention on this important agenda. That agenda includes; a forthcoming integrated care pathway standard for dementia; the funding for a partnership dementia services redesign project through NHS Forth Valley and the Dementia Services Development Centre; attention on ensuring all new and refurnished primary care premises are designed to be dementia friendly; work with NHS Education for Scotland to develop a competency based framework for mental health staff working with older adults and grant funding over the next three years to support both Alzheimer Scotland and the Dementia Services Development Centre.</p>

  <p>A number of national patient group directions (PGDs) have been developed for both the urgent provision of repeat medicine by community pharmacists and the Minor Ailment Service. The Scottish Government will consider the introduction of further national PGDs where this will offer an advantage for patient care, without compromising patient safety.</p>

  <p>Referrals to one of Scotland&rsquo;s five regional wheelchair centres are, in most cases, made by a GP, consultant or occupational therapist. Details of referrals will include the nature and level of the patient&rsquo;s disability and/or medical condition, lifestyle and needs. Where they will use the wheelchair and their ability to operate particular types of wheelchairs will also be taken into consideration.</p>

  <p>Wheelchair assessments are carried out by a qualified medical professional. The process may involve a rehabilitation engineer responsible for how the wheelchair works, its dimensions, functionality and any adjustments, features or fixtures it needs. This includes special postural seating. Where necessary, a specialist team can provide assessments for equipment for people with severe physical disabilities, including muscular disease, who cannot use standard wheelchairs or controls.The assessment may include other professionals across health, education and social services. This is especially important if the wheelchair is for a child who will have development needs. All the situations in which a wheelchair may be used, including school, using transport and social activities, will be part of the assessment. Parents and carers should also be part of the process and their opinions and views considered.</p>

  <p>As a person's needs change, the wheelchair service will review their requirements. This can include, for example, changing from a manual to a powered wheelchair or carrying out adaptations to an existing chair.</p>
