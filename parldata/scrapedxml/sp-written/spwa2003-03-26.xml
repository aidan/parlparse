  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the cost would be of buying out the public private partnership (PPP) for Inverness airport; whether the terms of the PPP are a disincentive to increasing the number of routes and passengers using the airport; what its estimate is of the total cost of payments due over the life of the PPP contract, and what steps it plans to take in order to increase the number of routes and passengers using Inverness airport.</p>

  <p>The buying out of Highlands and Islands Airports Limited (HIAL) Public Finance Initiative (PFI) deal on the development and operation of the Inverness Airport Terminal is not under consideration by Scottish ministers. The contractual parties to the deal are reviewing the PFI structure, to ensure that it continues to be effective in delivering the intended benefits for the operation and development of the terminal and airport. The Scottish Executive fully supports this review.</p>

  <p>The estimated cost of PFI payments until the end of the contract is based on a (variable) volume based payment multiplied by the estimated passenger throughout. This is applied through a cost model which is subject to commercial confidentiality.</p>

  <p>HIAL and the Scottish Executive will continue to pursue the development of new routes from Inverness and other HIAL airports through the Interim Route Development Fund and the company's marketing strategy. In the past six months this has resulted in delivery of a new Manchester service and an additional London (Gatwick) service.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committing record levels of investment in the NHS, ensuring that NHS boards have sufficient funds to meet local health care needs in line with the priorities set out in out in <em>Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change</em> and our recently introduced white paper, <em>Partnership for Care</em> . This substantial investment will continue to rise by over 5% a year in real terms over the next three years. Generic clinical standards already require NHS boards to have information strategies in place which meet the needs of patients, relatives and carers. The introduction of Carer Information Strategies will seek to enhance that existing work.</p>

  <p>Many pupils in Scottish schools already take part in vocational training at employers' premises. It is our intention to greatly increase the number of such placements, through the major expansion of our Enterprise in Education programme. Indeed, the Executive will commit at least &#163;40 million over the first three years of Enterprise in Education to ensure all pupils in Scotland can derive benefit from its opportunities. One of our key objectives will be the delivery of an expanded programme of work-based vocational learning. Additionally, the Executive will commission from Learning and Teaching Scotland work on improving existing guidance and support materials for work experience.</p>

  <p>This is not a subject on which the Scottish Executive has issued specific guidance. We expect authorities to take account of integrated issues as set out in the joint Scottish Executive/COSLA school estate strategy. The Education (Publication and Consultation Etc.) (Scotland) Regulations 1981, as amended, set out the legal framework on consultation on school closures, and guidance on those regulations was issued to authorities in 1981.</p>

  <p>In general, it is the responsibility of an education authority to take any decision on a proposal to close a school. There are certain circumstances, prescribed in legislation, in which authorities cannot implement such a proposal without the consent of the Scottish ministers.</p>

  <p>In summary, these circumstances are where the school concerned is more than 80% full, or where the alternative school is five or more miles distant in the case of a primary school and 10 or more miles distant in the case of a secondary school from the school proposed for closure. There are further provisions concerning denominational schools, but these do not mean that the consent of ministers is required for all proposals involving the closure of denominational schools.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&#146;s environmental justice policy seeks to ensure that no particular section of society suffers disproportionately from avoidable environmental impacts in comparison to other sections.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&#146;s Equality Strategy provides a framework for work in all equality areas, including gender. At the centre of this strategy is the integration of equality into every aspect of the Executive&#146;s work. Draft legislation is subject to equality proofing and is scrutinised by the Scottish Parliament. This integrated approach requires policymakers to take account of and reflect the diverse needs of the population.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive published in 2002 guidance on consultation with equality groups entitled <em>Good Practice Guidance &#150; Consultation with Equalities Groups</em> . This covers consultation with women&#146;s groups. This guidance is designed to assist policy makers within the Executive to adopt good practice when consulting with equality groups.</p>

  <p>The guidance recommends that after the consultation it is a good idea to ask those consulted about the process and ways it could be improved in the future. This may include reviewing who actually responded to the consultation, to see whether there are any patterns or obvious gaps. This may help to pinpoint any groups that were not contacted by the methods used.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive, in partnership with other bodies such as the Programme Management Executives, the enterprise networks, local authorities and voluntary organisations, seeks to take full advantage of the various sources of funding from European institutions, as set out in the answer given to question S1W-34834 today. All these stakeholders are actively engaged in ensuring funding streams are fully utilised and work co-operatively to achieve this end.

  <p>The extent of take up of European Structural Funds by other UK regions is a matter for the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, the Department for Trade and Industry and the European Commission. Take-up by other member states is a matter for the European Commission. The Commission monitors progress and reports to member states through the Committee for the Development and Conversion of the Regions, which is attended by Scottish Executive officials.</p>

  <p>Take-up is measured by the so-called "N+2" regulation, under which money has to be spent within two years of allocation by the Commission. So far as the 1994-99 programmes are concerned, where project activity finished at the end of 2001, final reports will be considered by the Commission over the coming months. For the 2000-06 programmes, the first test of take-up was at the end of last year, where the majority of Objective 1 and Objective 3 Programmes had to report financial performance against allocations. Again, the information is currently being considered by the Commission.</p>

  <p>There are four Structural Funds available in Scotland:</p>

  <p>The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) primarily supports productive investment, infrastructure and SME development.</p>

  <p>The Guidance Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF-Guidance section) supports measures for the adjustment of agricultural structures and rural development.</p>

  <p>The European Social Fund (ESF) supports measures to promote employment (education systems, vocational training and recruitment aids).</p>

  <p>The Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG) supports measures for the adjustment of structures in this sector, and the "accompanying measures" of the common fisheries policy.</p>

  <p>These are made available through geographically defined programmes - the Highlands and Islands Special Transitional Programme, the three Objective 2 programmes (East, West and South of Scotland) and Objective 3 which supports training activities outwith the Highlands and Islands area.</p>

  <p>In addition to these there are four community initiatives, which are worth around 5% of the 2000-06 Structural Fund budget and are pilot projects/test beds for activity which, if effective is then mainstreamed into the larger funds:</p>

  <p>Interreg III: Cross-border, transnational and interregional co-operation.</p>

  <p>Urban II: Regeneration of urban areas in crisis. (Port Glasgow and Clydebank South)</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive makes no direct contribution to match funding at project level. Match funding for European Structural Funded projects is provided by the individual project sponsors, the funding for many of whom comes directly from the Scottish Executive either in whole or in part. This ensures local commitment to local priorities, accountability and value for money.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has encouraged the five Programme Management Executives (PMEs) (who implement the programmes on the ground on behalf of the Scottish Executive) to pursue actively a range of activities to raise awareness of the availability of European Structural Funds programmes, including:</p>

  <p>the provision of websites and the circulation to all partner organisations of programme bulletins providing up to date information on funds available and forthcoming application rounds;</p>

  <p>facilitation of fast-track applications, rolling programmes and additional application rounds where appropriate;</p>

  <p>delivery of regular application advice surgeries and workshops across the country;</p>

  <p>engaging with target communities to stimulate applications for community economic development support;</p>

  <p>analysis of underlying reasons for slow uptake in particular measures or areas, and</p>

  <p>efforts to promote private sector interest in the funds.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is in the process of implementing a new web-based application and claim form system, which will streamline the process for applicants. The new application forms have been developed and are being phased in according to the timetables of the application rounds run by each PME. PMEs will introduce the new forms and processes to applicant organisations and provide training and support to assist them in preparing grant applications.</p>

  <p>This is primarily an operational matter for the Firemaster in consultation with his Fire Authority. The nationally recommended standard is five crew on the first pumping appliance and four crew on any subsequent pumping appliance. There are agreed risk assessments to allow four crew on a pump to operate safely. Furthermore, national guidance for operational deployment requires a dynamic risk assessment for all incidents before work commences. The crucial test, therefore, is not the number of crew deployed but the action taken at the incident to ensure their safety. Strathclyde Fire Brigade, which generally has five crew on the second pumping appliance, is therefore operating above the current nationally recommended crewing criteria.</p>

  <p>As I indicated in the answer given to question S1W-33682, any compensation paid by North Lanarkshire Council will need to be in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions. If it decides to use the compulsory powers available under Part IV of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987, it will require to pay compensation as defined by Part XV of that act. This has the effect that compensation may not exceed the actual market value of the property at the date the relevant notice is served on the owner. The payment of compensation would not prevent the council from providing additional assistance to help those affected secure suitable alternative accommodation.</p>

  <p>Our understanding is that the properties in question were built in the 1960s.</p>

  <p>Details of the defects and their impact on the relevant properties are set out in reports by A.J. Balfour &amp; Associates, dated October 2000 and the Structural Partnership, dated August 2001. Copies of each are available in the Parliament's Reference Centre (Bib. numbers 27050 and 27052).</p>

  <p>Advice and guidance on building practice, relating to the use of calcium chloride as an additive to accelerate the hardening of concrete, is contained in the British Standards Institution Codes of Practice. The 1977 amendment to Code of Practice 110 strongly recommended that calcium chloride should never be added to pre-stressed, reinforced concrete or concrete containing embedded metal. Code of Practice 110 was revised in 1985 and re-issued as Code of Practice 8110, which reiterated the previous advice.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive study <em>Evolving the right to buy: evidence for Scotland</em> included a review of existing research on the resale of former right to buy properties. It was published in 2000 and is available from the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 7129).</p>

  <p>Subsequently, Communities Scotland commissioned research which was published in the report <em>Assessing and Predicting the Long-run Impact of the Right to Buy,</em> and which included information on resales. This was published in June 2002 and is available from the Communities Scotland website.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive Development Department&#146;s research programme for 2003-04 includes provision for a project entitled "Right to buy sales and resales" which is planned to examine further the impact of right to buy sales and resales on affordable housing, community stability, stock condition and local housing markets.</p>

  <p>There are a number of sources of information on trends in house prices in Scotland, including estimates for Scotland as a whole, compiled by the Council of Mortgage Lenders on behalf of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. The Lloyds-TSB analysis of its own lending for house purchase is the only source of information which currently provides estimates of price change for areas within Scotland adjusted for any changes from quarter to quarter in the mix of properties sold.</p>

  <p>I have recently confirmed the Development Programme for 2003-04. Investment both in Edinburgh and East Lothian will increase significantly, 26.6% and 18% respectively, against the approved programme for the current financial year.</p>

  <p>Consultation with partners is on-going, particularly with local authorities, to agree how these additional resources will be used. Local Housing Strategies are currently being developed by both the City of Edinburgh Council and East Lothian Council and this will inform investment priorities within local authority areas.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Persons proceeded against and convicted for drugs offences recorded in the North Ayrshire council area may also be dealt with in other courts, e.g. the High Court, but the number of such cases are not separately identifiable within the data held centrally.</p>

  <p>2. There is no sheriff court in North Ayrshire council area; however, the majority of persons proceeded against in the sheriff court for drug offences committed in North Ayrshire are believed to be dealt with by Kilmarnock Sheriff Court (which will also deal with offences committed in East Ayrshire).</p>

  <p>The Occupiers' Liability Scotland Act 1960 provides that an occupier of land has a duty to take such care, as is reasonable, to ensure that any person entering on their land will not suffer injury or damage due to the state of the premises or anything done or omitted to be done by them.</p>

  <p>Section 5(2) of the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 provides that the operation of Part 1 of the act, including the exercise of access rights, will not affect the duty of care owed by an occupier to any person present on the land. The extent of duty of care of land owners in respect of those exercising access rights will not therefore be greater than at present. Insurance premiums can vary due to a variety of factors. No useful purpose would, therefore, be served by the Scottish Executive monitoring the level of premiums following the implementation of Part 1 of the Land Reform (Scotland) Act.</p>

</table></p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The 1996-97 figures have been excluded, as prior to 1997-98, allocations were issued on a gross basis, which took into account capital receipts and they are not therefore comparable with later years. The table relates only to mainstream HRA allocations.</p>

  <p>2. Allocations from 1998-99 onwards have remained unchanged with the following exceptions:</p>

  <p>* Following discussions with Glasgow City Council allocations were reduced in the years 1999-2000 and 2000-01. This followed the agreement to transfer HRA debt associated with demolished housing stock from the HRA to the general fund, which resulted in a net saving of &#163;20 million to the council. The overall effect in terms of available resources was, therefore, neutral. The allocations were re-instated to previous levels in 2001-02. The 2002-03 allocation was reduced to reflect the recent transfer of the housing stock.</p>

  <p>**The 2002-3 allocation for Scottish Borders was reduced to reflect the recent transfer of stock.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the definition of &quot;capacity&quot; is under the Education (Publication and Consultation etc.) (Scotland) Regulations 1981 which states &quot;proposals must also be submitted to Scottish ministers if the school concerned has attendance which is greater than 80% of its capacity.&quot;</p>

  <p>Capacity is not defined in the 1981 regulations, as amended. The Education (Publication and Consultation etc) (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 1988, which amended the 1981 regulations, did, however, set out three criteria to which education authorities must have regard in calculating school capacity for the purposes of the regulations. These are:</p>

  <p>(i) the assessment of capacity on which the education authority have based their proposal;</p>

  <p>(ii) the maximum number of pupils in attendance at the school in any one year in the period of 10 years preceding the proposal, and</p>

  <p>(iii) the curriculum of the school.</p>

  <p>An explanatory circular issued to authorities in 1988 indicated that it would be for the education authority to determine the capacity of a school for the purpose of deciding if their proposals require the consent of ministers, and that they must make a reasonable assessment of capacity, taking into account the aforementioned criteria and any other relevant circumstances.</p>

  <p>Procurators fiscal subject each report submitted by the police to careful scrutiny and consideration to assess the sufficiency and quality of evidence before a decision is reached about taking proceedings. The police will be instructed to carry out any necessary further investigations. police/procurator fiscal liaison arrangements provide an opportunity to raise any issues arising from reporting. Once a decision has been taken to continue proceedings, material witnesses will be precognosced (interviewed) by a member of the procurator fiscal&#146;s team and the evidence subjected to further evaluation. Every police report prepared for submission to procurators fiscal is subject to internal quality control by the police.</p>

  <p>The two projects that closed down are as follows:</p>

  <p>The CHEAF (Change Health Equality Action Future) youth project, funded by Milton Social Inclusion Partnership (SIP), closed in June 2001 because it was unable to find suitable accommodation for its activities.</p>

  <p>The Environmental Improvements Task Force, funded by Greater Pollok SIP, closed during 2002-03 because of the withdrawal of private sector support.</p>

  <p><em>Meeting the Needs&#133;Priorities, Actions and Targets for Sustainable Development in Scotland</em> was not a consultation paper. As explained in paragraph 42 of <em>Meeting the Needs&#133;</em> , the Scottish Executive launched its consultation, <em>Checking for Change</em> , in May 2001 asking for views on ways in which progress towards more sustainable development could be measured using indicators.</p>

  <p>Following this consultation we adopted the 24 indicators listed in <em>Meeting the Needs&#133;</em> . In paragraph 43 we made a commitment to publish full data on each indicator and <em>Indicators of Sustainable Development for Scotland</em> represents the fulfilment of that commitment.</p>

  <p>In <em>Meeting the Needs&#133;</em> we stated that further information on transport indicators would be published later in 2002. <em>Scotland&#146;s Transport: Delivering Improvements, Transport Indicators for Scotland</em>, published on 19 December 2002, describes the 11 indicators we have chosen to chart progress on implementing our transport policies. As a result we have set new targets for Indicator 16 - Travel: mode, and Indicator 17 - Travel: accessibility, as set out in <em>Indicators of Sustainable Development for Scotland</em>.</p>

  <p>A new target has also been set for Indicator 5 &#150; Recycling, in the light of work undertaken to develop the National Waste Plan.</p>

  <p>The targets for Indicator 4 &#150; Waste: production, and Indicator 19 &#150; Preparing for life, have been revised, explanations for which are given on pages 12 and 46 of the report.</p>

  <p>As stated in the introduction of the report, we intend to set targets for some indicators in light of further policy and scientific work but for others it is more appropriate to monitor the trend than set a target.
