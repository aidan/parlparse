  <p>We do not propose to extend the period of formal consultation about the terms of the proposed designation of the Ythan catchment as a Nitrate Vulnerable Zone. The consultation paper on the proposed designation was widely publicised. It was sent to a large range of organisations and made available in local Rural Affairs Department and National Farmers Union offices and in public libraries. Responses from any person will be taken into account. We also expect to undertake a further formal consultation later in the year about proposed regulations for the action programme rules which farmers would be required to follow within the Zone.</p>

  <p>The provisional poundage figure I announced on 8 December was calculated to keep the total tax burden the same in real terms for Scottish businesses.

  <p>Standards in FE colleges are being considered as part of the review of management currently being carried out by the Scottish Further Education Funding Council. The review will identify best practice with a view to promulgating such examples throughout the FE sector.</p>

  <p>: Ministers have considered the final report of the National Goose Forum and have agreed that it should be published as a consultative document, which I expect will take place next month.

  <p>Each council&#8217;s expenditure guideline figure is calculated on the basis of its increase in Grant-Aided Expenditure and loan charge support. The distribution of GAE, as stated in my reply to Mr Gibson&#8217;s earlier question (S1W-3398), is based on a formula assessment of councils&#8217; relative expenditure needs agreed with CoSLA. Although Glasgow City Council&#8217;s increase in loan charges support for 2000-01 was above average, its increase in GAE was below average, largely because of the continuing phasing in of revised Social Work GAE indicators and the normal redistributive effects on a number of other service assessments within the agreed formula approach. As Glasgow&#8217;s GAE increase was the most significant component in the calculation of its guideline, this resulted in Glasgow having a correspondingly lower than average guideline increase.</p>

  <p>I shall answer this and Mr Lochhead&#8217;s subsequent question (S1W-3749) together.</p>

  <p>In the reply of 13 January to a similar question from Mr Lewis Macdonald (S1O-902) we explained that there is no single method of allocating resources for tackling deprivation across the range of the Executive&#8217;s programmes. The reply also pointed out that the <i>Social Justice Report,</i> published in November 1999, makes clear that we will exploring how planning systems can be developed to ensure expenditure is effective and relevant to the problems experienced by particular groups and communities.</p>

  <p>Weights and Measures legislation including metrication is a reserved matter. The Department of Trade and Industry made a UK-wide assessment of the expected compliance cost to business, including small firms arising out of the legislation.</p>

  <p>The main cost is likely to be for the conversion or replacement of weighing machines. Most machines should be able to be converted. The cost of conversion is expected on average to be around &pound;100.</p>

  <p>The enforcement of legislation relating to weights and measures is a matter for local authority trading standards departments. Trading standards departments will normally enforce the law by offering guidance rather than by taking enforcement action.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s position on the M74 Northern Extension was set out in my statement to Parliament on 4 November and in the report on the <i>Strategic Roads Review</i> which was published on the same day. As I explained on 13 January, in response to question S1O-917, discussion at my meeting with the council leaders on 21 December focused on how the councils might deliver their proposal. It is, however, for the councils, as the scheme&#8217;s promoters, to decide on all aspects of the procurement, including the scheme details. <br /></p>
