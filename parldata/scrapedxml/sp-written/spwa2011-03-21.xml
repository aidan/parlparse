  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many people have been diagnosed with alcohol-related dementia in each of the last five years, broken down by NHS board area.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2011-03-21.S3W-40549.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80379" speakername="Shona Robison" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-11/wa0321.htm#1">

  <p>The exact number of people diagnosed with alcohol-related dementia in Scotland is not available centrally.</p>

  <p>National estimates can be given of the number of patients consulting a GP or practice-employed nurse for this condition based on information obtained from a sample of Scottish general practices participating in PTI (Practice Team Information). Patients registered to PTI practices are representative of Scotland as a whole in terms of their age, gender and deprivation profile. The PTI sample is only representative at national level, so NHS board-level estimates cannot be provided. The last year for which PTI data are currently available is the year ending 31 March 2010.</p>

  <p>The following table shows the estimated number of patients who have consulted a GP or practice-employed nurse in Scotland at least once where a clinical code for alcohol-related dementia was recorded, for each of the financial years ending 31 March 2006 to 2010, based on PTI data.</p>

  <p>These figures are likely to underestimate the true numbers of patients in Scotland with alcohol-related dementia. This is because, for the purposes of this request, &quot;alcohol-related dementia&quot; is defined so as to include specific clinical coding for the following only: alcohol amnestic syndrome; Korsakov&rsquo;s alcoholic psychosis; Korsakov&rsquo;s alcoholic psychosis with peripheral neuritis; Wernicke-Korsakov syndrome; alcohol amnestic syndrome NOS; other alcoholic dementia; chronic alcoholic brain syndrome, and mental and behavioural disorders due to use alcohol: amnesic syndrome. Clinicians may in some cases use less specific codes than these ones for patients with alcohol-related dementia, and these cases will therefore not be captured in the estimates shown in the table.</p>

  <p>Since May 2007, the Scottish Government has continued work to translate the principles and recommendations of <em>Mind the Gaps</em> (2003) and <em>A Fuller Life</em> (2004) reports into practical advice on action needed to move the joint agenda forward and support joined-up local delivery to improve the awareness, support and service provision for people who have both mental health and substance misuse problems.</p>

  <p>The <em>Closing the Gaps &ndash; Making a Difference</em> report, published in December 2007, sets out six recommendations to be implemented by a range of partners including: NHS boards, Alcohol and Drug Partnerships (ADPs) (formerly Alcohol and Drug Action Teams (ADATs)) and local authorities.</p>

  <p>In 2010, the Mental Welfare Commission (MWC) <em>Missed Opportunities</em> report set out two recommendations for the Scottish Government in relation to alcohol-related brain damage. We have sought and received the advice of the Scottish Ministerial Advisory Committee on Alcohol Problems (SMACAP) Essential Services Working Group on these recommendations and are currently considering next steps.</p>

  <p>The majority of burial grounds in Scotland are publicly managed.

  <p>We are committed to providing appropriate and accessible NHS services which meet the needs of all ethnic minority communities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government and NHSScotland have a duty to undertake equality impact assessments (EQIA) of all policies and strategies. An important part of that process is to secure views from a wide range of organisations and communities (including ethnic minority communities) that may be directly or indirectly affected by policy developments or proposals.</p>

  <p>Guidance to NHS boards outlining the requirement to EQIA policies, issued in March 2005, is available at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/equalityanddiversity/IAtoolkit" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/equalityanddiversity/IAtoolkit</a>.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is fully aware of the need to consider issues concerning equalities groups, and to consult with equalities groups and have consulted with black and minority ethnic (BME) groups when developing anti-poverty strategies.</p>

  <p><em>Tackling Child Poverty in Scotland: A Discussion Paper</em> was open to public consultation and issued directly to the African and Caribbean Network.</p>

  <p>In addition to this, some more targeted consultation activities took place including working with bodies such as the Poverty Alliance and Young Scot, to elicit the views and experience of, and engage with families with direct experience of living in poverty, through focus groups and structured discussions with equality groups. The consultation processes also included meetings and events engaging key professionals from different sectors, including organisations representing BME groups.</p>

  <p><em>Taking Forward the Government Economic Strategy: A Discussion Paper on Tackling Poverty Inequality and Deprivation in Scotland </em>(the consultation that formed <em>Achieving Our Potential</em>) was also issued to a wide range of BME groups, including BEMIS (Black and Minority Infrastructure in Scotland).</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to promoting equality of opportunity and improving the levels of economic activity across all groups within society in Scotland. In implementing our refreshed skills strategy the Scottish Government and partners will continue to recognise people&rsquo;s differing needs, situations and goals and work to remove any barriers which restrict progress. In terms of skills and training provision, Skills Development Scotland&rsquo;s development of their products and services are informed by an Equality Advisory Group. Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) communities are represented on this group by Black and Ethnic Minority Infrastructure Scotland (BEMIS).</p>

  <p>While employment policy remains reserved to the UK Government, the Scottish Government continues to work hard to build capacity in the delivery of employability services in Scotland. Under our community planning arrangements, there are now active employability partnerships in all local authority areas in Scotland. In the Glasgow area the Scottish Government has supported Glasgow Works to develop and implement the Glasgow Works Ethnic Minority Policy Group Action Plan. This aims to eliminate racial inequality in the labour market and improve participation levels amongst ethnic minority groups in the city. Local initiatives for the African and Caribbean communities, supported by the Regeneration Agencies, include the Bridges Programme in Glasgow South West.</p>

  <p>The reasons these bids could not be supported was that the score of the bids against the full criteria used fell below that of the others. In the case of Highland, the bid&rsquo;s explanation of the impact on jobs, and the area and population covered, was weaker than the highest scoring bids. Other bids also provided technical solutions likely to deliver longer term sustainability.</p>

  <p>In the case of Cairngorm the bid did not explain the project delivery or the impact of the technology proposed as clearly as higher scoring bids.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, though both bids were sound, they scored less highly than the successful bids.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government provides support through the PACE (Partnership Action for Continuing Employment) Partnership to all individuals facing redundancy. The local PACE Partnership is aware of potential job losses at West Freugh and has contacted the company to offer advice and support. To date QinetiQ has declined the offer of this support as they already have arrangements in place to provide support to any staff facing redundancy. However, PACE support will remain available through partner organisations and can be accessed by employees.</p>

  <p>The type of support available through PACE will be tailored to meet individual needs and local circumstances but will include: Jobcentre Plus Scotland services; one-to-one counselling; comprehensive information packs; access to high-quality training; seminars on skills such as CV-writing and starting up a business.</p>

  <p>Bursary payments to Scottish students are paid out by Student Awards Agency Scotland (SAAS) for full-time higher education (HE) students, and the Scottish Funding Council (SFC) allocates further funds for further education (FE) students. The most recent year where data collection for bursary payments is complete is 2009-10, so this answer contains data for academic sessions 2005-06 to 2009-10.</p>

  <p>In these academic sessions, full-time Scottish students studying at HE level in Scotland are eligible to apply for Young Students&rsquo; Bursary (YSB). The bursary is income assessed, and is paid out to students who were under 25 before the first day of the first academic year of your course and have not been supporting themselves through earnings for at least three years. YSB is paid out instead of part of the maintenance loan, so it reduces the amount of loan that these students will be entitled to. Table 1 therefore shows the average YSB payments to full-time students for each institution in Edinburgh and Lothians, for 2005-06 to 2009-10.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Funding Council allocate money to college institutions in respect of students who are studying at further education level. These funds can be accessed by full-time students or part-time students on the basis of study, travel, or special educational needs. However, because institutions distribute the money as they see fit, the total number of students that benefited from these allocations of money was not available so it was not possible to calculate an average payment. Therefore, table 2 shows the total amounts allocated to each college in the Edinburgh and Lothians regions.</p>

  <p>The Food Standards Agency in Scotland advises that it employs a number of diet and nutrition outcome measures relating to health improvement. For example:</p>

  <p>In working to improve messaging about healthy eating, an FSA in Scotland project is being carried out by the University of Glasgow to develop a resource designed to help consumers (and health professionals) understand what eating a healthy diet over the period of a week entails. Continuing from this project FSA in Scotland will further explore the attitudes and understanding of both health professionals and consumers in relation to specific messages associated with healthy eating.</p>

  <p>To measure the diet of the Scottish population, FSA in Scotland runs a programme of diet and nutrition surveillance designed to measure progress towards the Scottish Dietary Targets. Outputs from this programme includes, where possible, breakdown by deprivation using the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation.</p>

  <p>To track progress made by the food industry to lower salt, fats and sugars in products, FSA in Scotland are currently working with Scottish Government to explore the analysis of market research data relating to retail food and drink purchases.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government remains fully committed to the themes set out in the original plan and continues to support these through policies like the Obesity Route Map, Recipe for Success: the National Food and Drink policy, Improving Maternal and Infant Nutrition: A Framework for Action and through our work with the Food Standards Agency Scotland.</p>

  <p>According to the Scottish Dietary Goals the target consumption is for an average intake to more than 400grams of fruit and vegetables per person per day. The 2009 Scottish Health Survey indicates a slight upward trend in personal fruit and vegetables consumption. It is not possible to compare the difference between national consumption and production with personal fruit and vegetables consumption.</p>

  <p>The amount of fruit and vegetables produced in Scotland is shown in the following table.</p>

  <p>The Food Standards Agency in Scotland advises that a survey carried out by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) in 2001 estimated that the average salt content of bread fell from 1.4g/100g in 1998 to 1.2g/100g in 2001, an average fall of 13%.</p>

  <p>Working with the food industry, in 2006 the FSA published the first set of voluntary targets for 85 categories of food including bread. The target for bread, set for achievement in 2010 was 1.1g/100g. A review of the salt targets carried out in 2008 to assess progress, indicated that most of the major supermarkets had already achieved the 2010 salt targets. Therefore, new more challenging targets were set for industry to work towards and achieve by 2012. The 2012 target for bread is 1.0g/100g.</p>

  <p>Bringing empty properties back into use is a matter for individual authorities. Where there are significant issues locally we would expect authorities to address these in their local housing strategies. However, a variety of information is collected and published on empty homes in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Information on empty homes in Scotland is primarily collected through data from the council tax system. This information is provided by local authorities and includes data on how many properties are unoccupied, how many properties are long term empty, how much of a discount is offered for long empty properties and how much money is raised by reducing the 50% discount for long term empty properties. This includes data for both private and social sectors. Information is also collected on second homes through these data collections on council tax. Information on long-term empty housing is not routinely published but is available on request from the Statistical Support for Local Government team (<a href="mailto:lgfstats@scotland.gsi.gov.uk">lgfstats@scotland.gsi.gov.uk</a>). More general council tax information can be found at:</p>

  <p>More information is also collected on vacancies specifically within local authority managed social properties. This information is also provided directly from local authorities and includes information on the number of vacancies, how long the properties have been vacant and the reasons why the properties are vacant. This information is published through the Housing Statistics for Scotland publication and can be found at:</p>

  <p>I have asked John Ewing, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service, to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>There is currently a requirement for all convicted prisoners to work during the core day Monday to Friday. This also includes a range of purposeful activity opportunities for self development, including education and training. While most of these opportunities are accessed in the establishments some are available as part of a work or education placement within the community. Prisoners also currently participate in offending behaviour programmes, health centre or community agency appointments during the normal working day.</p>

  <p>Forestry Commission Scotland has secured leading edge community benefits of up to &pound;5,000 per mw per annum for both wind and hydro developments. Communities, if they so wish, will be able to invest this payment in a share of the development. Also, they have the choice to add extra cash of their own to build a greater stake for the community.</p>

  <p>We estimate that this new programme could generate up to 500mw per annum and if this is realised then it could mean a windfall of &pound;2.5 million per annum for communities.</p>

  <p>The project Forestry Commission Scotland (FCS) undertook with Atkins Consultants had the main objective to build a GIS based analytical model to enable FCS to assess potential wind resource on the national forest estate. This objective was achieved and FCS routinely uses this to assess the potential of various forest blocks for different reasons. Atkins also ran the model as a part of the exercise and produced a report covering the NFE as part of the deliverables of the project. This, along with the analytical model was handed over to FCS in September 2008. Any report like this has its limitations and the main project output was the working model however, the report did provide the necessary confidence that there remained a reasonably significant wind energy resource on the NFE and that therefore it would be worth pursuing its development strategically. FCS has had no requests to release the report but would be happy to publish it on their website if required.</p>

  <p>Where Forestry Commission Scotland (FCS) was aware of community schemes that had started doing some preparatory work before the renewables contracts were announcement on 22 February, FCS built that knowledge into the arrangements by withholding the relevant forest blocks from the process. This has happened in the case of Dalavich, Strathyre and Mull.</p>

  <p>The Kintyre site was one of the short-term options that was included within the Draft Plan for Offshore Wind Energy in Scottish Territorial Waters. The Scottish Government has just published the plan which includes its view on the proposed offshore wind farm at Kintyre.</p>
