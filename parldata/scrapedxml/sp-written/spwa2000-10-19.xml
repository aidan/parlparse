  <p>The SE Network operates within an annual planning cycle. Each cluster plan developed by SE so far identifies key strategic objectives for development and anticipates the timescales and resources needed to achieve these objectives. The next stage, as defined in <i>Creative Scotland: Shaping the Future,</i> is to work with industry further to develop specific projects and interventions in the context of the agreed objectives. These are:</p>

  <p>Development of a dynamic flexible business environment</p>

  <p>Expansion and development of the existing talent and skills base</p>

  <p>Development of an environment in which innovation can flourish</p>

  <p>Development of an international reputation for Scotland&#8217;s Creative Industries</p>

  <p>To assist in detailed action planning, the SE Network is working with four key industry focus groups in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dundee and Aberdeen. However, from our industry consultation to date several priority projects have emerged. These are:</p>

  <p>Pacific Quay site development</p>

  <p>Dundee Creative Industry Campus</p>

  <p>Market Entry Programme into London and North America.</p>

  <p>Investment will be allocated to these projects in the forthcoming year, subject to the SE Network annual budget allocation process.</p>

  <p>The Pacific Quay development in Glasgow, and:</p>

  <p>SEn is already investing in these projects with the aim of facilitating the right conditions within which the private sector will provide and maintain any incubation facilities.</p>

  <p>In relation to the transfer of ideas across the creative industries, SE has already started the process of developing regional and national networks under the following banners:</p>

  <p>Creativescotland.com (national web resource)</p>

  <p>Creative Edinburgh</p>

  <p>Creative Glasgow</p>

  <p>Creative Aberdeen</p>

  <p>Interactive Tayside.</p>

  <p>The first of these regional networks will be launched on November 13 in Edinburgh. It is through these networks that the transfer and commercialisation of ideas across the creative industries cluster will be encouraged.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for the regulation of the mortgage market is a reserved matter, but I understand that the Financial Services Agency is issuing a new consumer factsheet, explaining how endowment holders should take up any complaints with the firm which sold them the endowment and how to take their case to the Ombudsman if the firm&#8217;s response is unsatisfactory. It also includes information about how consumers can seek compensation if they feel they were in any way misled at the point of sale and may have lost out financially as a result.</p>

  <p>Yes. The scale to which new entrants are invited was last set from 1 August 1999, and is &pound;18,963 to &pound;34,071. Using this scale, during the last recruitment round 25 new deputes were appointed, including several with appropriate experience in other legal organisations. Over two years 66 deputes have been recruited to fill posts throughout Scotland.</p>

  <p>All pay scales are currently being reviewed in pay negotiations. The need to maintain pay scales which are sufficient to recruit, maintain and motivate staff is the key objective of the department in these negotiations.</p>

  <p>Procurators Fiscal are issued with confidential guidelines regarding the use of fiscal fines as an alternative to prosecution. In general the Procurator Fiscal must first be satisfied that there is sufficient evidence to justify prosecution and that a prosecution would otherwise be in the public interest. Thereafter he must consider a number of circumstances including (1) the type of offence, (2) the circumstances of the accused and (3) any other circumstances relevant to the commission of the offence. Specific guidance is given as to the type of offences that may be suitable for a &quot;fiscal fine&quot;. Likewise guidance is given as to the circumstances in which a fiscal fine should not be issued.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Private nursing homes are not specifically designated for older people, although the majority (92.5% at 31 March 1999) of residents are aged over 65.</p>

  <p>The above table excludes a small number of nursing homes (around 30) for which data were not supplied.</p>

  <p>2. Residential care homes are designated as being primarily intended for older people, but it is possible that some residents will be from other client groups.</p>

  <p>I understand from the Convenor of the HPG that bomb-proofing requires increased performance standards for construction methods used on the new Parliament building, and for materials which must be typically stronger, thicker, or denser than for standard uses. As this is a fundamental aspect of the project brief, and integral to the building design, no cost studies have been carried out for options excluding bomb-proofing, and no accurate cost comparison figures are therefore available.</p>
