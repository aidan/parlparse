  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-34233 by Alex Neil on 14 June 2010, whether it can confirm that the Scottish Neighbourhood Statistics database shows that the Scottish Government&rsquo;s preferred indicator of child poverty recorded a figure of 45% in 2007-08.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-07-23.S3W-34953.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80370" speakername="Alex Neil" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa0723.htm#1">

  <p>The figure of 45 percent quoted above appears on the Scottish Neighbourhood Statistics and Scottish Government websites and refers to the proportion of children in Scotland living in households that are dependent on out of work benefits or where Child Tax Credit is more than the family element. At a local authority level this is used as a proxy indicator for child poverty and is the Scottish Government&rsquo;s current preferred indicator for examining the distribution of child poverty across local authorities. It is not however comparable to the official child poverty estimates which are published for Scotland and the UK.</p>

  <p>At a Scotland level the Scottish Government uses the Family Resources Survey (FRS) to measure child poverty and the 2008-09 figures for the preferred child poverty indicators are as follow:</p>

  <p>Percentage of children in relative poverty (Before Housing Costs): 21 percent.</p>

  <p>Percentage of children in absolute poverty (Before Housing Costs): 11 percent.</p>

  <p>Percentage of children in material deprivation and low income combined: 16 percent.</p>

  <p>FRS figures are not available at local authority level or for smaller geographical areas and so proxy indicators, such as the one quoted above, are used for poverty research concerning these areas.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has no immediate plans to publish economic forecasts for the Scottish economy. The Chief Economic Adviser regularly publishes an assessment on the future prospects for the Scottish economy within the State of the Economy publication series. This draws together existing evidence, including independent forecasts, to help inform our understanding of the future performance of the Scottish economy.</p>

  <p>AEGON has stressed that it is determined to work with its employees and the unions at the facility to minimise job losses and in particular, compulsory redundancies at its Edinburgh office.</p>

  <p>AEGON is unable, at this time, to offer any details on the numbers involved in any proposed job reductions in Edinburgh but, should job losses occur, the Scottish Government will, through Skills Development Scotland, coordinate local response teams under the Partnership Action for Continuing Employment (PACE) initiative, to provide tailored help and support.</p>

  <p>The Finance Sector Jobs Taskforce is aware of the situation and will engage directly with the company at the right time.</p>

  <p>Employment policy is reserved to the UK Government. However, the Scottish Government is doing all that it can, within the scope of its current powers, to promote employment opportunities across Scotland.</p>

  <p>For example:</p>

  <p>We are supporting six Urban Regeneration Companies (URCs) to deliver wide-ranging regeneration strategies in some of our poorest communities. All of these aim to create new employment opportunities for local people. We have invested &pound;127 million in these projects since 2004; &pound;92 million since 2007.</p>

  <p>We are encouraging the use of Community Benefit clauses, which help to ensure that local people benefit from training and job opportunities arising from the physical transformation of their area. As well as the Commonwealth Games project in Glasgow, there are good examples of this in places like Raploch and Dundee. See the Scottish Government website for more details <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/Procurement/policy/procurecombenefits" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/Procurement/policy/procurecombenefits</a></p>

  <p>Through ScotAction, we have invested &pound;145 million to support the skills needs not only of the unemployed, but also of those in work and those facing redundancy. We are also in the process of rolling out an integrated employment and skills service across Scotland. Delivered in partnership by Jobcentre Plus and Skills Development Scotland, this service will help to ensure that all unemployed people have timely access to appropriate careers advice and training.</p>

  <p>We continue to work closely with CPPs and local employability partnerships to join up and otherwise enhance support for those out of work, as well as to promote enterprise and healthy working lives. This includes work to develop links between employability and, for example, the health and voluntary sectors. For more details, visit: <a href="http://www.employabilityinscotland.com/" target="_blank">http://www.employabilityinscotland.com/</a>.</p>

  <p>In February we launched a Supported Employment Framework for people with disabilities. The Framework aims to ensure that supported employment is seen as a valued and integral part of local mainstream employment services. See <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2010/02/23093849/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2010/02/23093849/0</a> for details.</p>

  <p>East Lothian Council submitted their formal objection to Cockenzie proposal to Scottish ministers on 29 June 2010.</p>

  <p>Under paragraph 2(2) of Schedule 8 of The Electricity Act 1989, when the relevant planning authority objects to a proposal, and that objection is not withdrawn, Scottish minister must cause a public inquiry to be held.</p>

  <p>A determination by Scottish ministers will not be made until this Inquiry has been held, and the resultant report received for consideration.

  <p>Public representations are a material consideration for applications submitted under s36 of the Electricity Act. Although the statutory consultee period for these applications is 28 days, Scottish ministers remain open to representations up until a determination is made. Any individual, or group, with an interest in the Cockenzie development are invited to submit their views.

  <p>Most of the data requested is not held centrally. However, information is held on the numbers of patients aged 16 and over, who are registered to a Scottish general practice and have been recorded as being obese (with a body mass index/BMI of 30 or more). This data is available through the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) of the new General Medical Services contract. QOF is a part of the new General Medical Services contract, and comprises a framework of indicators that practices much achieve against in order to receive QOF funding.</p>

  <p>Tables 1 and 2 show the numbers of patients aged over 16, with a BMI of 30 or over, included on QOF obesity registers for Scotland and in each NHS Board, for the financial years 2007-08 and 2008-09.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. QOF registers can potentially include a mixture of patients who are defined as obese and morbidly obese, but as the QOF reports only the total numbers of patients on the obesity register in each practice the figures cannot be broken down to count each group separately.</p>

  <p>2. QOF obesity registers can include patients newly recorded as being obese and those previously recorded as being obese, so the numbers for the two years are also likely to include many of the same patients.</p>

  <p>3. The QOF-reported prevalence of obesity, at around 7% for Scotland, is much lower than the rates reported in population surveys (for example the 2008 Scottish Health Survey reported that 26% of men and 27.5% of women aged over 16 years were obese).</p>

  <p>NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde have confirmed that all correspondence from elected members concerning constituent complaints are handled in accordance with the national NHS Complaints Procedure. Most complaints raised under the national NHS Complaints Procedure should receive a response within 20 working days. In a limited number of cases, NHS boards may need more time to provide a full response. In such cases, the relevant board should contact the correspondent to explain the delay and provide an estimate of when it expects to respond in full.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has not made projections of the levels of homelessness by the end of 2012, nor of the number of new social housing units that need to be created in order to meet the 2012 homelessness target. The Scottish Government and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities have jointly agreed a strategy to address the 2012 target. The four strands of the strategy are: continued leadership at both political and corporate level; preventing homelessness where possible; ensuring that all housing providers work together to maximise the access of homeless households to existing stock (both RSL and the private rented sector), and investing where appropriate to meet need. The number of homeless households in 2012 will depend, among other things, on the effectiveness of councils&rsquo; prevention strategies and the number of social housing units needed will depend on both the number of homeless households and the ways in which councils are able to use their new powers to discharge homelessness duties through the private rented sector.</p>

  <p>In a series of seminars in autumn 2009, councils were provided with spreadsheet based models to allow them to explore the impact of prevention and new social house building on the need for lets to homeless households each year, up to and beyond 2012. The recent allocation of money to local authorities for new build had homelessness as a key criterion.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government and COSLA 2012 Steering Group held a prevention event in June this year which promoted the development of the housing options approach. This looks to prevent homelessness and also identify a more sustainable outcome for homeless households. This will impact on the number of homeless households presenting to local authorities.</p>

  <p>The estimated uptake of influenza A (H1N1) vaccination for those under the age of 65 years and in a clinical at-risk group (including pregnant women) is 52.1%. The estimated uptake of vaccine for those aged 65 years and over in a clinical at-risk group is 56.2%. These data are based on estimates from automatic reporting from 95.3% of general practices in Scotland on 4 April 2010.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to provide an estimate for uptake in the household contacts of the immuno-compromised group, as these individuals are not specifically coded on the IT systems used in general practices.</p>

  <p>The estimated uptake rate for frontline health care staff is 55.1%. The estimated uptake rate for frontline social care staff is 32%. These figures are based on the numbers of people vaccinated considered against the numbers eligible for vaccination as reported to HPS by the NHS boards.</p>

  <p>Phase 2 of the immunisation programme recommended H1N1 immunisation for all children over six months of age and under five years. The estimated uptake of vaccine among healthy children under five years of age is 44.5%. Using the Scottish Immunisation Recall System (SIRS) it is not possible to separately identify children in an at-risk category from those who are healthy, therefore this figure will also include vaccinations given to children at-risk where this has been recorded on SIRS.</p>

  <p>The table below sets out the budget allocation and the outturn figure for the Court of the Lord Lyon since 2005, which is the earliest year for which records are held internally within the Scottish Government. An outturn figure is not yet available for the current financial year. In addition to funding from Scottish Government the Court receives income from court fees, also shown in the table below. This is offset against their budget with the Scottish Government ultimately funding only the difference between their income and expenditure.</p>

  <p>The inquiry referred to was held under the terms of section 103B of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. The act does not address the legal status of evidence given at such inquiries, nor the extent to which witnesses at such inquiries are protected by privilege. It is not for the Scottish Government to provide legal advice to others. It would be for the courts to determine the extent to which the common law principles of qualified or other privilege give protection in the circumstances of a particular case.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of the appointment of senior psychologists to the role of approved clinician under mental health legislation for England and Wales, whether it will consider extending the role of chartered psychologists, who under Part 8 of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 can be responsible for the treatment of mental disorder for patients on probation orders, to a wider Resident Medical Officer-type role in appropriate cases.</p>

  <p>In determining the requirements for the role of Approved Medical Practitioner*(AMP), prior to the enactment of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003, the role of chartered psychologists as AMPs was considered and rejected. Having chartered psychologists as AMPs would result in a duplication of work as patients who are detained under the 2003 act are usually on medication and would already have medical input from doctors (AMPs) responsible for prescribing medication and for their detention.</p>

  <p>Note: *An Approved Medical Practitioner (AMP) is a medical practitioner who has been approved under section 22 of the 2003 Act by an NHS board or the State Hospitals Board for Scotland as having special experience in the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorder.</p>

  <p>Those adults accessing mental health services for the first time or within unplanned or crisis care usually do so quickly, and we are already addressing those areas affected by the longest waits in planned access to care.</p>

  <p>We have established the first ever mental health waiting time target for access to specialist child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) which means by March 2013 no one will wait longer than 26 weeks. We are also investing &pound;6.5 million over three years to increase the number of psychologists working in specialist CAMHS. A further &pound;2 million per year is available to NHS boards on a recurring basis to accelerate the development of specialist CAMHS.</p>

  <p>We are also investing and working with NHS boards and NHS Education for Scotland to expand and improve access to evidence based psychological therapies. This includes a commitment to develop an access target for psychological therapies for inclusion in HEAT in 2011-12.</p>

  <p>The Patient Rights (Scotland) Bill will also include mental health services in its aims to establish a 12 week treatment time guarantee for patients receiving elective or planned treatment on an inpatient or day case basis. Where mental health services are delivered on this basis then the treatment time guarantee will apply.</p>

  <p>All NHS boards in Scotland provide access to a range of child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) with specialist inpatient services provided on a regional basis.</p>

  <p>Considerable progress has been made in recent years both in mapping out what needs to be done and in delivering the changes that will be required now and in the future to improve these vital services. This has involved work in many different areas including training and workforce planning; increasing hospital bed numbers; reducing inappropriate hospital admissions; early intervention; supported transitions; improved primary care, and better planning and delivery of specialist care.</p>

  <p>We have established a 26 week HEAT target for access to specialist CAMHS to be achieved by March 2013; further supported the development of CAMHS specialist services by investing an additional &pound;2 million per year on a recurring basis, and we have made available &pound;6.5 million new money over three years from 2009-10 to develop the CAMHS psychology workforce and support additional training places and posts.</p>

  <p>Access to a range of evidence based psychological therapies is available across all NHS boards in Scotland.</p>

  <p>In line with the principle of participation in the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Scotland Act 2003, service uses should be fully involved so far as they are able to be in all aspects of their assessment, care, treatment and support. Decisions about the best treatment will take into account the clinical evidence, patient choice and the appropriateness of the patient for a particular treatment.</p>

  <p>We are committed to working with NHS boards and NHS Education for Scotland to improve access to psychological therapies across Scotland. We are also developing an access target for psychological therapies for inclusion in HEAT in 2011-12.</p>

The Museums Think Tank is considering, as part of its remit, how best to achieve a sustainable future for our industrial collections and I look forward to discussing their conclusions later in the summer.

  <p>I was pleased to visit the Scottish Maritime Museum on 14 June to open the new PS Lochlomond gallery, to announce an additional &pound;100,000 funding for the museum, and to hear about its work and future challenges. The financial situation of the Scottish Maritime Museum and other industrial museums is being considered by the Museums Think Tank. Museums Galleries Scotland is working with the Maritime Museum to help ensure the development of a sustainable business model for the museum.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises the importance of preserving Scotland&rsquo;s maritime heritage. The Marine (Scotland) Bill received Royal Assent on 14 March 2010. This will allow us to create Historic Marine Protected Areas for our heritage at sea while heritage designations around our coast already recognise the significance of 107 historic lighthouses and 90 harbours. The Scottish Government is also investing in our maritime heritage. Over the last five years, Historic Scotland&rsquo;s Building Repair Grant Scheme has contributed &pound;2.5 million. Over the last two years, Museums and Galleries Scotland has invested approximately &pound;1.3 million in Scottish Government funding towards maritime heritage through its grants schemes.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has ongoing discussions with COSLA about local authorities&rsquo; approach to tackling poverty, as set out in Achieving Our Potential (the Scottish Government and COSLA framework). This has included discussion of what support and guidance is needed by Community Planning Partnerships and strategic public authorities to ensure that tackling poverty is given due regard in strategic decision-making, including commitments within single outcome agreements.</p>

  <p>Question S3W-34473 referred to a &quot;living wage&quot; which is generally understood to mean a wage over and above the statutory national minimum wage and the answer was provided in that context. Contractors engaging UK workers are required to comply with UK employment law including the National Minimum Wage Act 1998. It is imposing a requirement to go further than the 1998 Act that could restrict the freedom to provide services guaranteed by article 56 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p>

  <p>Public liability obligations are not affected by designation of land as a core path under the provisions of the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003.</p>

  <p>The nature of the liability obligations applicable on land to which the public have a right of access will depend on the particular circumstances. The Occupiers&rsquo; Liability (Scotland) Act 1960 and the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 provide that land managers owe a duty of care to other people on their property. Members of the public also owe a duty of care to others, particularly if they are taking part in potentially hazardous activities. Persons taking access to land would generally be held to have accepted any obvious risk or risks inherent in the activities they are undertaking.</p>

  <p>The seasonal nature of some of the Scottish Government public information campaigns means that the majority of activity takes place over the winter and into the spring. This is a pattern consistent with previous years, both under this and the previous administration.</p>

  <p>Projected expenditure on Social Advertising and Public Information campaigns in the first quarter of 2011 is currently estimated at &pound;3,360,000 including VAT. However, this is subject to business planning variations and fluctuations to the media market. For each of the past three years, quarter one expenditure was &pound;5,956,720 in 2008, &pound;6,610,869 in 2009 and &pound;5,035,714 in 2010.</p>

The licence can be downloaded from the link below. The Scottish Government does not keep a record of general licences issued. The general licence does require returns.
