  <p>Scotland&#8217;s growth performance over recent years has been strong and, although output in Scotland fell marginally in the first quarter of 2000, GDP rose by 2.3% over the four quarters to March 2000 compared to the four previous quarters. Prospects remain good and independent forecasters predict continued growth over the next two years.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has just published for the first time a <i>Framework for Economic Development in Scotland</i>. The Framework is firmly focused on the underlying economic conditions necessary to stimulate economic growth and how we can meet the challenges of a highly competitive global environment.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive also published a manufacturing strategy earlier this year, and is currently engaged with the agricultural industry and other interested parties in devising a strategy to assist the future viability and sustainability of Scottish farming.</p>

  <p>All new overhead lines require the consent of Scottish Ministers under section 37 of the Electricity Act 1989.

  <p>The 1987 Act does not define &quot;other special reasons&quot;, and it is not possible to list all potential special reasons for vulnerability. The Code of Guidance on Homelessness, updated in October 1998 provides advice to local authorities, and lists examples of those who may be considered vulnerable for special reasons.
