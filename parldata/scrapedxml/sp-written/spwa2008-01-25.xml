  <p>Funding allocations were not calculated with specific reference to adoption services within grant aided expenditure for these years. Whilst local government had flexibility to allocate other resources to this area, the specific amounts allocated to local government under the more general heading of Casework and Related Administration &ndash; Children, which would include adoption services, were as follows:</p>

  <p>2003-04: &pound;66.4 million</p>

  <p>2004-05: &pound;68.9 million</p>

  <p>2005-06: &pound;71.5 million</p>

  <p>2006-07: &pound;73.4 million.</p>

  <p>Some spending on children and young people will have been subsumed within budgets that covered services to people of all ages - e.g. community health - and as such, it is not possible to identify the total budget for children and young people over this period. It is not therefore possible to present this as a percentage of the budget for children and young people.</p>

  <p>Local government will receive &pound;34.8 billion over three years in overall financial support, an increase of &pound;1.4 billion. Moreover provided local authorities sign a single outcome agreement ring-fenced funding streams will be reduced and councils will be able to redeploy all efficiency savings. However, this government doesn&rsquo;t believe in dictating to local government. It will be the responsibility of each local authority to allocate the total financial resources available to it on the basis of local needs and priorities and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities including class sizes reduction.</p>

  <p>The Project Board for the Review of Civil Judicial Statistics last met on 13 April 2006. Correspondence with the board has occurred since this meeting via email, with the most recent communication taking place during summer 2007.</p>

  <p>As part of the review, research has recently been carried out with users, and potential users, of civil judicial statistics, to identify their data requirements and suggestions for a revised <em>Civil Judicial Statistics</em> publication. The next step for the review is to consider each of the responses submitted as part of this research, and develop a specification for the revised dataset and publication. The first draft of this specification is expected to be produced by spring 2008.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will provide a total of &pound;16 million of additional funding, over the next three financial years (2008-09 to 2011-12), to reconfigure and modernise NHS wheelchair and seating services. The resources will be allocated to the five rehabilitation centres in Scotland following the submission of a robust business case from each of the five centres, and its approval by the Wheelchair and Seating Services Project Board.</p>

  <p>In 2006-07 NHS boards provided approximately &pound;15 million in total for wheelchair and seating services. Further detailed analysis is not available in the format requested.</p>

  <p>It is a matter for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to determine in light of the revised guidance whether charging is necessary and justified to manage the car parking space available at Inverclyde Royal, Vale of Leven and Royal Alexandra hospitals.</p>

  <p>In accordance with the revised car parking guidance published on 18 January 2008, through their travel plans NHS boards have a responsibility to work with local and regional partners to help to ensure good access to NHS sites for patients, carers, visitors and staff. At most NHS sites, car parking should be free of charge, however, NHS boards may make reasonable charges for car parking as part of a planned approach to facilitating access to sites and to cover the costs of car park provision.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to improving the health of Scotland&rsquo;s children. We have fully supported the passage of the Schools (Health Promotion and Nutrition) (Scotland) Act 2007 which will require all schools to put health promotion at the heart of its activities, including the curriculum. The health promotion guidance that will accompany the act will include information on food education. The Curriculum for Excellence draft outcomes and experiences grouped under health and wellbeing, will be published in mid-May as part of the work on the curriculum review, are likely to include opportunities for teachers to develop young people&rsquo;s knowledge and understanding of current food issues including practical food preparation.</p>

  <p>The act will also introduce new nutritional requirements which will go beyond school lunches and set standards for food and drinks in school vending machines and tuck shops. The Minister for Children and Early Years, Adam Ingram, has considered proposals from an Expert Working Group and has now decided on these nutritional requirements for Scottish schools. The requirements will be written into legislation and apply from August 2008, subject to parliamentary approval. Details of the proposed requirements are available on the Scottish Government website at:</p>

  <p>We are currently carrying out a free school meals trial for primary 1 to primary 3 pupils. This is part of our drive to encourage good eating habits from a young age. The trial will enable us to establish whether&#63; the provision of free nutritious school meals in this age group can help bring about a shift towards healthy eating habits and social behaviour both at home and in school.</p>

  <p>The 2007 report of the Mobile Telecommunications Health Research (MTHR) programme, found no association between mobile phone use and any biological or adverse health effects. Advice from the UK governments on mobile phone use is provided in their leaflet on Mobile Phones and Health. This recommends &quot;a precautionary approach&quot; to the use of mobile phones, particularly for children, including keeping calls short, and not using mobile phones when driving. The need to update this leaflet, and the associated advice on Mobile Phone Base Stations and Health, in the light of the findings of the MTHR programme and other research internationally is currently under consideration. Meanwhile, the advice from the UK governments remains as that in the current leaflets.</p>
