  <p>The information presented in the answer to question S2W-21935 was compiled by the General Register Office for Scotland using its standard methodology. For residents of Scotland, deaths are allocated to the area of usual residence. For persons usually resident outside Scotland, deaths are allocated to the area where the death occurred. The latter category generally covers under 1 per cent of all deaths in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not available centrally for all years or for all local authority areas.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Parliament Information Centre holds tables (Bib. number 38938) which show, those local authority areas available:</p>

  <p>Tables 1a, 1b &amp; 1c: Children identified as undernourished (the 2% of the population with the lowest BMI) for those who have received a 39 to 42 month pre-school review, by local authority area and year of birth.</p>

  <p>Tables 2a, 2b &amp; 2c: Children identified as undernourished (the 2% of the population with the lowest BMI) for those who have received a primary 1, 7 and secondary 3 review (aged approximately four to five, 11 to 12 and 14 to 15 years respectively), by local authority area and year of birth.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that there is no set international definition for undernourished children, hence the tables offer an indication only. Although underweight for their age, such children do not necessarily suffer from any health problems.</p>

  <p>The Crown Estate is not generally exempt from legislation or regulations passed by the Scottish Parliament. For example Scottish planning law can be applied to the Estate. However, the management of the Crown Estate remains a reserved matter.</p>

A third was to help identify persons on a force&rsquo;s dangerous offenders register who did not have profiles on the National DNA Database.</p>

  <p>The remaining six requests that were approved were to inform research in areas that may assist in future investigations. One of these sought anonymised samples, one sought profiles and four sought anonymised profiles held by the database.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive currently has no information as to whether legislation will be forthcoming to extend the new gender duty to the private sector. However, where a private contractor delivers a service on behalf of the public sector, the contractor will be performing a &quot;public function&quot; and therefore will be subject to the duty and be responsible for complying with it. This is a complex matter and guidance will be issued by the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) in due course.</p>

  <p>It was agreed in partnership with trades unions and professional organisations at a UK level as part of the overall Agenda for Change agreement that the outcomes of the job evaluation scheme would be checked for consistency and accuracy.</p>

  <p>There are two strands to this process in NHSScotland, both performed in partnership. Local systems ensure that there is consistency in outcome across the individual matching panels within their area. A national monitoring group ensures that job evaluation outcomes are accurate and consistent across the whole of NHSScotland. Approval from the national monitoring group is required before staff groups can be assimilated to the new Agenda for Change paybands.</p>

  <p>NHSScotland has made significant progress in the implementation of Agenda for Change. In terms of job evaluation, over 85% of posts which have been submitted to matching panels have been matched against national profiles, with around 53,000 staff having passed through the local consistency and national monitoring process in readiness for assimilation. Health boards have also made progress in locally evaluating those posts which do not fit national job profiles. It is anticipated that all staff, either job matched or locally evaluated, will be paid on the Agenda for Change paybands by October 2006.</p>

  <p>In common with NHSScotland generally, significant progress has been made in implementing Agenda for Change in the Scottish Ambulance Service. The majority of staff within the Scottish Ambulance Service have now been through the job matching process and the National Monitoring Group are currently monitoring outcomes. The process of notifying staff of job matching outcomes commenced on 17 February 2006.</p>

  <p>Centrally held information can provide details for patients where malnutrition is identified on their hospital records. These figures <i>may</i> represent an undercount of the true number of cases because malnutrition could be an underlying reason for admission to hospital and, as such, will not always be recorded.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Parliament Information Centre holds tables (Bib. number 38937) which present the number of patients discharged from acute hospitals in Scotland with a diagnosis of malnutrition broken down by NHS board of residence (table 1) and Scottish Parliamentary Constituency (table 2). Patients with more than one discharge in a year are only counted once.</p>

  <p>Since 1999, the CSO has funded one research project in 2002 on the impact of malnutrition in Scottish school children and adolescents at a cost of &pound;16,748.</p>

  <p>In this time, the CSO has also funded a number of research projects on nutrition and nutrient deficiencies in groups of people at risk from malnourishment.

  <p>There are no plans to do so. Following approval by the Minister for Health in 2002, it is for NHS Fife to take forward the proposed development of healthcare services set out in <i>Right for Fife</i> . In doing so, I would expect the board to take account of and ensure consistency with national policy and guidelines, including those set out in <i>Delivering for Health</i> . I would also expect NHS Fife to continue to involve local communities in Fife in the implementation of its proposals.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally. However, NHS Quality Improvement Scotland published Clinical Standards on Food, Fluid and Nutritional Care in Hospitals in September 2003. These were developed in response to research which showed that patients in hospital could be at risk of malnutrition. The standards cover patient assessment on admission to hospital; the delivery of food and nutrition, and education and training of staff. The standards are published at:</p>

  <p>Crown immunity applied to all NHS bodies from the date of the creation of the NHS, 5 July 1948, until its removal by means of the NHS and Community Care Act 1990 which came into force on 1 April 1991. Immunity therefore applied to all NHS premises during this period. In 1986, however, the NHS (Amendment) Act 1986 removed Crown immunity from the NHS in respect of food hygiene and health and safety legislation.</p>

  <p>Following consideration of the support available for these students, I decided that, with effect from September 2005, the Nursing and Midwifery Student Bursary Scheme should be amended to include a concession that will allow nursing and midwifery students to continue to receive support if they have to suspend their studies in certain circumstances. These circumstances can include where they have caring duties, long-term illness or illness or other issues arising from pregnancy and childbirth.</p>

  <p>This approach is consistent with the current arrangements in Scotland for all other undergraduates including allied health professions, medical and dental students. The Higher Education Institutions and the Students Awards Agency for Scotland have been notified of this change to the bursary scheme.</p>

The issues examined by the working party included the cost and staff resource implications of the proposals contained in the White Paper, <i>Modernising the Planning System</i> . The working party is finalising its report which will be published later this spring.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Executive commissioned the consultants Ove Arup and Partners in April 2005 to assess comprehensively the impact of the white paper proposals for reform of the planning system.

  <p>I previously advised that the initial stages of the review would be overseen by a steering group drawn from the Government&rsquo;s Radioactive Waste Policy Group (RWPG). I said that the steering group would be organising two national stakeholder workshops during 2005 to support consideration of the issues and possible solutions, and that this would contribute to the preparation and issue of a consultation by the Executive, in conjunction with UK government and the administrations of Wales and Northern Ireland, on the revised policy proposals.</p>

  <p>This work has been completed and has resulted in the publication today of the consultation document <i>A Public Consultation on Policy for the Long-Term Management of Solid Low Level Radioactive Waste in the United Kingdom</i>, copies of which have been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 38918). This consultation is being sponsored jointly by the Scottish Executive, the UK government, the Welsh Assembly Government and the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment. Responses to the consultation are due by 31 May 2006.</p>

  <p>The LLW management policy review is being carried out for three main reasons:</p>

  <p>the national LLW disposal facility, near to Drigg in Cumbria, does not have sufficient capacity to meet future forecasts of LLW arisings. Indeed, I understand that the Environment Agency&rsquo;s on-going review of the site&rsquo;s disposal authorisation has served to call into question its previously estimated capacity;</p>

  <p>the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) must have the necessary disposal routes available if it is to progress its decommissioning and clean-up programme of the UK&rsquo;s older, publicly-owned civil nuclear sites. It is also questionable whether the large amounts of lightly contaminated rubble and soil that will arise from such decommissioning and clean-up should be dug up and transported over large distances, merely to deposit it again at the LLW disposal facility close to Drigg, which is a limited and relatively expensive national resource, and</p>

  <p>finding small scale treatment and disposal routes (in particular incineration and landfill) for the least radioactive LLW, which are particularly important for non-nuclear users of radioactive waste, such as hospitals, research and educational establishments is proving increasingly difficult.</p>

  <p>The policy proposals on which views are being sought include:</p>

  <p>whether we should allow greater flexibility in the way LLW is managed. Government proposes that it should not all be sent to the LLW disposal site near to Drigg in Cumbria. This would particularly apply to the large amounts of very low activity LLW that will arise from decommissioning and clean-up activities that could be disposed in various ways, at the site of arising if this is the best practicable option. But this flexibility must also maintain the necessary level of safety through the use of a risk-informed approach, and the preparation of plans and safety cases that are acceptable to the regulatory bodies;</p>

  <p>coupled with this more flexible approach to disposal, could we effectively place greater emphasis on minimisation of arisings through use of the waste management hierarchy advocated for other forms of non-radioactive waste management;</p>

  <p>whether the NDA should be placed in the lead for providing disposal facilities for all nuclear LLW, and also whether it should make its disposal facilities available for non-nuclear LLW producers where this practicable, subject to appropriate commercial arrangements. It is also proposed that the NDA would be placed in the lead for securing any replacement to the LLW disposal facility close to Drigg, and</p>

  <p>whether local communities should take greater responsibility, through appropriate use of planning strategies, for dealing with non-nuclear LLW arising from non-nuclear producers &ndash; e.g. hospitals and research and educational establishments &ndash; that serve their community. Government proposes to contribute to this process by commissioning a study of the extent and geographical distribution of arisings of such non-nuclear industry wastes.</p>

  <p>The LLW management policy review is being carried out in parallel with the work of the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management (CoRWM), which is assessing options for the long-term management of the UK&rsquo;s higher activity wastes. The outcome of the LLW consultation, and the policy statement resulting from it, should be available in the summer of this year at about the same time as CoRWM delivers its higher activity waste management recommendations.</p>

  <p>Local authorities in Scotland are performing service reviews of all services provided under the Supporting People programme and all services reviews are to be completed by March 2007. The Scottish Executive believes that significant efficiencies are achievable in the programme and will expect to see evidence of that for the next spending review, but monitoring arrangements will also allow local authorities to record any adverse impact of budget changes on services and service users. The information in the monitoring returns will be made available to the Supporting People Service Review Impact Group to inform their report to ministers on the impact of the service review process. Monitoring returns will be twice a year and started in October 2005.</p>

  <p>At present, there is no strong evidence that particular services or client groups are being disproportionately affected and local authorities have already shown they are free to shift funding across from other sources to support services.</p>

  <p>It is up to local authorities to decide what housing support services they provide and how many staff are employed, but they are free to draw in resources from other budgets locally as they judge best.</p>

  <p>Local authorities have been asked to review all housing support services to improve efficiencies in a fair way across all providers. Supporting People funding in Scotland remains double that in England on a per capita basis. Currently, local authorities are reporting an average national vacancy rate of 9.2% for social workers and this indicates scope for authorities to absorb any job losses that may arise directly or indirectly from any reduction in supporting People funding.</p>

  <p>I can confirm that all eight police forces gather and maintain intelligence on registered sex offenders, non-registered sex offenders, violent offenders, dangerous offenders, and potentially dangerous persons. These are the agreed common definition of terms, defined with reference to the Violent Offender and Sex Offender Register, in the National Concordat on sharing information on sex offenders, found at:</p>

  <p>These are extra resources over and above what NHS boards currently spend to fund sexual health services in their area. In the current financial year 2005-06, the Executive has allocated &pound;9 million to NHS boards for action to prevent the spread of blood borne viruses, including HIV/AIDS. The funds allocated for this purpose will rise to &pound;9.3 million in 2006-07 and &pound;9.5 million in 2007-08.</p>

  <p>This is not a matter for the SPCB. The Scottish Parliamentary Standards Commissioner operates independently of the SPCB in the exercise of his statutory functions.</p>

  <p>The member may wish to contact the Commissioner directly on this matter by writing to The Scottish Parliamentary Standards Commissioner, The Scottish Parliament, Edinburgh, EH99 1SP or the member may also wish to contact the Standards and Appointments Committee who may hold such information.</p>

  <p>The remit of the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner as set out in the Scottish Parliamentary Standards Commissioner Act 2002 (the 2002 Act) is to determine the admissibility of complaints against members, to investigate complaints and to report on the outcome of these investigations to the Parliament.</p>

  <p>The Commissioner&rsquo;s role under the 2002 Act is confined to initial investigation. It is for the Standards and Public Appointments Committee in terms of the Standing Orders of the Parliament and the Code of Conduct for Members to determine whether a complaint should be upheld and to recommend sanctions. The Parliament ultimately decides whether those sanctions should be imposed. While every effort is made to check factual matters in determining whether a complaint is admissible, no rights are conferred on a complainer to have a particular complaint investigated. Questions about the lack of appeal procedures are only therefore relevant in connection with members. However, the lack of an appeal in respect of the Commissioner&rsquo;s report cannot be said of itself to be determinative of a Member&rsquo;s civil rights and obligations. Article 6 ECHR rights are not directly engaged with regard to these procedures. The Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body is satisfied therefore that the lack of an appeal procedure for reports by the Commissioner does not breach the European convention on Human Rights or Scots Law.</p>

  <p>The member is referred to the answer to question S2W-22792.</p>

  <p>In terms of section 9(3) of the 2002 act where the Commissioner concludes that a member has breached a provision, before sending the report to the Standards and Public Appointments Committee, a member must be given a copy of the Commissioner&rsquo;s draft and may make representations which, if the are not given effect to in the report, will be annexed to it. The Standards and Public Appointments Committee cannot alter or amend a Commissioner&rsquo;s report after it is received but in terms of the Code of Conduct (paragraph10.2.31) it will ask the member who is subject to the complaint to confirm in writing whether he/she agrees with the Commissioner&rsquo;s findings in fact or conclusion. It will also ask if the member wishes to make representations to the committee.</p>

  <p>The committee considers the report provided and any representation from the member before deciding if it agrees with the Commissioner&rsquo;s findings in fact and conclusion. It can also carry out its own investigation or refer matters back to the Commissioner for further investigation. Further, Section 10 of the 2002 act specifically provides that the Parliament is not bound by the facts found or the conclusions reached by the Commissioner. There are ample opportunities for factual errors to be brought to the attention of the Committee before it concludes its deliberations. To that extent, the ability to comment on factual errors in an initial draft adds little to the overall process.</p>

  <p>For the reasons set out in relation to the earlier linked question number S2W-22792, we are satisfied that there is no breach of the European Convention on Human Rights or Scots Law.</p>
