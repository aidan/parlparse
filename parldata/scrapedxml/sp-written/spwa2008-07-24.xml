  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how much has been spent since May 2007 on tackling (a) MRSA and (b) clostridium difficile (i) across Scotland, (ii) by each individual NHS board and (iii) at the Vale of Leven Hospital.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-07-24.S3W-14685.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80396" speakername="Nicola Sturgeon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa0724.htm#2">

  <p>It is not possible to provide the breakdown sought for (i) and (ii) as both the Scottish Government and NHS boards invest in a range of measures to tackle all Healthcare Associated Infections (HAI). For example, the Scottish Government invested over &pound;5 million last financial year (2007-2008) in the measures and policies identified in the previous HAI Task Force Delivery Plan (2005-2008). This included funding to support HAI related posts in each NHS board and resources to support our national Hand Hygiene Campaign and the publication of key HAI guidance documents for NHS boards. Within that funding, each NHS board also shared in &pound;1.2 million to support the bids they made for individual HAI related Implementation and Development projects.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is investing &pound;54 million over the next three years (2008-2011) on an extensive and wide-ranging set of measures to prevent and control all HAIs across NHS Scotland, including a new national MRSA Screening Programme from 2009-2010. NHS boards and our multi agency stakeholders on the HAI Task Force will play a key role in taking forward the comprehensive programme of work in our three year HAI Delivery Plan which came into being on 1 April 2008.</p>

  <p>On part (iii) of the member&rsquo;s Question, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde advise that it is not possible to provide a breakdown of spending on these specific infections at the Vale of Leven Hospital as, in line with all NHS boards, funds are earmarked for infection prevention control and management generally, thus supporting the key message that infection prevention and control is everyone&rsquo;s business.</p>

  <p>Patients on a waiting list who are transferred within the same NHS board to another specialty (removal reason code 50) or transferred to another NHS Board area (removal reason code 59) do not have their &quot;waiting time clock&quot; stopped or reset to zero.</p>

  <p>We expect NHS boards to ensure that all patients are seen and treated within current waiting time standards. Where a patient is required to be transferred to another hospital, we would expect the patient to participate in any decision about their hospital care.</p>

  <p>The core allocation from the Scottish Government to Dundee Science Centre for the financial year 2007-08 was &pound;160,300.</p>

  <p>The accounting year for the Dundee Science Centre runs from 1 January to 31 December. It is not possible, therefore, to match the grant paid by the Scottish Government in a given financial year to the Centre&rsquo;s income for the same period. However, in its statutory accounts to 31 December 2007 the Centre recorded &pound;125,750 core grant from the Scottish Government against a turnover of &pound;879,240 (excluding capital funding). On the basis of these figures the Scottish Government grant represents around 14% of the Centre&rsquo;s total funding.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has any concerns that Schedule 7 of the UK Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill which seeks to amend the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000 would undermine the protection given to adults with incapacity in Scotland, in particular the requirements relating to ethics committees which include the regulatory powers of a Scottish minister to prescribe particular matters which these ethics committees shall take into account when deciding to approve any research and what representations it has made to the UK Government on the matter.</p>

  <p>No. The regulation of ethics committees in Scotland under the terms of The Adults with Incapacity (Ethics Committee) (Scotland) Regulations 2002, as amended, are unaffected.</p>

  <p>The effect of the amendment excludes the adults with incapacity research consent provisions. The human fertilisation and embryology provisions will apply in such circumstances, thereby, avoiding the potential for two separate and different tests being applied. This approach does not undermine the regulatory powers of Scottish Ministers, with regards to the Adults with Incapacity Ethics Committee, and no representations have been made to the UK Government in this regard.</p>
