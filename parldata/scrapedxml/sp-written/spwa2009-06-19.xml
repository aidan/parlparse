  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many seals it anticipates will be killed each year under the new licensing scheme proposed in the Marine (Scotland) Bill and how this compares with the number killed under the Conservation of Seals Act 1970.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-06-19.S3W-24723.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80340" speakername="Richard Lochhead" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa0619.htm#1">

  <p>Under the current Conservation of Seals Act 1970 there is no legal requirement to report the number of seals shot, except under licence, and there are, therefore, no official statistics on this.</p>

  <p>The proposals under the Marine (Scotland) Bill will make it an offence to kill any seal at any time, except under licence, and include a duty to report numbers of seals killed to provide essential statistics.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is currently developing the new seal licensing system in consultation with stakeholders, including its statutory scientific advisers and the Scottish Seals Forum. It anticipates that the system will involve the use of a permitted/potential biological removal (PBR), which provides a maximum figure for individuals that can be removed without affecting the wider population. This will ensure effective monitoring of potential impact on seal populations.</p>

  <p>The system of milk quotas, which operates throughout the EU, first came into existence in 1984. The Scottish milk quota ring fence arrangements have been amended from time-to-time to take account of changing circumstances in the dairy sector. The degree of consultation undertaken on each occasion was determined by the prevailing circumstances.</p>

  <p>The Southern Isles (including the Kintyre peninsula) milk quota ring fence arrangements exist to support the interests of the local dairy industry, including producers and processors. The overarching aim is to underpin, where possible, the continuation of dairying and cheese-making in the area. The policy is kept under review to ensure that it takes account of, and reflects the wishes of, the majority of active dairy producers, processors and their representative bodies.</p>

  <p>As Scottish ministers have previously stated, a commencement date for any service will depend on a number of factors, including reaching agreement with the Northern Ireland Executive (NIE) about the way forward, and the timing of any subsequent procurement process. However, since ministers are presently awaiting a decision from the NIE regarding their involvement in the proposed development of this ferry service, we are not yet in a position to make a definitive announcement on the future for this proposed service.</p>

  <p>The GP patient access survey asked about patient experience of both 48 hour access and advance access. The answers were coded into &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; responses using a coding scheme agreed amongst survey stakeholders. Details of this, the questionnaire and the survey results, can be found at the following Scottish Government website:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/Browse/Health/GPAccessSurveyResults" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/Browse/Health/GPAccessSurveyResults</a>.</p>

  <p>Based on the agreed coding scheme, the number of replies included in calculation of results was different for the two types of access, as outlined below.</p>

  <p>48 Hour Access</p>

  <p>The total number of responses that could be used in calculation of 48 hour access results was 198,420. The main reason a reply was excluded was because the respondent had not attempted to gain 48 hour access. This applied to 54,593 replies. Other replies were excluded were because questions 1 or 2 were missed out or because more than one option in a relevant question was ticked. In addition, replies were excluded if the answer to question 3 (which asked why 48 hour access was not obtained) was &quot;don&rsquo;t know/ can&rsquo;t remember&quot; or &quot;other reason&quot;, or if question 3 was not answered after a &quot;no&quot; answer to question 2. These reasons excluded a further 16,173 replies.</p>

  <p>Advance Access</p>

  <p>The total number of responses that could be used in calculation of advance access results was 122,393. The main reason a reply was excluded was because the respondent had not attempted to book in advance. This applied to 133,919 replies. A further 7,742 replies were excluded were because questions 4 or 5 were missed out or more than one answer in a question was ticked. In addition, the results for advance access exclude the 5,232 forms received from patients registered with practices designated as &quot;open access&quot;.</p>

  <p>Social housing is a widely recognised shorthand for the housing provided for rent by registered social landlords and local authorities.</p>

  <p>Affordable housing is a wider term which covers these properties and other initiatives, such as mid-market rent, shared ownership and low-cost homes.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service, to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>There have been no individuals convicted specifically for Section 74 of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2003 who have served custodial sentences.</p>

  <p>There was one prisoner in 2006-07 and 23 prisoners in 2007-08 who have served sentences for other offences, for example breach of the peace, but whose offence was religiously aggravated. The majority of these were sentenced to very short sentences and only two with sentences in excess of one year.</p>

  <p>HM Young Offenders Institute Polmont have developed an awareness session aimed at raising the issue of sectarianism and racism which emphasises the behaviours expected both in prison and in the community which is delivered during the young offender&rsquo;s induction on admission to the establishment. Other prisons deliver a similar package.</p>

  <p>There is no specific prisoner programme for religiously motivated crime because the numbers do not make the delivery of a programme viable as most programmes are dependent on the interaction of participants in a group work setting. (Whilst the 23 individuals for 2007-08 might suggest there were sufficient numbers it should be noted that these are spread across the Scottish prison estate and will have started/ended their sentence at different times during the year).</p>

  <p>The provision of local healthcare services is a matter for NHS Ayrshire and Arran. NHS Ayrshire and Arran have stated that they are developing efficient new models of care in line with national policy which are flexible, community-based and meet the needs of local people. NHS Ayrshire and Arran are working with partners to introduce these new models of service in the autumn. Once community based services are established, these changes will involve ceasing to provide inpatient intermediate care at the unit at Kirklandside Hospital. We understand that this was a pilot scheme set up as a specific short to medium-term initiative to address historical problems with delayed discharge. In line with Scottish Government policy, the board are now seeking to develop services which are community based and closer to patient&rsquo;s homes.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>Statistics were previously collected on the number of disabled people receiving a housing support service funded through the Supporting People programme. However, local authorities indicated that housing support services were also funded from other sources, so this did not necessarily represent the total number of disabled people supported to maintain independent living.</p>

  <p>Following the end of ring fencing of the Supporting People budget in April 2008, the Scottish Government consulted with a wide range of stakeholders on whether to continue to gather information on numbers receiving housing support.</p>

  <p>The outcome of the consultation will be published on the Scottish Government&rsquo;s website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk</a>. Planned changes to the data collection to bring this better into line with the annual home care census will be discussed by the Housing Support Forum at its meeting on 23 June.</p>

  <p>It is widely recognised that family contact is beneficial to the rehabilitation process and it is undoubtedly the case that some people will have to travel further to go to Peterhead than is currently the case in visiting HMP Aberdeen. However, this has to be viewed in the context that at present, mid-June, within Aberdeen Prison there are 193 prisoners with an Aberdeenshire postcode and within the total prison population in Scotland there are 491 prisoners who come from the AB postcode area.</p>

  <p>By providing a community facing facility in the north-east of Scotland, those prisoners who would otherwise serve sentences elsewhere in Scotland, currently almost 300, will serve their sentences nearer to the community they come from.

  <p>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service, to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The information is not available in the format requested. However, the Scottish Prison Service published <em>Prison Health in Scotland: A Health Care Needs Assessment</em> in December 2007, which contains information on the epidemiology of prisoner health and describes some aspects of treatment for physical health conditions. The following is a web link to the publication:</p>

  <p>From December 2008:</p>

  <p>A new service each way between Aberdeen and Inverness;</p>

  <p>A new service from Inverness to Wick and Thurso six days per week, and</p>

  <p>An additional all year round service on the Kyle of Lochalsh line.</p>

  <p>Information on quit attempts made via NHS smoking cessation services is available from the agreed national minimum dataset for cessation services. The national smoking cessation database (the primary data collection mechanism) was established in July 2005.</p>

  <p>Quit outcomes are monitored at one month, three months and 12 months after the client&rsquo;s &quot;quit date&quot;.</p>

  <p>The table below shows, for all quit attempts made using NHS cessation services in 2007 where the pharmacotherapy used was recorded as nicotine replacement therapy, the percentage of quit attempts successful at one, three and 12 months.

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Figures are based on total quit attempts, rather than total number of clients with a quit attempt, so could include repeat quit attempts by the same client.</p>

  <p>2. Quit attempts not recorded as &lsquo;successful&rsquo; will include clients still smoking and clients &quot;lost to follow-up&quot;/smoking status unknown. Regarding eligibility for follow-up - all quit attempts are eligible for follow-up at one month after the &quot;quit date&quot;, at the three month follow-up it is just those recorded as a successful quit at one month, and at 12 months it is all cases recorded as a successful quit at three months or &quot;lost to follow-up&quot;/unknown smoking status when followed up at three months.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Swimming Healthy Living Manager has access to a small revenue budget of &pound;20,000 through Kellogg&rsquo;s Swim Active.</p>

  <p>The point is to build on existing activity. The Healthy Living Managers will work closely with the Scottish Swimming management team, local authorities and key partners to lead the implementation of:</p>

  <p>A discounted lesson scheme and other initiatives for driving participation;</p>

  <p>A sustainable framework for monitoring swimming participation and progress against specific targets;</p>

  <p>A marketing strategy to build awareness of swimming as both a healthy and accessible activity for all.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally. However, a study carried out by the Scottish Executive in 2002 suggested that the level of vaccination uptake amongst health workers was around 20%.</p>

  <p>In order to promote vaccination uptake within this group a separate information leaflet for health workers was produced for the 2008-09 campaign, advising of the importance of the vaccination for health care workers and for the vulnerable people in their care. Separately the national Flu and Pneumococcal Group is also working with occupational health clinicians to look at how best to improve uptake of the flu vaccine by health workers.</p>
