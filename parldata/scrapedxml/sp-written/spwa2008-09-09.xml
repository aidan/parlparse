  <p>The available information is given in the following table, which shows all offences recorded under section 61 of the Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Act 1997.</p>

  <p>The police have powers under section 61 of the Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Act 1997 to confiscate alcohol from under 18s in a public place and dispose of it. Under this section, the police also have powers to confiscate alcohol from persons aged 18 or over, in a public place and dispose of it if that person has supplied, or intends to supply, alcohol to under 18s. If the alcohol is surrendered to the police, it is not an offence and so is not included in the recorded crime statistics. It is, however, an offence to fail to comply, for example by failing to surrender the alcohol or by failing to give his name and address if requested. The number of these criminal offences are shown in the following table. It should be noted that this cannot be assumed to be a true representation of the number of incidents where alcohol was confiscated.</p>

  <p>Number of Offences Recorded by Strathclyde Police under Section 61 of the Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Act 1997, by Local Authority Area, for 2004-05 to 2006-07.</p>

  <p><em>The population size of native breeding greylag geese in Scotland</em>.</p>

  <p>The outputs of the modelling will predict future population trends of native greylag geese within a location over a 25 year period. The potential impact of various management scenarios will also be assessed. The final report for this research is due at the end of this year.</p>

  <p>Work to assess the population of native greylag geese is underway and an interim report is due in autumn 2008. Further survey work will be carried out during 2009 and a final report including a population estimate is due at the end of 2009.</p>

  <p>Scottish Government officials met with HM Treasury and HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) officials in August 2008 to discuss their current consultation on the modernisation of the tax credits system. As part of the consultation process, officials have stressed the Scottish Government&rsquo;s desire that the child care element of the working tax credit and child care vouchers should be merged to create a straightforward, progressive and more accessible system.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will continue to liaise with HMRC regarding the simplification of the tax credits system to make the process easier for parents and improve uptake for those families in need of support.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government remains committed to doing what it can within the available powers to end child poverty by 2020. The Scottish Government recognises that any effective approach to child poverty must also address income inequality in Scotland, which is why the <em>Government Economic Strategy</em> contains the solidarity target, which sets out our ambition to increase the proportion of income earned by the poorest 30% of the population by 2017. The Scottish Government will publish with COSLA our framework to tackle poverty, inequality and deprivation in Scotland in November 2008. That framework will consider benefits issues, and the support for employment that can be offered by affordable and accessible child care. The Scottish Government&rsquo;s position that it could more effectively tackle poverty in Scotland with additional powers over the tax and benefits system was supported by a majority of those who expressed a view on this in our consultation exercise.</p>

  <p>Currently there is a lack of evidence to confirm the reported adverse effects associated with energy drinks or to support their safety. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) are currently reviewing the safety of some of the constituents of so called &quot;energy drinks&quot; and are due to report on their findings shortly. The Food Standards Agency regularly review the literature on energy drinks as this is a high profile area and following the EFSA conclusions may seek the opinion of the Committee on Toxicity (COT) although no decisions have been made on this at this time.</p>

  <p>The following list states the target outcomes and the actual outcomes for each health-related advertising campaign launched since May 2007.</p>

  <p>Ageism:</p>

  <p>Targeted Outcomes:</p>

  <p>To raise awareness across an all adult population of Scotland (aged 15+ years) about the issue of ageism, and to help start tackling ageist attitudes in society. The campaign highlights the impact that negative attitudes about age have, and encourages people to &quot;see the person&quot; and not the age.</p>

  <p>Actual Outcome:</p>

  <p>The campaign is currently running. Post evaluation research is not yet available.</p>

  <p>Alcohol:</p>

  <p>Targeted Outcomes:</p>

  <p>The National Debate on Alcohol seeks to stimulate public debate about the impact of alcohol on Scotland, both at a personal and societal level. Internet and radio advertising has been used to stimulate awareness and drive traffic to the campaign website.</p>

  <p>Actual Outcomes:</p>

  <p>Four weeks of online tactical activity (week beginning 11 August 2008) was targeted at parents, supported by two weeks of radio (week beginning 11 August 2008). This not only helped raise awareness of the less obvious impacts of alcohol on children but also resulted in an average increase of 500% in traffic levels to the debate site, with a corresponding increase in public comment.</p>

  <p>Career Opportunities within the NHS:</p>

  <p>Note: A &pound;5,000 spend appears in financial year 2007-08 which relates to activity from the previous financial year.</p>

  <p>Domestic Abuse:</p>

  <p>Targeted Outcomes:</p>

  <p>Maintain a high level of public awareness of domestic abuse and raise awareness of the support available;</p>

  <p>Specifically, the 2007-08 campaign&rsquo;s purpose was to underline the effects that domestic abuse has on children in the families where it occurs;</p>

  <p>Our primary target audience was women experiencing domestic abuse, as they are usually best placed to help themselves and their children;</p>

  <p>Our secondary target audience was the wider Scottish public.</p>

  <p>Actual Outcome:</p>

  <p>Proportion of people spontaneously aware of advertising/publicity about domestic abuse has been consistently high at more than seven in ten over the last four waves and was at 72% at wave 11 (70% at wave 10);</p>

  <p>The level of TV reach, recognition of both &quot;Doll&rsquo;s House&quot; and &quot;Teddy&quot; creative executions, was 83% - much higher than levels reached over last four waves. 58% of those who had seen the adverts thought that the advert sought to communicate the effects on children/family which was the main campaign message at wave 11;</p>

  <p>Combining the reach figures for TV and radio gives a total campaign reach for the latest phase of 85%, compared to 79% at wave 10.</p>

  <p>Flu:</p>

  <p>Targeted Outcomes:</p>

  <p>The overall campaign aims to encourage the two target groups, over 65s, and those aged under 65 and in an &quot;at risk&quot; group, to get their free flu jab each winter;</p>

  <p>The main focus of the 2007-08 publicity campaign was the under 65 at risk audience;</p>

  <p>The Chief Medical Officer set public health targets of 70% uptake in the over 65s target group and, for the &quot;at risk&quot; group, 60%.</p>

  <p>Actual Outcome:</p>

  <p>67% of the &quot;at risk group&quot; were aware of advertising or publicity on the subject of flu (65% in 2006);</p>

  <p>When prompted with the posters for the &quot;at risk&quot; audience, 61% claimed to be aware of at least one of them, compared to recall in 2006 of 53%;</p>

  <p>81% of people agreed with the statement that the advertising &quot;helped me understand how serious getting the flu can be&quot; and 82% of people agreed that the advertising &quot;helped me to realise that the flu jab is not just for old people&quot;. Both of these statements indicate that the campaign was working well in communicating these key campaign messages;</p>

  <p>However, there was a fall in agreement that the advertising &quot;is relevant to me&quot;, 82% in 2006 to 71% in 2007. This provides an area for development in 2008/09. 2007/08 vaccine uptake figures are as follows:</p>

  <p>65 and Over: 70%</p>

  <p>65 and Under at Risk: 40%</p>

  <p>It should be noted that the advertising contributes to the effectiveness of the vaccination programme but that the programme has other determining factors (GP payments / willingness for public to get vaccine / availability of vaccine / appointment slots etc.).</p>

  <p>Hand Hygiene:</p>

  <p>Targeted Outcomes:</p>

  <p>The following activities were funded:</p>

  <p>Payment of media space for sonic panels to be used in NHS wards;</p>

  <p>Production of sponsored local press editorial;</p>

  <p>Re-branding logo on behalf of Health Protection Scotland &ndash; updating &quot;Scottish Executive&quot; to &quot;Scottish Government&quot;.</p>

  <p>Actual Outcome:</p>

  <p>The hand hygiene campaign is run by Health Protection Scotland. All campaign results are available on its website.</p>

  <p>Healthy Living (Take Life On):</p>

  <p>Targeted Outcomes:</p>

  <p>Diet: The objective is to raise awareness amongst our target audiences of the everyday, achievable changes to diet which can provide significant and specific health benefits by helping to reduce the risk of cancers, heart disease and diabetes.</p>

  <p>Physical Activity: The objective is to provide motivating guidelines for increased and effective physical activity amongst key adult target audiences.</p>

  <p>Specifically it will raise awareness of the specific health benefits of five x 30 minutes of brisk walking five days per week and supply examples of how to achieve this as part of everyday life.</p>

  <p>Actual Outcome:</p>

  <p>The campaign is currently running. Post evaluation research is not yet available.</p>

  <p>Hepatitis C:</p>

  <p>Targeted Outcomes:</p>

  <p>To encourage health and medical professionals who come into contact with carriers/sufferers of Hepatitis C to find out more about the disease by visiting the website at <a href="http://www.hepcscotland.co.uk" target="_blank">www.hepcscotland.co.uk</a></p>

  <p>Actual Outcome:</p>

  <p>The total media spend for this campaign is less than the &pound;100,000 threshold for post-campaign evaluation.</p>

  <p>National Care Standards:</p>

  <p>Targeted Outcomes:</p>

  <p>The National Care Standards are used across the care sector in Scotland to set standards for the quality of care that the public has a right to expect, in both residential and day care settings. TV advertising has been used to raise awareness of the National Care Standards and improve people&rsquo;s knowledge of how the standards can help them.</p>

  <p>Actual Outcomes:</p>

  <p>The campaign is currently running. Post evaluation research is not yet available.</p>

  <p>Organ Donation:</p>

  <p>Targeted Outcomes:</p>

  <p>To increase the number of Scots on the Organ Donor register by running a campaign to drive the 91% in favour of organ donation to sign up.</p>

  <p>91% in favour of organ donation</p>

  <p>23% on the organ donor register</p>

  <p>40% relative refusal rate</p>

  <p>700+ people waiting for a life saving transplant in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Actual Outcome:</p>

  <p>During the campaign period, Scottish registrations jumped by 299% with 85,899 people signing up between February and May 2008. We cannot attribute the entire uplift to our campaign as UK Transplant ran some national activity during the period. However, there was an uplift of 72% in England for the same period. If we apply the 72% uplift as a base, our campaign generated approximately 48,900 registrations which equates to a 277% increase in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Prescription Charges:</p>

  <p>Targeted outcomes:</p>

  <p>The key marketing objective was to raise awareness that prescription charges were being reduced from &pound;6.85 to &pound;5.00. A secondary objective was to let people know about prescription pre-payment certificates and that the cost had reduced by 51%.</p>

  <p>Actual outcomes:</p>

  <p>The results of the omnibus tracking survey completed at the end of the campaign indicated high awareness levels for the campaign and its key messages. Over half (51%) of the total sample recalled at least one strand of prescription charges advertising. 88% of those in the sample who had heard or seen any of the campaign understood the main message of the advertising to be &lsquo;NHS prescription charges are coming down&rsquo;. This rose to 95% when prompted with advertising messages.</p>

  <p>Community Health Partnerships were established to enable the delivery of better services for local people and to help to improve the health of local communities. Patient benefits have been delivered by Community Health Partnerships (CHPs) including better management of long-term conditions; more local diagnosis and treatment; improved access to primary care services and improvements in health through anticipatory care programmes targeted at disadvantaged groups.</p>

  <p>These benefits are measured through NHS board HEAT targets and other strategic priorities such as the Mental Health Delivery Plan and community care outcomes.</p>

  <p>In relation to costs, the 40 CHPs replaced 81 Local Health Care Cooperatives and were established from the budgets previously used to support LHCCs and NHS trusts which were dissolved. There was no additional funding provided for the establishment or running costs of CHPs.</p>

  <p>We will be commissioning a study of CHPs at the end of the year to consider their overall progress in delivering key areas of responsibility and to identify the factors that have facilitated their progress with a view to sharing the learning across all CHPs.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-14279 by Stewart Maxwell on 8 July 2008, what level of Housing Association Grant per unit is considered sustainable if the Scottish Government is to meet the challenge of homelessness and its aspiration to increase the supply of new affordable homes.</p>

  <p>Housing Association Grant requirements vary depending on a range of circumstances including location, house size, client group and rent levels. In general terms, reducing the amount of public subsidy per unit will enable more houses to be built, and quicker and more sustainable progress made towards increasing supply and meeting the challenge of homelessness. We will consult later this year on new methods of allocating subsidies for affordable housing in the future.</p>

  <p>I have asked Karen Watt, Chief Executive of the Scottish Housing Regulator to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Housing Regulator assesses performance on the management of antisocial behaviour, including use of tenancy conditions and legal action, in its inspection of registered social landlords (RSLs). Together with a number of other important tenant and service use outcomes, this forms a major part of the regulator&rsquo;s assessment of RSLs&rsquo; overall performance as set out in the inspection grade it awards to each inspected landlord.</p>

  <p>As part of the First Minister&rsquo;s announcement on 19 August, the Scottish Government published &quot;Responding to the Changing Economic Climate: Further Action on Housing&quot;. This set out the targeted measures that the Scottish Government is putting in place to help alleviate some of the most serious aspects of the credit crunch on the supply of affordable homes, on first time buyers and existing homeowners, and on the capacity of the house building industry. It included information about the Scottish Government&rsquo;s plans to bring forward up to &pound;100 million of affordable housing investment and explained that this would be spent in the financial years 2008-09 and 2009-10, rather than in 2010-11 as planned originally. It also explained that some &pound;60 million of this investment would be committed from government programmes and that the government would discuss with COSLA the temporary contribution of a further &pound;40 million from local government programmes.</p>

  <p>One of the guiding principles of getting it right for every child in foster and kinship care is: &quot;unless there are clear reasons why placement within the family would not be in the child&rsquo;s interests, care within the wider family and community circle will be the first option for the child.&quot;</p>

  <p>The steps being taken to achieve this include:</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the costs and benefits are of pay modernisation contracts for consultants, GPs and NHS staff affected by Agenda for Change.</p>

  <p>In relation to the costs of the new contracts it should be noted that costings were produced around the additional finance required for these new initiatives when they were introduced, and are detailed below. Now that these new terms and conditions have been agreed and are in place, the focus has moved to securing available benefits for the service and for patients and, as such, on-going work on additional costs has not been undertaken.</p>

  <p>New Consultant Contract: The estimated additional cost to NHSScotland over the two year period 1 April 2003 to 31 March 2005 is &pound;125.6 million.</p>

  <p>New GP contract (known as General Medical Services (GMS) contract): The total expenditure on the GMS contract increased from &pound;503.9 million in 2003-04 to &pound;696 million in 2005-06 which was the first year in which the new contract was fully in place.</p>

  <p>Agenda for Change: The estimated additional costs are &pound;145 million in 2004-05, &pound;215 million in 2005-06, &pound;161 million in 2006-07 and &pound;113 million in 2007-08.</p>

  <p>All of these additional costs are considered to be affordable within the overall funding provided to boards during this period and all boards have managed to contain their expenditure within the funding allocated to them in this period.</p>

  <p>As regards benefits, HDL(2005)28 set out the requirements for NHS boards to develop Pay Modernisation Benefits Realisation planning to demonstrate how they are using the new NHS contractual arrangements to deliver improvements in services for patients and to meet national targets and support local service redesign.</p>

  <p>By modernising terms and conditions all three strands ensure that the NHS is well equipped to recruit and retain the staff it needs, not just in terms of fair remuneration but also through policies that allow staff to maintain the appropriate work life balance.</p>

  <p>Changes in pay, terms and conditions do not in themselves effect improvements in patient care. The new contracts do however contain a series of provisions which can act as catalysts, as drivers for change, giving boards levers and tools that they can use to effect service re-design and improvement.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will continue to work with the service to ensure that boards take full advantage of the opportunities which these new terms and conditions packages present to develop benefits for patients.</p>
