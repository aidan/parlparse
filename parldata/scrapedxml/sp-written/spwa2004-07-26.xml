  <p>The Executive supports the principle of civic participation, and we are taking this commitment forward in a number of ways. Examples of specific activities include: providing support for the Scottish Civic Forum; promoting citizenship education in schools; supporting volunteering and the voluntary sector; promoting community engagement locally in Community Planning Partnerships and supporting grassroots capacity-building through the Community Learning and Development strategy. We are also providing increased opportunities for civic participation and stakeholder engagement in Executive policy-making processes and promoting good practice in our consultations.</p>

  <p>Civic participation complements a healthy representative democracy, and the measures contained in the Local Governance (Scotland) Bill will improve democratic participation and widen the range of people who can become involved in local government.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Children&rsquo;s Reporter Administration collects statistics on under 16s who are registered by the Reporter, under the Children (Scotland) Act 1995, where a child has allegedly misused alcohol or any drug. In 2003, 1907 children were registered by the Reporter, and 1,646 were referred by the Reporter for alleged misuse of drugs or alcohol. A child can be referred to the Reporter multiple times on the same grounds, so the number of referrals may be higher than the number of children referred.</p>

  <p>Figures on drug and alcohol misuse are not held separately, and information on numbers who did not receive treatment is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>It is for the members of local Drugs and Alcohol Action Teams to design and deliver services for people in their areas with drug and alcohol problems, and the Executive does not commission or fund individual services.</p>

  <p>Decisions on the most appropriate treatments for individuals are taken by local clinicians, taking account of the needs and circumstances of each patient. We therefore have no plans to promote the services provided at Castle Craig.</p>

  <p>Specific performance measures have been developed, following extensive discussion with local authorities, to monitor and evaluate delivery of the National Priorities in Education through the School Improvement Framework, introduced under the <em>Standards in Scotland&rsquo;s School etc. Act 2000. </em>Local authorities and schools publish an annual report on progress towards meeting targets and delivering the National Priorities in Education.

  <p>Information collected on capital expenditure is not broken down into primary or secondary education. However, the total capital expenditure figure for primary and secondary education in Scotland in 2002-03 was &pound;143.6 million. Using school roll data from the September 2002 school census, this represents capital education expenditure per pupil of around &pound;197. Figures are not yet available for 2003-04.</p>

  <p>Unlike chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) have zero ozone depleting potential. In light of constraints introduced by the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer, HFCs have been promoted by industry and others as a suitable alternative to CFCs. However, HFCs are powerful greenhouse gases and emissions should not be allowed to go unchecked. HFC emissions in Scotland are quantified and reported in the annually produced <em>Greenhouse Gas Inventories for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland</em> . The main sources of emissions are aerosols and refrigeration.</p>

  <p>The Executive contributes to the UK climate change research programme, administered by Defra, which recently funded a project entitled <em>Emissions and Projections of HFCs, PFCs and SF<sub>6</sub> for the UK and Constituent Countries</em>. This work includes estimates of future HFC emissions and assesses additional options for reducing future emissions of HFCs, including from refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment. A copy of the research findings can be accessed through the research pages of the Executive&rsquo;s climate change website at:</p>

  <p>A length limit on vessels fishing with creels came into force on 5 July in Luce Bay and Wigtown Bay. The purpose of the restriction was to support those local fishing communities who are dependent on the stocks in the area. The Galloway Static Gear Fishermen&rsquo;s Association provided information on landings, effort and fishing activity to assist the decision-making process, and we intend to continue working with local fishermen to monitor whether the restriction enables them to continue to make a sustainable return from the fishery. We also intend to continue working with nomadic fishermen to identify any displacement of effort elsewhere in Scottish waters arising from the new restriction.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Further and Higher Education Funding Councils (SFEFC and SHEFC) have a range of measures in place to widen access to and participation in further and higher education for under-represented groups, including under-represented groups in rural areas. Four Scottish regional widening access forums, assist colleges and higher education institutions to work together to widen participation on a regional basis.</p>

  <p>As part of the SFEFC core funding methodology, there is additional funding available for those colleges for whom remoteness is an issue. The rates for 2004-05 are &pound;198,535 per qualifying college and &pound;31.85 per remote student at the qualifying colleges. This funding is provided in recognition of the additional operating costs for those, often small colleges, in remote and islands areas of Scotland.</p>

  <p>In terms of future steps SFEFC commissioned an area mapping exercise to look at patterns of supply and demand for further education in Scotland on a regional basis. This identified that participation rates at FE level in Lanarkshire are 24% below the national average and around 50% below the best performing areas. SFEFC has provided research funding to colleges in the area to examine why participation in Lanarkshire is at such levels, and is currently considering a proposal from the colleges for a project to enhance participation in the region.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive recognises that effective data sharing is an important factor in delivering more effective, customer focused public services - and in particular in improving child protection services. The need for public sector staff to understand when they can - and should - share data about their clients has perhaps never been greater.</p>

  <p>The Local Government in Scotland Act 2003 sets out the legislative basis for Community Planning. Statutory guidance, published in April, makes clear the importance of sharing appropriate information between partners and provides additional practical advice. That guidance will be supplemented by the work of the Senior Officer Group on Data Sharing which the Executive has set up</p>

  <p>The Senior Officer Group, which has representatives from across the Executive&rsquo;s functions, promotes data sharing and oversees the development of strategic guidance. We have produced an internet-based framework that promotes a consistent approach to data sharing and will shortly publish general legal guidance that will help public sector bodies to ensure that they make effective use of information, share data within the law and respect people&rsquo;s legitimate expectations about the privacy and confidentiality of their personal information. We are also developing further specific guidance, such as information sharing protocols, and are looking at the feasibility of running a short training programme targeted at key public sector staff with an interest in data sharing.</p>

  <p>We have also encouraged, through the Modernising Government Fund, data sharing programmes such as eCare, which is developing inter-agency systems to improve patient care and which, in its next phase, will focus on children&rsquo;s services across all local authorities and NHS boards.</p>

  <p>The Executive is taking forward, with the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland, the recommendations in the Bichard report relating to the sharing and management of police information, and as part of that will examine the possibilities for sharing such information with police forces in other parts of the UK. The Executive will also shortly be issuing new guidance to managers and practitioners within the childcare community on the general question of information sharing, and the ability of agencies to collaborate in such sharing, in cases where there is any concern about a child.</p>

  <p>Data sharing guidance will be placed on the Internet at <a href="http://www.openscotland.gov.uk/" target="_blank">www.openscotland.gov.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>In Scotland the curriculum is not statutory and responsibility for decisions on curriculum delivery rests with local authorities and headteachers. The Scottish Executive Education Department offers guidance and direction on the curriculum and the outcomes of education. Local authorities must be free to meet these outcomes in a way which best meets local needs in line with available resources. Decisions on whether to run any course depend on pupil uptake, timetable restrictions and staffing and other resources.</p>

  <p>There is a range of disciplinary penalties which the Executive can impose depending upon the seriousness of the breach. A verbal warning was given in the majority of these cases. 68 resulted in more serious disciplinary action mainly in the form of a formal written warning.</p>

  <p>External Finance Limits (EFL) apply to cash accounting and as the Scottish Executive has operated on a resource accounting system since 2002-03 they no longer apply.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to report that all of the non-departmental public bodies spent within their agreed final budgets. There are however, four health boards who are expected<sup>1</sup> to exceed their Revenue Resource Limit:</p>

  <p>NHS Argyll and Clyde</p>

  <p>NHS Grampian</p>

  <p>NHS Lanarkshire</p>

  <p>NHS Western Isles</p>

  <p>NHS boards are clear that any such overspends are carried forward to the next year, and that we expect plans to eliminate them to be in place.</p>

  <p>The audited annual accounts for NHS boards are not yet available and the number of boards with deficits may change.</p>

  <p>The Water Industry Commissioner&rsquo;s overspend occurred in 2003-04 and related largely to resourcing extra work on Scottish Water&rsquo;s business planning and charging policies. Any payments due to employees or former employees in relation to the settlement of disputes between them would be met from the budget for the relevant year.</p>
