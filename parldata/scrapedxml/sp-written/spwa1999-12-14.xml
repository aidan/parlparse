  <p>There are a number of mechanisms. Each year business planning meetings are carried out and a set of numerical targets and performance measures are agreed for each company. The targets typically cover number of interviews, action plans, referrals and placings, work with parents, employers and training providers and other relevant information. Progress towards these targets is monitored on a quarterly basis. Career Service Inspectors maintained regular contact with the companies.</p>

  <p>The principal means of assuring the quality of service delivery is through the Scottish Quality Management System (SQMS). SQMS is an organisational development framework based on internal self-assessment and is subject to external examination by qualified auditors. It is a quality auditing system for all organisations involved in education, training, and guidance in Scotland and has been specifically customised to include an additional standard, Careers Service Delivery, specific to career service companies. SQMS requires to be achieved on a three-yearly cycle.</p>

  <p>Clients at school with a record of needs receive a future needs assessment before they leave school. The careers service are involved in this process and their services remain available to the client after they leave school in accordance with individual needs. Further information on future needs assessment is contained in SOEID Circular 4/96, which is available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe).</p>

  <p>Other young people who require support but who do not have a record of needs would normally have contact with a careers advisor before leaving school. The careers advisor would discuss their career ideas and identify their learning or training needs, in consultation with the school and other agencies.</p>

  <p>The careers service have a role in assessing clients during the transition period and all careers service companies have careers advisers who have expertise in working with clients who require additional support.</p>

  <p>To assist education authorities, schools, teachers and parents in tackling non-attendance the Government supported the publication of the Scottish Initiative on Attendance, Absence and Attainment&#8217;s good practice document <i>Close to the Mark</i> , which was published in December 1997. This publication offers practical support materials for schools, pulling together the examples of good practice identified by the Initiative in its work on attendance issues. It contains guidelines to help a school evaluate and develop its own practice in line with HMI publication <i>How Good is our School?.</i> Good practice is shared between schools through the Ethos Network</p>

  <p>Schools and education authorities have now agreed targets to raise attendance, and are putting in place strategies to meet those targets. The framework for setting targets was set out in <i>Setting Targets &#8211; Raising Standards in Schools</i>, published on 4 March 1998. Locally agreed targets where returned to HMI at the end of last year.</p>

  <p>Several initiatives funded under the Excellence Fund for Schools &#8211; Special Programme, including New Community Schools and Education Action Plans, contain components for reducing the level of absence.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive and its agencies take very seriously the impact of the planned reduction in activity at RAF Saxa Vord. In recognition of that I visited Unst, along with the Minister of State at The Scotland Office, on 15 and 16 November to meet the islanders and their representatives and to listen to their views on how future difficulties might be tackled. I also met the Unst Co-ordinating Committee which has been formed to consider appropriate response measures, and of which Shetland Enterprise is a member. The enterprise agencies recognise the uncertainty which faces the economy of Unst and will reflect that in their consideration of employment creation and other projects. The economic needs of Unst will be taken fully into account in future budget allocation decisions.</p>

  <p>A comprehensive set of response measures is being put in place following the recently announced reduction in the workforce employed by Barmac. An Oil Industry Response Team has been established comprising Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE), the local enterprise companies, the local authorities, the Employment Service, the Benefits Agency, the Citizens Advice Bureau, Inverness College and the Unions.</p>

  <p>Key priorities for the Team are job placement and upgrading of skills. On-site information centres are also being opened at both Ardersier and Nigg, which will be manned by Employment Service, Highland Council and contract staff. The centres will provide easy access, first-stop advice on employment, skills development and other issues for employees. A comprehensive information pack will shortly be published giving advice, contact numbers etc. This will be given to on-site workers and will be sent to all those have already left employment.</p>

  <p>HIE have placed a contract to create a database (HIE-OPS) which holds personnel data of people affected by the rundown of the oil fabrication industry in the HIE area. The data will include a full description of individuals&#8217; professional, casual and hobby skills to assist with job placement, skills upgrading, or the development of new career structures. A total of 1,584 people have been registered to date.</p>

  <p>HIE are also working with local labour placement specialists based in the Highlands and Islands and will assist them to identify jobs and place as many individuals from the list as is practicable. Although the main effort has still to commence, over 200 persons have been placed to date in short-term posts where the contract duration is a minimum of six weeks.</p>

  <p>We take very seriously the difficulties currently facing the fabrication yards in the Highlands. The Deputy Minister for Enterprise in the Highlands and Islands and I visited the Ardersier yard only last week to meet the management and unions. While there is uncertainty over the immediate future of the yards, I am encouraged that they have not been closed and that the owners are committed to their retention on a care and maintenance basis in order that the yards are able to compete for orders when market confidence returns. The enterprise agencies are working closely with the company, and stand ready to help it in any way they can to develop new products and services and compete in new markets.</p>

  <p>At last week&#8217;s Oil &amp; Gas Industry Task Force, my DTI colleague the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe, Mrs Liddell, and I impressed on the industry the need for a response to the problems currently facing platform fabricators. As a result, a &quot;Fabricators Forum&quot; has been established and will be meeting before the end of the month.</p>

  <p>Section 59 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1994 was introduced as a mechanism of requiring all new councils to review the local legislation they inherited at local government reorganisation in 1996. This was to ensure that such legislation was appropriate to the new council area and that any anomalies and inconsistencies were addressed. To allow the new authorities sufficient time to undertake the review, section 59(6) provided that the local legislation inherited to which section 59(6) applies will cease to have effect on 31 December 1999, unless an Order is made which exempts or postpones it from repeal.</p>

  <p>The Local Statutory Provisions (Exemption from Repeal) (Scotland) Order 1999 (SSI 1999/157) contains the local legislation which can continue in force unaltered on the grounds that it meets contemporary needs, thereby avoiding local authorities having to promote unnecessary replacement legislation.</p>

  <p>In 1995, an independent consultant conducted an evaluation of the Crofting Counties Agricultural Grant Scheme (CCAGS). Subsequently there was a consultation on proposals for change including, in particular, merging CCAGS into a new wider ranging scheme.

  <p>The GB Road Safety Strategy for the period to 2010, which is nearing completion, will address issues related to driver fatigue including sleep related accidents. The GB Speed Policy review itself, however, is not looking at the contribution of sleep apnoea to fatal road accidents.</p>

  <p>Current research by the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL) on behalf of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, due for completion in June 2000, is looking at sleepiness as a factor in road accidents. The latest edition of the Highway Code, published in February, offers advice to drivers, based on the early results of the research, about what to do if they feel ill or tired whilst driving.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive will consider the need for education and publicity measures relating to driver fatigue in the light of the outcome of the research.</p>
