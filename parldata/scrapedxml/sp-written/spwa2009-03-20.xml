  <p>Historic Scotland, who act on behalf of Scottish ministers on these matters, have been looking at potential sources of slate across Scotland starting with a national overview taken in 2000. The Scottish Stone Liaison Group (SSLG) which is funded by Historic Scotland has a remit to look at sustaining and developing supplies of indigenous stone, and have taken a specific interest in slate. Historic Scotland attended a meeting facilitated by SSLG in February 2008 with the mineral rights owner and a potential quarry operator. This was a concept level discussion where the Historic Scotland interest was based on skills required, material quality and demand.</p>

  <p>The supply of traditional roofing materials is an area of policy concern for Officials at Historic Scotland, and while they do not have the remit or the resources to make financial judgments of a commercial activity such as quarrying, they remain keen to assist those who are in a position to do so.</p>

  <p>To this end, Officials at Historic Scotland have commissioned reports on quality, training and ways to assess demand, that will allow commercial quarry operators to draw up costings for any potential extraction operation at Ballahulish based on an understanding of the material and the likely demand. It should be noted that Historic Scotland has no leverage, ownership or any other hold over the site, which will remain a matter for the owner of the site, the local authority and a potential operator. We are aware that the Scottish Stone Liaison Group has taken an active interest in this area.</p>

  <p>Historic Scotland, acting on behalf of Scottish ministers, is aware of the need to obtain a wide range of appropriate traditional building materials for repairs to existing buildings and matching new work. There are a range of potential sources for slate production in Scotland and Historic Scotland has previously commissioned a number of research projects around this issue in general, including:</p>

  <p>A report on the training issues involved with a revived quarrying operation in the West of Scotland (via Proskills 2007).</p>

  <p>A report into the technical and physical properties of the material remaining at one of the Ballachulish Quarries, and at Hill of Foudland in Aberdeenshire will be launched in April 2009.</p>

  <p>A pilot methodology, carried out in Stirling by the Scottish Stone Liaison Group, to assess the likely demand for Scottish Slate will be launched in April 2009.</p>

  <p>It is not Historic Scotland&rsquo;s intention to commission such a feasibility study in the near future, but it remains an area of interest for them.</p>

  <p>Only provisional data is currently available for the second and third quarters of 2008 (Q2 and Q3 2008). On the basis of these provisional estimates, the number of new build completions by housing associations in Q1-Q3 2008 (January to September 2008) was 2,041. This provisional estimate is 29% lower than the figure for new build completions in Q1-Q3 2007 (January to September 2007). This reduction should be interpreted with care.</p>

  <p>Recent experience suggests that the provisional estimates for the second and third quarter of 2008 are likely to be revised significantly upwards as more complete data become available. For example, data for Q2, Q3 and Q4 2007 were revised upwards by 21%, 16% and 51% respectively between the time they were first published and their final revision at the end of the financial year.</p>

  <p>The only knife crime communication campaign undertaken by the Scottish Government over the past five years ran between November 2006 and April 2007. &pound;650,573 was spent on its delivery and the impact was evaluated by an independent organisation. However, over the past few years we have been working in partnership with the national Violence Reduction Unit to deliver a range of initiatives to prevent and reduce knife crime in Scotland. These include the on-going anti-violence policing campaign, which delivers coordinated and targeted enforcement action across Scotland; the groundbreaking Community Initiative to Reduce Violence (CIRV) project, in which our &pound;1.6 million investment is supporting partners to tackle gang violence in Glasgow, and the recently announced <em>No Knives Better Lives, </em> our new &pound;500,000 youth engagement initiative which will work directly with young people to educate them about the dangers and consequences of carrying a knife.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is making good progress with partners in delivering the national performance targets and commitments for mental health set out in <em>Delivering for Mental Health</em> (Bib. number 41410) which cover the full spectrum of mental health care.</p>

  <p>Refinement of the published suicide target to support training of key frontline staff by 2010, and new targets to deliver faster access to specialist child and adolescent mental health services for 2009-10 onwards, to support a future waiting time target, and to achieve improvements in the early diagnosis and management of those with dementia by 2011 have been added since it&rsquo;s publication.</p>

  <p>Ex-service personnel, including those in the Highlands, have unhindered access to mental health services and NHS priority treatment for conditions relating to their service. Local delivery of national mental health targets and commitments will benefit all those with a mental illness, including ex-service personnel.</p>

  <p>This is an operational matter for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, however, the Board have confirmed that all Glasgow Maternity Units provide neonatal services. The Princess Royal Maternity Hospital (PRM) and Southern General provides the full range of care from intensive care high dependency and special care; the Queen Mother&rsquo;s Hospital (QMH) provides special care services only and Royal Hospital for Sick Children (RHSC) provides intensive care services in a combined medical and surgical intensive care unit. When the QMH closes their special care neonatal services will transfer to the Southern General Hospital (SGH) and PRM. The combined medical and surgical intensive care service will remain at the RHSC, Yorkhill until the new children&rsquo;s hospital opens at the SGH. There will be a period of four years between the QMH closure and the new children&rsquo;s hospital opening. Clinical staff fully support this service model for the gap period.</p>

  <p>In September 2008 I launched the Healthy Eating in Schools guidance at the HM Inspectorate of Education healthy food in schools conference where the audience included local authority catering staff.</p>

  <p>Officials consulted widely, including with local authority and school catering staff and their representatives, when drafting the guidance to get their views and to raise awareness. Copies of the guidance were subsequently sent to all Scottish schools and local authorities.</p>

  <p>Officials regularly promote the Healthy Eating in Schools guidance to local authority and school catering staff and their representatives when speaking at conferences and seminars, at meetings and when contacted by email and telephone. We continue to work with our partners and local authorities to promote the guidance and to encourage the sharing of good practice.</p>

  <p>Under the Schools (Health Promotion and Nutrition) (Scotland) Act 2007 local authorities are required to ensure that food and drink provided in schools comply with the nutritional requirements that we have set. In carrying out this duty, local authorities must have regard to the Healthy Eating in Schools guidance. Local authorities therefore have a key role to play in making sure their school catering staff are aware of the guidance and are implementing it in their schools.</p>

  <p>Scottish Government officials regularly promote the Healthy Eating in Schools guidance to local authority and school staff when speaking at conferences and seminars. We also consulted widely with local authority and school staff while drafting the guidance. Copies of the guidance were sent to all Scottish schools and local authorities.</p>

  <p>In addition we have posted information on the Schools (Health Promotion and Nutrition) (Scotland) Act (the Act) with links to the guidance on the Parentzone website at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.parentzonescotland.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.parentzonescotland.gov.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>However, we want to make sure more staff, parents and pupils are aware of the Act and the accompanying guidance. We are currently developing leaflets for parents and pupils to let them know about what is happening in schools in relation to health promotion and healthy food. Other leaflets are being developed for staff.</p>

  <p>Partnership working and involving parents, pupils and staff are key objectives of health promoting schools. The health promotion guidance on the Act, that we issued to local authorities and schools last summer, includes guidance on partnership working and highlights the importance of involving partners, including parents, pupils and staff. Under the Act, local authorities are also required to promote school lunches. However, it is for local authorities and schools to determine how to promote the lunches and the Healthy Eating in Schools guidance. For our part we continue to work with our partners and local authorities to support the implementation of the act and to encourage the sharing of good practice.</p>

  <p>Research published in early 2007 recommended that permitted development rights distinguish between domestic and non-domestic buildings. We have given priority to domestic buildings. The research recommended that the same rights apply to all non-domestic buildings. However, non-domestic buildings vary enormously in their scale, location and type of activity. We intend to progress work on non-domestic microgeneration when matters are resolved for domestic.</p>

  <p>With regards to the question raised, the following table provides the relevant information.</p>

  <p>The job share figures are not currently available. Job sharers are included in the part-time figures.</p>

  <p>You will notice that the staffing number have increased as at 1 January 2009. This is due to a number of factors, but most significantly the inclusion of staff from Communities Scotland, Scottish Building Standards Agency and Scottish Agricultural Science Agency to core Directorates, which were not included in the earlier figures.</p>
