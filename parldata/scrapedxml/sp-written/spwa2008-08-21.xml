  <p>The West of Scotland Regional Planning Group has agreed to support the introduction of an optimal reperfusion therapy service. The service modelling undertaken by the group, in conjunction with the Scottish Ambulance Service, is intended to ensure that the redesign of services for patients requiring primary PCI does not prejudice the Scottish Ambulance Service&rsquo;s ability to respond to all category A calls in the region.</p>

  <p>To back-fill the use of ambulances transporting patients to the primary PCI centres, the Scottish Ambulance Service will be deploying two additional rapid response vehicles in the region. Repatriation of patients after primary PCI will be undertaken by two new dedicated ambulances in order to further reduce pressure on front-line ambulances.</p>

  <p>A business case for the introduction of optimal reperfusion therapy is being considered by the South East and Tayside Regional Planning Group.</p>

  <p>The North of Scotland Planning Group is developing a model of optimal reperfusion which takes account of geography and the availability of clinical staff. In addition to pre-hospital thrombolysis, which will continue to be provided in appropriate cases, plans are being made for the provision of daytime primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for those within 60 minutes&rsquo; travel time of Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.</p>

  <p>These plans, which have been developed in conjunction with the Scottish Ambulance Service, take account of the service&rsquo;s targets relating to all category A calls.</p>

  <p>Regulations introduced by the General Dental Council between July 2006 to July 2008 relate only to the registration of dental technicians and clinical dental technicians, not to operational processes. From July 2006, it has been a legal requirement for clinical dental technicians to be registered. This existing regulatory framework is relatively long standing. From 31 July 2008, dental technicians have also required registration. This should not impact directly on denture provision or result in delays.</p>

  <p>Governance arrangements for denture provision should improve following the introduction of registration regulations as all denture professionals will now have formal training and have demonstrated the competence necessary to deliver a safe and effective standard of care.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, given that one of the main routes for delivery of cognitive behavioural therapy is to be by telephone through NHS 24 and given that the evidence base for this method of delivery is not yet strong, what steps it is taking to prove the efficiency of this modality against face-to-face or online therapy.</p>

  <p>Our &pound;3 million investment in the two pilot projects will focus on new innovative approaches to help those with anxiety and depression including telephone based cognitive behaviour therapy and guided self-help, as well as access to cognitive behaviour therapy on line. Part of the approaches to be tested will use a structured model of care supported by general practice and trained therapists.</p>

  <p>The initiatives will explore and contribute to the evidence base of what works well in terms of access and care for service users and what proves effective in terms of overall outcomes and all steps will be taken to ensure the right patents are assessed and referred to this service through an algorithm designed by NHS 24.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has already published timetabled targets on reducing anti depression prescribing and on increasing access to psychological therapies. We are also keen to see change through our published standards for integrated care and now see merit in investing this significant sum to test reaction and benefits from new ways of responding to those in need and to put them more in control of their condition.</p>

  <p>Police forces have their own operating procedures in respect of policing issues when dealing with mental health issues, which give guidance to all officers. These cover all relevant legislation. In addition, training on mental health issues is currently provided to police officers both in-force and nationally.

  <p>A Mental Health Act Review Group was set up by Shona Robison, the Minister for Public Health, in January this year.

  <p>Under the Scottish Safety Camera Programme six mobile camera sites, five within Dumfries and Galloway and one within Strathclyde, have been successfully established on the M74 and the A74 (M). Since the cameras have been deployed the average speed of the traffic at the camera sites in Dumfries and Galloway has dropped from an average of 86 to 89mph down to an average of 70 to 72mph. In Strathclyde the average speed of traffic at the camera site has dropped from 69mph down to 66mph.</p>

  <p>In addition to the deployment of safety cameras, the police constantly patrol the full length of the M74 and the A74 (M) in both marked and unmarked vehicles to enforce a wide range of traffic legislation, including those laws relating to speeding.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive why a higher proportion of male than female school leavers is unemployed and what action it is taking to address this imbalance.</p>

  <p>The higher proportion of male than female school leavers not in employment, reflects the gender split in both underachievement in school and unemployment in the adult population.</p>

  <p>We recognise that staying in learning post-16 is a priority for both males and females. The importance that we place on this is reflected in the following:</p>

  <p>(i) The National Performance Framework indicator &quot;To increase the proportion of school leavers in positive and sustained destinations&quot;.</p>

  <p>(ii) Both the strategy to help young people who need More Choices and More Chances and Curriculum for Excellence are firmly focused on identifying the needs of each young person individually and targeting the relevant support where it is needed. This support must deliver equally well for all young people of both genders.</p>

  <p>(iii) Skills for Scotland, the skills strategy, aims to encourage all young people to stay in learning post-16 as this is the best way for ensuring their long-term employability and contribution to a more prosperous Scotland.</p>

  <p>(iv) Building the Curriculum 3 makes it clear that the success of the education system will be judged on the extent to which it contributes to the national indicator on positive and sustained destinations.</p>
