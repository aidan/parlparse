  <p>The Scottish Government has incurred no specific expenditure on alcohol test purchasing in 2008 nor does it anticipate doing so in 2009. It is not possible to provide costs incurred by Scottish Police Forces for mounting alcohol test purchasing programmes, because these are absorbed within operational police budgets.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to working with the Violence Reduction Unit (VRU) to tackle knife crime in Scotland. In order to prevent assault injuries we need to understand the nature and true scale of violent crime, including knife-related incidents. Injury surveillance systems can help us do so, and there are currently injury surveillance projects running in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Fife, with another due to begin shortly in Lanarkshire. A range of partners work together to collate anonymous data including hospital reception and nursing staff, police analysts and ambulance teams. The information gathered through this process is shared with the police to inform their tasking and coordinating meetings in an attempt to prevent future incidents. These projects will be evaluated in due course and we hope that successful lessons can be replicated in other parts of Scotland.</p>

  <p><em>The Government Economic Strategy</em> sets out the Scottish Government&rsquo;s definition of sustainable economic growth, which is defined as &quot;building a dynamic and growing economy that will provide prosperity and opportunities for all, while ensuring that future generations can enjoy a better quality of life too.&quot;</p>

  <p><em>The Government Economic Strategy</em> further defines the Scottish Government&rsquo;s purpose in the targets that have been set &quot;to track progress in boosting Scotland&rsquo;s growth, productivity, population and participation, and in delivering on the desired characteristics of growth &ndash; solidarity, cohesion and sustainability.&quot; The purpose targets are further supplemented by the various national outcomes, targets and indicators set out in the National Performance Framework.</p>

  <p>With regards to matters outwith the measurement of GDP, an additional measures of progress steering group was set up in 2006 to review the evidence on the options for additional and improved ways of measuring progress. In concluding its work the steering group presented three recommendations on additional and improved ways of measuring progress to Scottish Government ministers in July 2008. The Scottish Government is now taking forward each of these recommendations.</p>

  <p>We recognise that waiting times for this service vary significantly between NHS boards, and we are currently considering ways to address this.</p>

  <p>We provided NHS boards with an update on eligibility criteria guidelines in March 2007.

  <p>Access to infertility services has not historically been included in waiting time targets because there were concerns about breaching patient confidentiality. We have collected data from NHS boards which shows that waiting times for this service vary significantly across the country, and we are currently considering options to address this. We are aware that individual boards have invested in this service to reduce waiting times in their areas.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government published Expert Advisory Group on Infertility Services (EAGISS) in 2000 to inform NHS boards planning and provision of infertility services. These guidelines, which remain extant, recommend that those who are eligible for NHS funded IVF treatment should be offered three cycles.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not call for &quot;greater&quot; regulation in any sector but rather regulation that is proportionate, transparent and targeted.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has taken the view that the most appropriate route to discuss regulation of the financial services industry in Scotland was through the Financial Services Advisory Board (FiSAB) which comprises industry, trade union and Scottish Government representatives. I wrote to the Chancellor of the Exchequer in April 2008 following advice from FiSAB calling for improved communications between the tripartite authorities and Scotland. In his speech to the Global Financial Services Conference organised under the FiSAB auspices in May 2008 the First Minister called for careful deliberation and a measured response. That is still the Scottish Government&rsquo;s approach.</p>

  <p>As part of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s dual support system for research, the Scottish Funding Council (SFC) distributes over &pound;250 million per year to Scotland&rsquo;s higher education institutions for research and knowledge transfer. Of that sum, around &pound;220 million is allocated through the Main Quality Research Grant and Knowledge Transfer Grant for Scotland&rsquo;s higher education institutions to use strategically. Some higher education institutions will choose to allocate a certain amount of these funds for stem cells research and development for clinical applications and commercial exploitation.</p>

  <p>One recent investment in stem cell research infrastructure has been made using SFC&rsquo;s Strategic Research Development Grant. In May 2006, SFC invested &pound;2 million, matched by the University of Edinburgh, in a &pound;4 million package of support to retain and recruit world-leading stem cell scientists in order that Scotland&rsquo;s acknowledged excellence in the field could be maintained as broader investment decisions were under consideration. The broader commitment was made in January 2007 when an investment of &pound;59 million was agreed by the Scottish Executive and SFC, together with Scottish Enterprise and the University of Edinburgh, to create the Scottish Centre for Regenerative Medicine at Little France in Edinburgh.</p>

  <p>Research-related funding for Scottish institutions also comes from a number of other sources in the public, private and third sectors, for example, the UK Research Councils. Some Scottish Government Directorates also fund research directly. For example, the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Chief Scientist Office is currently funding four research projects on stem cells.</p>

  <p>We are building on the existing Mortgage to Rent scheme to develop a new Home Owners&rsquo; Support Fund, with a budget of &pound;25 million over two years. Mortgage to Rent helps people with little or no equity to stay in their homes. A new Mortgage to Shared Equity scheme will be launched in early 2009 to help home owners who have built up a level of equity in their properties. There will be a further announcement setting out the criteria for this scheme in due course.</p>

  <p>We have urged the UK Government to act on the OFT&rsquo;s recommendations and to legislate to protect Scottish homeowners from the risks of &quot;sale and rent back&quot; schemes operated by unscrupulous landlords.</p>

  <p>We are also launching a new awareness raising campaign for the National Debtline this month, to encourage people to take action at an early stage to address their debt problems.</p>

  <p>Scottish home owners are subject to a different legal system, than those in England and Wales, but are not disadvantaged by the Scottish rules. The pre-action protocol adopted in England and Wales does not alter the borrower&rsquo;s or the lender&rsquo;s legal rights, and has no substantive legal effect. It does not change the way the court may dispose of a case and it does not give the court additional options.</p>

  <p>The Mortgage Rights (Scotland) Act 2001 provides significant protection for those at risk of repossession. Owners have the right to ask the Sheriff to give them time to pay off arrears, and lenders are also obliged to comply fully with Financial Services Authority (FSA) regulations.</p>

  <p>Since May 2007, five Senators of the College of Justice have been appointed, of whom one has been female. Seven sheriffs have been appointed in the same period, of whom two have been female. Information on the ethnic composition of recent judicial appointments is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>Also since May 2007, the Judiciary and Courts (Scotland) Act 2008 has been passed by the Scottish Parliament. Under Section 9 and Schedule 1 of the act, the Judicial Appointments Board for Scotland (JABS) will be established as an advisory body not subject to the direction of ministers.</p>

  <p>JABS will recommend individuals for judicial appointment solely on the basis of merit and will provide advice to ministers in connection with such appointments. JABS will initially comprise members of the existing JABS, which is an advisory administrative body established under the chairmanship of Sir Neil McIntosh in 2002. The existing JABS was created to provide more open and accessible arrangements for judicial appointments in Scotland.</p>

  <p>In its consideration since May 2007 of women and people from minority ethnic groups appointed to judicial office, the existing JABS has established a Diversity working group, with membership including representatives from the Law Society of Scotland and the Faculty of Advocates. For these purposes, diversity includes consideration of women and people from minority ethnic groups. The working group&rsquo;s remit included the identification of whether the diversity of the legal profession in Scotland is reflected in the diversity of applicants for judicial office. The working group identified a need for evidence on the current make-up of the eligible population for judicial appointments (and how this might change in the next few years), as well as a need to identify whether there are any actual or perceived barriers which could be inhibiting eligible candidates from applying for judicial office.</p>

  <p>All selection processes will continue to be based solely on merit.</p>

  <p>Under section 76 of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976, it is an offence for a licence-holder or his employee or agent to sell or supply in licensed premises any alcoholic liqueur to a drunken person. The maximum penalty is a fine of level 3 with the licence-holder vicariously liable for the offence and both the holder and the premises liable to disqualification.</p>

  <p>This provision will be replaced from 1 September 2009 by section 113 of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005 which provides that any responsible person who, on any relevant premises, sells alcohol to a person who is drunk commits an offence. A person guilty of such an offence is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale.</p>

  <p>Test purchasing is, of course, an enforcement tool which is available to the police to assess compliance with the licensing law and, as such, no specific guidance is available to licensees. However, the roll-out of alcohol test purchasing arrangements across Scotland has been accompanied by national and local publicity which has helped to raise awareness among licensees that the law is being more vigorously enforced and to encourage them to be more vigilant. The police and local authorities are more than willing to offer individual licensees advice and guidance to assist them in meeting their legal obligation to comply with licensing law and to take all reasonable steps to avoid underage sales.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government works with a range of intermediaries, including housing associations, to encourage and support vulnerable individuals to claim the financial assistance to which they are entitled. Housing associations are well placed to make an important contribution and they are encouraged by the availability of the Wider Role Fund for Registered Social Landlords (RSLs) to take an active role in the regeneration of their local communities. One of the priority themes for the wider role fund is to make early interventions to tackle poverty and many RSLs have developed projects supported by wider role funding aimed at income maximisation and increasing the take up of welfare benefits.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Tackling Poverty Framework is due to be published soon and a major strand of the framework will be to maximise income.

  <p>This government is committed to radical action to end the cycle of offending and re-offending. Prison will always remain the right place for those who commit serious crimes and present a risk to our communities. But tough community penalties delivered swiftly and consistently are more effective in dealing with those whose offences are of a less serious nature.</p>

  <p>We know that custody is often not the most appropriate option for women offenders. The Community Justice Authorities have identified women as a priority group and this is reflected in schemes such as diversion from prosecution and supervised bail. We are spending over &pound;600,000 per year on piloting Drug Treatment and Testing Orders for all lower tariff offenders including women and have increased spending on supervised bail by over 40%. Additional funding of &pound;190,000 per year has been made available to the South West Community Justice Authority for piloting an innovative approach making use of mentors/link workers for adult female offenders given a community sentence.</p>

  <p>Network Rail is responsible for compiling the National Rail Timetable and running the timetable process which balances the timetable bids from different train operators. Transport Scotland specifies the minimum service to be operated by First ScotRail. The Department for Transport specifies the minimum service to be operated by cross-border franchised train operating companies. Train companies may elect to run extra services in addition to the minimum specified level.</p>

  <p>The current reform of the education system through Curriculum for Excellence will play a significant role in educating young people about tobacco, alcohol and drugs, through promoting resilience, confidence, independent thinking and positive attitudes. It will also enhance young people&rsquo;s knowledge, skills and understanding of substance misuse as part of education around health and well-being.</p>

  <p>The ASSIST project has evaluated well as an effective approach to how peer education can contribute to wider substance misuse education. The University of Glasgow is researching the Cannabis and Smoking Education (CASE) study and the feasibility study is expected to report next year.</p>

  <p>It is for local authorities and schools to determine how best to meet the needs of young people in their community and what role the CASE programme might have in supporting a comprehensive programme of personal and social education.</p>

  <p>An Additional Measures of Progress Steering Group was set up in 2006 to review the evidence on the options for additional and improved ways of measuring progress. In concluding its work the Steering Group presented three recommendations on additional and improved ways of measuring progress to Scottish Government ministers in July 2008, full details at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/SustainableDevelopment/measuring-progress/additional-measures" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/SustainableDevelopment/measuring-progress/additional-measures</a>.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is now taking forward each of these recommendations.</p>

  <p>The key characteristics of sustainable economic growth are measured through the government&rsquo;s purpose targets set out in Scotland Performs. The purpose targets are further supplemented by the various national outcomes, targets and indicators set out in the National Performance Framework.</p>

  <p>As of 4 November, 84 of the 2,794 teachers who have retired in 2008 have still to receive their lump sum. All of these applications were either received after the prescribed notification date or contained erroneous information. All are being processed urgently.</p>

  <p>The agency&rsquo;s target, where it receives correct information from employing authorities and teachers within the prescribed notification period, is to ensure that 98% of teachers receive their lump sum within one week of their retrial date. That target has been exceeded in 2008.</p>
