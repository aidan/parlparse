  <p>Economic growth and excellent public services are complementary and mutually reinforcing. We look to the potential for excellent public services to promote economic growth, through facilitating the appropriate physical, human and electronic infrastructure and fostering the dynamic competitiveness in Scottish enterprises. We will shortly publish plans to secure annual efficiency savings in the public sector that will rise to &pound;650 million by 2007-08 and will be used for investment in our front-line services. In turn, economic growth can help deliver the outcomes we are pursuing, as achieving our equity and sustainability objectives is closely tied to achieving our economic objectives.</p>

  <p>Now is not the time to make changes given the need for stability in our health service. Therefore no reduction in the number of health boards is being proposed by the Executive. However, I would make it absolutely clear that there has to be a significant improvement in cross boundary working to ensure that the boards&rsquo; decisions take account of the regional dimension.

  <p>The Fingerprint technology currently in use by the Scottish Fingerprint Service is up to date. It consists of two interlinked parts, the Automatic Fingerprint Recognition System which was introduced in 1991 and which had a major software upgraded in 1997 and the Livescan system which was introduced in 1997.</p>

  <p>A letter was issued in May by the Scottish Sports Association to the Scottish Association of Local Sports Councils, sports governing bodies and local sports councils outlining the benefits of registering as a community amateur sports club with the Inland Revenue.

  <p>Very positive progress is being made towards ensuring that the new integrated tourism network will be in place by April 2005. Discussions have taken place with COSLA and all the local authorities in Scotland on their role in the new network and I am pleased with the positive and active approach being taken by the local authority sector to help deliver the vision of growing tourism revenues by 50% over the next decade.</p>

  <p>There are two measures of unemployment used in the UK. Unemployment (previously know as International Labour Organisation (ILO) unemployment) and the claimant count. There are significant differences between the unemployment level derived from the ILO unemployment measure and the claimant count. The ILO measure of unemployment is a wider definition and includes individuals who are actively seeking work as well as those claiming job seekers benefits, whereas claimant count only includes those claiming job seekers benefits.</p>

  <p>Unemployment levels obtained from the Labour Force Survey using the ILO definition is the Executive&rsquo;s preferred measure of unemployment. However it is currently less reliable for geographical areas lower than Scotland level. The claimant count is based on administrative records and is more reliable at local authority level.</p>
