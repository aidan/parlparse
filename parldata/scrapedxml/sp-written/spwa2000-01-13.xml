  <p>Crown Office does not "downgrade" police charges. As a matter of law, the decision whether to prosecute an individual and, if so, on what charges, is a matter for the Crown, not the police. Charges preferred by the police following a fatal road traffic accident give early notice to the accused of likely or possible criminal charges, but the decision regarding criminal proceedings is taken later, by Crown Counsel, after a detailed investigation by the Procurator Fiscal. I have recently written in detail on this matter to the Chair of the Justice and Home Affairs Committee, on which Mr Gallie serves.</p>

  <p>The Executive is keeping closely in touch with Her Majesty&#8217;s Government on the progress of compensation due to Scottish ex-miners, their widows and families. As of 2 January 2000, 254 full and final payments had been made to Scottish ex-miners, totalling over &pound;500,000. A further &pound;2.5 million had been disbursed as interim payments to Scottish ex-miners and their families.</p>

  <p>Prior to the signing of the Handling Agreement for England and Wales in September the Department of Trade and Industry had commenced discussions with Scottish solicitors to adapt the Agreement to take into consideration the differences between English and Scots law.

  <p>The Executive has prepared Route Profiles of all routes in the trunk road network. These Profiles summarise the key aspects of each route in terms of its operation, safety and maintenance. These profiles are currently being updated and will be used to highlight problems and issues relating to each route as an aid to strategic decision-making. There are also Route Action Plan Studies on 10 trunk roads, focusing on those with the greatest operational safety and maintenance problems. Three further studies are underway. I will write to Mr Tosh shortly with details. Each study has identified a phased and targeted programme of low to medium cost improvements. A significant number of these have been implemented and others will follow as resources permit.</p>

  <p>Multi-modal appraisal will be carried out on the A68 (Dalkeith Bypass) schemes if, following consideration alongside other emerging priorities, the schemes remain worthwhile projects for inclusion in a future trunk road programme. I refer Mr Tosh to my answer to question S1W-2899 explaining how we plan to identify priorities for such a programme.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether all of the land required for the projected M77 extension from Malletsheugh to Fenwick has been acquired, whether any land is currently subjected to compulsory purchase or whether any land is being acquired by negotiations, subject to conditions, including time delays in acquisition.</p>

  <p>The land for the M77 extension between Fenwick and Malletsheugh has not yet been purchased. <strong> </strong> Three Compulsory Purchase Orders to acquire most of the land for the scheme were made at the end of last year. Subject to the satisfactory completion of the statutory procedures, ownership of this land will be vested in Scottish Ministers in spring 2000. Additional plots of land for various additional drainage, landscaping and access works are being acquired by negotiation. <br /></p>
