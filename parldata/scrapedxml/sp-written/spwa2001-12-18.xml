  <p>The National Breastfeeding Adviser is working with NHS Boards to encourage and increase the incidence and duration of breastfeeding through, for example, the UNICEF Baby Friendly initiatives.

  <p>Since 1996 the Scottish Executive has awarded funding of over &#163;10 million to more than 160 public CCTV systems throughout Scotland. There has been no national assessment of the effect of those systems on levels of street crime and I am not aware of any systems funded from this programme which are operating in West Renfrewshire. However, from 1 April 2001 we are introducing a new funding programme worth &#163;12 million over the next three years which will include provision for CCTV. A proposal has been included within the Scottish Executive new research agenda for an evaluation of the new funding arrangements which will also include a review of the systems approved under the existing funding scheme.</p>

  <p>The number of dentists working in Scotland has increased constantly over the last 30 years and by 300 in the last eight years, and we are committed to increasing numbers further. The Scottish Advisory Committee for the Dental Workforce (SACDW) advise on the most effective way to achieve this. Increasing the student intake is only one of the various options that the committee considers. There are currently no plans for a new dental school in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Council for Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education is currently working with ISD Scotland to map the characteristics and supply dynamics of the dental workforce, based on our current annual target output of 120 dental graduates per year. Once this information is available, SACDW will consider the findings and will recommend on the most appropriate method to increase the number of dentists working in primary care in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Executive is providing substantial additional resources to NHSScotland.

The formula used to determine funding takes account of, amongst other factors, the influence of age on the relative healthcare needs of each NHS Board's population.</p>

  <p>However, it is for NHS Boards to decide how to deploy funds on the basis of their assessment of local needs and priorities for investment. In determining local priorities, NHS Boards take account of national priorities and guidance.</p>

  <p>There are currently no arrangements for the formal monitoring by the Executive of the Direct Access System. However, I refer the member to the answer given to question S1W-20636. The answer outlines the scope of the wide ranging review of audiology services currently under way which will include review of the referral systems.</p>

  <p>The time limits for the service of indictments following full committal contemplate such service at any time up to 11 months thereafter. During that time, the cases are investigated and prepared. Except in relation to potential High Court cases, such cases are not brought to the central attention of Crown Office until preparation is complete. The particular statistic sought as regards November 2000 is not recorded and could not be reconstructed except by diverting substantial resources. The same is true of the statistic for November 2001.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, with regard to the statement released by email directly to a selection of ministers and MSPs by Amey Highways Ltd on 15 November 2001, whether the company&#8217;s motorway maintenance programme &quot;has met the exacting standards laid down by the Scottish Executive&quot;; how many default notices have been issued to the company since 1 April 2001; why any such notices were issued in each case, and what impact any such notices have had on the extent to which Amey Highways Ltd meets the standards required by the Executive.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2001-12-18.54.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80189" speakername="Lewis Macdonald" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-01/wa1218.htm#27">

  <p>The Scottish Executive and the Performance Audit Group (Halcrow Group Ltd in association with PricewaterhouseCoopers) monitor the performance of Amey Highways in order to see if this performance meets the standards required by the trunk road contract. Where contract obligations are not met, there is a provision within the contract for a Default Notice to be issued and/or for money to be withheld. A Default Notice identifies a specific issue where an Operating Company is not meeting its contractual obligations and requires the Operating Company to set in train a programme to remedy the situation. To date seven Default Notices have been issued to Amey Highways in South East Unit and 12 to South West Unit. They have been issued in respect of management issues such as compliance of computer systems and operational issues such as cutting of grass verges.</p>

  <p>Default Notices are taken very seriously by the Operating Company and are therefore an effective tool in ensuring that performance is improved. However, in a contract as large and diverse as the trunk road maintenance contracts it is most unlikely that the contractor would at all times meet all of its contractual requirements. Whilst the issue of Default Notices is disappointing, it should not be seen as indicating a general underperformance of the Operating Company.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive on how many occasions since May 1999 it has made media announcements outwith the facilities in Victoria Quay, Edinburgh; what venues were used, and what the total cost was of these announcements.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2001-12-18.55.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80183" speakername="Mr Andy Kerr" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-01/wa1218.htm#28">

  <p>The Scottish Executive makes announcements in venues appropriate for the nature of the announcement, for example: in Parliament; at events or conferences; through visits to organisations or projects throughout the country, and through news releases, as well as through press conferences. The main venue for press conferences is the Media Centre in St Andrews House, although Victoria Quay and other Scottish Executive buildings in Edinburgh and Glasgow are used from time to time.</p>

  <p>Generally events such as these do not incur cost to the Scottish Executive beyond normal running costs and no central record is kept of them.</p>
