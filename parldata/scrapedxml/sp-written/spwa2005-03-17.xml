  <p>The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) has published an Appraisal Consultation Document entitled <em>Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease - donepezil, rivastigmine, </em> galantamine <em> and memantine</em> . The consultation is open until 22 March 2005 and can be accessed at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.nice.org.uk/page.aspx?o=245912" target="_blank">http://www.nice.org.uk/page.aspx?o=245912</a>.</p>

  <p>The consultation document does not constitute the Institute&rsquo;s formal guidance on these drugs and the recommendation made is preliminary and may change after the consultation. A final recommendation will be made later in the year. At that point, NHS Quality Improvement Scotland will provide advice on how relevant the guidance from NICE on these drugs is for NHSScotland.</p>

  <p>The Financial Services Strategy Group (FSSG), a partnership of industry, trade unions and the public sector, was charged with developing a vision and strategy to support the future success of the financial services industry in Scotland. The final meeting of the group was held on 1 March when the members ratified the completed strategy. Consequently we are today publishing <em>A Strategy for the Financial Services Industry in Scotland</em> and the first <em>Annual Implementation Plan</em> .</p>

  <p>The ambitious shared vision is:</p>

  <p>&quot;An innovative, competitive and thriving international financial services industry in Scotland, underpinned by world-class infrastructure and universally recognised as a leader on the global stage.&quot;</p>

  <p>Through our continued commitment to working together, we strive to sustain and maximise the industry&rsquo;s success and the impact it makes on the Scottish economy. We will achieve it by ensuring that the right competitive environment continues to flourish in Scotland. We aim to:</p>

  <p>Strengthen the world-class workforce and improve the business infrastructure;</p>

  <p>Build the industry&rsquo;s profile within and beyond Scotland, and</p>

  <p>Support and encourage innovation within the industry.</p>

  <p>The <em>First Year Implementation Plan</em> sets out the priority, short-term and longer term actions needed to deliver the strategy. Early actions include:</p>

  <p>Examining new air routes from Scotland to key financial services locations;</p>

  <p>Working with mobile phone operators and transport bodies to eliminate &quot;gaps&quot; in coverage between Edinburgh and Glasgow;</p>

  <p>Feeding in the needs of the industry to the Executive&rsquo;s <em>Fresh Talent </em>initiative;</p>

  <p>Enhancing work underway on financial education;</p>

  <p>Building better labour market knowledge, and</p>

  <p>Boosting capability within the supply network.</p>

  <p>A Financial Services Advisory Board (FiSAB) has been created to ensure delivery and further development of the strategy. I will chair FiSAB, alongside an industry deputy chair, with members of the board drawn from all parts of the industry, plus the public sector and trade union representation. FiSAB will be a prime enabler of the continued strategic level collaboration and communication needed to achieve our aims.</p>

  <p>Membership of FiSAB:</p>

  <p>Jim Wallace &ndash; Scottish Executive (Chair)</p>

  <p>John Campbell &ndash; State Street and Scottish Financial Enterprise (Deputy Chair)</p>

  <p>Mike Jones &ndash; Lloyds TSB Scotland</p>

  <p>Ben Thomson &ndash; Noble Group</p>

  <p>Otto Thoresen &ndash; Aegon</p>

  <p>David Wallace &ndash; Abbey</p>

  <p>Graeme Dickson &ndash; Scottish Executive</p>

  <p>Jim McFarlane &ndash; Scottish Enterprise</p>

  <p>Martin Togneri &ndash; Scottish Development International</p>

  <p>HM Treasury observer</p>

  <p>It has been a privilege to chair the group and I look forward to the delivery of the <em>Implementation Plan</em> and to seeing the benefits flow to the industry, the economy and the Scottish people.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is assisting the G8&rsquo;s aims for climate change, for example:</p>

  <p>investing heavily in the development of new renewables technologies, such as wave and tidal power. We believe that Scotland has the potential to be a world leader in these technologies with our companies supplying major international export markets in G8 countries and more widely.</p>

  <p>encouraging and supporting businesses in improving their resource efficiency. This issue will be addressed further in our Green Jobs strategy and our Energy Efficiency Strategy.</p>

  <p>working in a UK forum to build on existing climate change science. We also have a Scottish programme, which includes scientific research. A major study currently underway is to improve our understanding of the processes that drive emissions from organic soils, a significant issue for Scotland.</p>

  <p>In addition, we plan to publish a new Climate Change Programme in the run up to the summit which will set out how we plan to contribute to UK long-term commitments to tackle climate change. This will be reflected in the new Scottish strategy for sustainable development which we are developing to give effect to the shared purpose, principles and priorities &ndash; including climate change and energy &ndash; set out in the joint UK sustainable development framework launched in Edinburgh on 7 March 2005.</p>

  <p>Acoustic neuromas are benign tumours that develop in the covering of the acoustic or auditory nerve. Tests and investigations include hearing tests, neurological examination CT or MRI scan and results will enable a decision on the best type of treatment in individual cases.</p>

  <p>Treatment decisions will be based on a number of factors including general health and the size, rate of growth and position of the tumour. In some cases, if the tumour is small or if it is not causing any symptoms, treatment may not be needed.</p>

  <p>The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI), which represents around 100 companies in the UK producing prescription medicines, has agreed that, wherever possible, liquid formulations for new medicines should be sugar-free. However, not all medicines are suitable for sugar-free formulation and would depend on matters such as the active ingredient and the dosage form.</p>

  <p>In 1998, at the instigation of the Chief Pharmaceutical Officer, a Working Group of the National Pharmaceutical Advisory Committee published a report on <em>Sugar-free Medicines</em>. The report put forward a strategy for the promotion and uptake of sugar-free medicines.</p>

  <p>There are now sugar-free alternatives to most commonly used liquid medicines and NHS prescribers are encouraged to endorse their prescription with &quot;sf&quot; to ensure that the sugar-free preparation is dispensed. Even if the prescription is not endorsed by the prescriber, pharmacists can dispense the sugar-free preparation whenever it is appropriate.</p>

  <p>An examination of prescription data for trends in the prescribing of sugar-free preparations of antibiotics for children for the period 1996 to 2003 found that there has been a steady increase throughout Scotland, from 29% in 1996 to 51% in 2003.</p>

  <p>An audit support pack for pharmacists produced by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain encourages the sale and supply of oral sugar-free liquid medicines, whether the medicines are dispensed on the NHS or purchased privately. The audit provides pharmacists with the opportunity to promote good oral health to patients and to increase manufacturers&rsquo; awareness of the need to produce sugar-free formulations through changes in ordering patterns. The audit pack can be accessed at <a href="http://www.rpsgb.org.uk/pdfs/sugar.pdf" target="_blank">www.rpsgb.org.uk/pdfs/sugar.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p>Specific training in pain management is being delivered in a variety of settings, for example for medical and dental undergraduates and for anaesthetic and intensive care Specialist Registrar trainees, as part of the relevant curriculum; for house officers, in their induction programmes; for surgical and anaesthetic Senior House Officers; for GP registrars and palliative care Specialist Registrar trainees, and for dentists and professionals complementary to dentistry, through postgraduate courses. In addition, pain management teams are now a feature of most hospitals, and junior doctors interface with them during their extensive period of workplace learning.</p>

  <p>The purpose of the personal fellowship scheme, run by the Royal Society of Edinburgh on behalf of the Scottish Executive, is to encourage talented researchers at the start of their career to remain in Scotland to develop outstanding research.

All applications received are considered on the basis of merit.</p>

  <p>Following advice in the Scottish Science Advisory Committee&rsquo;s report <em>Investing in Scientific Talent</em>, I have asked the Royal Society of Edinburgh to undertake, during 2005, a full, independent review of the personal fellowships scheme in order to ensure that it fulfils our current objectives.

  <p>The pilot had two aims - to test the ability of the market to deliver the single survey on a voluntary basis, and to test the concept itself. It is clear from the low take-up that the market-led approach has not delivered and that the scheme does not provide enough incentives for many sellers to participate on a voluntary basis. We believe, however, that the rationale for the single survey remains strong &ndash; providing in-depth information on a property to buyer and seller before sale and ending the need for multiple condition surveys. We therefore concluded that we should now evaluate the detailed outcomes of the pilot with a view to introducing a mandatory scheme.</p>

  <p>No formal or systematic evaluation has been made of any savings to the civil legal aid or other justice budgets as a result of the provision of mediation services. Previous attempts to do so in family cases have been unsuccessful due to the difficulties in ensuring valid comparisons between cases where mediation has taken place and others where it has not. Mediation may reduce costs in some cases where it is successful, but may increase the cost of cases where not successful. The take up of mediation in non-family cases is very low and unlikely to have had any measurable impact on the legal aid budget. Research is being developed with the aim of evaluating the effectiveness of mediation in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Often acts will require to be commenced in stages (for particular provisions or particular purposes) for policy or practical reasons. Decisions about such matters are the responsibility of the minister in charge of the act and so the information requested is not held centrally. Acts of the Scottish Parliament and Scottish Statutory Instruments, including Commencement Orders, are published on the HMSO website. <em>Is it in Force? 2004</em> which is published by LexisNexis, Butterworths, provides full details of provisions in Acts of the Scottish Parliament which had not yet been brought into force as at 17 February 2004. If the member would like information about any specific act or any specific provision or provisions in an act, the relevant portfolio minister will be happy to provide that information.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to building workforce capacity within NHSScotland.</p>

  <p>Under the banner of <em>Facing the Future</em>, a number of recruitment and retention initiatives have been launched to specifically build capacity across the nursing and midwifery workforce. These include a review of workload, a review of nurse bank arrangements in Scotland as well as additional funding for clinical leadership programmes.</p>

  <p>Presently we are unaware of any specific concerns relating to a shortage of midwives in Scotland.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that not all will necessarily be lost to the service as some students choose to transfer to other nursing categories during training.</p>

  <p>On 24 February 2005 the First Minister announced that the Executive was establishing a review group to consider the operational performance of NHS 24 and to come forward with recommendations for action, including actions for NHS 24, NHS boards, other partners and the Health Department for improving the services provided.</p>

  <p>The terms of reference of the review group include the requirement for the group to come forward with recommendations for improving services for patients in remote and rural areas. And I expect both NHS 24 and the group to consider whether the current three call centre model best meets the expected performance standards for the service.</p>

  <p>No. The extension of borrowing powers to individual boards in Scotland has not been considered since Scottish ministers have no powers to raise extra resources by borrowing or sanctioning borrowing. Capital funding in the NHS is controlled by rules issued by HM Treasury, the Scottish Executive has no power to change these rules which are a reserved matter for Westminster.</p>

  <p>Three-month vacancy rates are not held for consultant psychiatrists. Instead a total vacancy rate and one for over six months is collected via the annual census. At September 2004, the over six months vacancy rate for consultants within all psychiatric specialties was 4.7%.</p>

  <p>Vacancy rates for other grades of medical and dental staff are not collected centrally.</p>

  <p>Data collected as part of the omnibus household survey, the Scottish Opinion Survey, are used by <strong></strong> sportscotland to produce their annual reports on sports participation in Scotland. Because the sub-sample sizes for many individual sports are relatively small, <strong></strong> sportscotland use the data from the three previous years for each annual report. This increases the sub-sample sizes, thereby reducing the sampling error for individual sports to make the estimates of participation more reliable than they would be for a single year. To take account of the seasonality of participation in many sports, results from only the two most popular months of the year are used.</p>

  <p>The rolling average for 1999-2002 (up to December 2002) was 48% and for 2000-03 (up to December 2003) was 45%. Whilst this shows a decrease, we expect this to change once infrastructure developments such as Active Schools are bedded in. Active Schools should lead to improved links between schools and clubs (and tertiary education) and thus pathways for school leavers to continue their participation in sport with a club and/or in further education. Figures up to December 2004 will not be available until summer 2005, and will be reported to the Sport 21 National Implementation Forum in October 2005. Thereafter, figures will be posted on <strong></strong>sportscotland&rsquo;s website <a href="http://www.sportscotland.org.uk" target="_blank">www.sportscotland.org.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>The rolling average for 1999-2002 (up to December 2002) was 78% and for 2000-2003 (up to December 2003) was 71.3%. Whilst this shows a decrease, we expect this to change once infrastructure developments such as Active Schools are bedded in. Active Schools should lead to improved links between schools and clubs (and tertiary education) and thus pathways for this age group to continue their participation in sport outside the school curriculum. Figures up to December 2004 will not be available until summer 2005, and will be reported to the Sport 21 National Implementation Forum in October 2005. Thereafter, figures will be posted on <strong></strong> sportscotland&rsquo;s website <a href="www.sportscotland.org.uk%20" target="_blank">www.sportscotland.org.uk </a></p>

  <p>The method of measurement is the same as that stated in the answer to <br /> question S2W-14291 on 17 March 2005. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at:</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what discussions it has had with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government regarding the viability of the Inland Revenue&rsquo;s operations in Scotland following reductions in civil servant numbers and, in particular, the degree of confidence that the Inland Revenue has regarding its ability to apply the 3% variable rate on the basic rate of income tax should that be agreed.</p>

  <p>Inland Revenue&rsquo;s operations in Scotland are a matter for Inland Revenue since its functions are a reserved matter.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&rsquo;s Draft Budget 2005-06, published in October 2004, stated that the Executive had agreed with the Inland Revenue that the infrastructure necessary to use the tax-varying powers will be kept in a condition where, after a May election, the powers could be introduced from the start of the new financial year the next April. Following the initial investment made during the last Parliament to bring the infrastructure to this condition the cost of maintaining this state of readiness is &pound;50,000 a year.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&rsquo;s central switchboard and enquiry facility has two published numbers, one geographic and one non-geographic. In 2004 the decision was made to promote the use of the 0845 774 1741 number rather than the 0131 556 8400 in order to provide equality of access across Scotland. The British Telecommunications plc phonebook entries are being updated to reflect this and work is currently underway on redesigning the content and format of these entries.</p>

  <p>There is no statutory requirement to collect information on the number of complaints about weeds specified in the Weeds Act 1959, but the Environment and Rural Affairs Department does this on an annual basis, and passes complaints about specified weeds on non-agricultural land to the relevant authority. This includes local authorities, the companies operating road maintenance contracts and railway authorities. These complaints are included in the annual statistics kept by the Environment and Rural Affairs Department.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not receive information from local authorities about the annual number of complaints received directly by them regarding the injurious weeds listed in the Weeds Act 1959.</p>

  <p>Only two items have been reported lost or stolen from members&rsquo; offices since end of August 2004, namely a camera from the first floor valued at &pound;400 and a mouse from the fifth floor valued at &pound;20. Both instances occurred in December 2004 with no reported losses in any of the other months.</p>
