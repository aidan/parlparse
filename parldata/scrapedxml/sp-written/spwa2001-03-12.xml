  <p>The Executive has taken a number of steps to encourage organic farming generally. These include significantly increased payment rates and hectarage limits for the Organic Aid Scheme; priority under the Scottish Executive Rural Affairs Department&#8217;s Marketing and Development Scheme for those involved in organic production, and the funding of the organic helpline operated by the Scottish Agricultural College.</p>

  <p>More specifically, applications are now being accepted for the department&#8217;s Processing and Marketing Scheme for the Highlands and Islands under the revised special transitional arrangements for the area.</p>

  <p>At the end of January 2001 there were 146 farmers/crofters from within the Highlands and Islands who have either participated, are currently participating or are awaiting approval into the scheme. This represents 22% of the Scottish total who have applied to join the scheme since its inception.</p>

  <p>The diagnosis of autism ultimately remains a clinical one, which may require input from a number of different disciplines.</p>

  <p>Initial results from the Borders Multi-Agency Service for Children with Autism provide evidence that autism can be detected earlier in life through earlier screening. This service involved health visitors screening children before the age of two years and resulted in a 50% increase in the number of cases of autistic spectrum disorder detected.</p>

  <p>Over the last decade, broadening the diagnostic criteria to encompass &quot;autistic spectrum disorders&quot; has become more common in Scotland.</p>

  <p>General practitioners take responsibility for their own learning needs as part of the process of lifelong learning and maintenance of clinical skills. We would expect all GPs to keep up to date with current thinking and practice in all clinical areas, including autism, as part of their continuing professional development.</p>

  <p>I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that beef from over thirty month old animals may enter the food chain if it is from specialist herds registered under the Beef Assurance Scheme or from animals born, reared and slaughtered in one of 14 non-EU countries that are designated as low BSE risk.</p>

  <p>The over thirty month (OTM) rule, which keeps meat from cattle aged over 30 months at slaughter out of the food chain, is strictly enforced in licensed abattoirs by officials of the Meat Hygiene Service. The agency is keeping this under close scrutiny and high levels of compliance with the OTM rule have been found by the agency and local authorities who report on the position in unlicensed plants.</p>

  <p>The Food Standards Agency advises that the Fresh Meat (Beef Controls) (No. 2) Regulations 1996 (as amended) provide powers for enforcement officers to ensure that meat intended for human consumption, imported or otherwise, has been derived either from cattle from a low-risk BSE country or from cattle no more than thirty months old at slaughter, unless specifically exempted under the Beef Assurance Scheme. In addition, all meat from premises licensed under the Fresh Meat (Hygiene and Inspection) Regulations 1995 must be accompanied by the appropriate health mark indicating that the meat has been subject to official veterinary controls and is therefore fit for human consumption.</p>

  <p>The Food Standards Agency advises that although recent EU legislation provides for some elements of compulsory beef labelling, the agency continues to attach great importance to clear and unambiguous country of origin labelling for all meat and meat products and is pressing the Commission and others on this.</p>

  <p>Effective systems are in plan to provide assurance about the source of meat being imported into the UK. In terms of traceability, all beef entering the UK from other member states will have been subject to a veterinary inspection there and health-marked in accordance with EU legislation.</p>

  <p>Under EU trade agreements with individual third countries, meat can only be exported into the EU from specific Commission-approved plants. Each consignment of meat imported to the UK is therefore subject to a document inspection at designated Border Inspection Points (BIPs) to ensure that the meat is properly health-marked and comes from an approved plant. Daily enforcement of these standards is provided by the veterinary services of that state and overseen by the Commission.</p>

  <p><u>Otters</u></p>

  <p>A Biodiversity Action Plan has been developed to conserve and enhance the otter throughout the UK. In Scotland, Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) provides advice on measures to conserve otter populations. An updated version of SNH&#8217;s &quot;Otters and Development&quot; booklet is in production and will be available soon, and consideration is being given to undertaking a fourth otter survey of Scotland.</p>

  <p>The otter is also listed in Annex II of the EC Habitats Directive, which requires the designation of Special Areas of Conservation (SAC). As a result, 41 sites have been proposed in Scotland as Special Areas of Conservation for otter. Most of these sites are located in the Highlands and Islands. This means that appropriate steps must be taken to avoid deterioration of the habitats or significant disturbance of the species.</p>

  <p><u>Pine martens</u></p>

  <p>I understand that SNH is promoting management practices for the conservation of pine martens. These include the expansion of native woodland, provision of advice on resolving issues involving pine martens occupying buildings, advice on the design of artificial breeding boxes and the promotion of non-lethal solutions to conflicts between pine martens and game-rearing interests.</p>

  <p><u>Wildcats</u></p>

  <p>I understand that SNH, in collaboration with other key stakeholders, is currently developing an action plan and strategy for conservation of the species in Scotland.</p>

  <p>We have no such plans at present. However, we will consider carefully any recommendations from the &quot;It Pays to Pay&quot; Working Group, which we have established to look at options for improving council tax collection. The group includes representatives from local authorities and consumer organisations and other relevant interests.</p>

  <p>We are supporting a number of initiatives aimed at addressing crime and fear of crime in rural areas. Examples of some of the measures we are taking are: promoting, with ACPOS and COSLA, our joint community safety strategy which encourages community safety partnerships established in all Scottish councils to respond effectively to rural as well as urban crime problems; providing tangible funding to support the partnerships - &#163;3 million in 2001-02 for urban and rural areas through the CCTV and Community Safety Challenge Competitions; the development of a strategy to address domestic abuse in Scotland which recognises the particular problems faced by women living in rural areas, with &#163;5 million funding in 2001-02 to agencies to improve the service provision to women and children experiencing domestic abuse across the whole of Scotland and to improve prevention strategies. Action to reduce crime across Scotland depends on police forces being adequately funded and our plans provide for an additional &#163;166 million current expenditure by police authorities over the next three years. It is for chief constables, in consultation with their authorities, to determine how their resources are used within authority areas.</p>

  <p>I am advised that the Crown Estate has around 170 let river fishings, and owns 50 coastal netting stations, six of which are let but only one of which is currently operated. It also owns, through acquisition, other salmon fishing rights within the boundaries of its five agricultural estates, of which the main ones are in Morayshire and Dumfriesshire.</p>

  <p>As is the case with all owners of salmon fishing rights, the Crown Estate&#8217;s ownership of salmon fishing rights carry with them the lesser rights of fishing for freshwater fish, which include the rights to fish for trout. On the agricultural estates, the Crown Estate also has riparian rights to trout fishing, which are a pertinent of the land.</p>

  <p>Similarly, by virtue of riparian ownership, the Crown Estate has rights to other freshwater (i.e. coarse) fishing on its estates. It has no interest in freshwater fish farms. In relation to marine fish farms, the Crown Estate&#8217;s rights stem from ownership of the relevant foreshore and/or seabed.</p>

  <p>Locate in Scotland promotes the whole of Scotland as a location for inward investment.</p>

  <p>However, in recognition of the particular difficulties which rural areas face in attracting inward investment, Locate in Scotland established its Rural Inward Investment Team in the latter half of 1998. The Rural Investment team works closely with Scottish Enterprise, the Local Enterprise Companies and Highlands &amp; Islands Enterprise in order to highlight to investors the many benefits that rural Scotland has to offer.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive declared its commitment to supporting rural economic development as a key priority with the publication in May 2000 of <i>Rural Scotland: A New Approach</i> . The particular opportunities and challenges facing rural Scotland were also fully recognised in <i>The Way Forward: A Framework for Economic Development in Scotland,</i> published in June 2000. The recent strategy for enterprise, <i>A Smart, Successful Scotland</i> , which provides a clear sense of direction and priorities for Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise, sets the foundation for successful and sustainable economic development across Scotland, including the Highlands and Islands.</p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise and their networks of local enterprise companies are the Executive&#8217;s main agencies for the promotion of economic development in rural areas, and are committed to pursuing a wide range of activities for this purpose, including the exploitation of advances in information and communications technology, support for business formation, development, and diversification, the encouragement of commercial application of scientific and technological research, enhancing learning and training opportunities, specific initiatives targeted upon the development of key sectors such as food and drink, forestry and tourism, and through ensuring that there is an adequate supply of sites and premises for business purposes.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is also committed to providing substantial support for traditional rural industries such as agriculture, fisheries, fish farming and crofting and to the improvement of rural transport through investment in infrastructure projects such as the Eriskay causeway. Specific initiatives such as Initiative at the Edge and the establishment of the Scottish Land Fund are aimed at promoting the development of remote and rural communities and facilitating social and economic development through community ownership and development of land.</p>

  <p>Through its agency Locate in Scotland, the Scottish Executive promotes the whole of Scotland as a location for inward investment. Any attempt to steer companies to particular areas would almost certainly be counter-productive, resulting in the loss of projects to Scotland.</p>

  <p>However, in recognition of the particular difficulties which rural areas face in attracting inward investment, Locate in Scotland established its Rural Inward Investment Team in the latter half of 1998. The Rural Investment team works closely with Highlands and Island Enterprise, Scottish Enterprise, the Local Enterprise Companies, local authorities and other local agencies in order to highlight to investors the many benefits that rural Scotland has to offer.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive Rural Affairs Department commissions Fisheries Research Services (FRS) to conduct routine and specific monitoring around the Scottish coast. One of the 18 Scottish stations in the National Monitoring Programme (NMP) is located off the Kirkcudbright coast. <i> </i> Within the NMP, measurements of water column chemistry, sediment chemistry and biology and of contaminant levels in fish are made annually, and the results for the period 1999 to 2001 are scheduled to be published in 2002. The results of similar measurements taken in a scoping exercise are contained in a report available through the FRS website (http://www.marlab.ac.uk/NMPR/SNMP/SNMP.htm). Arrangements are being made for copies of the report to be placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>In addition the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) undertakes a programme of environmental monitoring for radioactivity linked to authorised liquid and gaseous discharges of radioactive waste to the environment. Extensive monitoring under this programme is carried out in the Solway Firth. The data is updated and reviewed annually, and published in the joint SEPA/Food Standards Agency publication <i>Radioactivity in Food and the Environment</i>.

  <p>I have asked Graeme Munro, Chief Executive of Historic Scotland to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Holyrood Park is a Royal Park managed on behalf of the Scottish ministers by Historic Scotland. Historic Scotland normally aim to provide one week&#8217;s notice of forthcoming road closures to local radio stations, emergency services, the City of Edinburgh Council and motorists&#8217; organisations. Occasionally, roads are closed at short notice for emergencies.</p>

  <p>The roads within the park are classed as Crown roads and are not formally part of the local public road network. The Holyrood Park Regulations grant powers of closure to the Royal Parks Constabulary.</p>

  <p>Because the Parliament development will close the east end of Holyrood Road, with traffic being diverted through the park, Historic Scotland and the City Council are currently discussing an agreement which will govern future road closures in the park.</p>

  <p>The road works related to the construction of the Holyrood Parliament fall into two categories. The first involves the upgrading of the roads in Holyrood Park around the Parliament site to carry the traffic which will be displaced by the closure of the eastern end of Holyrood Road. This work, which is now under way, is being funded through Historic Scotland, the managers of Holyrood Park, at an estimated cost of &#163;1.420 million inclusive of fees and VAT.</p>

  <p>The second area of road works involves traffic calming measures to Horse Wynd and Reid&#8217;s Close. This work is being funded by the Scottish Executive through the City of Edinburgh Council, who are responsible for the roads outwith the park and is at detailed design stage. There will be further discussions with the council about the cost of these works.</p>

  <p>Funds earmarked for the Empty Homes Initiative in this coming financial year have already been allocated to local authorities and there is currently no scope to reallocate these funds. However, we will be monitoring progress during the year.</p>

  <p>In terms of making funding available to tackle homelessness, we have increased the funding for the Rough Sleepers Initiative (RSI) for the five years from 1997-2002 to &#163;42 million. In addition to this, over the next three years we have backed the legislative proposals on homelessness with &#163;27 million and made a further &#163;12.5 million available to decommission Glasgow&#8217;s large hostels.</p>

  <p>The Housing (Scotland) Bill contains measures intended to:</p>

  <p>provide new and strengthened rights for homeless people needing accommodation, advice and assistance;</p>

  <p>provide a right to register on a housing list for every one over the age of 16;</p>

  <p>improve the quality and consistency of housing management including the allocation of housing;</p>

  <p>put in place enhanced strategic arrangements for local authorities to plan and fund housing requirements in their area.</p>

  <p>These and other measures contained in the Bill will benefit both rural and urban communities in all parts of Scotland. They are complementary to other policy initiatives, such as investment programmes to ensure that 20,000 new and improved homes are built across Scotland for affordable renting or low-cost home ownership over the three years 1999-2000 to 2001-02.</p>

  <p>Mortgage rescue provides support to homeowners in mortgage difficulties and can help families to remain in their homes and avoid the negative effects of repossession. We are aware of a number of mortgage rescue schemes operating in Scotland with support from some of the major lenders. By building on their experience, we are keen to consider the merits of a national mortgage rescue or mortgage to rent scheme to extend the availability of such support throughout Scotland. We are working closely with lenders, housing associations and Scottish Homes in considering the detail of a possible national scheme and I hope to make further announcements in the coming months.</p>

  <p>The 1999 New Earnings Survey highlighted that average earnings in the Highlands &amp; Islands are below those earned in Scotland and Great Britain. This reflects the traditional narrow base of the economy of the Highlands &amp; Islands. The key thrust of the Scottish Executive to address this issue is the diversification of economic activity in the area through its agency Highlands and Islands Enterprise.</p>

  <p>During the year 1999-2000, 80% of the jobs created through inward investment were in the knowledge sector, contributing to the broadening of opportunity in the area. The quality of employment is an explicit element of Highlands and Islands Enterprise&#8217;s annual target framework, and the network has focused on bringing new opportunities to the fragile parts of the area, as evidenced in the attraction of the Stolt project to Harris in the Western Isles.</p>

  <p>These activities will all help diversify employment in the Highlands and Islands and raise average per capita income. An output of this diversifying business portfolio is to reduce the differential between Highland and Island and Scottish/UK per capita income. As per capita income is constantly changing, continually eroding the differential is a more robust measure than a specific target date.</p>

  <p>Warrant sales are normally conducted in auction houses. They can only be carried out in domestic premises where the occupier thereof and, if he is not the occupier, the debtor gives consent in writing. No records are kept centrally of the number of occasions such consent is given.</p>

  <p>Poindings proceed on the authority of the extracted warrant. No applications for poinding are therefore made. The table sets out the number of poindings effected under the summary warrant procedure for Council Tax arrears and Community Tax arrears for the years 1995 to 1999 in Scotland, which are the latest available. The data collected does not specify the numbers of poindings effected by each local authority.</p>

  <p>Through the Central Local Government 21st Century Forum, the Scottish Executive is encouraging local authorities to deliver electronically all services for which this is feasible by 2005. To promote progress towards this target, the Scottish Executive monitors developments like the Camden scheme both north and south of the border.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-12577 by Susan Deacon on 1 February 2001, how many clinical psychology training posts were provided from the &#163;100,000 allocated to the Scottish Council for Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education.</p>

  <p>The additional funding for clinical psychology training secured eight posts so that the output from the training programmes in Scotland over the next three years will be 32 clinical psychologists per year. Without the additional funding the output would have fallen back to the previous figure of 24 per year. Supported by the clinical psychology committee of the Scottish Council for Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education (SCPMDE), work is under way to define the number and type of psychologists required to provide psychological services in NHSScotland in the most effective way.</p>

  <p>There are no plans to extend the study to the 44 private training providers.</p>

  <p>To build on the strengths identified in the Full-Time Education and Training (FTET) Report, three regional good practice dissemination events are being held in Inverness, Glasgow and Edinburgh this month to enable the expertise established by private training providers and FE colleges to be shared between New Deal specialist staff in both sectors.</p>

  <p>These will be workshop-led events. Each workshop has an identified theme which will maximise the opportunity to highlight good practice in key areas related to the New Deal programme.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to tackling the causes of population decline through initiatives targeted at rural communities across Scotland. In the Western Isles, the Executive supports economic development through Highlands and Islands Enterprise and Western Isles Enterprise.

Wider programmes, such as Iomairt aig an Oir (the Initiative at the Edge) and grants for community land purchase, are also boosting the local economy and creating jobs.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what impact the anticipated 19.9% reduction in the population of Eilean Siar between 1998 and 2016, as detailed in the Registrar General for Scotland&#8217;s Annual Report for 1999, will have on the long-term economic, cultural and social viability of the islands.</p>

  <p>The latest, 1998-based population projections produced by The Registrar General for Scotland, indicate that the population of the Western Isles will decline by 14.2% (3,960 people) over the period 1998 to 2016. Population projections provide an indication of future changes in population if assumptions about future levels of fertility, mortality and migration, based on past trends, are realised. These projections do not take into account potential economic or social changes which might impact on population decline or growth. As indicated in the answer given to question S1W-13645, the Scottish Executive is committed to addressing the causes of population decline in the Western Isles, together with local agencies and authorities, through a wide range of measures.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive recognises that the formation, growth and survival of small businesses is crucial to the economic success of the Highlands and Islands, and to Scotland as a whole. The way forward is set out in the publication <i>A Smart, Successful Scotland</i> &#8211; the first comprehensive statement by the Executive setting out the direction and priorities for the Enterprise Networks.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is continuing to work closely with Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) to ensure easier access to public sector support for new and small businesses in the HIE area. A number of significant developments are in hand. For example, HIE will shortly be introducing HIE Starts, a flexible new programme which has support from the Highlands &amp; Islands Transitional Programme; it will provide information, advice, training and financial assistance to small business starts that have the potential to contribute to the growth of the local economy.</p>

  <p>In addition, Inverness and Nairn Enterprise have developed The Greenhouse in Inverness which provides a range of office and laboratory incubator accommodation for technology based start-ups. The Outreach Incubator project complements The Greenhouse by providing support and guidance to technology start-ups throughout the Highlands and Islands.</p>

  <p>In addition to these programmes, which are specific to start-ups, new businesses can also access the wide range of business and skills development programmes delivered by the HIE Network.</p>

  <p>There are 48 Social Inclusion Partnerships (SIPs) in Scotland tackling social exclusion in priority areas and client groups. These include the Highlands &amp; Islands SIP, which addresses social exclusion in young people across a number of priority areas, and the Argyll &amp; Bute SIP, which addresses social exclusion on an area-based approach across a number of priority areas.</p>

  <p>The priority areas were selected by the SIPs. The Highlands &amp; Islands SIP identified: Ormlie (Thurso); Westford/Milnafua (Alness); Merkinch (Inverness); Upper Fort William; Kinlochleven; Acharacle and the Initiative at the Edge Areas of North Sutherland; Ardnamurchan; Westray and Papa Westray in Orkney Islands; and Uig &amp; Bernera, the Bays of Harris, Lochboisdale and Eriskay within the Western Isles. The Argyll &amp; Bute SIP identified: Ardenslate; Ballochgoy; Dalintober; Kirkmichael, and Soroba.</p>

  <p>As well as the Highlands and Islands SIP and the Argyll &amp; Bute SIP, we are also providing funding to the Lochaber Working for Communities Pathfinder which covers Acharacle, Mallaig, Kilchoan, Kinlochleven, Lochaline, Duror, Fort William and Invergarry and the Western Isles Working for Communities Pathfinder and we announced recently that Eilean Siar would receive &#163;1.35 million over three years to develop better neighbourhood services, in areas to be selected by the local authority.</p>

  <p>Components within the core of courses of initial teacher education already consist, where appropriate, of inter-related units in special educational needs. Guidelines for initial teacher education in Scotland require teacher education institutions to prepare teachers to be responsive to the needs of all pupils in respect of special educational needs.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is providing over &#163;5 million per year to local authorities for the development and training of classroom-based staff and trainee educational psychologists working with children with special educational needs, including dyslexia and other similar conditions. &#163;1 million of this funding is directed towards early intervention, which addresses a wide variety of training requirements including accreditation such as the Certificate in Dyslexia.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive Education Department has worked jointly with the Scottish Dyslexia Trust to train teachers in dyslexia awareness and early identification. The Executive is currently funding the Trust to run a national seminar and to produce a report to highlight good practice and innovative approaches for teaching dyslexic pupils. This report will be issued to all education authorities in Scotland.</p>

  <p>In addition, the 3-5 Curriculum guidelines for pre-school education cover the key aspects of children&#8217;s development and learning. Differences in children&#8217;s progress, and any need for extra support, are noted through observation and careful assessment.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is considering with the UK Government how best to extend broadband access as widely as possible, including the role of public sector procurement of broadband services in stimulating wider supply by the industry.</p>

  <p>The Executive recognises that in remoter parts of Scotland, including parts of the Highland &amp; Islands, a different approach may be needed. In this context we welcome the work of the Highlands &amp; Islands Partnership under the special Transitional Programme which is considering the need for Public/Private Partnerships to encourage investment in remoter areas.</p>
