  <p>The gas, electricity and telecommunications industries are regulated, and their regulation is a reserved matter. The relevant regulatory regimes are currently being reformed by the Department of Trade and Industry with a view to further promoting consumer interests.</p>

  <p>The Scottish water authorities are statutory public corporations and each has a Code of Practice for customer service. Limited provisions for compensation in specific circumstances exist, but the main emphasis of the regulatory regime is to improve efficiency and standards of service.</p>

  <p>I am not persuaded at this stage that we should change the upper age limit for Children&#8217;s Panel members. I will review this in the light of the current recruitment campaign. This was launched on 6 September and seeks to increase the number of male members.</p>

  <p>A short-life Working Group comprising health, education and local authority professionals together with representatives from the Scottish Executive will oversee the publication of a good practice guide on the administration of medicines in schools by teachers. This guide will include a specific section relating to children with epilepsy, providing examples of types of seizures and medication and control measures. The guide is likely to be available for issue in December 1999.</p>

  <p>In the last financial year, 1998-99, Scottish Women&#8217;s Aid was awarded central Government funding totalling almost &pound;370,000. In the same year a start-up grant of &pound;20,000 was awarded to CHANGE (Men Learning to End Violence Against Women).</p>

  <p>In 1998-99 Victim Support Scotland received an ad hoc grant of &pound;30,000 from The Scottish Office to meet the costs of providing a telephone counselling and advice service for those using the freephone helpline facility which was specifically set up to support The Scottish Office domestic abuse advertising campaign.</p>

  <p>In addition, Scottish Homes approved grant funding of &pound;136,324 in 1998-99 on three projects for households that had suffered domestic violence. This grant funding related to the total provision of 20 units (39 bedspaces).</p>

  <p>Information about funding provided by public bodies at a local level to tackle domestic violence is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is concerned about the welfare of all of those who are the victims of domestic violence and looks forward to receiving from the Scottish Partnership on Domestic Violence recommendations which will help formulate policy on how the problem may be addressed.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is determined to ensure that older people in our communities, whether at home or in residential care, are protected at every level. We are contributing to the funding of a UK telephone helpline run by Action on Elderly Abuse which provides confidential support for anyone suffering from abuse. We have set up the National Care Standards Committee to draw up new care standards. We have announced that we will set up an independent Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care to register and inspect all care homes, day care and home-based care. And we are introducing arrangements to register the social care workforce, including in the first tranche, heads of residential establishments.</p>

  <p>Scottish Ministers confirmed on 24 August their intention to put a Mental Health Bill before the Scottish Parliament using emergency procedures upon the resumption of Parliament. This Bill addresses issues raised by the case of Noel Ruddle. The Mental Health (Public Safety and Appeals) (Scotland) Bill was passed by the Scottish Parliament on 8 September.</p>

  <p>The Mental Health (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill was introduced in the House of Commons in Westminster on 13<sup>th</sup> January 1999 by Eric Clarke MP. That Bill would amend s94 of the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984.</p>

  <p>The Executive intends to bring forward legislation to reform mental health law, once the reports of the committee chaired by Lord MacLean into serious violent and sexual offenders and the committee chaired by the Right Honourable Bruce Millan have been considered. Lord MacLean&#8217;s report is expected by early next year and that of the Millan committee by summer 2000.</p>

  <p>There are currently 2 MRI scanners at Ninewells Hospital. As part of the initiative to reduce waiting lists, I understand both MRI scanners operated five days per week between January and March 1999. This was made possible mainly by existing radiology staff working additional sessions. However, staff could not sustain that level of activity beyond the short term and between April and June one MRI scanner operated for five days supplemented by two evening sessions. The evening sessions were suspended in July to enable the leave needs of staff to be taken into account but these will resume this month.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, the Trust is seeking to recruit the additional specialist team of staff necessary to increase MRI scanning activity. Depending on the availability of suitably trained and experienced staff, the Trust expects to have the second MRI scanner operational three days each week by January 2000. Thereafter, the intention is to increase the service further until both scanners are operational five days per week.</p>

  <p>The information requested can not be identified separately. A wide range of expenditure and action by Health Boards and NHS Trusts contributes to relieving bed blocking. This includes effective discharge planning, improving rehabilitation services and other developments falling to the NHS acting alone or working together with local authorities and other partners. This is reflected in each Health Board&#8217;s Health Improvement Programme and in Trust Implementation Plans.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service, in line with other parts of the NHS in Scotland, is geared up to deal with major incidents and provide emergency care 365 days a year. This winter will be no different. It is recognised, however, that the extended Millennium holiday will pose particular challenges requiring special preparation and planning arrangements.</p>

  <p>As part of this process the Scottish Ambulance Service is working with police, fire and local authorities to ensure that all major, planned local celebratory events are identified and that adequate first aid arrangements are made by the organisers. Consideration is also being given to the need for establishing emergency care centres at major celebration venues. Furthermore, in preparing its staffing plans for this period, the Scottish Ambulance Service has been mindful of the potential demands which millennium street parties and other events, whether licensed and approved or not, might place on the Service&#8217;s resources.</p>

  <p>In terms of the preparedness of the NHS in Scotland as a whole, we have established a Year 2000 National Co-ordinating Group to ensure that there is no material disruption to the delivery of health services over the Millennium period. Each health service body, including the Scottish Ambulance Service, has an executive director responsible for our Year 2000 action programme at local level and the Chief Officers and Boards of these bodies, who are briefed on progress regularly at public meetings, have this programme as a high priority.</p>

  <p>Under the arrangements set out in the NHSiS Management Executive Letter MEL(1994)104, which is still in force, Health Boards have been asked to fund around 50% of agreed running costs of the adult voluntary hospices. The MEL recognised that the exact level would vary according to local circumstances and each Health Board&#8217;s palliative care strategy. The Scottish Executive Health Department monitors the Health Boards&#8217; contribution through information gathered by the Scottish Partnership Agency for Palliative and Cancer Care and the Scottish Voluntary Hospices Forum.</p>

  <p>Scottish Ministers attach a high priority to tackling homelessness in general and rough sleeping in particular. The discharge of its homelessness responsibilities is however an operational decision for each local authority. I understand from the council that this closure will not occur until suitable alternative services are in place.</p>

  <p>This reflects the fact that a high proportion of economically active tenants leave the local authority housing sector either by exercising the Right to Buy their council house or by moving to private sector housing. This means that a higher proportion of remaining local authority tenants are likely to be in receipt of housing benefit.</p>

  <p>Between its inception on 1 April 1987 and 31 March 1999, the Scottish Legal Aid Board has dealt with just over 310,000 applications for civil legal aid of which just over 60,000 were refused following a review of the decision; over 1 million applications for an increase in authorised expenditure under Advice and Assistance, of which approximately 110,000 were refused; and over 800,000 applications for summary criminal legal aid (including appeals) of which around 79,000 were refused following a request for a review of the decision. Solemn criminal legal aid is determined by the courts and central records of applications refused are not maintained.</p>

  <p>Records are not held on the number of representations by Members of Parliament who request that the Board&#8217;s decision be reviewed. This is because the Board will only consider a formal legal application for a review or reconsideration of a decision if it comes from the applicant or their solicitor.</p>

  <p>Following on from the White Paper <i>Aiming for Excellence: Modernising Social Work Services in Scotland</i> , we intend to legislate to set up an independent body, the Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care, to register and inspect all residential and nursing homes, as well as a range of other care provision.</p>

  <p>Registration and inspection functions, currently undertaken by local authorities for private and voluntary sector residential homes and by health boards for nursing homes, will therefore pass to the new body. In addition, the new body will register and inspect local authorities&#8217; own provision. The Commission will both assist to raise actual standards of care and address consistency of service quality across Scotland.</p>

  <p>We are about to consult on the detail of these proposals, which have been well received in principle. This consultation will include a seminar for over 70 interest group representatives on 24 September 1999, and a consultation paper to be issued later this year. There will then be further consultation on a draft Bill. I hope that we will be able to include the Bill in our legislative programme for the second session. Subject to successful completion of Parliamentary stages it is our aim to have the new Commission operational by 1 April 2001.</p>

  <p>prior approval procedures for the siting and appearance of telecommunications masts;</p>

  <p>increased controls over telecommunications development in Sites of Special Scientific Interest;</p>

  <p>clarification that planning permission is required to extend the height of an existing mast beyond 15 metres;</p>

  <p>The recruitment and deployment of police officers is a matter for chief constables to control from within their GAE provision. For the current year police authorities and joint police boards have set budgets totalling &pound;711.9m, which represents an increase of 4% over last year&#8217;s figure. This should be sufficient to allow police numbers to be maintained at adequate levels.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive was informed of the appointment by the Secretary of State for Scotland. The appointment was made under transitional arrangements made by the then Scottish Office Ministers, so as to ensure that appropriate arrangements were in place to investigate complaints of maladministration from 1 July when the Scottish Parliament and Scottish Executive took up their powers.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration is appointed by Her Majesty under article 4 of the Scotland Act 1998 (Transitory and Transitional Provisions) (Complaints of Maladministration) Order 1999 (S.I. 1999/1351). He holds office under Her Majesty and exercises his functions on behalf of the Crown.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Parliament has power to determine the salary and allowances in respect of expenses for the Commissioner but, as the present Commissioner also holds office as Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, he is not entitled to any salary in his capacity as Scottish Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration. The Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB) may determine the other terms and conditions of the appointment.</p>

  <p>The costs of the Scottish Commissioner&#8217;s office in Edinburgh will be paid by the SPCB. The appropriate amounts are a matter for the SPCB to settle with the Office of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration.</p>

  <p>The Commissioner himself continues to be based in his London office but complaints against the Scottish Executive and other Scottish public authorities will be dealt with by staff based in his Edinburgh office.</p>

  <p>Under section 91 of the Scotland Act 1998, an Act of the Scottish Parliament will be required to put in place the permanent arrangements for investigating complaints of maladministration. This will be preceded by a wide-ranging consultation process. My officials have begun initial research work and to identify issues which might need to be addressed.</p>

  <p>It will be for the Parliament to decide in due course what provision such an Act should make for the appointment of a permanent Commissioner.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is responsible only for expenditure on motorways and trunk roads. Other A Class roads and B Class roads are the responsibility of Councils and comprehensive information is not available on their construction proposals.</p>

  <p>The planned expenditure set out in the response to question S1W-616 by Jack McConnell is expected to result in 40.8km (25.35 miles) of new road being opened in 1999-2000. Decisions on the use of the motorways and trunk roads budget for the two subsequent years have still to be taken.</p>

  <p>There are no plans to conduct a review of overtaking opportunities on the Aberdeen to Peterhead road in the coming year, as the Scottish Executive already has sufficient data for present purposes.</p>

  <p>Between 1991 and 1996 there were 2 fatal, 1 serious and 6 slight injury accidents at the location known as Hatton Bends. Following the installation of remedial measures in 1996 there have been no recorded injury accidents.<br /></p>
