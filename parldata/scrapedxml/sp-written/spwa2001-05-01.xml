  <p>The Scottish Executive has established an Impact Assessment Group to identify the impact foot-and-mouth disease is having across sectors and areas. A local impact assessment group in Dumfries and Galloway &#8211; which includes Scottish Enterprise Dumfries and Galloway, the council, the area tourist board, and other local organisations &#8211; is feeding into the national group. To date the complexities involved in estimating the impact mean this remains work in progress.

  <p>The Scottish Executive has established an Impact Assessment Group to identify the impact foot-and-mouth disease is having across sectors and areas. Given the complexities involved in making impact assessments this remains work in progress. Initial results illustrate that many tourism businesses in Dumfries and Galloway have been affected with cancellations and reduced enquiries.</p>

  <p>However, the final impact will be dependent on the eventual scale and duration of the disease and for this reason, eradication of FMD remains the highest priority for the Executive.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has embarked on a wide range of initiatives in primary care. These include the development of LHCCs, the launch of NHS24, Personal Medical Services schemes and an action plan for primary care dental services. Plans have also been announced in <i>Caring for Scotland</i> the Strategy for Nursing and Midwifery for Scotland to pilot the WHO Family Health Nursing model as a way of strengthening primary care services in remote and rural areas. Malcolm Chisholm and I have recently met with the leaders of all the professional groups involved in primary care including general medical practice. The Executive recognises the valuable work of general medical practitioners throughout Scotland in the delivery of primary care. There are no plans for a separate review of general medical practice in Scotland. The Executive is, however, committed to bringing forward proposals for the development of LHCCs in the coming months.</p>

  <p>The objective of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) is to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of clinical care for patients in Scotland by developing, publishing and disseminating guidelines which identify and promote good clinical practice on the basis of the best evidence we have. SIGN guidelines are distributed widely and all doctors are expected to comply with Good Practice advice.</p>

  <p>Under the statutory terms of service for general practitioners, a GP is required to invite each patient aged 75 and over for an annual health check. The purpose of the consultation is to assess whether the GP needs to render personal medical services to the patient. Although any action is determined by the clinical judgment of the GP, it is likely that this will involve measuring a patient&#8217;s blood pressure.</p>

  <p>The UK National Screening Committee (on which the Executive is represented) is due to consider the final Report of the evaluation of a chlamydia screening pilot project in England in summer 2001. On the basis of the conclusions reached by the evaluation, the Committee will make a recommendation on the merits or otherwise of a national screening programme for chlamydia. The research by Edinburgh University will also help inform decisions about the introduction of such a programme in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The national health demonstration project, Healthy Respect, will pilot chlamydia testing in a range of settings to help achieve its headline targets to increase the reported cases of chlamydia amongst young people by 2003 through raised awareness. That will be followed by the long term target of a 50% decrease in reported prevalence by 2010.</p>

  <p>All of the 11 confirmed farms and most of the 24 suspect farms have been restocked following clearance, disinfection and fallowing. There have been no confirmed cases since May 1998 and no suspect cases since November 1999.</p>

  <p>If further confirmed cases arise, the changes we have secured to EC and domestic legislation will enable us to vary the rate at which farms are cleared of fish according to the level of disease present and the threat to other farms.

  <p>The Bill will mark the second stage in the Property Law Reform Programme commenced by the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000.
