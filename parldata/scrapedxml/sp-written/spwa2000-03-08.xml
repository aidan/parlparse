  <p>One of the main recommendations of the National Audit Office in its recent report <i>The Scottish Ambulance Service: A Service for Life</i> is that the Scottish Executive and the Scottish Ambulance Service should consider and should decide on whether to introduce a system of priority-based dispatch for emergency ambulances in Scotland. That report is currently under review by the Audit Committee which, as part of its evidence gathering, interviewed the Chief Executive of the NHS in Scotland and the Chief Executive of the Ambulance Service on Tuesday 7 March.</p>

  <p>As part of his evidence to the Committee, the Chief Executive of the NHS in Scotland indicated that &pound;100,000 had been allocated to the Scottish Ambulance Service from 1 April 2000 to assist them in reviewing the evidence for priority-based dispatch, in preparing a case to show whether such a system would provide a better and more responsive system of answering 999 calls, and in establishing the costs involved.</p>

  <p>Once the facts are known, and after proper consultation with the ambulance staff and others, I will decide whether a priority-based dispatch system should be introduced.</p>

  <p>Following Grampian Country Food&#8217;s announcement on 29 February, I met trade union and company representatives the following day to discuss the reasons for the decision and to ensure that all possible support would be provided to those affected. A team of public support agencies comprising Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise Limited, the local authorities, Employment Service and Benefits Agency will begin work immediately to help redundant employees find new work and the company have agreed to co-operate fully with this team. I shall remain closely in contact with the company and support team to ensure that all possible assistance is being provided. I have every confidence that this partnership approach will be successful, as it has already proved to be for the ex-employees of Continental Tyres. Latest figures indicate that at least half of these employees have so far gained new employment.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has received no research proposals of a sufficiently high standard on cardiomyopathy recently and therefore does not directly fund research into heart muscle disease at present. However, we would be pleased to receive research applications on any of the three types of cardiomyopathy (dilated, restrictive and hypertrophic), especially as cardiovascular problems remain a priority of the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>We are aware of 129 research projects on cardiomyopathy which are currently taking place in the UK, five of which are taking place in Scotland. The results of the projects undertaken throughout the UK will inform the future direction of research and treatment of this disease.</p>

  <p>Details of all the UK projects are available from the National Research Register (NRR), a copy of which is in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe).</p>

  <p>Pharmacists are increasingly being integrated into the extended primary care team and are playing a key role in the modernisation of primary health care services. At local level, improvements in pharmaceutical care of patients are planned through Health Improvement Programmes and Trust Implementation Plans. At national level, there are a number of initiatives underway including:</p>

  <p>a new national framework for the pharmaceutical care of patients in the community has been initiated through model schemes of care for the frail elderly, patients with severe and enduring mental illness and provision of out-of-hours pharmaceutical palliative care.</p>

  <p>developing a pilot project for the direct supply of medicines, which will allow pharmacists to supply to specific patients, direct and free of charge, certain &quot;pharmacy only&quot; and General Sales List medicines which would otherwise have been obtained on prescription from a GP.</p>

  <p>exploring the potential for the electronic transmission of prescription information between GPs, community pharmacists and the Common Services Agency.</p>

  <p>We will continue to work with the pharmaceutical profession, health boards and Trusts to ensure that pharmacists are fully engaged in contributing to the agenda for improving the health of the people of Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Homes development programme in 2000-01 is being announced today. Some &pound;206 million will be disbursed and it is expected that this will deliver 6,000 new and improved homes. This is in line with the Executive&#8217;s commitment in <i>Programme for Government</i> to build and improve 18,000 homes over three years. We recognise the need to give greater priority to tackling the housing problems of rural areas and I am pleased to announce that Scottish Homes&#8217; rural programme will be increased from around &pound;41 million in the current year to &pound;45 million in 2000-01 &#8211; an increase of 10%.</p>

  <p>As part of the Scottish Homes rural programme, I am proposing to pilot a new partnership approach to tackling difficulties in pressured rural areas where there are acute shortages of socially rented housing and constraints on new development due to shortages of available land and high development costs. The pilot will be led by Highland Council working in partnership with Scottish Homes, local housing associations and others. Around &pound;10 million will be made available for the pilot over the next three years.</p>

  <p>I am also establishing a national steering group to monitor the Highland pilot and to advise me on how the lessons could be rolled out nationally in subsequent years. I am very glad to say that Lewis Shand Smith, a Scottish Homes board member has agreed to chair the steering group. CoSLA, the SFHA and other interested parties will be invited to be represented. I shall announce the full membership once responses to invitations have been received.</p>
