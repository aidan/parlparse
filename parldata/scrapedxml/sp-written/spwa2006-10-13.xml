  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the reasons are for the NHS investing in shares; how much each NHS board has invested and in what companies; who incurs any losses that are accrued, and who monitors the receipts.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-10-13.3.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80057" speakername="Mr Andy Kerr" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa1013.htm#2">

  <p>NHS boards are not currently permitted to invest in companies without specific authority from Scottish Ministers. However Scottish Ministers agreed that NHS Grampian, NHS Greater Glasgow, NHS Lothian and NHS Tayside should be allowed to own shares in TMRI Ltd., a Scottish limited company newly formed by those boards, four of Scotland&rsquo;s Universities and Scottish Enterprise for the purpose of facilitating a medical research collaboration with Wyeth Pharmaceuticals. Each Board has subscribed a total of &pound;1000 in return for being issued 1000 ordinary &pound;1 shares in TMRI Ltd. The universities and Scottish Enterprise have also bought shares in TMRI Ltd and any potential losses in excess of the share capital would be borne by TMRI Ltd itself. Financial monitoring is the responsibility of the board of directors of that company, which includes a representative of each participating NHS board.</p>

  <p>NHS boards may also invest funds donated to them in shares but the Scottish Executive does not hold any information on these funds, as they are held on the boards&rsquo; behalf as separate endowment funds. Investment of NHS endowment funds is a matter for the individual fund managers and may also be governed by the terms of the endowment made.</p>

  <p>I have today arranged for the release of a spreadsheet detailing direct and indirect grants to voluntary organisations in 2006-07. In 2006-07 the Executive will be providing &pound;496 million directly and &pound;160 million indirectly - &pound;656 million in total - to the voluntary sector in Scotland. This is an increase of &pound;133 million from last year, reflecting the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s continued commitment to the sector.</p>

  <p>Copies of the spreadsheets are available from the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib Numbers &ndash; Direct 40554 and &ndash; Indirect 40555) and also on the Scottish Executive website.</p>
