  <p>We are working towards the implementation of a new vetting and barring scheme for those who work with children and vulnerable adults in response to the recommendations in the Bichard Report. The proposed scheme will include continuous updating of an individual&rsquo;s barred status as new information comes to light. That coupled with the intention to provide the facility for organisations with a genuine interest to check an individual&rsquo;s current status, will remove the need for multiple disclosure checks.</p>

  <p>Research carried out by TNS System Three last year on behalf of Volunteer Development Scotland indicated that for 83% of people, the requirement to undergo a disclosure check did not affect their willingness to volunteer. It is important, however, that we keep the levels of bureaucracy in relation to disclosure checks low, whilst doing all we can to protect children. Turnaround times within Disclosure Scotland have reduced significantly. We are now working with the Central Registered Body for Scotland to reduce delays in that part of the process.</p>

  <p>In the longer term, it is intended that the new vetting and barring system being developed in response to recommendations in the Bichard Report will remove the need for multiple disclosure checks.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to make a direct comparison between out-of-hours services prior to and after the implementation of the GP opt-out. This is because new out-of-hours services, although continuing to rely heavily on GPs, have been or are in the process of being substantially redesigned by NHS boards using a range of different providers.</p>

  <p>Prior to the new General Medical Services (GMS) contract, out-of-hours services were the responsibility of general practitioners and cost information on out-of-hours services was not separately identifiable.</p>

  <p>Following the negotiation of the new GMS Contract, GPs are able to opt-out of out-of-hours services and they have become the responsibility of each NHS board. Cost information is therefore held at NHS board level rather than by the department.</p>

  <p>In June 2004, the Scottish Executive asked Health Protection Scotland (HPS) to conduct a literature review of published scientific studies on this issue. Its findings are re-evaluated when new studies are published. In light of the evidence gathered to date, HPS have concluded that routine preparation of the skin by swabbing with alcohol prior to injection carries little or no benefit in terms of infection control. However, if the injection site is visibly soiled it should be washed with soap and water.</p>

  <p>This approach is consistent with the views of the World Health Organization&rsquo;s Safe Injection Global Network.</p>

  <p>Under the public policy rules for .eu top level domains, these have allowed member states to request domain names directly related to their country name.

However, I understand that the review team has consulted with a number of individuals and representative bodies including patients, staff, voluntary organisations, accident and emergency consultants, NHS boards, GPs and members of the public.</p>

  <p>All NHS boards use national systems as follows: Payroll, SCI Store (clinical information repository), CHI (Community Health Index), National Screening Systems, SCI Gateway (clinical communication).</p>

  <p>Full details of all other systems used by all health boards are not held centrally but the main IT systems used by each NHS board are listed in the table. Although these systems are not necessarily the same across NHS boards, where applicable they are required to be compatible and meet certain criteria. Common information standards are in place, they report on the same basis for national statistics and they are interfaced to a common infrastructure which can be configured to allow them to share data.</p>

  <p>The majority of patients who require in-patient or day case treatment, including heart operations, are treated quickly. Nearly 55% of patients treated in NHSScotland hospitals are admitted immediately and never join a waiting list. Of those who do wait, 41% are admitted within one month and almost 70% within three months.</p>

  <p>For those who have to wait longer, the national maximum waiting time was reduced from 12 months to nine months at the end of 2003. This guaranteed waiting time will be further reduced to six months by the end of this year and to 18 weeks by the end of 2007.</p>

  <p>National maximum waiting times have also been set for the diagnosis and treatment of coronary heart disease. Currently, these are eight weeks for angiography &ndash; a diagnostic test &ndash; and 18 weeks for coronary artery bypass graft surgery or angioplasty. These guaranteed waiting times will be replaced by a &quot;total journey&quot; maximum wait of 16 weeks from GP referral, through a rapid access chest pain clinic or equivalent, to cardiac intervention, from the end of 2007.</p>

  <p>With regard to out-patient waiting times, the majority of patients referred by a general medical or dental practitioner for a first out-patient appointment at a consultant-led clinic are seen quickly, with nearly 54% of patients being seen with nine weeks of referral and 66% within 13 weeks. For those who have to wait longer, we have set a national maximum waiting time target of 26 weeks from referral to consultation, by the end of 2005. This will be reduced to 18 weeks from the end of 2007.</p>

  <p>To ensure performance is monitored effectively, Partnership for Care included a commitment to establish a national out-patient waiting list. Information on this list was published for the first time on 30 September 2004, and has been published quarterly since then. On 30 June 2005, 15,432 patients without an availability status code had waited more than 26 weeks for a first out-patient appointment &ndash; a reduction of 6,706 since 31 March 2005.</p>

  <p>Information on waiting times for in-patient and day case treatment for the last five years and for the treatment of coronary heart disease against national commitments, since 30 June 2003, is given in the table.</p>

  <p>Information about waiting times in England is available from Department of Health websites:</p>

  <p>In return for the operational independence holding bodies now have in respect of property transactions, they are monitored on their implementation of the procedures contained in the NHSScotland Property Transactions Handbook. The Scottish Executive does not undertake any monitoring of individual transactions including, for example, compliance with mandatory trawl procedures as this is a function of the audit process conducted within each holding body.</p>

  <p>Audit Committees are responsible for the oversight of the internal audit programme and are responsible for reporting to health boards.</p>

  <p>NHSScotland holding bodies are required to submit to the department annual monitoring reports which provide an overview of each holding body&rsquo;s performance in managing property transactions completed that year and which highlight instances where the procedures detailed in the Property Transactions Handbook have not been followed. This would include instances where trawl procedures have not been undertaken in accordance with the handbook and if appropriate actions have not been agreed between the internal auditor and the board to remedy such a situation then the department would intercede to ensure that procedures are put in place to ensure compliance with the Property Transactions Handbook.</p>

  <p>Information is not available in the format requested. In addition, some of the charges referred to (e.g. manslaughter and grievous bodily harm) are not recognised offences in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service has a target of taking a decision on the appropriate course of action, and implementing that decision (including serving complaints in cases which are to be prosecuted under summary procedure), in at least 75% of cases within five weeks of the date on which the report is received from the reporting agency. This target applies to all cases except cases which are to be dealt with under solemn procedure. In the period April to July 2005 decisions were taken and implemented within five weeks in 87% of cases.</p>

  <p>In solemn cases (i.e. the more serious cases, where the case is to be dealt with in the High Court or in the sheriff court before a jury) where the accused is on bail, our target is to serve 80% of indictments within nine months. In the period April to July 2005, indictments were issued within that timescale in 81% of High Court cases and 90% of sheriff and jury cases.</p>

  <p>The Executive does not have a general policy for buying out PPP contracts. PPP contracts are for the long term and this is the spirit in which the public sector enters into these contracts. They provide important safeguards for the public sector because of the long-term commitment to maintenance of key public service assets.</p>

  <p>However, it is important that PPPs remain appropriate to changing circumstances and continue to offer value for money. The buy-out of the Skye Bridge was a consequence of a political commitment to abolish the tolls made in relation to the Partnership Agreement (Bib. number 27591). The Inverness Airport contract was examined in the light of altered market conditions which suggested that a continuation of this early PFI would not offer continued value for money over the remainder of the contract. Each of these is a unique circumstance and do not indicate any trend towards other buy-outs.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive will make franchise payments amounting to approximately &pound;1.9 billion to First ScotRail over the seven year life of the franchise.</p>

  <p>Under the terms of the Franchise Agreement for operating rail services in Scotland, First ScotRail are committed to spending &pound;40 million of capital expenditure over the seven years of the franchise. &pound;17 million is due to be spent in the first 18 months of the franchise, of which &pound;3.3 million has been spent to date.</p>

  <p>Additionally, a significant investment is being made in staff numbers and staff development. Approximately 400 additional staff have been employed in the Franchise to date, with more planned. First ScotRail are investing at least &pound;1 million per annum in staff training and development.</p>

  <p>This information is not held by the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>Under the franchise, the total costs of operating the services and the revenues collected across all the routes were aggregated. In aggregate, the revenue collected under the first franchise was insufficient to cover operating costs. Therefore, subsidy required to be paid to National Express Group in addition to the revenue raised.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has received excess revenue share from the First ScotRail franchise in respect of the franchise year ending in April 2005. Under the Franchise Agreement, First ScotRail Limited retain the remaining revenue. This in addition to the subsidy they receive covers their operating costs and profit. The sum received by the Scottish Executive was used to lower the subsidy paid to the franchisee.</p>

  <p>Information on the revenue raised under the ScotRail franchise is commercially confidential.</p>
