  <p>The Advocacy Safeguards Agency was established on 1 April 2002. The total budget for the agency for 2002-03 is &#163;358,700. The cost of setting up the agency to 31 August is &#163;7,169; the running costs up to 31 August are &#163;63,992. The remit of the agency is divided into five core functions: developing support for commissioners; evaluation; policy development and implementation; research, and complaints and mediation. The agency is currently based in the offices of Scottish Human Services Trust in Edinburgh and is in the process of securing its own distinct, accessible premises.</p>

  <p>The Public Health Institute of Scotland&#8217;s Needs Assessment Report on Autistic Spectrum Disorders (2001) estimated that, in Scotland, there are 2,114 autistic children under 19 years of age, and a further 5,600 with other autistic spectrum disorders.</p>

  <p>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a technique which amplifies minute quantities of DNA in the blood and makes testing for it easier. Each test costs a minimum of &#163;150.</p>

  <p>The Executive wants to see a joined-up, user-friendly and quality-assured network of legal information and advice for the people of Scotland. That is the ultimate objective behind the programme of work I announced back on 22 May. In that context, it will be important for all organisations involved in providing advice to work together co-operatively, in the interests of their clients, many of whom are among our most vulnerable people, and in particular for strong and effective referral networks to be established.</p>

  <p>The Community Safety Partnership Award Programme introduced from 1 April 2002 is made up of two elements, a formulated award and a variable award. The formulated award is based on population and crime levels whilst the variable award is allocated following an assessment of the individual action plan and strategy. The action plan sets out the local authority led Community Safety Partnership's priorities for the forthcoming year. One condition of the award is that the Chief Executive of the relevant local authority agrees to ensure that the monies received are for the purposes specified in the action plan. A progress report signed by the Chief Executive is provided mid-year and a further progress report will accompany the application for funding for the following year. Audited accounts are required within four months of the end of the financial year.</p>

  <p>Evaluation of individual schemes/projects funded by the Community Safety Partnership is a matter for the individual partnership. However, it is proposed to evaluate the new arrangements for funding community safety partnerships and to include a review of the effectiveness of CCTV and other community safety initiatives funded by the Executive under the Make Our Communities Safer Challenge Competition, which the Community Safety Partnership Award Programme supersedes.</p>

  <p>Highlands and Islands Enterprise have looked with interest at the Cornwall project and are discussing it with the telecoms industry. They are also supporting BT&#8217;s trial of community broadband through mini-ADSL.</p>

  <p>However, ADSL is not the only solution for providing broadband. Our broadband strategy acknowledges this by being technology and supplier neutral. Nevertheless, the Scottish Executive does, of course, recognise the benefits of public/private collaboration for promoting broadband and we are, for instance, adopting this approach in the implementation of the Scottish programme of projects under the UK broadband fund.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how much of the &#163;100 million it announced in September 2000 to tackle illicit drug misuse has been allocated to each (a) local authority and (b) NHS board, also on a per capita basis.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-09-24.S1W-28682.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80238" speakername="Dr Richard Simpson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0924.htm#9">

  <p>Additional funding from Spending Review 2000 for drug rehabilitation services, included in local authorities&#8217; Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE) for the years 2001-02 to 2003-04 is outlined in Table 1. The funding is distributed in line with overall GAE expenditure, on a per capita basis.</p>

  <p>Additional funding for work with young people and families, allocated to local authorities through the Changing Children&#8217;s Services Fund for the period 2001-02 to 2003-04 is outlined in Table 2.</p>

  <p>Local authorities are also benefiting from significant additional resources for other drug-related initiatives such as training and employment, community disposals, schools education and community safety, all funded from the &#163;100 million.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer given to question S1W-25154 on 1 May 2002 for additional allocations to each NHS board for drug treatment services. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament's website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="/webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a>.</p>

  <p>Resources for drug treatment are allocated to NHS boards. I refer the member to the answer given to question S1W-25154 on 1 May 2002, which details total and per capita allocations to NHS boards from 1998-99 to 2002-03. Funding for 2003-04 will remain the same as 2002-03.</p>

  <p>I also refer the member to the answer given to question S1W-28682 today, which details allocations to local authorities from the Changing Children&#8217;s Services Fund for the period 2001-02 to 2003-04.

  <p>The information requested is not available centrally.</p>

  <p>People suffering from anorexia nervosa are treated and supported through mainstream mental health and social work services. Treatment is undertaken in a variety of settings, with very few in-patient and day cases. Most treatments are carried out in hospital and community health settings on an out-patient basis. Information on waiting times for out-patient attendances is available only at specialty level and does not identify specific conditions or treatments.</p>

  <p>The Health Department published guidance in October 2001 on the organisation and provision of eating disorder services. It is for all NHS boards and their care partners to consider what provision best suits the assessed needs of their area, in collaboration with neighbouring boards where appropriate. Services are in place in Grampian, Highland, Lanarkshire and Lothian which range from specialist eating disorder teams to single nurse specialist posts.</p>

  <p>The performance and accountability arrangements for NHSScotland and the visiting Mental Health and Well Being Support Group keep these matters under review.</p>

  <p>The guidance is available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 23704).</p>

  <p>Source: Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>The estimates for each year published in August 2002 have been revised since each of the annual figures were first published. This happened for a number of reasons; the provision of updated and previously omitted data by data suppliers, the availability of annual results which feed into the analysis, improvements to the GDP methodologies and improved data sources, and revisions to data submitted by individual companies and organisations. The Executive takes the view that it is extremely important to use the most up-to-date data available at the time of publication.</p>

  <p>The revision policy for Scottish GDP is that all estimates affected by data revisions should be updated at the earliest opportunity. This allows those using the data for long-term analysis to have a consistent long-term series.</p>

  <p>The estimates for each year published in August 2002 have been revised since each of the annual figures were first published. This happened for a number of reasons; the provision of updated and previously omitted data by data suppliers; the availability of annual results which feed into the analysis; improvements to the GDP methodologies and improved data sources, and revisions to data submitted by individual companies and organisations. The Executive takes the view that it is extremely important to use the most up-to-date data available at the time of publication.</p>

  <p>The revision policy for Scottish GDP is that all estimates affected by data revisions should be updated at the earliest opportunity. This allows those using the data for long-term analysis to have a consistent long-term series.</p>

  <p>The UK Pesticides Residues Committee carries out monitoring of both home-produced and imported food (including imported seed which is used as part of other food products e.g. bread) for pesticide residues. I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that it is represented on the committee and provides input to the design of the monitoring programme. Some 4,000 food samples are analysed each year for a wide range of pesticides. The full results of monitoring by the Pesticides Residues Committee, both quarterly and annual reports, are available on its website.</p>

  <p>Imported seed which is not intended for eating, but for sowing, may purposefully be treated with pesticides for plant protection reasons.</p>

  <p>All local authorities in Scotland have a duty under the Environment Act 1995 to review and assess air quality in their areas against the air quality objectives contained in the <em>Air Quality Strategy for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland</em> . If this exercise shows that any of the objectives is unlikely to be met by the required dates, the authority must take steps to work towards the objectives concerned by declaring an Air Quality Management Area and drawing up an air quality action plan.</p>

  <p>Part of the review and assessment process is to identify potential pollution hotspots and to undertake any further monitoring or other work considered necessary. Therefore it is for the City of Edinburgh Council to decide on the requirements for monitoring air quality in Holyrood Park. To date, the council has not identified any problems with air quality in the area. However, the situation will be kept under review as part of on-going local air quality management.</p>

  <p>We are currently in the process of reviewing the powers introduced in 1996 enabling the courts to impose aggravated sentences for offences committed while the offender was on bail. This review was announced in April 2000. To inform the review two research projects were planned. The first has been completed and the second is now under way. These will inform the later stages of the review which we aim to complete by the middle of 2003. While the research is under way it would be premature to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of the new powers and what additional measures, if any, may be required.</p>

  <p>We have also noted the proposal in the UK Government&#8217;s recently published white paper <em>Justice for All</em> to weight the court&#8217;s discretion against granting bail to a defendant who has been charged with an imprisonable offence committed while on bail for another offence. We shall follow developments relating to that particular proposal with interest.</p>

  <p>On 22 May, I announced a practical programme of development work to take forward the recommendations of the <em>Review of Legal Information and Advice Provision in Scotland</em> published last November. That programme includes the creation of four pilot partnerships, in different locations across the country, to look at local advice needs and service provision; a national needs assessment exercise; a review of the Scottish Legal Aid Board&#8217;s advice and assistance scheme, and a review of innovative service delivery mechanisms. Work is in hand on all of these. The programme will provide the information the Executive needs to take a more strategic approach to legal advice and information, with the ultimate aim of improving access to justice by creating a more joined-up, quality-assured and user-friendly network of advice, information and help across the country.</p>

  <p>We have today placed both in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre and on the Executive&#8217;s website a summary of responses to the issues raised in the consultation on the White Paper <em>Renewing Local Democracy: the Next Steps</em> .</p>

  <p>In relation to the electoral system, responses to the consultation showed a significant majority in favour of the Single Transferable Vote (STV) system. In line with the Executive&#8217;s commitment to making progress on electoral reform, we have decided to prepare a Local Governance Bill that will include STV as the alternative choice to First Past the Post electoral system. We intend to publish the bill before the end of the parliamentary session and it would be then available for decision by the new Executive following the May 2003 elections. We will announce our intentions on the other issues included in the white paper to Parliament in due course.</p>

  <p>Capital allocations for the period 2001-02 to 2003-04 based on the existing capital formula were announced following Spending Review 2000. Local authorities have set their spending plans on the basis of these allocations and there are no plans to change these.</p>

  <p>The fixed element of the formula is set at a level commensurate with the overall resources available for local authority capital expenditure. The main factors that determine an authority's (relative) expenditure needs are included in the variable elements of the formula.</p>

  <p>We have announced plans to reform the local authority capital finance system. Subject to the passage of the Local Government Bill, local authorities will be able to determine their own capital spending plans from 1 April 2004. Proposals for supporting capital expenditure from 2004-05 will be discussed with COSLA.</p>

  <p>Decisions on police officer ill-health retirements are the responsibility of the employing authorities and information on the reason for police officer ill-health retirements is not routinely collected or held by the Scottish Executive. In response to question S1W-913, the information was sought specially from individual police forces. However, the Executive does not normally seek information specifically from third parties for the purpose of answering parliamentary questions. This is in keeping with the Executive&#8217;s current <em>Guidance on Scottish Parliamentary Questions</em> , a copy of which has been placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre, and was the approach taken in replying to question S1W-27621.</p>

  <p>There is likely to be a limited impact on the Executive&#8217;s finances through loan charge support to local authorities. A reduction in interest rates would influence the calculation of loan charge support for local authorities. The impact of a reduction in interest rates on the calculation of loan charges is limited as the calculation also takes account of interest rates on historic debt. In addition we would not recalculate loan support within the fixed three-year local government settlement period.</p>

  <p>The single allocation formula contains special allowances to recognise the special transport circumstance of remote/rural areas. A top-slice (10%) of the roads and transport element of the formula is distributed to island authorities or those authorities containing large island areas to reflect the needs in relation to ferry services, and to rural local authorities to reflect increased needs for bridge strengthening and forest roads. The amount for special transport needs is built into the authority's unhypothecated single allocation. It is not specifically identified for special transport needs. It is entirely up to the local authorities to determine how they spend their allocation across the range of their capital programmes (excluding council housing).</p>

  <p>The single capital allocation formula measures the relative need to spend of each local authority based on statistical indicators for the main capital programmes (excluding council-owned housing) and the total resources made available for local authority capital spending. It is up to each local authority how it spends its total capital resources including any locally-raised resources for example the proceeds of asset sales. There are no plans to review the special transport needs element of the formula.</p>

  <p>Rural and islands authorities also benefit from revenue grant from the Rural Transport Fund and have received additional capital allocations from the Public Transport Fund. The final round of such allocations will be made in October. Future arrangements for supporting local transport infrastructure projects will be announced in the autumn.</p>

  <p>As stated in the answers given to questions S1W-25472 on 30 April 2002 and S1W-25524 on 15 May 2002, expert medical advice confirms that MMR remains the safest and most effective way to protect children from measles, mumps and rubella. This view was supported by the conclusions of the MMR Expert Group report, published in April 2002.</p>

  <p>The Executive therefore has no plans to change the current immunisation programme and, on the basis of best clinical practice, will continue to offer MMR to protect children against these three serious diseases.</p>

  <p>Uptake rates for the childhood immunisation programme to quarter ended June 2002, as published by the Information and Statistics Division (ISD) of the Common Services Agency (CSA), reflect another rise in MMR uptake. The figure of 88.6% to end June 2002 reflects the highest uptake since March 2001.</p>

  <p>There is no specific requirement.

This will be achieved through the implementation of the Area Waste Plans. The Executive plans to take powers to set mandatory recycling and other waste management targets under the Local Government Bill.</p>

  <p>As with the majority of water supply catchment areas in Scotland, there are sheep on the catchments for the Edinburgh water supply reservoirs. These catchments are privately owned and Scottish Water cannot control sheep farming activities carried under good agricultural practice. In this respect, Scottish Water does not have information on the numbers of sheep on the catchment and would not seek to have them removed. Scottish Water does, however, have a good working relationship with landowners and farmers in these areas.</p>

  <p>The storage of water in reservoirs is only one part of the water supply cycle and the treatment process is the principle line of defence in safeguarding public health. All of the water treatment works that supply Edinburgh have the necessary filters to remove particulate material. There is no evidence that the presence of sheep on the catchment areas has had any adverse effect on public health.</p>
