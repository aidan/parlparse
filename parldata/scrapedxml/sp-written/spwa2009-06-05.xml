  <p>The Scottish Government have no plans to introduce regulations on the welfare of greyhounds. The provisions of section 24 of the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006, which requires those responsible for animals to take steps to ensure that the needs of such animals are met, is sufficient to ensure the welfare of greyhounds.</p>

Other measures we have put in place to help small businesses include; the Small Business Bonus Scheme which is helping tens of thousands of small business by removing or reducing business rates; extending the eligibility for small businesses to apply for Regional Selective assistance grants across the whole of Scotland, and launching BusinessClub Scotland to help Scottish businesses get maximum benefit from major events being held in Scotland. The alignment of local government, Skills Development Scotland and other public bodies with business has also contributed to attaining the goal of increased sustainable growth.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what its best estimate is of the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by burning one tonne of Scottish coal in a power station that does not have any form of carbon capture technology.</p>

</ques>


<ques id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-06-05.S3W-24402.q1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80347" speakername="Jim Mather" spid="S3W-24402" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa0605.htm#6">

  <p>Figures supplied by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency suggest burning one tonne of coal would produce a range of between 2.5 to 2.9 tonnes of carbon dioxide.</p>

  <p>Coal used in power stations in Scotland comes from various geographical locations. Due to the differing composition and moisture content of coal types, it is not possible to provide a more precise figure.</p>

  <p>Carbon Capture and Storage Technology (CCS) has the potential to reduce emissions from power stations by up to 90 per cent. The Scottish Government supports CCS as a critical new technology that would make a significant contribution towards carbon emission reductions.</p>

  <p>The act of throwing down, dropping or depositing and leaving chewing gum, like all types of litter, is an offence under Section 87 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, and subject to a fine of up to &pound;2,500. Alternatively, the person may be offered the opportunity to pay a fixed penalty fine, the level of which is currently &pound;50.</p>

  <p>Designated local authority officers have the power to issue fixed penalty notices to those who litter. As independent bodies, whether local authorities empower officials to issue notices is a matter for each local authority. They are encouraged to do so by the Scottish Government.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has funded, through the Rivers and Fisheries Trusts of Scotland (RAFTS), local trusts to produce Fishery Management Plans which provide the background to the fisheries and identify management actions to promote sustainably managed freshwater fish and fisheries resources.</p>

  <p>The Wester Ross Fisheries Trust&rsquo;s plan includes proposals for the restoration of the Loch Maree salmon and sea trout fisheries. Projects to date undertaken by a range of partners including the Trust, the local District Salmon Fishery Board, proprietors and the local authority have included habitat restoration and stocking programmes.</p>

  <p>The West Sutherland Fisheries Trust&rsquo;s Plan includes measures for the conservation of its wild salmon and sea trout populations. At Loch Stack the proprietors have introduced a variety of measures including catch and release, reduced fishing hours, restrictions on fishing methods, habitat improvements and limited stocking with native populations.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government welcomes these local initiatives by boards, trusts and proprietors which along with work at the national level such as through its support for the RAFTS Fisheries Management Planning Programme and the Marine Scotland Science Programme for Freshwater Fisheries are in the long term interests of sustainable Scottish salmon and sea trout stocks.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government have requested the European Commission exempt two groups of Scottish Nephrops vessels, one which fishes in areas of low cod in the Minches and the other in the eastern Firth of Clyde, which catch very little or no cod at all from the fishing effort management regime. The Scottish Submission has now been considered by the Commission's scientific advisors, the Scientific, Technical and Economic Fisheries Committee (STECF). Further information has been requested which will be provided. The Commission will now consider the STECF advice. We continue to press for an early decision from the Commission and stand ready to boost our onboard observer programme to collect further evidence for further groups of vessels to be exempt.</p>

  <p>Allocation of Affordable Housing Investment Programme resources for 2009-10 was based on the following principles:</p>

  <p>Core programmes for all local authority areas would be reinstated to 2007-08 core programme levels;</p>

  <p>Top slicing commitments (arising e.g. from previous stock transfer agreements) would be honoured;</p>

  <p>Core funding for Glasgow and Edinburgh (combined) would be maintained in line with plans announced under the current Spending Review, and</p>

  <p>The small balance of resources (after the above principles are taken into account) would be added to the allocation of the 16 councils with greatest homelessness pressures and housing shortfalls.</p>

  <p>The measure of greatest homelessness pressure was based on the work of Dr Andrew Waugh. The measure of housing shortfall was based on the report by Professor Glen Bramley on Local Housing Need and Affordability Model for Scotland.</p>

  <p>Allocations with each local authority area reflect the priorities of the local authority set out in its Strategic Housing Investment Plan, and include Housing Association Grant and other grants.</p>
