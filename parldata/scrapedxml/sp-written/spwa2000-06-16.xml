  <p>We are keen to encourage crofter forestry and hope that landlords and crofters can work together on forestry plans affecting crofting land. Woodland Grant Scheme payments are not available to landlords who resume crofting land against the wishes of the crofters and I have asked the Forestry Commission to make this clear to applicants. A similar rule applies to landlords who terminate agricultural tenancies by means of a contested notice to quit.</p>

  <p>Many centres have already implemented new National Qualification courses in English and Communication &#8211; over 100 at Higher level, around 120 at Intermediate 2 level and over 70 at Intermediate 1 level.</p>

  <p>However, the Scottish Qualifications Authority is tackling concerns which have been raised about the new courses, and has set up a short-life group to look into any possible revisions to English and Communication courses within the existing framework.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Executive&#8217;s review of the first year of Higher Still implementation aims to identify both the programme&#8217;s strengths, and areas where improvement is required.</p>

  <p>In Scotland the curriculum is not prescribed, but national guidance is given.</p>

  <p>Although there are no plans to increase the time in the national guidance beyond the minimum allocation for Maths (10%) and for Environmental studies (30%), which includes Science, the guidance already includes a 20% flexibility factor, which remains after all minimum allocations have been made, which schools are encouraged to use to meet their own needs and circumstances.</p>

  <p>The Executive is taking several measures to minimise disruptive behaviour and improve discipline in schools. Improving discipline is one of the key elements of the Executive&#8217;s National Ethos Programme which also includes anti-bullying and attendance.</p>

  <p>Discipline does not only involve controlling the behaviour of pupils, but also instilling in them the desire to learn. Central to achieving this objective are several of the initiatives funded for the three-year period, 1999-2000&#8211;2001-02 under the Excellence Fund for Schools. The Core Programme includes three initiatives of particular relevance to the question of discipline, Alternatives to Exclusion (&pound;23 million), Study Support (&pound;27 million) and Supporting Parents (&pound;15 million). The Special Programme involves Education Action Plans (&pound;15 million) and New Community Schools (&pound;26 million).</p>

  <p>An official from the Scottish Executive&#8217;s GM Co-ordination Team attends fortnightly liaison meetings on biotechnology issues involving officials from the UK Government and the devolved administrations. After the formal meeting on 5 May, he participated in a conversation with officials from the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food and the Department of the Environment Transport and the Regions during which he learned of the possible problem.</p>

  <p>He was informed that an unspecified amount of Advanta rapeseed had been imported from Canada containing traces of a GM contaminant that only had clearance to be grown for research purposes in this country. It was understood that some of the contaminated seed might have been planted and that Scotland could be affected.</p>

  <p>The decision by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) on 16 May 2000 relates to certain questions referred to the ECJ by the House of Lords in connection with test cases concerning part-time workers&#8217; rights of access to occupational pension schemes.</p>

  <p>As the cases raised issues concerning the compatibility of domestic law and European law, the House of Lords considered it appropriate to refer certain questions to the ECJ for a preliminary ruling. The questions related to the time limit for making claims for membership of a scheme and the extent of the limitation on the backdating of the claims. The UK Courts had originally ruled that any claims must be brought during, or within six months of leaving, employment and that backdated access is limited to two years from the date of application.</p>

  <p>The ECJ has ruled that while the six months time limit is compatible with European law, the two-year period of retrospection is not. It will now be for the House of Lords to decide whether the six month limit should stand and what the period of retrospection should be. Until then it will not be possible to assess the implications for local authorities generally, and the Local Government Pension Scheme in particular.</p>

The working group has reviewed the existing curriculum materials and made recommendations about further materials and improved procedures. They have also recommended key principles and aims for sex education, to be incorporated in the guidance circular.</p>

  <p>I am very grateful to all the members of the working group who have looked at these important issues in a thorough and professional manner. I welcome the report and the recommendations which have the unanimous support of all members of the group. I am happy to accept the recommendations in full.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has a commitment to creating a more stable funding environment for the voluntary sector, including providing three-year funding packages where appropriate. <i>The Scottish Compact</i> sets out the principles underpinning the relationship between Government and the voluntary sector in Scotland. As part of its implementation, good practice guidance on funding has been consulted on and was published this week. The Scottish Executive and Executive agencies have a responsibility to ensure that they have plans to implement the Compact.</p>
