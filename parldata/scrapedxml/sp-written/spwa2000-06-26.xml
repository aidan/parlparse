  <p>No. The Highlands and Islands&#8217; exemption was based on a sparsity of population criterion as a definition of peripherality. This also recognises the Highlands and Islands&#8217; reliance on air services for essential transport links. The north-east of Scotland, including Aberdeen, does not meet the criteria for exemption. Aberdeen has also sustained a strong increase in passenger numbers since the introduction of APD. In the last decade, the annual number of passengers handled at Aberdeen has increased by 50% to 2.45 million per annum.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Source: Medical and Dental Manpower Census, ISD Scotland.</p>

  <p>2. Data at 30 September 1999 is provisional.</p>

  <p>3. It is assumed that the medical and clinical oncologists are working at the specialist centres within the Trust.</p>

  <p>4. The difference in the totals for Scotland and the totals for the five trusts is due to some consultants working part-time outside the main cancer centres.</p>

  <p>5. The two oncologists at Highland Acute Trust give both radiotherapy and chemotherapy.</p>

  <p>Table 2 shows the number of patient episodes per consultant at each centre for the year ending 31 March 2000. The figures in the table were arrived at by adding the number of patient episodes for each centre for medical oncology and for clinical oncology and dividing by the whole time equivalent consultant figures given in table 1. Patient episodes comprise inpatient, outpatient and day-case episodes. The number of patient episodes is not the same as the number of patients, as the number of visits by an individual patient varies according to the type and stage of the disease. The figures do not include outreach patients seen outwith the centre and do not show the total workload per consultant. The table should be read in conjunction with the notes below.</p>

  <p>As a UK taxation measure, the climate change levy is a reserved matter. The UK Government is not able to say with precision what the effects of the levy will be in specific areas, sectors or firms since this will depend upon many factors including take-up of various incentives to improve energy efficiency.</p>

  <p>There are no proposals for a system of licences to enable organisations to gain exemption from the climate change levy. To obtain exemption, they will simply need to contract with their suppliers to purchase electricity from qualifying renewable sources, or invest in good quality combined heat and power generation. Larger energy-intensive companies may also enter into sectoral energy efficiency agreements to obtain discounts on their levy payments. Information on these opportunities is being disseminated to Scottish businesses by the Scottish Energy Efficiency Office.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive provides support through grant funding to national voluntary organisations under sections 9 and 10(1) of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 and section 16B of the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978 as amended.</p>

  <p>In the current financial year Deafblind UK and SENSE in Scotland have been awarded grants amounting to &pound;68,300 and &pound;22,650 respectively. This funding provides training to enable deafblind people to develop communication skills, and supports voluntary organisations in working with local authorities and health boards in developing services for deafblind people.</p>

  <p>The Social Work Services Inspectorate also published a report, <i>Sensing Progress,</i> in 1998. It examined the planning, delivery, commissioning and management of social work services for people with a visual or hearing impairment or dual impairment. The report was followed up by inviting responses from local authorities and by holding three seminars across Scotland on the issues raised in the report. Local authorities responded positively to the recommendations of <i>Sensing Progress</i> and a number are in the process of acting on the recommendation to set up multi-agency resource groups.</p>

  <p>These and other sectors are supported through a range of schemes and initiatives promoted by the Scottish Executive and its agencies, in particular the Enterprise Network. Scottish Enterprise has identified the opto-electronics and food and drink sectors (including the dairy industry) as priorities for cluster development and further details are available from the Scottish Enterprise website. I announced plans for developing public support for the textile industry on 12 June.

  <p>The recent incident involving conventional seed accidentally containing a small proportion of GM seed has highlighted the question of separation distances between GM and other crops. The circumstances of the contamination are still being investigated but the evidence which emerges will form an important element of the UK review of separation distances which was announced on 8 June.

  <p>The procurement of NHS equipment is undertaken by NHS Trust supplies departments. There are a large number of national contracts set up by Scottish Healthcare Supplies for Trusts to use. NHS Trusts are encouraged to use the services of Scottish Healthcare Supplies where possible to assist in major procurement exercises.</p>

  <p>A centrally led initiative to procure cancer treating equipment was completed recently which secured savings of around &pound;1 million on an asset total of &pound;7 million. A second round of purchasing, again on an all Scotland basis, is now underway.</p>

  <p>At the recent NHS Conference in Peebles the establishment of a National Network Group to consider smarter ways of managing capital projects and delivering value for money in procurement was announced. This group will seek out best practice across the NHS in Scotland and identify opportunities for greater efficiencies and savings.</p>

  <p>The work of the National Network Group will complement work already underway by Scottish Healthcare Supplies and the NHS Trusts to establish a greater use of national contracts. Scottish Healthcare Supplies is also examining the scope for introducing logistics management and greater co-ordination into NHS procurement.</p>

  <p>Information is collected centrally about neonatal facilities, not specifically about neonatal intensive care units; babies requiring intensive care are normally treated in such facilities. The following table shows the average number of staffed beds in neonatal facilities for each NHS hospital in Scotland:</p>

  <p>The Public Health White Paper <i>Towards a Healthier Scotland</i> addresses some of the antecedent causes of low birth weight and prematurity including smoking.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive together with the Scottish Programme for Clinical Effectiveness in Reproductive Health (SPCERH), the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Royal College of Midwives is taking forward a number of studies into issues around prematurity. These include: the Scottish Still Births and Infant Deaths survey to look at the incidence and any antecedent causes of prematurity and the Confidential Enquiry into Sudden Deaths of Infants study into babies born at 27 and 28 weeks. SPCERH have produced guidelines on the management of pre-term foetus, pre-eclampsia and non-proteinuria hypertension, all of which can be associated with premature delivery.</p>

  <p>The Chief Nursing Officer is chairing a Maternity Services Reference Group which is looking at the development of a National Services Framework for the delivery of maternity services in Scotland and this will look at all aspects of maternity care and will report in autumn 2000.</p>

  <p>I expect health boards and NHS Trusts to hold full and open discussions about the outcome of Accountability Reviews at public sessions of their board meetings. It is important that key messages given and actions agreed at the reviews are promulgated locally in this way and through incorporation in public documents such as Health Improvement Programmes, Corporate Contracts and Trust Implementation Plans. The Scottish Executive has no plans to publish separate records of the Accountability Reviews.</p>

  <p>Modernisation Action Teams were announced by the Secretary of State for Health, Alan Milburn, as part of England&#8217;s modernisation plans for the NHS. I have announced plans to establish a Modernisation Board to drive forward the Executive&#8217;s programme for modernising and improving the NHS in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The board will provide advice to Ministers on the modernisation programme and the priorities for new investment, will champion success by identifying best practice and ensuring that it is shared across Scotland and ensure that national policy develops in response to local aspirations for service modernisation and vice versa.</p>

  <p>Membership of the Modernisation Board will be drawn from the professions, from NHS staff, patients and management. It is expected that the board will meet monthly with the first meeting planned for July.</p>

  <p>Information is not available in the format or time period requested. Scottish universities were not funded from the Scottish block until 1993-94. Funding for higher education institutions is not centrally allocated. The Scottish Higher Education Funding Council (SHEFC) receives a grant each year from the Scottish Executive which is then allocated to individual higher education institutions for a range of purposes. The main grant for teaching is allocated on the basis of student numbers and a range of unit costs for various subject areas. (In addition, institutions received income from tuition fees for each student.) Other grants (such as for research) are not allocated on the basis of student numbers. It is, however, for institutions to manage the total grant they receive.</p>

  <p>Information is given below which shows the total grant, the grant allocated for teaching and the associated number of student places. Places are on a full-time equivalent basis (FTE) so may not reflect the actual numbers of students:</p>

  <p>Over 950 representations have been received in response to the Executive&#8217;s housing bill proposals. The majority were part of an organised postcard campaign concerned with the possible impact of an extended right to buy on housing associations&#8217; viability. Some supported the proposed changes whilst others were concerned about the availability of social housing, particularly in rural areas, where the current exemption from the right to buy has been ineffective in practice. The Executive is in discussion with key housing interests to agree a response to these and other concerns.</p>

  <p>Transfers offer opportunities for new initiatives to promote owner occupation and to assist existing owners. These opportunities should be considered by those developing transfer proposals.

  <p>Capital investment in council housing is funded from borrowing consents allocated by the Executive, and usable receipts and revenue surpluses generated by councils themselves.

  <p>Greater Glasgow Health Board is working closely with its partner Trusts on an ambitious programme to modernise and improve acute health services across the city. The health board will need to demonstrate that the costs of any specific proposals are affordable within the overall revenue allocation it receives from the Scottish Executive Health Department; no separate bridging funds are allocated for acute hospital services and bids for strategic capital investment must represent value for money.</p>

  <p>As explained in the answer to question S1W-6114, capital to revenue transfers were made annually to enable health boards and NHS Trusts to meet the costs of minor projects and non-added value elements of capital schemes.

  <p>None. Health boards are given a unified budget to enable them to meet the health care needs of their resident populations. It is for health boards to decide how best to meet national and local priorities, and to reflect them in their Health Improvement Programmes.

  <p>It is for individual health boards and NHS Trusts to determine annually the level of funding required for new and replacement medical equipment taking into account other local priorities. Health boards and NHS Trusts can use both capital and revenue resources to meet equipment costs.</p>

  <p>Capital investment in the NHS in Scotland continues to increase from &pound;136 million in 1998-99 to &pound;179 million in 2000-01, rising further to &pound;194 million in 2001-02.</p>

The figures contained within my earlier answer were incorrect. These inaccuracies only came to light when collating the detailed information requested for this answer.</p>

  <p>I have investigated this matter and instructed that arrangements be put in place to ensure that accurate statistical records are maintained. This has been done.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s vision is for Scotland&#8217;s railways to play a full and growing part in a sustainable, effective and integrated transport system which is accessible and safe, and which meets economic and social needs without threatening the health of our environment. The proposals outlined in Railtrack&#8217;s <i>2000 Network Management Statement</i> <i>for Scotland </i> will help inform the Executive&#8217;s consideration of the strategic priorities for developing such a railway network. These priorities will underpin the directions and guidance that will be issued to the Strategic Rail Authority for the passenger services that begin and end in Scotland. We will publish those directions and guidance. In addition, we will shortly issue guidance to the SRA on the East Coast Main Line franchise, which we will also publish.</p>

  <p>I submitted advice today to the Chief Executive of the shadow Strategic Rail Authority on the replacement of the east coast mainline franchise. He will take account of the advice when making his decision on the preferred bid for the franchise. He will also consider it when agreeing the details of the franchise agreement with the successful bidder.</p>

  <p>The advice includes the Scottish Executive&#8217;s views on how the new franchise will best fit with the development of an integrated transport policy for Scotland. It also includes operational proposals and considers the relationship between enhanced east coast mainline services and the provision of local and regional railway services within Scotland.</p>

  <p>A copy of the advice will be available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what its stated objectives were in relation to the A701 Transport Challenge Fund bid from Midlothian Council; what requirements were placed on the council in relation to this funding, and whether each of these requirements was met in full.</p>

  <p>In February 1997 Mr Michael Forsyth, the then Secretary of State for Scotland, advised Midlothian Council that their application for Transport Challenging Funding involving a Private Finance Initiative (PFI) had been successful and that &pound;2.5 million had been awarded towards the council&#8217;s proposals. These were intended to construct a stretch of dual carriageway from New Milton to Straiton and included a package of measures which would allow the use of the existing A701 as a dedicated route for pedestrians, equestrians, cyclists and local traffic. The then Government&#8217;s objective was to help support proportionally large capital projects which would not otherwise have been affordable in terms of local authorities&#8217; likely level of roads and transport resources. The council was required to submit to The Scottish Office by 29 August 1997 an Action Plan detailing its intentions and timetable for the project and subsequently to submit, periodically, short factual monitoring reports about the project. The Action Plan was received in August 1997 and a number of monitoring reports have been received since then. The council was required to satisfy itself that the proposed PFI project had the potential to deliver value for money and had to secure the agreement of The Scottish Office that it fell within the criteria for a PFI deal. Subsequently, Scottish Ministers agreed to the council&#8217;s request that the A701 project should be pursued through conventional funding, including the monies advanced from the Transport Challenge Fund.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive and its agencies currently have 114 staff in the Fife local authority area. No additional permanent posts have been created in or transferred to Fife since 6 May 1999.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s policy on location and relocation of civil service jobs remains as set out by the First Minister in his answer of 15 September 1999 (S1W-1558, Mr Duncan McNeil MSP). When opportunities arise potential locations across Scotland will be considered on a case-by-case basis consistent with our objectives of efficiency and effectiveness.</p>

  <p>This type of support is generally provided effectively by the local area in which an event takes place, should it be considered to be of benefit.</p>

  <p>On 8 August 1996 the previous Government announced a thorough overhaul of road traffic regulation law. A consultation document was issued seeking comments on specific proposals relating to traffic regulation orders, parking controls, speed limits, traffic signs and the inspection of orange badges. In their response of 15 October 1996, the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland made a number of comments but not on the measures relating to the Orange Badge Scheme.</p>

  <p>Any proposals that are put to the Scottish Executive by the Road Haulage Association for an essential user rebate will be carefully considered. However, if such proposals are linked to the taxation system then the issue would be a reserved matter for consideration by HM Treasury.</p>

  <p>On wind-up of the Scottish Transport Group, the Scottish Executive will bring forward for Parliament&#8217;s approval a Dissolution Order which will prescribe to whom the group should pay the surplus funds. The processes involved, including the wind-up of the two Scottish Transport Group pension schemes, are complex and it is not envisaged that the Order will be brought forward until the autumn.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally. Most projects addressing offending behaviour are funded by local authorities or voluntary organisations to reflect local need and circumstances.</p>

  <p>However, the Executive announced on 9 June an additional &pound;3 million in the current year for local authorities to develop mainstream projects to deal with offending behaviour among young people as effective alternatives to custody. The Executive intends to increase this provision in future years as part of its action plan on youth crime.</p>
