  <p>Information is not collected centrally on further education or higher education students attending Further Education institutions who fall ill during their studies. However, this information is available for students in Higher Education Institutions, and is given in the table below. Information for 1998-99 is not yet available.</p>

  <p>Students do not continue with their studies for a variety of reasons which can be complex in nature. The information shown below is for the main reason cited by the student or presumed by the institution. Deceased students are not included with those who gave health reasons as the cause of leaving without completing the course.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive in the light of the fact that the contract of Crawford Beveridge, Chief Executive of Scottish Enterprise, is due to end in March 2001, how it will proceed with the recruitment of his successor, and how it will involve the Parliament in the process.</p>

  <p>The Chief Executive of Scottish Enterprise is an employee of the Board and the recruitment of a successor to the present Chief Executive is a matter for Scottish Enterprise. Under the terms of the Enterprise and New Towns (Scotland) Act 1990 any appointment requires the approval of Scottish Ministers.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will give community councils more responsibility in the development of local plans and strategic policy decisions.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/1999-08-25.6.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80199" speakername="Mr Frank McAveety" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-99/wa0825.htm#906">

  <p>The Scottish Executive recognises the special role that Community Councils have in the planning system, and current research is examining the experience of Community Councils as statutory consultees on planning. The Report of the Commission on Local Government and Scottish Parliament made a number of recommendations concerning community councils and the local consultation process. A consultation paper, which will include a section on community councils, will be issued in due course.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question SW1-292 by Susan Deacon on 29 July 1999, whether any discussions took place with representatives of motoring and insurance organisations in regard to the increase in charges under the Road Traffic (NHS Charges) Act 1999 and, if so, to provide details of those discussions.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/1999-08-25.7.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80146" speakername="Susan Deacon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-99/wa0825.htm#774">

  <p>Meetings and correspondence to discuss the proposed changes took place with a range of organisations including the Association of British Insurers (ABI), representatives from the smaller Insurance Companies, and the Motor Insurance Bureau.</p>

  <p>The discussions were led by the Department of Health and took place in 1997. They centred on the compliance costs associated with the proposed changes. None of the insurance companies felt that they would be differentially affected by the changes, either in terms of NHS charges or additional administration costs, and for this reason their compliance costs would be in proportion to their exposure to motor liability insurance.</p>

  <p>Whether or not those compliance costs are passed on to motorists in the form of additional premiums will be for the individual companies to decide.</p>

  <p>Total public expenditure on road improvements cannot be separately identified from the available information but I refer to the answers (S1W-664 and S1W-665) on total central and local government expenditure on transport which I gave to Mr Tosh on 20 August. Information on expenditure planned by local authorities in 2000-01 and 2001-02 is not held centrally. <br /></p>
