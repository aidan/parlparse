  <p>The Scottish Inshore Fisheries Advisory Group (SIFAG) was established in 1999 by the Scottish Fishermen&rsquo;s Federation and the then Scottish Executive. Its role was to advise on the development of policy and legislation relating to sea fisheries in inshore waters. SIFAG last met in June 2009 and no date has yet been set for its next meeting.</p>

  <p><em>A Strategic Framework for Inshore Fisheries in Scotland</em> was published by the then Scottish Executive in 2005, following a strategic review of inshore fisheries carried out by SIFAG which had begun in 2002. The document set out a strategic direction for inshore fisheries policy and announced proposals for a network of up to 12 inshore fisheries groups across Scotland.</p>

  <p>Six IFG pilots were established during 2009 covering the Outer Hebrides, Clyde, South East, Small Isles &amp; Mull, North West and the Moray Firth areas. A review of early lessons and economic benefits is being carried out. A further roll out of IFGs will be considered in the light of the findings of the review, which are expected later this year.</p>

  <p>The existing IFGs are currently drafting management plans in line with the high level objectives contained in the Strategic Framework. Once these plans have been agreed by the IFG Executive Committees and Advisory Groups, Marine Scotland expects to consult SIFAG representatives to ensure that the plans are in line with national objectives and consider any issues which might have an effect outwith the area of the local plan.</p>

  <p>We are aware of a number of websites that are selling fake fit notes. This is not illegal. It only becomes illegal when someone receives a payment or advantage, for instance paid time off work, through use of a fake fit note.</p>

  <p>Fraud against the NHS is taken very seriously and anyone caught using fraudulent documents will be pursued vigorously.</p>

  <p>The Med 3 medical certificate, commonly known as the fit note, is a document produced by the Department for Work and Pensions for the purposes of statutory sick pay. The Med 3 certificate has no other statutory purpose, but is commonly used by doctors as a means of giving advice to their patients. Addressing fraudulent production of Med 3 certificates is an issue for the Department of Work and Pensions and is a matter reserved to the UK Government.</p>

  <p>NHSScotland Counter Fraud Services will investigate any cases concerning the recently introduced fit notes where NHS staff are identified as attempting to use or have used, fake fit notes or genuine fit notes which have been altered. Where fake sick notes are identified, there will be liaison with the Department of Work and Pensions whose role will be to investigate the supplier of the fake fit notes.</p>

  <p>Fraud against the NHS is taken very seriously and anyone caught using fraudulent documents will be pursued vigorously.</p>

  <p>All data relating to periods of sickness absence in NHSScotland is held in a secure national database; reports from this database cannot identify individuals. At a local level within Boards any documents relating to individual members of staff are held securely in line with both national and local data protection policies.

  <p>The process differs for strategic development plans (SDPs) and local development plans (LDPs), given Scottish Ministers&rsquo; statutory role in approving SDPs.</p>

  <p>Once they have received the examination report on a proposed SDP, section 13 of the Planning etc. (Scotland) Act 2006 allows Scottish Ministers to approve or reject the plan, taking into account the recommendations made by the reporter(s). Ministers may make modifications in approving the plan, and if so will set out reasons for these.</p>

  <p>Examination reports on proposed LDPs are largely binding on planning authorities. Regulation 2 of the <strong>Town and Country Planning (Grounds for declining to follow recommendations) (Scotland) Regulations 2009</strong> states that authorities may only depart from recommendations that:</p>

  <p>(a) would have the effect of making the LDP inconsistent with the National Planning Framework, or with any SDP or national park plan for the same area;</p>

  <p>(b) are incompatible with Part IVA of the Conservation (Natural Habitats etc) Regulations 1994, or</p>

  <p>(c) are based on conclusions that could not reasonably have been reached based on the evidence considered at the examination.</p>

  <p>Section 19(11) of the Planning etc. (Scotland) Act 2006 also allows authorities to environmentally assess the plan following modification in response to recommendations, and to not make modifications that are not acceptable having regard to that assessment.</p>

  <p>This appeal was determined by a reporter appointed by Scottish Ministers. The decision is final subject to the right of any aggrieved party to appeal to the Court of Session within six weeks of the decision notice. This means that neither the reporter nor Scottish Ministers can comment on the merits of the proposed development or further consider this decision.</p>
