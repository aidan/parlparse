  <p>A written consultation about proposals for a patient rights bill ran from September 2008 to January 2009. Several written responses were received from organisations working with children and young people, including Scotland's Commissioner for Children and Young People, Action for Sick Children (Scotland) and Children in Scotland. In addition, a children and young people's focus group was held on 25 November 2008. There were 11 participants, with an age range between 11 and 17 years. Further consideration about the Bill and how it might impact on children and young people can be found in the Equality Impact Assessment at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/PatientRightsBill/AccDocs" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/PatientRightsBill/AccDocs</a>.</p>

  <p>Prior to the launch of the consultation, I also met with a group of young people who were patients at Yorkhill Children&rsquo;s Hospital. I discussed with them how they have been involved in influencing health services and discussed patients&rsquo; rights and the consultation, and encouraged their input into the consultation process.</p>

  <p>Since the Patient Rights (Scotland) Bill has been introduced, the Scottish Executive has met with representatives from organisations working with children and young people to discuss the implementation of the Bill and how this can be done in ways that meet the needs of children and young people. Officials will also shortly be meeting with the office of Scotland&rsquo;s Commissioner for Children and Young People to discuss similar issues.</p>

  <p>(a) Sheep:</p>

  <p>The Food Standards Agency (FSA) have advised me that there is no evidence of the current presence of any cloned sheep in the UK, nor the offspring of such animals.</p>

  <p>They have also advised me that there is no evidence of meat from any cloned sheep, or the offspring of cloned sheep having entered the food chain in Scotland.</p>

  <p>(b) Cattle:</p>

  <p>The FSA have advised me that there is no evidence of the presence of any cloned cattle in the UK, only the offspring of such animals and that there is no evidence of meat from any cloned cattle having entered the food chain in Scotland.</p>

  <p>They have also advised me that the meat from one bull, the offspring of a cloned cow, entered the food chain in Scotland in July 2009. The meat from this animal was supplied as part of a larger batch of meat from a number of animals to four butchers in Scotland and one in northern England.</p>

  <p>The Food Standards Agency (FSA) have advised me that there is no evidence of the presence of any cloned cattle in the UK, only the offspring of such animals, and that therefore no milk from cloned cattle has entered the food chain.</p>

  <p>They have also advised me that they have received written assurance from all the farmers who have offspring of cloned cattle which are currently/or have been capable of producing milk, that no milk entered the food chain. Milk from these animals was disposed of in on farm slurry pits.</p>

  <p>The FSA have advised me that their interpretation of the Novel Food Regulations is that milk from the offspring of cloned cattle, and any subsequent generations of offspring is covered by the regulations and would require authorisation before being placed on the market.</p>

  <p>The FSA is reviewing its handling of the recent incident involving cloned cattle in order to learn lessons.</p>

Future funding for local government, including support for pre-school education, will be dependent on the outcomes from the next Spending Review. There is no statutory requirement on councils to expand entitlement to free pre-school education to 570 hours, although we are aware that some local authorities are already providing this level of provision. </span></p>

  <p><span lang="PT-BR" xml:lang="PT-BR"><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>Earlier this year I wrote to the UK Government, in response to the consultation on the draft Merchant Shipping (Ship-to-Ship Transfers) Regulations 2010, welcoming the proposals to make regulations covering the ship-to-ship transfer of oil cargoes within the United Kingdom&rsquo;s internal waters and territorial seas.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="PT-BR" xml:lang="PT-BR">I plan to respond to the recently announced review of the regulations, reiterating my support for regulations to control ship-to-ship transfers of oil as cargo.
