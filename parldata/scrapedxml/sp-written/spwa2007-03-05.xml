  <p>The information requested is not available.</p>

  <p>A children&rsquo;s hearing cannot make residence orders as this is a matter for the court.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Children&rsquo;s Reporter Administration <em>Annual Report 2005-06</em> has information about the numbers of children referred, the grounds for referral, the living groups of children referred and Hearings decisions. For example, in 2005-06, 46% of children referred lived in a single parent household.

  <p>HM Naval Base Clyde (Faslane) has launched a project which aims to reduce annual expenditure by &pound;30 million by the end of 2011-12. The project is planned to report later in the year and no decisions have yet been taken, with implementation of any proposals unlikely before April 2008. It is therefore not possible to estimate the potential economic and social impacts at this time, as the specific nature of the spending reductions are unknown.</p>

  <p>The project is fully coherent with the Naval Base Review, which is currently looking at infrastructure requirements for the Royal Navy.</p>

  <p>In 1999, Simclar (Ayrshire) Ltd accepted an RSA offer of &pound;1.5 million for a project that planned to safeguard 160 jobs. The grant was paid in full. To date, none of the grant has been recovered but the Executive has lodged a claim with the administrators in respect of the RSA paid.</p>

  <p>Simclar International Ltd has received two RSA grants for projects at its Dunfermline facility, both dating back to the 1990s. It received &pound;600,000 for a project to create 150 new jobs (206 actually created) and a further &pound;1.3 million for a project that safeguarded 480 jobs. The company fully met all its obligations under the terms of the grant agreement and no grant was recovered.</p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise Ayrshire has paid &pound;113,275 in grants to Simclar (Ayrshire) Ltd. No new jobs were linked to these grants and there has been no claw back.</p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise Fife assistance in respect of Simclar&rsquo;s Dunfermline facility has amounted to &pound;656,537. Again, no new jobs were linked to these grants and there has been no claw back.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The information requested is not available. However, Communities Scotland aims to provide a grant applicant with a decision in principle within six weeks of receiving a fully completed outline application for funding. If the outline application is approved, a grant applicant will be asked to complete a more detailed application. Communities Scotland aims to make a final decision on whether grant can be awarded within six weeks of receiving the final piece of information needed to fully consider this application. If the more detailed application is approved, a formal offer of grant will be made.</p>

  <p>Life expectancy figures are normally calculated for a three year period, to provide large enough numbers to ensure accuracy. Figures are available up to 2003-2005.</p>

  <p>Information on life expectancy at birth for ranked local authority areas for the latest period is available from the General Register Office for Scotland&rsquo;s website through the following link: <a href="http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/statistics/library/life-expectancy/le2003-05/list-of-tables.html" target="_blank">http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/statistics/library/life-expectancy/le2003-05/list-of-tables.html</a>.</p>

  <p>Although not ranked, figures for earlier years are also available from this web page.</p>

  <p>Information is not available for life expectancy at birth in each ward, because of the small size of the populations involved.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive encourages local authorities to evaluate all new school buildings, however procured, to assess how well the design and facilities are meeting the needs of users, and to take account of and share lessons learned.</p>

  <p>The Executive has not carried out any investigations of the type described. Authorities have the same degree of control over the design brief and specifications as to quality, whatever the procurement method.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many injuries or fatal road accidents have involved horses in the last five years, broken down by police constabulary.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2007-03-05.S2W-31943.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80109" speakername="Tavish Scott" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-07/wa0305.htm#20">

  <p>Data about injury road accidents are collected by the police and reported to the Scottish Executive using the STATS 19 statistical report form. These returns cover only road accidents in which one or more people were injured and which become known to the police. The returns do not cover accidents which involved injury only to horses, &quot;damage only&quot; accidents, or accidents of which the police are unaware because they were not reported by the public.</p>

  <p>The STATS 19 returns collect information about the vehicles involved in each accident, using a code-list which has an entry for &quot;ridden horse&quot;. The returns do not have codes which identify horses which were involved in other ways, such as those pulling carts, being led, or running free. However, as the type of vehicle code for &quot;other non-motor vehicles&quot; and the carriageway hazards code for &quot;any animal in carriageway (except ridden horse)&quot; are not used for many of the reported accidents, it seems likely that there are few such reported accidents which involve horses.</p>

  <p>The following table provides the information that is available. The police forces are listed in the standard order which is used in <em>Road Accidents Scotland</em>. Figures for 2006 should become available in June.</p>

  <p>Reported Personal Injury or Fatal Road Accidents which Involved Ridden Horses.</p>

  <p>Under the terms of the Agreement <em>A Teaching Profession for the 21st Century</em> the allocation of time for a range of planned activities, including parent consultations, is a matter for local agreement by local authorities and individual schools.
