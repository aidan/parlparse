  <p>As requested, the table presents the absolute numbers of deaths from cancer. However, because the population of Scotland is ageing, these may give a false impression of trends in the risk of dying from lung cancer. To aid interpretation, a table giving age-standardised rates, which take account of changes in the age structure of the population, has also been provided.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is seeking to ensure that more Scottish food is processed and consumed in Scotland, by encouraging localised food distribution systems and by supporting local marketing schemes. For example, we have provided over &pound;60 million since 2001 enabling a total investment of &pound;308 million in Scotland to support improvements in the processing and marketing of Scottish primary produce.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is seeking to reduce the distance travelled by food through working with the industry to ensure that more Scottish food is processed in Scotland, by encouraging localised food distribution systems and by supporting local marketing schemes. For example, we have provided over &pound;60 million since 2001 to support investments that add value to Scottish primary produce within Scotland. We also welcome recent initiatives by Marks and Spencer, and by Tesco, to reduce their food miles and label food imported by air.</p>

  <p>The members of the informal Cross Party Group on Fair Trade, to avoid confusion, now called the All Party Group on Fair Trade are:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>Patricia Ferguson, Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport (Chair)<br />
              Jamie Stone MSP, Scottish Liberal Democrats<br />
              Murdo Fraser MSP, Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party<br />

              Dennis Canavan MSP, Independent<br />
              Michael Matheson MSP, Scottish National Party<br />
              Des McNulty MSP, Scottish Labour (who resigned upon his appointment as Deputy Minister for Communities).</p>
</blockquote></p>

  <p>The group has met four times: on 26 May 2005, 25 January 2006, 15 June 2006 and 16 November 2006.</p>

  <p>During this time, significant progress has been made taking forward the fair trade agenda, particularly with reference to the structures required to deliver the aspiration to become a Fair Trade Nation. The first ever conference of the Fair Trade movement in Scotland took place on 27 January 2007 with the specific purpose of discussing the creation of a Scottish Fair Trade Forum to co-ordinate implementation. The next meeting of the All Party Group will consider any recommendations that come out of this conference.</p>

  <p>The full Fair Trade Nation criteria (announced by the First Minister on 3 July 2006) which were developed in consultation with the Welsh Assembly Government and the Fairtrade Foundation, can be found at:<br /> <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/News-Extras/fair-trade" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/News-Extras/fair-trade</a>.</p>

  <p>Overall, the UK and Scottish economies have similar, though not identical, structures. All economies have a degree of variation in, for example, their industrial composition, their fiscal and legislative environment, the gender-mix in their labour market, the skills and entrepreneurial attitude of their people, the share of part-time and full-time workers in their labour market, the proportions of their public and private sectors, their trading partners and their population densities. These variations are what gives an economy its unique identity and are ultimately what leads to an economy having some form of comparative and competitive advantage.</p>

  <p>The Public Local Inquiry on the Water of Leith Flood Prevention Scheme was held between 2 November and 10 December 2004.

  <p>Flood prevention schemes, other than those of maintenance or repair, can only be carried out under the Flood Prevention (Scotland) Act 1961. This is to ensure all parties affected by a scheme are properly informed and given the opportunity to object. It is important that at all stages the due process and procedures are followed correctly. However we do acknowledge that this can, on occasion, be a lengthy process. The Executive is considering ways to reduce delay in the system, while ensuring that those affected by a scheme have the opportunity to raise any concerns.</p>

  <p>Principal responsibility for the funding of higher education institutions and colleges of further education lies with the Scottish Further and Higher Education Funding Council, which is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Scottish Executive. The council also has a duty to assess and enhance the quality of education which it is funding. Other relevant organisations are Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education and the Scottish Qualifications Authority. Individual inspections and audits carried out by these bodies are operational matters and I have therefore asked their respective chairs to write to the member direct providing the information sought.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to improving the way all public services are scrutinised via regulation, audit, inspection and complaints handling. The Independent Review of Regulation, Audit, Inspection and Complaints Handling of Public Services in Scotland under Professor Lorne Crerar is looking at how well our current external scrutiny arrangements reflect our principles of public service reform, avoid duplication, ensure common standards and focus on service users. It will make recommendations on any measures needed to improve them and is due to report to ministers in summer 2007.</p>

  <p>The allocation of places to the Crichton Campus is a matter for the Scottish Funding Council (SFC). It is not an area in which ministers can intervene.</p>

  <p>The SFC has supported higher education provision at the Crichton campus by allocating an additional 100 full-time equivalent (FTE) places in 2001-02 and a further 50 in 2002-03, split between the Universities of Glasgow (88 FTE places) and Paisley (62 FTE). These places are cumulative and recurring. Total student numbers at the University of Glasgow&rsquo;s Crichton campus were: 2002-03 - 290; 2003-04 - 245; 2004-05 - 270, and 2005-06 - 240.</p>

  <p>The Crichton Campus is not an institution in its own right. Provision is delivered through the partner institutions. The partner institutions make their own decisions on the allocation of their resources to their activity and facilities at Crichton. This includes funded student places. Any decision to allocate additional places above the SFC allocation to Crichton would be for the partner institutions themselves to make, in light of their particular circumstances or priorities.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers have advised the Scottish Funding Council (SFC) to ensure the adequacy of provision of further and higher education in the South of Scotland.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for decisions on the funding of individual higher education institutions lies with the SFC. The SFC allocates a block teaching grant to institutions. Consequently, institutions make their own decisions on the allocation of their resources to their activities and facilities.</p>

  <p>Under the current higher education teaching funding methodology, there is no specific funding premium for provision of outreach campuses. However, the SFC review of college and higher education institution (HEI) teaching funding methodologies will review all the costs of further and higher education provision and will clearly have to consider this aspect.</p>

  <p>In respect of capital funding, the SFC provides targeted support in rural areas for joint HEI/College estates developments. This has included &pound;5.5 million of Learning and Teaching Infrastructure Funding for 2006-07 to 2007-08 at the Crichton campus for Bell College, the University of Paisley and the University of Glasgow. This is in addition to &pound;2.3 million towards infrastructure costs for the early development at the Crichton campus and &pound;21.7 million to Dumfries and Galloway College in support of its relocation to a site adjacent to the campus.</p>

  <p>Source: Households Below Average Income, The Department for Work and Pensions.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>Gross household income: Total income from all sources including from Tax Credits, before deductions of income tax and National Insurance.</p>

  <p>Net disposable household income: Total income after deductions for income tax, National Insurance Contributions, council tax, pension contributions and maintenance payments.</p>

  <p>Housing costs: Net disposable income but with rent/mortgage payments, water charges, structural insurance premiums, ground rent and service charges deducted.</p>

  <p>Equivalised net disposable household income: &quot;Equivalised&quot; Income is used to allow comparisons of living standards between different household types. Income is adjusted to take into account variations in the size and composition of the household. This adjustment reflects the fact that a family of several people requires a higher income than a single person in order for both households to enjoy a comparable standard of living. The key assumption is that all individuals in the household benefit equally from the combined (equivalised) income of the household. There are distinct equivalence scales used for income before housing costs (BHC) and income after housing costs (AHC).</p>

  <p>Median: The income value which divides a population, when ranked by income, into two equal-sized groups. The measure is most commonly used to represent average income due to the highly skewed nature of the income distribution, which leads to the very high incomes of a few having a disproportionate impact on the mean.</p>

  <p>Mean: The total income/expenditure of all households in a population, divided by the number of households. In some situations it can be more appropriate to use the mean rather than the median.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The information in these tables is taken from a Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act request answered on 7 March 2005. The tables include journeys undertaken by Scottish ministers, ministers of the UK Government Departments when in Scotland, some senior officials at the Scottish Executive, visiting dignitaries and where necessary the transportation of official documents. The underlying records are no longer held.</p>

  <p>2. The numbers provided were compiled using data from two different scheduling methods. Up to and including July 2002, the Government Car Service (GCS) relied on a manual scheduling system where journeys were recorded as one, regardless of the number of points of call. From 1 August 2002, GCS installed a computerised scheduling system which only accepts a single point of call as one journey. The totals in each of the tables are therefore not comparable. The large variation between the numbers journeys carried out during the first seven months and those completed in the latter months simply reflect the different recording methods, and not because of any increase in the workload.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The table includes journeys undertaken by Scottish ministers and where necessary the transportation of official documents.</p>

  <p>2. The figure is an approximation as data for the period of January to March 2005 is no longer held on Government Car Service Scheduling software. Seven thousand six hundred and sixty-nine journeys were recorded from April to end of December 2005.</p>
