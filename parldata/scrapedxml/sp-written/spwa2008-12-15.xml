  <p>Full-time higher education lone parent students currently have an entitlement to apply for Higher Education Lone Parent Grant and Higher Education Lone Parent Childcare Grant.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government currently has no plans to make other child care funding available through the Discretionary Funds a legal right for college and university students.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government published, on the 15 December, a consultation on student support for higher education. The consultation will consider the current support arrangements for higher education students and seek views on a number of proposals in connection with that.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government published on 10 December its <em>Early Years and Early Intervention Framework</em> which recognises that the cost and accessibility of child care is a major concern for parents in Scotland. At present, child care support for parents is a reserved matter, and is provided via the childcare vouchers and child tax credit schemes. In the framework, we set out a desire for a single, accessible and more progressive system of supporting the costs of child care.</p>

  <p>The information for Inverclyde Community Health Partnership and Local Council area from March 2007 to June 2008 is published on ISD&rsquo;s website at:</p>

  <p>The information does not represent the percentage of people in the Inverclyde Community Health Partnership and local council area who are registered. Registrations (numerator) are based on the postcode of the practice where the patient has registered with a general dental practitioner. The population (denominator) is based on where the patient resides, in this case the community health partnership and local council area. In some cases, the number of registrations may exceed the actual number of &quot;people&quot; in the chosen population.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has already undertaken considerable work with businesses to ensure that they are prepared for a flu pandemic. Engagement is continuing on both a Scottish and UK basis with businesses in sectors such as transport and energy.</p>

  <p><em>A Scottish Framework for Responding to an Influenza Pandemic</em> was published by the Scottish Government in 2007 and provides guidance and planning assumptions on which all business continuity plans should be made. The framework is supported by a range of sector-specific guidance, including advice on infection control. The guidance is available on the Scottish Government website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/pandemicflu" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/pandemicflu</a>.</p>

  <p>Local authorities also have a role in supporting businesses. Under the Civil Contingencies Act, local authorities are required to provide assistance to those undertaking commercial activities and to voluntary organisations in relation to business continuity management. These responsibilities are outlined in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s guidance on preparing for emergencies <em>Preparing Scotland</em>. The Scottish Government continues to provide support to local authorities in carrying out this role.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Centre for Healthy Working Lives provides advice on health promotion and occupational health and safety. Business continuity planning for a flu pandemic does not fall within this remit.</p>

  <p>The &quot;Keep Yer Shirt On&quot; sun awareness campaign was initiated by NHS Tayside and Fife and ran from April 2002 for two years with funding from the Big Lottery Fund (BLF) targeting carers of pre-school children. Following its success, further funding was provided from the BLF to extend the project to include primary school aged children and their carers.</p>

  <p>Decisions on priorities for investment in local health programmes are taken by NHS boards.</p>

  <p>The project ended in November 2007 and the NHS boards involved have no plans to roll out further, although resource packs are available to download at <a href="http://www.sunaware.scot.nhs.uk" target="_blank">www.sunaware.scot.nhs.uk</a> or: <a href="http://www.scan.scot.nhs.uk" target="_blank">www.scan.scot.nhs.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has committed to funding of &pound;11,000 for 2008-09 to the UK-wide Cancer Research UK <em>Sunsmart</em> campaign which highlights the importance of early detection, avoiding burning from sun exposure and the potential dangers of sunbeds.</p>

  <p>National surveillance of Clostridium difficile is carried out at board level although hospitals undertake local surveillance. However, in future there will be a common reporting template used by all boards to capture HAI data at hospital/service level on a number of metrics, for example MRSA, C.diff, Hand Hygiene, cleaning standards and causes of adverse incidents. Prior to October 2006 cases were reported on a voluntary basis and the systems for doing so were unreliable. Therefore only the past seven quarters of data are available. It should also be noted that the first quarter (October 2006 to December 2006) of data collection was artificially low, due to a lack of full compliance with the surveillance protocol by some hospitals.</p>

  <p>Table showing C.diff cases for the past seven quarters, broken down by health board:</p>

  <p>All available information on ribotypes is published in the <em>clostridium difficile </em> quarterly reports available through the Health Protection Scotland website at <a href="http://www.hps.scot.nhs.uk" target="_blank">www.hps.scot.nhs.uk</a> <a href="http;//www.hps.scot.nhs.uk" target="_blank"></a> .</p>

  <p>At present information is only recorded at a national level and is not broken down by health board or hospital. Samples from severe cases of CDAD and suspected outbreaks are submitted to the Scottish Reference Laboratory Service for typing.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has asked Health Protection Scotland to co-ordinate a &quot;snapshot&quot; study of Clostridium difficile ribotypes. This study will start early next year and will involve the typing of all samples of C.diff, not just those of severe disease, suspected outbreaks, or suspected infections with ribotype 027. This will give an accurate picture of the epidemiology of C.diff strains in Scotland and will help to inform how the monitoring of strains should take place in future. The results will be made available publicly.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>&quot;Number of applications for assistance&quot; and &quot;Instances of Assistance&quot; have been rounded up or down to the nearest five (e.g. one, two round to zero; three, four round to five).</p>

  <p>&quot;Total Amounts Issued&quot; have been rounded to the nearest thousand and are quoted in thousands.</p>

  <p>Average amounts have been rounded to the nearest pound.</p>

  <p>Individual identifying details of students receiving help from the Higher Education Childcare Fund (and Mature Students Bursary Fund) are not held centrally. As it is possible that a student may receive help more than once from the fund there may be a degree of double counting in the management information. We therefore report number of applications and instances of assistance from the fund rather than the number of students assisted. Academic year 2006-07 is the latest for which data is available.</p>

  <p>Section 40 of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 provides that an appeal from any order or judgment of a court in Scotland will lie to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom if it currently lies from a court in Scotland to the House of Lords. This provision continues the current right of appeal, for civil cases, from decisions of the Court of Session to the House of Lords. It also transfers jurisdiction in devolution issues &ndash; including Scottish devolution issues - from the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council to the new Supreme Court. Schedule 9 of the act makes other amendments relating to the jurisdiction of the new Supreme Court. The Supreme Court and other interacting constitutional reforms represent significant constitutional changes introduced by the Parliament at Westminster.</p>

  <p>In view of other changes to the operation of courts in Scotland introduced by the Scottish Parliament, it is entirely appropriate that the implications of these changes for the distinctive Scottish legal system are considered in full, in Scotland, and at this time.</p>

  <p>I recognise that under the Scotland Act it would not be possible to deliver legislative change in all these areas without legislation in the UK Parliament.</p>

  <p>However, I am pleased that Professor Neil Walker, Regius Chair of Public Law and the Law of Nature and Nations at the University of Edinburgh, has accepted my invitation to conduct a review of final appellate jurisdiction in the context of its implications for the Scottish legal system.</p>

  <p>I have asked Professor Walker to provide me with an overview of the historical development of final appellate jurisdiction in the Scottish legal system; to identify the established constitutional principles of such jurisdiction and to provide appropriate international comparisons.</p>

  <p>I have also asked Professor Walker to appraise the features, benefits and disadvantages of the current Scottish arrangements, and to assess options for future developments in order to present his conclusions and recommendations by December 2009.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Each establishment has provision of a visiting psychiatry service from the NHS. The SPS meets the cost of these services. Additionally a forensic community psychiatric nurse attends HM Prison Inverness one day per week.</p>

  <p>HMYOI Polmont is the only establishment known to have a routine speech and language therapy service. HM Prison Inverness has provision of an in reach service when required.</p>

  <p>Our public sector settings are becoming exemplars in creating environments which promote positive mental and physical health wellbeing.</p>

  <p>Regulations covering soft drinks in the public sector are covered in schools by The Schools (Health Promotion and Nutrition) (Scotland) Act 2007. This requires local authorities to ensure that food and drink provided in schools comply with the nutritional requirements specified by Scottish ministers in regulations. Under these regulations (The Nutritional Requirements for Food and Drink in Schools (Scotland) Regulations 2008) schools are not permitted to sell soft drinks. These regulations came into force in primary schools in August 2008 and will commence in secondary schools in August 2009.</p>

  <p>With regard to NHS bodies we issued, in March 2008, Guidance on the Health Promoting Health Service issued to all NHS boards. This set out a number of actions which include a requirement to remove unhealthy soft drinks from hospital-managed restaurants and vending machines by 2011.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of renewed concerns in England regarding an increase in cases of measles and failure to meet MMR vaccination uptake targets, whether it will (a) carry out a further campaign to increase uptake and (b) promote and undertake further catch-up work for people previously not immunised.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-12-15.S3W-18595.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80379" speakername="Shona Robison" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa1215.htm#100">

  <p>MMR uptake rates in Scotland have been higher than in many parts of England throughout the last decade. The quarterly childhood immunisation statistics published on 30 September indicate that uptake of the MMR vaccine by 24 months in Scotland was 91.7%, whereas the comparable figure for England in 2007-08 was 85%, and uptake in London was less than 80%.</p>

  <p>The rate of measles is also much lower in Scotland relative to the population than in the rest of the UK. In 2008 there have been a total of 53 laboratory confirmed cases of measles in Scotland, compared to 1049 laboratory confirmed cases in England and Wales to the end of October 2008.</p>

  <p>For these reasons there are no plans to extend the English MMR catch-up campaign to Scotland. But we are not being complacent and have a number of initiatives underway that aim to reduce risk of measles, mumps and rubella. The &quot;Never Too Late&quot; campaign, launched in 2006, aims to encourage vaccination of children who may be beyond the normal age for vaccination, emphasising that it is never too late to be vaccinated. Currently there is also a national initiative to focus invitations for the second dose of MMR pre-school vaccination at the lower end of the age range for vaccinations, thereby decreasing the period of time in which children are reliant on protection from only one dose of MMR.</p>
