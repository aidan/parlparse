  <p>The Executive&#8217;s consultation on the review of the code of practice that accompanies part 5 concluded on 30 June. We are currently analysing the responses. The Executive has also recently commissioned research into issues raised by the implementation of part 5. These exercises will be taken into account in any future review of the operation of part 5 of the act.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Diabetes Survey is beginning to provide this information but the data are not yet fully robust. In the 2002 Survey almost 60% of those patients included in diabetes registers were reported to have received a cholesterol test within the last 15 months.</p>

  <p>The importance of regular cholesterol monitoring is recognised in the clinical standards for diabetes published by NHS Quality Improvement Scotland. Reviewing services against these standards, along with the action being taken to improve clinical information and to establish a diabetes Managed Clinical Network in each board area are the essential steps to ensuring that all people with diabetes are monitored appropriately and that robust data are available in future.</p>

  <p>The total cost of providing an annual cholesterol test and subsequent statin treatment all people with diabetes is not available.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Diabetes Framework estimated that treating people with diabetes accounts for some 5% of total NHSScotland costs. In financial year 2003-04, that would amount to some &#163;335 million. It is not possible to identify separately an element relating to the treatment of those with diabetes who also have symptomatic cardiac disease.</p>

  <p>The electricity industry is of considerable importance to Scotland and we keep closely in touch with the Department of Trade and Industry, the regulator Ofgem and Scottish generators to ensure that Scottish interests are fully taken into account in GB electricity trading arrangements. We are currently working with these bodies to develop new trading and transmission arrangements, which will help to remove the barriers that independent Scottish generators currently face in selling to the electricity market in the rest of Great Britain.</p>

  <p>19% of electricity generated in Scotland in 2000 and 18% of electricity generated in Scotland in 2001 was consumed elsewhere. Information in respect of other years is not currently available.</p>

  <p>In NHS Scotland consultant gynaecologists deal with most cases of endometriosis. Consultants in acute general hospitals may refer severe cases to university or tertiary centres. In cases in which endometriosis is associated with infertility, women will usually be referred to one of the four tertiary centres for infertility treatment in Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Glasgow or Dundee. These arrangements ensure access to clinical expertise. It is the responsibility of each NHS board to deploy the resources available to it to address the health care needs of its local population.</p>

  <p>For details of Executive funding for research into endometriosis please refer to the response to S2W-1558 on 13 August 2003.</p>

  <p>To date, the Executive has received 20 letters from members of the public and 13 from MSPs making representations about the results job sizing exercise.</p>

  <p>The Executive also received the results of a postcard campaign organised by the Scottish Secondary Teachers Association (SSTA), expressing concerns that the exercise benefits teachers in primary schools to the detriment of those in the secondary sector. We received approximately 1,300 postcards in total.</p>

  <p>An appeals mechanism is in place to accommodate any failure to agree between postholders and line managers in completing the job-sizing questionnaire. Local authorities all have grievance procedures in place which individuals may pursue if they remain unsatisfied.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is not aware of any such anomalies. The range of duties undertaken by promoted postholders can be very wide. That is why no single criterion, such as pupil roll, can adequately judge the value of a post. The salary scale points identified for management posts under the job-sizing exercise is determined by the range of duties covered by these posts, reflecting the agreed contribution of factors such as school-roll, management responsibilities, policy development and monitoring, external liaison and whole school activities, as set out in the agreement <em>A Teaching Profession for the 21st Century</em> . We would therefore expect some differences between guidance posts in different schools.</p>

  <p>There is no evidence of a current shortage of home economic teachers in any local authority area. There were seven vacancies across Scotland at the time of this latest report by local authorities. This relatively low vacancy level was confirmed in April/May this year when local authorities reported vacancy information for the 2003-04 Induction scheme. Fifteen vacant posts were identified for the 2003-04 school session, which could not be filled by probationer teachers. This represents around 1.7% of the teaching complement.</p>

  <p>The Executive keeps vacancy information under review. Once ScotXed, the Executive led electronic data collection system, is making a full contribution to the teacher workforce planning exercise, better estimates of likely subject demand will be available. This will be reflected in guidance given to the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council on the distribution of places among Initial Teacher Education courses.</p>

  <p>Pay scales for management grades in schools have not been affected by job-sizing. They remain as set out in the agreement: &#163;31,299 to &#163;40,401 for principal teachers; &#163;35,500 to &#163;69,300 for depute headteachers and headteachers; and the introduction of a new salary scale for chartered teachers, &#163;29,601 to &#163;35,199. These compare to the salary scale for classroom teachers of &#163;18,000 to &#163;28,707.</p>

  <p>The job-sizing exercise now allows values to be placed on specific management posts within schools. This contrasts with the previous system, where jobs were graded solely on the basis of school roll, resulting in one person department heads being paid identical sums to the heads of departments with large staffing and significant budgets.</p>

  <p>The flexibility job-sizing brings will mean local authorities can now design management structures to suit local circumstances in order to maintain and enhance the quality of education they provide.</p>

  <p>These changes to management levels are being introduced in parallel to the introduction of the new Chartered Teacher programme. In return for pursuing post graduate studies, considerable salary increases will be offered. In turn, this will increase the quality of education delivered in the classroom, and offer incentives for ambitious teachers to stay in teaching posts, rather than apply for management positions.</p>

  <p>You will be aware that veterinary medicines legislation is a reserved issue. Notwithstanding this, where new policies would have implications for Scottish farmers, my officials bring these to the attention of colleagues in Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Veterinary Medicine Directorate to inform negotiations.</p>

  <p>As regards the prescription authorisation, the current position is that while the UK (supported by the Netherlands and Ireland), opposed the proposal for an Article 67 amendment, the existing prescription requirement has been retained by the Commission. However, there is possible flexibility in the form of an exemption list. This list has yet to be drawn up and we are awaiting the criteria that medicines will have to fulfil to be considered to be exempt. I understand that the UK intends to include as many PML (pharmacy and merchants&#8217; list) products as possible on the exemption list.</p>

  <p>The Scottish ministers do not issue a detailed report of their assessment in circumstances such as this where they are not determining the planning application. Internal planning documents are exempt from disclosure under exemption 2 of Part II of the <em>Code of Practice on Access to Scottish Executive Information</em> as they include information relating to internal discussion and advice.</p>

  <p>The Scottish ministers are, of course, aware that there is a general presumption against development in the green belt. However, such development may be acceptable in special circumstances. In this case it was clear that there was a pressing need<strong> </strong>for a new water treatment works to improve the quality of drinking water supplied to the Greater Glasgow area in order to meet current regulatory standards.</p>

  <p>The Scottish ministers were aware that East Dunbartonshire Council received over 3,900 objections to the proposal. And they were also aware that the Council had received more than 3,300 letters supporting the development. Ministers may call-in a planning application where it is considered that a planning authority has failed to give full consideration to local objections. But a substantial volume of objections is not in itself sufficient grounds to call in an application. All other relevant issues must be taken into account, as they were in this case, and a balanced decision reached.</p>
