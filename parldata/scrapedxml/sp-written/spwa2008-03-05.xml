  <p>The MA programme is led by employer demand. It is therefore impossible for government to quantify the number of modern apprentice opportunities that will be created as a result of the introduction of MAs at SVQ level 2.</p>

  <p>Sections 49 to 64, which provide for the creation of Scottish Charitable Incorporated Organisations (SCIOs), will not be brought into force until the introduction of the subordinate legislation, necessary to set out the detailed operational arrangements of the regime.</p>

  <p>SCIOs are a new legal form, and the policy development process will require detailed planning and extensive stakeholder engagement to ensure that it is fit for purpose but not overly resource-intensive for charities or for the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator. Under current plans, which allow for a number of phases of engagement, we would not expect to bring sections 49 to 64 into force before the end of 2009.</p>

  <p>The administrative process and procedures for the Disqualified from Working with Children List (DWCL) are rooted in the legislative requirements of the Protection of Children (Scotland) Act 2003 and the associated Determination Regulations. A case management team deals with all administration associated with referrals to the Disqualified from Working with Children List (DWCL). This includes determining the competency of referrals and on whether or not an individual should be placed provisionally on the list. The team also supports the Determination Panels responsible for making listing decisions. All aspects of the administrative process are robust including consideration of risk.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it is satisfied that those civil servants who make decisions regarding the Disqualified from Working with Children List and those who will work for the Central Barring Unit have the requisite knowledge, skills and experience to ensure that correct judgments about risk are made.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-03-05.S3W-9679.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80331" speakername="Adam Ingram" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa0305.htm#5">

  <p>Decisions about listing on the Disqualified from Working with Children List (DWCL) are taken on behalf of Scottish ministers by a panel of civil servants. Each panel comprises a chair who is a senior civil servant with responsibility for the development of policy relating to children and young people; a member of the Social Work Inspectorate Agency (SWIA) experienced in monitoring the provision of social work services or responsible for advising ministers on child protection matters, and a member of HM Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) experienced in monitoring the provision of education services or responsible for advising ministers on matters relating to education. As well as training specifically related to DWCL, all panel members have the necessary experience in child protection practice and/or policy to make listing decisions about future risk and unsuitability to work with children.</p>

  <p>As in any situation, efficient and effective decision-making depends on good quality information. The recently issued Supplementary Information and Guidance on DWCL makes this clear and provides further guidance to organisations on making referrals.</p>

  <p>Consideration is still being given to the staffing of the Central Barring Unit (CBU) and what skills, experience and knowledge will be required of caseworkers and those who will take listing decisions particularly since the CBU will be taking decisions about unsuitability to work with adults and/or children.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland has been working in partnership with Local Authorities, Young Scot and transport operators to promote the Scotland-Wide Concessionary Travel Scheme for Young People since the scheme started in January 2007.</p>

  <p>There has been a great deal of media coverage (radio and press), online promotion, direct mailing of parents of 16 to 18-year-olds, posters on buses and trains and a dedicated website <a href="http://www.givememycard.org" target="_blank">www.givememycard.org</a> to encourage young people to take advantage of the scheme.</p>

  <p>An extensive marketing campaign is now nearing completion and has resulted in the number of young people applying for and receiving a National Entitlement Card increasing by around 50%.</p>

  <p>Application forms and information leaflets are available from local authorities and their nominated agents.</p>

  <p>It is estimated that approximately &pound;5,000 will be spent on the following public information leaflets: HCS1 Help with Health Costs (web only) and HCS2 A Quick Guide to Help with Health Costs (booklet). Both include information on eligibility to the costs of dental treatment.</p>

  <p>We are working to continue to increase the dental workforce and to improve dental facilities.</p>

  <p>More dental students are graduating from the dental schools and the creation of a third dental school in Aberdeen will also increase the number of dentists available for work in Scotland. In addition, a number of projects which received funding under the Primary and Community Care Premises Modernisation Programme are due to be completed this financial year.</p>

  <p>The dental bursary scheme has also proved popular with over 460 students currently in receipt of the dental bursary which ties students into the NHS in Scotland for a period of up to five years following graduation.</p>

  <p>The majority of dentists who provide NHS general dental services are independent contractors, i.e. private dentists. Most dentists provide a mix of both NHS and private treatment. A number of financial measures have been put in place over the last few years to recruit dentists to the NHS and to support those dentists who provide NHS treatment. Dentists providing mainly private treatment do not benefit from these allowances, or only receive a small proportion of an allowance, but can take steps to remedy this situation by providing more NHS treatment.</p>

  <p>In inspections, HMIE evaluates the quality of meeting learning needs and the school&rsquo;s approaches to achieving successful outcomes for all children. This includes additional support needs arising from any form of language or communication difficulties. There is no one, universally accepted, definition of dyslexia.</p>

  <p>As part of an on-going task on dyslexia, HMIE has commissioned a literature review covering national and international studies. The working definition adopted in HMIE&rsquo;s review is drawn from the definition provided by the British Psychological Society. HMIE is aware that dyslexia can be evident when the development of accurate and fluent word reading and/or spelling is notably incomplete or takes place with great difficulty. They are also aware that dyslexia is often accompanied by other difficulties.</p>

  <p>Under the previous Scottish Executive, information on partners and their income was not recorded. The Student Awards Agency for Scotland (SAAS) does not ask for details of partner&rsquo;s income because partners are currently not recognised in the income assessment for living cost support. It is therefore not possible to estimate how many students will be affected by the changes as we do not know how many students&rsquo; parents have partners or how many students themselves have partners, or what the partner&rsquo;s income is.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government did attempt to model the costs involved in estimating how many students in Scotland who are assessed as coming from a single parent family, but have a parent who lives with a partner. However, because this information is not available, it is not possible to produce accurate forecasts.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will ensure that all income available to households when applying for living cost support will be recorded by SAAS and will closely monitor the numbers affected by these changes from 2008-09 onwards.</p>

  <p>Well North, an extension of the Keep Well approach adapted to remote and rural areas, is being applied through six projects across the North of Scotland, including Dufftown.</p>

  <p>The Ministerial Task Force is looking at the wider factors underlying health inequalities and will action these when it reports in May.</p>

  <p>NHS board general revenue allocations include provision for the cost of prescribed drugs and are set to allow for the introduction of new drugs.</p>

  <p>If treatments such as new biologic drugs for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis are approved for use in NHS Scotland by the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC), NHS boards are required to fund them from their existing allocations, and are expected to ensure that they are made available to treat clinical need.</p>

  <p>The use of such treatments that have to date been approved for use by the SMC depends on the clinical judgement of specialists experienced in the management of rheumatoid arthritis.</p>

  <p>Training numbers for junior doctors are set through a process that takes account of multiple factors. NHS board workforce plans set out their future requirement for consultants for each specialty. Specialty boards of NES advise on current numbers and also provide a national view of developments in the specialties. During the Modernising Medical Careers (MMC) transition, we have also taken account of the number of doctors in specialties that do not have training posts, with the aim of maximising opportunities to integrate them into formal training positions.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is in the process of reviewing medical workforce planning in response to the MMC inquiry chaired by Sir John Tooke. The aim is to design a methodology for medical workforce planning which reflects the needs of the NHS in Scotland at all levels from undergraduate to consultant.</p>

  <p>Good progress is being made and the Scottish Government has no plans to make a statement to the Parliament.</p>

  <p>Selection and recruitment is well advanced in Scotland and the process closed to applications on 18 January. There were around 7,000 applications for around 1,300 posts at various Speciality Training and GP Training levels. Because candidates were able to make multiple applications, the applicant pool is around 6,000 junior doctors. This overall ratio of applications to vacancies is in line with our expectations and similar to that for the rest of the UK. Many applicants will have applied for posts elsewhere in the UK and abroad and it is expected that, as in previous years, the applicant pool in Scotland will continue to contract as selection proceeds. Details of the number of applications proceeding to short listing and vacancies per speciality are available on the MMC Scotland website at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.mmc.scot.nhs.uk/documents/MMCShortlistingStatistics-2008forMMCUpdatev2.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.mmc.scot.nhs.uk/documents/MMCShortlistingStatistics-2008forMMCUpdatev2.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.mmc.scot.nhs.uk/documents/FTSTANumberswithSTvacancies-AllScotland-forwebsite.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.mmc.scot.nhs.uk/documents/FTSTANumberswithSTvacancies-AllScotland-forwebsite.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p>As always, some specialities are more popular than others with applications per post appearing high in comparison to the overall picture, but that is not unusual.</p>

  <p>Applicants short-listed for interviews will be able to rank their speciality and deanery preferences in order (east, north, south east and west). Short-listing and interviewing is already well underway and offers of posts will be made in three waves from 26 March to16 April. This approach gives candidates who do not secure their first preference in the first wave continued opportunities to secure posts. NHS boards will offer formal contracts of employment from 1 May to 31 July, ensuring that successful candidates are in post in August with no disruption to service continuity.</p>

  <p>Although the practicalities are challenging for all concerned, the process is being undertaken with the full support of all stakeholders, including the junior doctors themselves. There are no significant problems at present.</p>

  <p>Most of our hospitals, at some point, need to restrict or stop admissions in order to manage emerging issues. These can range from a surge in emergency activity such as a serious accident requiring the treatment of a number of casualties, through to internal issues such as an outbreak of Norovirus that closes wards and restricts available beds.</p>

  <p>There is no universally agreed definition of a &quot;Red Alert&quot; within NHS Scotland. What all NHS boards and hospitals have are clearly set out plans and procedures for coping with surges in activity. This allows the continued effective and appropriate management of patients during any period of pressure along with a return to normal operating conditions as soon as is practicable.</p>

  <p>Using data supplied by the Health Professions Council (HPC), our best estimate (rounded to the nearest 10) for the number of occupational therapists who are registered and who are known to be working in Aberdeen City, Aberdeenshire and Angus in 2007 are as follows:</p>

  <p>Aberdeen City - 130 occupational therapists</p>

  <p>Aberdeenshire - 60 occupational therapists</p>

  <p>Angus - 30 occupational therapists.</p>

  <p>The HPC were unable to provide historical data for the years 2002 to 2006.</p>

  <p>The above figures should be seen as estimates as the HPC have not recorded the workplace for all registered occupational therapists in Scotland. Therefore, the above figures could possibly be under-estimated.</p>

  <p>Also, the above estimates are based on the postcode district (i.e. the first part of the postcode) of the registered occupational therapist&rsquo;s workplace. As the same postcode district could be spread across more than one local authority area, occupational therapists have been assigned to the local authority that accounted for the highest number of individual postcodes within each postcode district.</p>

  <p>Supporting people at home where this is safe and appropriate is a continuing care objective shared by all agencies and has been carried forward most recently through <em>Better Health, Better Care</em> . We invest &pound;50 million annually to underpin this objective through enabling older people to access intensive home care, and other preventative services, to enable more people to stay at home for longer. An additional &pound;28 million has been provided over the last two years to fund faster access to care.</p>

  <p>Our concordat with local government reflects our shared aim to increase the proportion of people with intensive care needs, including those with dementia, who are cared for at home. We are working with all partners towards more flexible approaches to the provision of home care, for example through the use of Telecare and in addressing those cases where changes to accommodation are appropriate.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government also recognises the vital role and personal health needs of carers supporting those with dementia to live at home. We are investing &pound;9 million of new resources over the next three years for outreach to carers, including training, information and other support initiatives. In continuing to recognise the importance respite can play for the carer and cared for, our concordat includes a commitment towards an extra 10,000 respite weeks annually. Our consultations on new respite guidance will inform future actions in this aspect of care.</p>

  <p>As part of our new relationship with local government we have also included significant financial resources for the Supporting People programme within the overall local authority financial settlement. Those funds help give vulnerable people the opportunity to improve their quality of life by providing a stable housing environment to enable greater independence. We are also making information more readily available to those who require services.</p>

  <p>Finally as part of the Scottish Government priority on dementia a new NHS target has been announced specifically designed to reach more in need and to address those needs earlier.</p>

  <p>A &pound;20 million cut in Roads Improvements spend next year would represent a 37% reduction in budget. This would require Transport Scotland to delay or cancel over a third of work in the Minor Scheme, Road safety and Intelligent Transport Systems programmes. These programmes are essential in meeting targets on road casualty reduction, reducing emissions and congestion. Preparation work for major new capital schemes would also be affected. A &pound;20 million cut over three years would represent a 12% reduction in budget and would be unsustainable for the same reasons.</p>

  <p>Funding cuts would require the following actions to be considered:</p>

  <p>Minor Road schemes such as A737 Barrmill Road Roundabout, A77 Burnside Improvement, A9 Bankfoot Junction Improvement or A82 Bilingual Signing amongst others, would require to be identified for delay beyond the present Spending Review period.</p>

  <p>The proactive works identified in our Road Safety Action Plan would require to be delayed beyond the present Spending Review period.</p>

  <p>Our Intelligent Transport Systems Action Plan would require to be rescheduled including delivery of the proposed new National Network Control Centre.</p>

  <p>Preparation work for major new Capital road projects such as Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route may require to be rescheduled.</p>

  <p>Delivery of the identified Roads Improvements programme is essential to supporting Scotland and its economy. The schemes and action plans contained within the programme are being delivered as commitments to address strong community concerns centred on road safety, journey time and environmental issues.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government would always wish to ensure that ethical and environmental considerations are taken into account in its decision making. The main types of asset held by the Scottish Government are infrastructure assets or other assets directly related to providing services to the people of Scotland and these can sensibly be regarded as broadly neutral in ethical terms. The concept of ethical investment is most commonly applied to investment in the shares of companies operating in particular fields or with particular business practices and it is worth noting that the pension schemes run by central government are generally managed on a pay as you go basis, which means that issues over ethical investment do not arise.</p>

  <p>The main remit of the Scottish Government Financial Partnerships Unit (FPU) is to provide policy support to Scottish Government ministers and procurement managers on partnership options and procurement methodology for infrastructure delivery and investment. This involves working with all public sector organisations and all sections of the private sector involved in infrastructure investment &ndash; to not only receive information but also to inform public and private sectors of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s current thinking on infrastructure investment.</p>

  <p>Contributing articles on current thinking on infrastructure investment is part of the usual business of FPU and the Scottish Government. We have contributed articles to Public Private Finance magazine as well as other similar publications. Officials in FPU do not receive any remuneration from publishers for this.</p>

  <p>As part of the on-going review of statistical collections, the Scottish Government will review all data collections to ensure they meet the needs of the National Performance Framework and to continue to develop the evidence base around outcomes and the effectiveness of interventions. In addition we will be working with Local Government and the broader public sector to develop the evidence base required to support outcome agreements and on the reduction of the information burden associated with the removal of ring fencing around certain allocations. This work will also align with our response to the Crerar Review.</p>

  <p>This information is not available.

  <p>Liability for the original graduate endowment fee was not means-tested and so young people from the poorest 20% of the population who are at university and are liable for Graduate Endowment fee will no longer need to pay and will therefore benefit from its abolition.</p>

  <p>From 2008-09, dependant Scottish students in higher education will be assessed for student support using the household income. Students in further education are already assessed for student support using this system.</p>

  <p>The household income will be made up of the income of the parent with whom the student lives and the income of his/her partner who lives in that household.</p>

  <p>Any maintenance paid to the parent with whom the student lives from the absent parent for the maintenance of the parent and the student will be taken into account as part of the household income.</p>

  <p>We cannot estimate how many students this will affect as under the previous Scottish Executive information on partners was not recorded. The Student Awards Agency for Scotland (SAAS) does not ask for details of partner&rsquo;s income because these individuals are currently not recognised in the income assessment for living cost support.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government did attempt to model how many students in Scotland who have two unmarried parents and who each have a partner. However, because this information is not available, it is not possible to produce accurate forecasts.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will ensure that all income available to households when applying for living cost support will be recorded by SAAS and will closely monitor the numbers affected by these changes from 2008-09 onwards.</p>
