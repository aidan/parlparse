  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1O-4422 by Lewis Macdonald on 17 January 2002, whether the Performance Audit Group has completed the audit of BEAR Scotland Ltd's trunk roads maintenance winter activities in the north east during the period of severe winter weather over the last festive period and beyond and, if so, what the findings of this audit were.</p>

  <p>The Performance Audit Group has completed its specific audit of BEAR&#146;s winter maintenance performance in the north east during the period from 22 December 2001 to 31 January 2002.</p>

  <p>PAG concluded that the public perception of BEAR&#146;s lack of winter performance is not borne out by PAG&#146;s on site observations and BEAR&#146;s records. PAG&#146;s visit to the A96 closure on 3 January 2002 did identify that significant resources had been deployed to deal with large volumes of drifting snow. PAG&#146;s detailed audits provided the most accurate objective assessment of BEAR&#146;s winter performance available. These audits have confirmed both strengths (compliant organisational, plant and material arrangements) and some weaknesses. These weaknesses have resulted in the issue of three Default Notices, which BEAR is actively addressing.</p>

  <p>The Default Notices essentially require BEAR to shorten certain gritter routes, which will result in more resources available on the network. Also, addressing the Default Notices will require the re-submission of the Winter Maintenance Plan for approval. This exercise will allow such issues as provision of &quot;all necessary resources&quot; to be better documented and, as a result, overall winter maintenance performance should improve. We will continue to monitor the performance of the Operating Companies, and to act wherever this performance falls short of the contract requirements.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive <a name="QuestionText">whether it will review the condition in the trunk roads maintenance contracts which precludes Amey Highways Ltd and BEAR Scotland Ltd from corresponding or meeting with MSPs.</a></p>

  <p>Yes. The condition in the contracts was carried over from an identical condition in the previous contracts in order to maintain clear lines of responsibility between the Executive and the Operating Companies. However, we are keen to maximise the accountability of the Operating Companies on operational matters. I have therefore reviewed the condition in the contracts and concluded that there is no good reason to continue to preclude the Operating Companies from meeting or corresponding with elected members on operational matters or questions of fact. They should continue to refer elected members to ministers on matters of policy.</p>

  <p>These contracts have reached the end of their first year of operation and the Operating Companies have established operational and management procedures that they would be happy to explain to elected members. In recognition of the change in the contracts referred to above, both Amey and BEAR intend to hold Open Days at each of their main depots at which MSPs will be invited to view and discuss with senior personnel the Operating Companies&#146; operations. These Open Days will take place during the week commencing 22 April and the Operating Companies will write to MSPs in their respective areas.</p>
