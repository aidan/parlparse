  <p>A number of police forces, including Fife Constabulary, are leading the way using not only the seizure of vehicles provisions, but other measures in the Antisocial Behaviour (Scotland) Act. This has helped bring relief and respite to their communities.</p>

  <p>Clearly antisocial behaviour does not recognise local boundaries and therefore we have monitoring systems in place to ensure that the act&rsquo;s provisions are used effectively across Scotland.</p>

  <p>All modern apprentices are employed and therefore their wages are a matter between them and their employers. We do not hold this information and it is likely to vary from employer to employer. Although contribution rates for modern apprenticeship frameworks vary between Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise, this has no direct bearing on the amount employers pay apprentices as this funding goes towards offsetting the training costs.</p>

  <p>The final evaluation of the Glasgow and Fife drug courts will be published today and can be accessed at the following weblinks:</p>

  <p>Report. <a href="http://sh45inta/Resource/Doc/100021/0024203.pdf" target="_blank">http://sh45inta/Resource/Doc/100021/0024203.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p>Research Findings <a href="http://sh45inta/Resource/Doc/47121/0020290.pdf" target="_blank">http://sh45inta/Resource/Doc/47121/0020290.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p>The report is broadly positive, finding that a sizeable proportion of individuals made subject to Drug Court Orders were able to achieve and sustain reductions in drug use and associated offending behaviour. The report also states that offenders who completed their orders had fewer convictions in the two years after being made subject to an order than in the two years immediately before, and that there was and is widespread support for the drug courts both from those working within them and from other criminal justice professionals, such as sheriffs sitting in other courts.</p>

  <p>On the basis of the report, I have decided that both drug courts will now continue. They will operate a composite model that will embrace the strengths of both existing models. The position of the drug courts will then be reviewed in three years time against the progress made with the summary justice reforms.</p>

  <p>There are, however, clear lessons to be learned from the success of the drug courts &ndash; about successful multi-agency working, about working to shared agendas and about the benefits of adopting a problem solving approach to delivery. We will apply these lessons across Scotland and will take them forward through the reducing reoffending agenda and through the summary justice reforms. At present there is no plan for further drug courts given the national coverage of Drug Treatment and Testing Orders - disposals which incorporate the most important features of the drug court and which have been shown to have success in dealing with this client group.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive participates in the <em>Positive about Disabled People</em> scheme. Staff and applicants to the Scottish Executive are invited to self-declare any disability, physical or mental, that they may have both during the recruitment process and in the workplace. The Executive monitors those applicants and staff who have self-declared a disability throughout the recruitment process and their career.</p>

  <p>The recruitment of people with mental health problems by public bodies is not currently monitored by the Scottish Executive. It is for individual public bodies to monitor their own recruitment practices in accordance with employment law.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has any concerns about NHS boards seeking to &quot;poach&quot; nursing staff from other NHS boards within Scotland.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are encouraged to have complimentary workforce strategies so that the net workforce capacity for the NHS in Scotland is increased. Staff &quot;poaching&quot; as a result of recruitment activities in one area having a consequence on the workforce in another has not been a national issue until now.</p>

  <p>Indeed, competition between NHS board employers in Scotland has been markedly less since Government policy has been to encourage co-operation within healthcare sector and avoid the wasteful tensions created by independent NHS trusts and the need to have local pay bargaining.</p>

  <p>Many services today are planned on a regional basis. This also requires the workforce to be planned accordingly to deliver these services at a local level. This requires NHS boards and regions to work collaboratively in developing solutions to workforce pressures across NHSScotland.</p>

  <p>However, the Health Department is aware that NHS Lothian Nurse Recruitment Service arranged a series of &quot;Open Days&quot; at various locations across Scotland. The boards recruitment team were fully briefed and understood that this was an opportunity to not only recruit to Lothian but also to highlight vacant nursing posts across the NHS in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The local NHS boards in each of the areas of the proposed events were also invited to attend to support recruitment within their area by the NHS Lothian Nurse Recruitment Service. The event was also supported by the RCN, who sent representation to every venue.</p>

  <p>I am aware that the Care Commission&rsquo;s complaints procedure is one of the issues being considered by the Health Committee as part of its review of the <em>Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001</em> . I will await the report from the committee and consider any other views before considering what action, if any, is required.</p>

  <p>Arrangements are in place which allow the Care Commission to inform local authorities of complaints in care homes or other care services. Where there are indications of abuse or neglect or allegations of an offence the Care Commission will inform the relevant agencies immediately on receipt of the complaint. The commission is developing agreements with local authorities and health boards which set out arrangements for sharing information.</p>

  <p>Where the outcome of a complaint leads to formal enforcement action this will be included in the care service provider&rsquo;s next inspection report and will be followed up by the Care Commission as part of the inspection process. The commission also has a statutory duty to copy all formal improvement notices to the local authority in whose area the service is provided.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive , further to the answer to question S2W-20252 by Ross Finnie 0n 14 November, whether, in light of the 7 September 2004 judgment of the European Court of Justice in the Waddenzee case, it considers that commercial scallop dredging in the Firth of Lorne Special Area of Conservation is, or should be, treated as a plan or project within the meaning of Article 6.3 of the 1992 EC Habitats and Species Directive, notwithstanding the minister&rsquo;s position that the issue of licences to fishing vessels is not subject to Regulation 48 of the Conservation (Natural Habitats, &amp;c.) Regulations 1994.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is considering the implications of the Waddenzee judgement by the European Court both in general terms with regard to fishing and specifically in relation to the Firth of Lorn marine Special Area of Conservation. Once we have come to a view on those implications, including the issue in this question, we shall discuss the matter further with the European Commission.</p>

  <p>The Firth of Lorn as a designated Special Area of Conservation is subject to regular site condition monitoring by Scottish Natural Heritage to ensure that the site interests remain in favourable condition. The Scottish Executive is currently considering whether specific further steps may be required for this site to ensure compliance with the Habitats Directive.</p>

  <p>The SPCB adopted contingency plans for the loss of the Holyrood Chamber in September 2005, following a report by officials on alternative venues considered or used by the parliament since 1999. These plans address the implications of using various alternative venues for meetings which would otherwise be held in the debating chamber. Contingency plans identify the facilities available at a number of them and the staffing and other resources required to procure, set up and run meetings at those alternative venues.</p>
