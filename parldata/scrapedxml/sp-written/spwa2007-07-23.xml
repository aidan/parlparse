  <p>Since 1 April 2006 strategic research in Environment, Biology and Agriculture has been funded by the Scottish Executive through 4 programmes of work as set out in Strategic Research for SEERAD 2005-2010: Environment, Biology and Agriculture. From April 2006 it has not been possible to extract precise data on the costs of agricultural biotechnology related research from the funding allocated to each programme, since the funding provided by the Scottish Executive is now focused on outcomes and it is up to the individual organisations to decide the approach used to achieve these. However, full details of the work contained within the 4 programmes are available at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/srg" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/srg</a>.</p>

  <p>The Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council also provide funding to Scottish research organisations for agricultural biotechnology related research. Information on this can be found at: <a href="http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk" target="_blank">www.bbsrc.ac.uk.</a></p>

  <p>The funding figures for private expenditure allocated to agricultural biotechnology research are not collected centrally. The Office of National Statistics (ONS) publishes figures for overall UK research and development spend, including by private companies, on an annual basis (latest figures are for 2003) and these are available on: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/" target="_blank">www.statistics.gov.uk/</a>.</p>

  <p>It is the responsibility of the Scottish Government to set strategic directions for the drugs agenda, as well as to establish national guidelines and the integration of services. Providing support for children in substance-misusing households, including those whose parents are prescribed methadone, is the responsibility of local services. We expect services to work together to identify children at risk and take coordinated action in the best interests of the child. The Scottish Government&rsquo;s policies underpin this support, and a wide range of activity is being taken forward around children in substance-misusing households, including the development of Getting It Right for Every Child, approaches to ensuring parents are clear about their responsibilities, better support for young carers and ongoing work in child protection.</p>

  <p>Monitoring individual children living with parents affected by substance misuse is the responsibility of local agencies. We expect services to work together to identify children at risk of harm from parental substance misuse and to take appropriate, coordinated action in the best interests of the child.</p>

  <p>Information about the number and ages of dependent children of clients accessing a new episode of treatment or care for their drug misuse is now being recorded in the expanded Scottish Drug Misuse Database. In addition, Ministers in March 2006 wrote to chief officers seeking assurances about children in their areas affected by drug misusing parents. This exercise generated an assurance from all agencies that they are working effectively, at an individual level, to protect children.</p>

  <p>Capital funding of &pound;32,907,065 has been allocated under the Primary and Community Care Premises Modernisation Programme for 2006-08 for premises to support extended NHS dental services and community training of dentists and dental technicians including the provision of both new dental centres and the improvement of some existing facilities.</p>

  <p>It is planned that extended services will mainly be provided by NHS salaried dentists. NHS general dental practitioners, however, already practice from some of the facilities being improved and NHS boards concerned are investigating the potential for general dental practitioners to practice from the new buildings. The premises from which general dental practitioners may in future practice currently account in total for &pound;10,748,000 of the above funds, although it is not possible at this time to confirm the precise amount that may be attributable to general dental practitioner use.</p>

  <p>In addition to this programme, since April 2005 NHS general dental practitioners have been eligible for recurring support with their premises rental costs for existing premises or when they wish to move to new premises. During 2006-07 over &pound;6 million was paid to dentists in rent reimbursement.</p>

  <p>Finally, &pound;2.5 million has been provided in this financial year for dental practice improvements and funding is also available to NHS general dental practitioners under the Scottish Dental Access Initiative.</p>

  <p>No maximum has been set for the number of patients who can be treated by dental students in outreach centres.</p>

  <p>Actual information on the outreach centre in Aberdeen shows that 3,405 patients were booked for treatment by dental students in its first full year.</p>

  <p>The number of patients will, however, vary between outreach centres according to several factors, including the type of patients being treated. For example, the outreach centre at Bridgeton in Glasgow will treat children only and will see fewer patients as a consequence.</p>

  <p>More information on the number of patients being treated by dental students in outreach centres will become available as more centres open and become fully functioning.</p>

  <p>There is currently a range of public health information available on the importance of vitamin D.

  <p>The Scottish House Condition Survey, which is the only consistent national source of information on houses below tolerable standard, estimates that there were 20,000 households living in houses below the standard in 2002. This is 0.9% of all households in Scotland. Because of the small number of houses identified in the survey as below the tolerable standard the survey cannot provide estimates for individual councils.</p>

  <p>Councils provide the Executive with annual estimates of the number of below tolerable standard dwellings in the council area. Research conducted on behalf of the Executive into the basis for local and national estimates &ndash; Research into the basis for local and national estimates of the number of BTS houses in Scotland by DTZ Pieda Consulting in association with Dr J I Ansell - concluded that there were significant variations between councils in the way in which they interpret the standard when compiling their estimates, and that there are also weaknesses in the estimates stemming from the use of unsatisfactory baseline data and imperfect methods used to update estimates. This report has been published by Scottish Executive Central Research Unit in 2000 and is available on the Scottish Executive website: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/cru/resfinds/drf90-00.asp" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/cru/resfinds/drf90-00.asp</a>.</p>

  <p>The number of farm animal welfare inspections carried out by Animal Health in Scotland during 2006 and the first six months of 2007 are shown in the following tables. The figures for 2007 have still to be finalised.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many farm animal welfare inspections undertaken by Animal Health (formerly the State Veterinary Service) in 2006 and the first six months of 2007 on pig, sheep, dairy cattle, beef cattle, poultry (broiler chickens, ducks and turkeys), laying hen and other farmed animal units in Scotland were for (a) monitoring compliance with EU animal welfare regulations, (b) assessing cross-compliance for single farm payments, (c) investigating complaints about animal welfare and (d) any other purpose.</p>

  <p>The number of farm animal welfare inspections carried out in 2006 and 2007 up to the end of June for various purposes are shown in the following tables. The figures for 2007 have still to be finalised.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive when it intends to announce its position on the previous administration&rsquo;s (a) commitment to set up a working group of stakeholders and officials to consider marine national parks and (b) request to local enterprise companies to consider the economic impact of setting up marine parks, in accordance with their remits.</p>

  <p>I recognise that the initial consultation by the previous administration highlighted the need for further work in addressing significant concerns raised about proposals to establish a coastal and marine national park.</p>

  <p>I am currently considering how and when we will make progress in relation to this work and in the wider context of the management of our marine environment.</p>

  <p>Our policy involves change to the training and educational infrastructure to increase numbers of trained staff to deliver the range of evidence based psychological therapies, including cognitive behaviour therapies, by our 2010 timetable.</p>

  <p>NHS Education for Scotland are taking work forward to develop greater capacity to deliver a range of psychological interventions, such as cognitive behaviour therapy. Building on this work we will be taking forward a mental health collaborative change programme that will work with every NHS board to look at improvements to making evidence based psychological interventions available, in a range of settings, for all ages.</p>

  <p>Visits this year to all NHS boards have included attention on implementation progress and plans including service models to enable staff to deliver psychological therapies in an expanded range of settings. Progress is being made but there is more to do.</p>

  <p>We are working to reduce the number of admissions of children and young people to adult beds by 50%; to increase dedicated in-patient beds; to provide mental health training for all those working with or caring for looked after or accommodated children and young people; and to ensuring that a named mental health link person is available to every school to better inform all concerned and help identify needs at the earliest point.</p>

  <p>We are also working with Heads Up and the Scottish Development Centre for Mental Health on developing national clinical support and better information.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the temporary staffing costs were in respect of (a) doctors, (b) nurses, (c) other healthcare professionals, (d) managers and (e) administrative staff in each of the last five years, broken down by NHS board.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2007-07-23.33.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80396" speakername="Nicola Sturgeon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-07/wa0723.htm#17">

  <p>Information on the temporary staffing costs in respect of four of the five groups listed above is not collected centrally; however separate costs are available for nursing staff (both agency and bank) and we can provide an overall total for the cost of employing agency staff which is reported in the Annual Accounts of NHS boards.</p>

  <p>(a) Nursing agency costs from 2001-02 to 2005-06 (2006-07 figures are not all available) broken down by NHS boards, as detailed in the national workforce unit&rsquo;s report E13 is given in table 1 of parliamentary question S3W-1907 &ndash; Nursing Agency costs 2001-02 &ndash; 2005-06&rsquo;, a copy of which has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number reference 43222):</p>

  <p>(b) Costs for nursing bank staff from 2001-02 &ndash; 2005-06 as detailed in the national workforce unit&rsquo;s report E16 is given in table 2 of parliamentary question S3W-1907 &ndash; Nurse Banking Staff costs 2001-02 &ndash; 2005-06, a copy of which has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 43223):</p>

  <p>Nationally co-ordinated nurse bank arrangements are being implemented to assist nurse placement across Scotland, to improve patient services and cut costs of agency nursing.</p>

  <p>The increase in the number of bank staff used is in line with recommendations made within the report and action plan of the nationally co-ordinated nurse bank arrangements project and reflects our policy on reducing the reliance on agency nurses in NHSScotland.</p>

  <p>Effectively managed nurse banks allow NHS employers to deploy resources effectively and safely in light of service demands, while affording individual staff members improved flexibility in their employment that better meet work/life demands. Bank staff are employees of NHSScotland, are deployed by individual NHS employers to cover temporary nursing gaps and as such have access to training and career opportunities.</p>

  <p>A project manager has been appointed to take forward the 18 recommendations set out in the nursing and midwifery workload and workforce planning report, which will impact on bank and agency usage. Significant progress is being made by NHS boards who are responsible for ensuring that their board has a local action plan to take the recommendations forward in their own area.</p>

  <p>A national contract for the provision of agency nurses, through the best procurement initiative, (BPI) is in place. The BPI is part of NHSScotland&rsquo;s agenda for modernising support services and is an important element of the Executive&rsquo;s Efficient Government initiative aimed at delivering public services to the highest possible quality in Scotland. A contract was initially established in the West of Scotland in November 2003 and this was rolled out to the North and East of Scotland in November 2004. It is anticipated that the contract will deliver savings of approximately &pound;7 million per annum by 2006-07.</p>

  <p>(c) Total agency costs for NHS boards as reported in the annual accounts of NHS boards and trusts, is defined as the gross cost of all payments to employment agencies for the provision of agency staff of all disciplines. The figures are given in table 3 of parliamentary question S3W-1907 &ndash; Total Agency costs for NHS boards 2001-02 &ndash; 2005-06&rsquo;, a copy of which has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 43224); these figures will not include nurse bank staff.</p>

  <p>The NHS is a team operation. Staff such as those listed above, play a vital role in keeping a hospital running smoothly. Behind every nurse or doctor there is someone making sure their equipment works, that test results are processed accurately, that appointments are scheduled and that patient records are up-to-date. These staff groups play a key role in planning better services for the future. Every member of staff in the NHS, regardless of their specialism, plays a vital part in saving lives in the modern NHS.</p>

  <p>Information on expenditure by NHS boards on the specific groups of staff requested is not collected centrally; however information on the following groups of staff is available:</p>

  <p>Information on the costs of these groups of staff and the increase between 1999-2000 and 2006-07 is given in table 1 of parliamentary question S3W-1917 - NHS Staff Expenditure 1999-2000 and 2006-07 (SFR 15), a copy of which has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 43216).</p>

  <p>The staff figures are taken from Scottish Financial Return 15 which were completed by all boards and trusts and returned to the SEHD with their annual accounts.</p>

  <p>Proportion of NHS Budget</p>

  <p>It is not possible to identify exactly what each NHS board spends on administrative staff as there is no definition of this with which to collate information. However expenditure on staff on administration and clerical pay scales has been used as an approximation, although this may include staff who might not be considered administrative and conversely may exclude those that are who are paid on a different pay scale, such as senior managers.</p>

  <p>We are committed to NHSScotland being an exemplar employer. Enhancements to staff terms and conditions provide benefits to staff by recognising their contribution through fair pay, greater flexibility and improved development opportunities; they also help deliver benefits to patients by creating a more motivated and better skilled workforce, and a platform for new working practices that can drive more responsive patient-centred services.</p>

  <p>The figures are given in table 1 of parliamentary question S3W-1922 &ndash; Annual NHS staff costs 2001-02 &ndash; 2005-06 a copy of which has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. reference 43219). The table shows the annual NHS staff costs over the last five years for each NHS board, the costs expressed as a percentage of each Board&rsquo;s total budget and year on year changes:</p>

  <p>Reason for Increase</p>

  <p>A range of factors impact upon staff costs. These include increases in staff numbers (which have been significant in recent years), annual uplifts to staff pay, movement of staff up pay scales, temporary supplements to staff pay such a New Deal banding supplements for junior doctors, introduction of pay modernisation and the change in employers&rsquo; superannuation contributions from 5.5% of total pensionable salaries to 14% in April 2004.</p>

  <p>It is not clear that changing to a system of opting out would necessarily lead to an improvement in organ donation rates in Scotland. Such a move would need strong support from the public and the health professionals involved, but the extensive consultations carried out in relation to the organ donation and transplantation provisions of the Human Tissue (Scotland) Act 2006 showed strong support for strengthening the present system of opting-in. That is the approach which is embodied in the Act.</p>

  <p>We feel that there are serious risks associated with a change to a system of presumed consent, given that the disclosures about organ retention at post-mortem examination showed that for many people presumed consent is regarded as denying them a proper say in what should happen to their body after death. A time may come when it would be possible to move to a system of presumed consent, but we do not believe that time is now.</p>

  <p>Both approaches aim to increase the number of organs becoming available for transplantation, an aim which we fully support. I wish to explore with the other health departments the gains which could be achieved through changes to the present organ donation and transplantation infrastructure.</p>

The consultation on the proposed Scottish enhanced service programme for primary and community care seeks to build on this by including falls prevention and bone health as one of those enhanced services.</p>

  <p>NHS Quality Improvement Scotland will published advice on the recommendations of the multiple technology appraisal by the National Institute for health and Clinical Excellence of drugs for the primary prevention of osteoporosis in post-menopausal women. NHSScotland should take account of this advice in its planning, funding and provision of services, to ensure that recommended drugs or treatments are made available to meet clinical need.</p>

  <p>We are aware that this is an issue which NICE is considering in the context of its multiple technology appraisal of drugs used in the primary prevention of osteoporotic fragility fractures in post-menopausal women.</p>

  <p>For women who cannot take or have withdrawn from treatment with alendronate, alternative treatment options will be outlined in the NICE Osteoporosis guideline, which is due later this year. The Osteoporosis guideline cannot be published until both the primary and secondary prevention of osteoporosis technology appraisals have been finalised. The recommendations from the technology appraisals on initiation of therapy will then be incorporated into the full guideline. This will ensure that a comprehensive care pathway is agreed for postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.</p>

  <p>Until the guideline is published, the existing NICE guidance TA87 (published in 2005) on secondary prevention of osteoporosis in post-menopausal women will apply, which recommends alternative treatment options for those women who cannot take or who have withdrawn from alendronate.</p>

  <p>Recent studies have shown that the costs of wind energy are expected to increase over the coming four or five years.

  <p>Under spending by the Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs against its Budgets in the years 2004-05, 2005-06 and 2006-07 was &pound;39 million, &pound;46 million and &pound;54 million respectively. The allocations made to the Department at the end of 2004-05 and 2005-06, for later use under the End Year Flexibility (EYF) arrangements were &pound;36 million (composed of &pound;28 million capital and &pound;8 million resource) and &pound;9 million (entirely capital) respectively.</p>

  <p>Provisional under spending against the Department&rsquo;s 2006-07 Budget is &pound;54 million (composed of &pound;38 million capital and &pound;16 million resource). No allocations of end year flexibility for 2006-07 under spending have been made at this time, pending the outcome of the 2007 Spending Review. The balance of under spending in any year which is not allocated as EYF is retained by the Central Contingency Fund.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-684 by Stewart Maxwell on 18 June 2007, whether it has considered how it could set up a new lottery distribution body for sports funding, given that this is a matter reserved to the UK Parliament.</p>

  <p>Arrangements for the distribution of the lottery sports fund in Scotland would be considered alongside consideration of the future of sportscotland.</p>

  <p>Primary legislation relating to the National Lottery is of course reserved to Westminster. However, there is extensive Executive devolution within the terms of the Concordat agreed between the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the Scottish Executive. These devolved powers include the provision for Scottish Ministers to change lottery distributors and their percentage shares within the overall Scottish arts and sport percentages as set out in the National Lottery etc Act 1993 (amended).</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-684 by Stewart Maxwell on 18 June 2007, whether the setting up of a new, separate lottery distribution body for sport would fulfil its aim of de-cluttering the public sector landscape.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the question S3W-684 answered on 18 June 2007. No decisions have been taken as yet. The question of sports lottery fund distribution will be considered as part of the review of sportscotland, which will take place within the context of the wider review of public bodies announced by the Cabinet Secretary For Finance And Sustainable Growth on 24 May 2007.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-684 by Stewart Maxwell on 18 June 2007, whether it considers that having a new independent organisation distributing lottery funding for sport and a different organisation investing in the priorities of Reaching Higher: Building on the Success of Sport 21 is the best way of investing in Scottish sport.</p>

  <p>The priorities for sport in Reaching Higher sets out the importance of strong organisations in order to deliver improved performance and increased participation. We value the contribution sportscotland can make to the implementation of the strategy and these remain the outcomes we are seeking for sport. Any decision on a new organisation distributing lottery funding for sport and a different organisation investing in the priorities of the strategy would recognise and consider the implications within the wider context of the review of public bodies announced by the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth on 24 May 2007.</p>
