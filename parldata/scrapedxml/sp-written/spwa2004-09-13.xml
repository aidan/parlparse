  <p>UK-wide negotiations over the new General Medical Services (GMS) contract began during 2001-02. A framework document was produced in April 2002 which contained an early indication of the proposed new out-of-hours arrangements. Further information was contained in the contract document itself, published in February 2003 and accepted in a GP ballot in June 2003. The National Health Service (General Medical Services Contracts) (Scotland) Regulations 2004, which came into force at 1 April 2004, set out in detail the terms to be included in contracts.</p>

  <p>NHS boards have been aware from these documents of the need to plan for the re-provision of out-of-hours care and have until 31 December 2004 to do so.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are currently developing their plans for out-of-hours service re-provision and most are not yet in a position to provide final figures. However, this is a key priority for NHS systems and any potential additional financial pressure should be placed within the context of a record uplift in general allocations to boards across Scotland of &pound;370 million in 2004-05. In addition, the introduction of the new General Medical Services contract is supported by 33% increased investment in primary care over its first three years.</p>

  <p>All NHS boards, other than NHS Orkney, have indicated that they will have new service models in place before 31 December 2004. No GP practices in Orkney intend to transfer responsibility for out-of-hours provision and so the current arrangements will continue there.</p>

  <p>Decisions on future organisation and staffing levels will be for SNH Management in the first instance. However, we announced in October 2003 that the Executive had agreed with SNH proposals to retain up to 50 posts in the Edinburgh area beyond the date of the main move, reducing to 25 in the longer term and the SNH Relocation Plan assumes 278 staff in the new Inverness HQ in 2006, rising to 303 in 2010.</p>

  <p>The Executive supports SNH management in its objective of encouraging staff to relocate and on 30 March ministers approved its Human Resources package of measures which seeks to maximise the number of staff who will choose to relocate, while providing value for money and securing business continuity. Tavish Scott made clear to the Finance Committee that the terms offered to staff of public sector bodies will, as in this instance, depend on the specific circumstances of each relocation.</p>

  <p>The cost of the package and of the different elements cannot be assessed accurately at this stage. The variable factors include the number of staff opting to relocate and the length of service and salary level of those who do not. Any severance payments will be paid in accordance with the standard Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme rules. I understand that SNH expect to undertake a staff survey once staff have had an opportunity to consider the options the results of which will enable SNH to update the cost assumptions in the project plan. A revised version of the project plan is likely to be available in the autumn following completion of the tender process for the building procurement at which stage a copy of the plan will be placed in SPICe.</p>

  <p>The use of human sewage sludge to regenerate marginal non-agricultural land requires a full licence under the Waste Management Licensing Regulations 1994, as amended, except where an appropriate exemption is registered. The appropriate exemption is that in Paragraph 8 of Schedule 3 to the 1994 Regulations. As with all exemptions, the relevant objectives in Paragraph 4(1) of Part 1 of Schedule 4 to the 1994 Regulations, which protect human health and the environment, must be met. Paragraph 8 also specifically requires observance of soil concentration limits for heavy metals set out in the Sludge (Use in Agriculture) Regulations 1989.</p>

  <p>I laid the Waste Management Licensing Amendment (Scotland) Regulations 2004 before the Scottish Parliament in June of this year. These amend Paragraph 8 of the 1994 Regulations to ensure that the enhancement of crop growth or ecological improvement to be gained by the activity should be demonstrated in advance to the satisfaction of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, according to statutory procedures. The 2004 Regulations also give the agency powers relating to the renewal and removal of registrations. These changes will come into force on 12 January 2005.</p>

  <p>There are no current plans for further changes to the relevant legislation. In any event, controls in other regimes, such as those in the Control of Pollution Act 1974 on water pollution and in the Environmental Protection Act 1990 on noise, odours and other nuisances, apply even to exempted activities.</p>

These include that waste should be recovered or disposed of without endangering human health.</p>

  <p>How this may be demonstrated is a matter for discussion between the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the operator and may include testing to determine levels of any basic contaminants if this is considered appropriate. The amendments in the waste Management Licensing Amendment (Scotland) Regulations 2004 which come into force on 12 January 2005 provide for annual renewal of Paragraph 8 exemptions.</p>

  <p>Sewage sludge is spread on non-agricultural land either in pursuance of a full licence under the Waste Management Licensing regulations 1994, as amended, or under a registered exemption under the terms of Paragraph 8 of Schedule 3 to those regulations. Where a licence is granted these factors would be taken into account and it is a requirement of registration of any exemption that the relevant objectives in Paragraph 4(1) of Schedule 4 to the 1994 Regulations should be observed. These include that waste should be recovered or disposed of without risk to plants or animals, and without adversely affecting the countryside or places of special interest. How this may be demonstrated is a matter for discussion between the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the operator.</p>
