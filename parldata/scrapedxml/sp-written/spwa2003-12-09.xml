  <p>The Scottish ministers own Highlands and Islands Airports Ltd (HIAL) which is responsible for helping to develop new business opportunities from its airports. Regular discussions are held with airlines about the commencement of new routes but it is for airlines themselves to take advantage of commercial opportunities.</p>

  <p>HIAL offers discounts on landing charges for new services; and the Executive&#8217;s Interim Route Development Fund can invest in new air services from the Highlands and Islands to destinations outwith Scotland.</p>

  <p>Ministers visited Scottish communities to discuss anti-social behaviour at the invitation of local MSPs, who organised, facilitated and advertised the visits. A table showing locations and dates follows. The number of people attending varied from meeting to meeting. In order to encourage the free and uninhibited expression of views and personal experiences of local people, it was agreed that the notes taken of the meetings would not be published, but would help inform the consultation process. The notes were therefore made available to the University of Glasgow researchers who produced the report on consultation responses published last week. That report contains a summary of views expressed during constituency visits, copies of which are available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 29683).</p>

  <p>In addition to ministerial visits, the Executive funded Youthlink to carry out its own consultation event with young people across Scotland to explore their views on the proposals contained in the consultation. The Executive also funded the Scottish Civic Forum to hold six community events across Scotland. Organisation, facilitation and advertisement of these events were carried out by the organisation concerned.</p>

  <p>There are currently no plans to develop best practice guidance in relation to feral pigeons. The Scottish Executive is not aware of an increasing problem concerning feral pigeons and local authorities have adequate powers to resolve problems which they experience. If Environmental Health representatives believe there is a pressing need to address this issue Executive officials will be happy to meet with them.</p>

  <p>Funds have been allocated to local authorities with the highest levels of parents in need of support towards employment. The resources are being distributed to authorities where there are more than 3,000 children of claimants of income-based jobseekers allowance and income support (JSA/IS) and children in these circumstances form more than 20% of the under 16 population. Resources are banded according to the numbers of children in the circumstances set out above.</p>

  <p>The fund has been extended to cover the two highest ranking rural authorities where rurality is defined as areas where more than 40% of the population live in settlements of less than 3,000 people.</p>

  <p>Shortlists for relocation are compiled by the bodies themselves, and will be drawn from a list of areas scoring highly against appraisal criteria.

  <p>The following table gives, for each council tax band, the estimated percentage of households in each household income band. For example, an estimated 32% of households occupying a Band A dwelling have a gross household income of &#163;150 or less per week, excluding any council tax benefit income.</p>

  <p>The council tax band occupied by a household, however, does not equate directly to the council tax bill. Many households with low incomes will qualify for council tax benefit, and will therefore pay little or no council tax from their gross income.</p>

  <p>The partnership agreement for a Better Scotland (PABS) contains a commitment significantly to increase teacher numbers to 53,000 by 2007.

  <p>The National Priorities in Education and the school improvement framework are the vehicles through which we work with education authorities and schools to seek improvement in educational outcomes for all pupils. As part of the drive for improvement, all publicly funded secondary schools have set targets for exam performance for 2005.</p>

  <p>We recognise that there are particular barriers that can prevent pupils who live in areas of high deprivation from achieving their potential in exam performance. A number of policy initiatives seek to offer support that will help to overcome these barriers. These include Surestart, integrated community schools and programmes for study support, among others. The curriculum review and the increase in opportunities for those who wish to pursue vocational qualifications are also important developments focused on addressing underperfomance. There is an additional allowance of around &#163;50 million within the local government settlement to cover education deprivation.</p>

  <p>In December 2002 the Council of Ministers decided that satellite monitoring for Community fishing vessels over 24 metres should be extended, first to vessels over 18 metres from 1 January 2004 and then to vessels over 15 metres from 1 January 2005. Detailed rules subsequently adopted by the European Commission in October 2003 require member states to take measures to ensure that satellite tracking devices fitted to fishing vessels do not permit the input or output of false positions and are not capable of being over-ridden.</p>

  <p>To secure the maximum enforcement benefit from vessel monitoring systems it has been decided that tracking devices fitted to UK fishing vessels should be fully &quot;tamper proof&quot; and dedicated to position reporting.</p>

  <p>Since such terminals may not be used by vessel owners or masters for business purposes, and subject to parliamentary approval the Executive has decided to meet the costs of fitting tamper proof terminals to those UK registered vessels for which it is the licensing authority. It is proposed that vessel owners will be able to reclaim from the department the costs (excluding VAT) of purchasing and installing compliant equipment. The arrangements will be time limited. They will apply to existing vessels and those that join the fleet before 31 December 2004.</p>

  <p>The actual cost of terminals has yet to be determined but, including fitting and warranty, is expected to be between &#163;2,500 and &#163;3,000 per vessel. It is expected that around 480 vessels will be equipped with tamper proof terminals, hopefully by the end of 2004, at an overall cost of around &#163;1.4 million.</p>

  <p>Running costs relate essentially to the costs of required transmission reports. It is estimated these are likely to be between &#163;250 and &#163;500 per annum, depending on whether a vessel has to report hourly (as required if fishing in Norwegian waters) or two hourly.</p>

  <p>It is intended that transmission costs are met by industry, with the department meeting the costs of purchasing and installing on vessels terminals which comply with agreed specifications.</p>

  <p>A non-numeric standard of fingerprint identification has not yet been adopted in Scotland. The most recent experience of the effect of the change to the non-numeric standard comes from England and Wales where that standard was adopted in 2001. This indicates that to date there has been no increase with regard to defence challenges to non-numeric based evidence.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, acting Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The number of completions in an individual year is largely determined by the nature of the projects approved for construction in previous years. Large or complex housing projects, especially when linked to a wider regeneration initiative, can often take over a year to be completed.</p>

  <p>In 2001-02, 4,865 housing association houses for rent were approved for construction. A significant proportion of these houses are due for completion this year rather than in 2002-03. The issue therefore is one of timing rather than any absolute reduction in the number of house completions.</p>

  <p>All new entrants to the Scottish Police Service (and British Transport Police based in Scotland) attend the Scottish Police College for an initial training course, of 15 weeks&#8217; duration. Training on mental health issues includes recognition of attention deficit hyperkinetic disorder and on dealing appropriately with sufferers of the disorder. One of the course modules deals specifically with the difficulties that may be experienced by police officers when interviewing a witness or suspect who may be suffering from this type of disorder.</p>

  <p>Unmarried fathers are able to jointly register the birth of a child with the mother. However, this does not automatically give the father parental rights and responsibilities in relation to the child. These can be secured by marrying the mother, completing a parental responsibilities and parental rights agreement, or through court action.</p>

  <p>The white paper, <em>Parents and Children, </em>published in 2000 included a proposal to confer parental rights and responsibilities on unmarried fathers who jointly register the birth of a child with the child&#8217;s mother. This proposal commanded widespread support.</p>

  <p>The Executive has made a commitment in the partnership agreement to reform family law for all of Scotland&#8217;s people and we will bring forward legislative proposals in due course.</p>

  <p>Road safety campaigns are rigorously researched and developed on the basis of research evidence. Campaigns are evaluated in terms of awareness levels to ensure that the road safety message is reaching its intended audience. Long-term changes in public attitudes and driving behaviour relating to the campaign are also evaluated regularly, and statistics are produced to measure progress towards achieving programme for government casualty reduction targets. Value for money can be assessed through comparing the costs of running the road safety awareness campaign with the estimated costs of a fatal road casualty (&#163;1,249,890 at 2002 prices).</p>

  <p>The Executive provides funds to the Scottish Road Safety Campaign for the production of key road safety education initiatives and publicity campaigns. The campaign arranges publicity to complement enforcement campaigns undertaken by police forces in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Information relating to police time is not held centrally. Campaigns are generally designed round core policing functions and do not require officers to be dedicated to dealing solely with campaign issues.</p>

  <p>The table indicates the cost of publicity arranged by the Scottish Road Safety Campaign associated with (a) festive and (b) summer safety campaigns run by police forces in Scotland in the years 2000-01, 2001-02 and 2002-03.</p>

  <p>All road safety campaigns are continually reviewed by the Scottish Executive and the Scottish Road Safety Campaign. Independent research and evaluation is commissioned to track long term changes in attitudes and behaviour relating to driving amongst target audiences. Awareness of campaigns is tracked and evaluated, before and after periods of campaign activity, to measure how messages are being received. All of this information is used to provide insight into the future development of the campaign strategy.</p>

  <p>For new roads, the Scottish Executive will assess predicted noise emissions and, where appropriate, devise a strategy for attenuation or insulation of affected properties. The eligibility to be insulated if a property is adjacent to a new or improved road is assessed on the first, fifth, tenth and fifteenth anniversary of the road opening or re-opening. There is not a programme for the improvement of noise around existing roads, however modern materials emit less noise than traditional surfacing and therefore improvements can normally be anticipated when worn out sections are resurfaced.</p>

  <p>None. The Executive is aware of some countries around the world where like Scotland &#8211; the provision of water and waste water services has remained in the public sector. Some water utilities have entered into joint venture relationships for delivery of capital programme, however, within the water industry this arrangement is unique in its partnering approach.</p>

  <p>The Clyde waterfront development project is an overall strategy which is made up of a wide number of individual projects. While the issue of access to water and waste water services has been recognised at the development project level, it would only become a factor for detailed consideration at an individual project level. Detailed work on individual projects has not started.</p>

  <p>In relation to development constraints, I refer the member to the answer given to S2W-3242 on 4 November 2003. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&#8217;s website, the search facility for which can be found at:</p>

  <p>In any case reported to a Procurator Fiscal, a decision will be made in the public interest whether to prosecute or take alternative action, including taking no proceedings. It is an important feature of our criminal justice system that Procurators Fiscal make decisions independently and in the public interest. This prosecutorial independence is enshrined in the Scotland Act.</p>

  <p>The decision in this case was taken after consideration of all of the circumstances of the case and consultation with the Drinking Water Quality Regulator for Scotland. I understand that procedures were introduced by Scottish Water very quickly after this incident which should avoid future incidents of this kind.</p>

  <p>There was an issue with the November NHS student nurse bursary payments being paid four days later than planned. The problem arose as a result of us processing an unusually large volume of transactions through our central payment system. Once we discovered the problem, we took urgent steps to accelerate the processing of the bursaries. We have reviewed procedures to minimise the risk of any reoccurrence.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive set out its policy on special educational needs in the document, <em>Moving Forward! Additional Support for Learning</em> , published in January 2003. This includes its support for the training of teachers working with pupils with special educational needs. This document can be accessed on the Executive&#8217;s website at:</p>

  <p>http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library5/education/mfas-00.asp.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s current review of initial teacher education (ITE) will include consideration of the contribution ITE can make to preparing student teachers for working with pupils who require additional support for learning. The review group is due to report to ministers by the end of March 2004. Any proposals for change will be announced thereafter.</p>

  <p>The Executive has put in place a framework for the continuing professional development of teachers, which includes inclusion and equality issues. We are providing &#163;8.4 million per year to support the development and training of teachers and staff working with pupils who require additional support.</p>

  <p>In addition, we are preparing draft regulations on specialist qualifications for teachers working with pupils with additional support needs and will consult on these in early 2004.</p>

The area tourist board review is being considered in the context of these wider issues. I, and my ministerial colleagues, are taking the time to get the right support structure, so we can achieve our long-term vision for Scottish tourism. It is hoped that an announcement on the outcomes will be made in the near future.</p>

  <p>The acting Commissioner was appointed by the SPCB on 31 January 2003. The terms of the contract stated that he would continue to act as the Scottish Parliamentary Standards Commissioner in relation to the complaint or complaints which were outstanding at 1 April 2003 until the Standards Committee had confirmed that no assistance or further assistance would be sought from him. When the Parliament went into dissolution on 31 March 2003 there was one outstanding complaint under investigation and the acting Commissioner duly reported on that matter to the Standards Committee at the earliest opportunity in session 2. The Standards Committee completed its consideration of this complaint with the publication of a committee report at the conclusion of Stage 3 of the complaints process on 7 October 2003. As at that date, no further assistance was required from the acting Standards Commissioner. The Standards Committee will be invited to confirm that position.</p>

  <p>I refer Alex Neil to my answer to S2W-4304 on 9 December 2003. We would not normally publish terms of appointment for individuals. I can confirm that the general terms and conditions were identical to those published as part of the application pack for those applying for the permanent appointment and a copy of this has been placed in SPICe (Bib. number. 30158).</p>

  <p>In addition to the general conditions these particular terms of appointment also had a specific section on tenure and this was as follows:</p>

  <p>Your appointment as acting Scottish Parliamentary Standards Commissioner is effective from 30 January 2003 until 31 March 2003. The purpose of your appointment is to fulfil the role of Scottish Parliamentary Standards Commissioner until the permanent Commissioner takes up his role on 1 April 2003.</p>

  <p>From 1 April 2003 you will continue to fulfil the functions of Scottish Parliamentary Standards Commissioner in relation to any complaint or complaints which are outstanding as at 1 April 2003 only. Any complaints lodged on or after 1 April 2003 will be passed to the permanent Scottish Parliamentary Standards Commissioner. You will continue to act as the Scottish Parliamentary Standards Commissioner in relation to the complaint or complaints which are outstanding at 1 April 2003 until the Standards Committee has confirmed that no assistance or further assistance is required.</p>
