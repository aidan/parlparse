  <p>A recent report from a private company within the aviation sector estimated that the cost to build a new paved runway at Barra would be &#163;1 million. However, a more extensive study carried out in 1993 by Airport Management Services Ltd, into the possibility of a hard landing strip on either Barra or Vatersay, estimated that the cost would be approximately &#163;6 million.</p>

  <p>The decision on what type of hearing aid best meets the needs of an individual patient is for the clinician in charge of their care.</p>

  <p>The wide-ranging review of audiology services is on target to report to the Executive by the end of October. The report, which will take account of advances in hearing aid technology, will establish the extent to which the Scottish service needs to undergo modernisation and how best to implement any necessary improvements.</p>

  <p>I launched a nationwide advertising campaign at Stirling Bus Station on 10 September to publicise the introduction of free local off-peak concessionary bus travel for elderly and disabled people from 30 September 2002. Posters will appear in and on buses throughout Scotland advising concession card holders of the minimum benefits to which they will be entitled. We will also be placing adverts in local newspapers across the country later in the month. These initiatives will complement guidance and information provided by councils, at a local level, on individual concessionary travel schemes.</p>

  <p>The information requested is shown in the following tables.

Not all of this will be due to fines in default as a large proportion could be within their valid payment period.</p>

  <p>I have asked John Ewing, Chief Executive of the Scottish Court Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>All major new legislation is reviewed to identify resource implications for the Scottish Court Service. The impact of increasing the financial thresholds in small claims and summary causes and the Debt Arrangement and Attachment (Scotland) Bill would not be expected to affect materially the level of business of the courthouse at Peebles.</p>

  <p>The Crofters Commission does not keep and is not required to keep plans and other legal documentation regarding croft registration. Section 41 of the Crofters (Scotland) Act 1993 specifies the information to be entered in the Register of Crofts. This consists of:</p>

  <p>The name, location rent and extent of every croft;</p>

  <p>The name of the tenant and the landlord of each croft, and</p>

  <p>Any consent given by a landlord of a croft under section 50(1)(b) of the 1993 Act.</p>

  <p>There are no current plans to change these requirements but chapter 9 of the white paper entitled <i>Crofting Reform Proposals For Legislation</i> seeks views on the possibility of requiring that a plan of a croft should be supplied, to be held on the register, when a croft changes hands.</p>

  <p>Section 41(3) of the Crofters (Scotland) Act 1993 requires that the Crofters Commission must provide, on request, an extract of any entry on the Register of Crofts to any person who, in the opinion of the Crofters Commission, has good reason for desiring an extract of that entry. The register does not contain plans.</p>

  <p>Chapter 9 of the white paper entitled <i>Crofting Reform Proposals For Legislation</i> seeks views on proposals to allow full public access to the Register of Crofts and to allow the Crofters Commission to charge for the provision of data from the register.</p>

By virtue of section 41(3) of the Crofters (Scotland) Act 1993 the Crofters Commission is required to provide, on request, an extract of any entry on the Register of Crofts to any person who, in the opinion of the Crofters Commission has good reason for desiring an extract of that entry.</p>

  <p>The Executive is providing annual funding to NHS boards for drug treatment services of &#163;15 million in 2001-02, &#163;16 million in 2002-03 and over &#163;17.4 million in 2003-04. NHS boards are also free to invest resources from their general hospital and community care allocations for drug treatment services, should local needs assessment determine that this is necessary.</p>

  <p>It is not just a matter of resources, however, but how services are managed and delivered locally. This is a matter for Drug Action Teams (DATs) and local agencies. Action being undertaken by DATs and NHS boards to improve accessibility is included in DAT annual Corporate Action Plans submitted to the Executive. Issues of concern, such as long waiting times for treatment services, are taken up with officials at local level.</p>

  <p>To assist DATs and partner agencies, the Executive&#146;s Effective Interventions Unit will shortly be issuing advice on effective practice in the planning, designing and delivery of integrated drug services. This will include material about good practice in managing treatment services to avoid lengthy waiting times.</p>

  <p>The DAT Corporate Action Plans for this year asked about waiting times for referral to assessment and to programmes of care. However, in addition, ISD Scotland and the National Waiting Times Unit are currently involved in identifying how waiting time information in this area might be improved and better monitored in the future.</p>

  <p>The SIGN guideline on diagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults (SIGN Guideline No. 21) was published in November 1997. The guideline is currently under review. An overall survey of progress by NHSScotland in implementing SIGN guidelines was carried out in 2001 by a subgroup of the Clinical Resource and Audit Group (CRAG) and a summary report was published in July of this year. A copy can be found on the CRAG website at <a href="http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/crag/" target="_blank">http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/crag/</a> . The survey indicates that of the NHS trusts which responded to the epilepsy guideline section of the survey, 77% had either fully or partially implemented the guideline.</p>

  <p>SIGN guidelines represent best evidence in relation to clinical practice. NHS trusts, through their clinical governance arrangements, are expected to review and apply SIGN guidelines in the light of local circumstances and priorities. The adequacy of trusts' clinical governance arrangements is reviewed by the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland and is the subject of periodic published reports. However, detailed information about adherence to individual SIGN guidelines (of which there are 60) in each trust area is not gathered centrally by the Clinical Standards Board, or by the department.</p>

  <p>On receipt of the information from Aventis, the Scottish Executive and UK Government immediately consulted the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE). ACRE were satisfied that the risks posed by the additional GM material were no different to those posed by the GM crop for which consent had already been granted. ACRE also advised that the affected crops should be harvested on a date that would minimise seed shed.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive news released this information on 15 August 2002 together with the text of a letter from Aventis (to the Scottish Executive) and ACRE&#146;s advice. Scottish ministers subsequently insisted that independent testing would be required of any seed which Aventis proposed to release. This condition applied to the proposed autumn farm-scale trials in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The presence of unauthorised GM material in seed supplied by Aventis was identified following a routine management audit of the Scottish Agricultural College (SAC) by the Executive&#146;s GM Inspectorate. Initial laboratory tests were inconclusive and it was not until 18 July that the precise nature and extent of the unauthorised material in the SAC crop was known. By that stage, the research plot at SAC had been destroyed as a precautionary measure.</p>

  <p>The GM Inspectorate sought further information about the affected seed lot and on 8 August the Executive received a letter from Aventis indicating that low levels of additional GM material were present in oil seed rape seeds used in farm scale trials. Officials advised me of the contamination of the GM seeds on 8 August.</p>

  <p>The text of the letter from Aventis notifying the Scottish Executive of the details of this incident was attached to the Executive&#146;s News Release dated 15 August 2002.</p>

  <p>Patients who receive paramedic-led thrombolysis from the rapid response unit are transferred by the specialist paramedic crew to the CCU at Ninewells for further specialist supervision and care. At present, information on the 30-day survival rate for these patients is not available.</p>

  <p>Paramedic-led thrombolysis is not only provided by the rapid/cardiac response unit, which covers the whole of the Angus area, but also by frontline paramedics based at Montrose and Brechin ambulance stations, who cover their respective areas.</p>

  <p>During the period 1 June 2002 to 31 August 2002, a total of 123 patients suffering from chest pains were attended to by the Ambulance Service in Angus. 47 were attended to by an accident and emergency ambulance and received thrombolytic treatment from a paramedic. The average response time for these cases was 7.9 minutes. The remaining 76 patients were attended to by the cardiac response unit whose average response time was 9.3 minutes.</p>

  <p>In October 2000, we announced our intention to prioritise the health of homeless people. To this end we appointed a Health and Homelessness Co-ordinator and issued guidance to NHS Scotland that outlined the requirement to pro-actively address the needs of this greatly disadvantaged group of people. As a result all NHS boards have submitted Health and Homelessness Action Plans which identify the activities they have planned to improve the health of homeless people across Scotland.</p>

  <p>By April 2003 Health and Homelessness Action Plans will also be integrated into Local Authorities&#146; Homelessness Strategies, which will ensure full NHS Scotland involvement in overall developments to tackle homelessness in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Health and Homelessness Co-ordinator and Health and Homelessness Steering Group are monitoring the delivery of these activities, and I am following progress with interest.</p>

  <p>In terms of both the civil and criminal courts, the only persons who are generally permitted to appear and conduct cases are members of the Faculty of Advocates, solicitor advocates or solicitors and parties who are natural persons (party litigants). In general solicitors are only able to appear before the district court and the sheriff court, except for solicitor advocates who have acquired rights of audience in the supreme courts.</p>

  <p>There are some exceptions. As regards civil proceedings:</p>

  <p>In respect of small claims actions an authorised lay representative may in representing a party do everything for the preparation and conduct of a small claim as may be done by an individual conducting his own claim. (Sheriff Courts (Scotland) Act 1971, section 36 and related rules of court).</p>

  <p>Section 97 of the Debtors (Scotland) Act 1987 and related rules of court entitles a party to any proceedings under the act to be represented by a person other than an advocate or a solicitor, if the sheriff is satisfied that such a person is a suitable representative and is duly authorised to represent the party.</p>

  <p>As regards criminal proceedings:</p>

  <p>At the first diet in summary proceedings where the accused is not present, a person (who is not an advocate or solicitor) who satisfies the court that he is authorised by the accused may tender a plea of guilty or not guilty on behalf of the accused (section 144(2)(b) of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995)</p>

  <p>In addition, under section 4(2) of the Fatal Accidents and Sudden Deaths Inquiry (Scotland) Act 1976 any person entitled to appear at an inquiry may appear on his own behalf or be represented by an advocate or a solicitor or, with the leave of the sheriff by any other person.</p>

  <p>The Joint Implementation Group for the Cultural Strategy is chaired by Mike Watson and its membership includes COSLA. At its second meeting in January this year it reviewed a wide range of issues relating to education including the contribution of museums and galleries.</p>

  <p>More detailed guidance on that contribution will be included in draft guidance for local authorities on their responsibilities in the cultural area and on their contribution to the implementation of the National Cultural Strategy. That guidance has been prepared by a joint Scottish Executive/COSLA working group and will issue in draft form for comment shortly.</p>

  <p>COSLA, Scottish Museums Council, Scottish Arts Council, National Museums of Scotland and National Galleries of Scotland collaborated on a joint conference in October 2001 - The Learning Power of Museums in Scotland. Conference proceedings were subsequently published in July 2002 and submitted to the Executive to inform the National Debate on Education.</p>

  <p>Detailed discussions on the education role and contribution of museums are being taken forward by the Group on Education in Museums.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive provides funding to the Scottish Road Safety Campaign to enable it to produce road safety education resources aimed at children of all ages. The campaign is developing and implementing a strategy for road safety education in Scottish schools at all stages of education, from pre-school to upper secondary school, including special educational needs. The main aim is to ensure that there is a core curriculum of road safety taught to all children in Scotland.</p>

  <p>As part of the Campaign&#146;s Theatre in Education programme, a number of plays aimed at different age groups tour schools throughout Scotland each year. The Campaign&#146;s website includes an area specifically for 8 to 13 year old children, which is designed to convey road safety messages in a fun way.</p>

  <p>On 10 September the campaign launched a national Junior Road Safety Officer scheme, in which senior primary school pupils, supported by local authority or police Road Safety Officers, are appointed to raise awareness of road safety issues among other pupils, teachers, parents and the wider community.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is providing funding, totalling &#163;810,000 over six years, for selected schemes, implemented by local authorities, to train five- and six-year-olds in practical road safety skills. Priority is being given to schemes in disadvantaged areas. The first three successful authorities were announced in January. The second bidding round was launched in June.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive also funds the Children&#146;s Traffic Club in Scotland, which offers free road safety education to all three and four year old children in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The present and predicted hourly traffic volumes in the year 2020, taken as the design year for this scheme, were given in the answers to questions S1W-28403 and S1W-28404 on 10 September 2002. North of the proposed junction with the Glasgow Southern Orbital route the increases are approximately 1,000 vehicles and 700 vehicles respectively for the morning and evening peak hours. South of the junction traffic to and from the Glasgow Southern Orbital will add to this flow and the increases are 2,800 and 2,350 vehicles in the peak hours.</p>

  <p>The &#163;50 million referred to in Quality and Standards 2 (Bib. number 15676) has been allocated to help ease constraints on new development and to help with first time sewerage in rural areas.</p>

  <p>Scottish Water is currently conducting a thorough survey of their network, with a view to understanding the scale of the development constraints problem and its implications. Clearly, this work will enable them to take an informed view of their investment priorities across the board, and to make appropriate decisions. I understand this work has been finalised. It will be shared with the Executive, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the Water Industry Commissionaire, and with local authorities and the construction industry.</p>

  <p>In these circumstances, I am not in a position to comment on what the key criteria for allocation might be. I would, however, expect the current legislative priorities relating to public health and the environment to be considerations.</p>

  <p>In terms of consultation, I would expect Scottish Water to continue - as they do at present - to consult affected communities about any plans they may have for improvements to or construction of water and/or waste water treatment facilities. This would in any case be a requirement under planning legislation.</p>

  <p>Until a new water treatment plant is commissioned, the public in Glasgow remains at risk from cryptosporidium in the water supply. To minimise this risk, Scottish Water has reduced the number of sheep grazing on the land owned by Scottish Water around Loch Katrine and all sheep owned by Scottish Water will be off the catchment by the middle of this month. It is because of this risk that continual monitoring takes place. However, cryptosporidium is ubiquitous in the environment and can be carried by wild animals as well as farm animals.</p>

  <p>Scottish Water is also constructing a pipeline to bring treated water from Balmore water treatment works into the Glasgow area. This will have the effect of reducing the size of the population exposed to the risk from cryptosporidium by about 90,000 people.</p>

  <p>The report of the Ad Hoc Group Of Ministers contains eight recommendations. They will be implemented by a number of bodies, including Scottish Water, NHS boards, the Drinking Water Quality Regulator and the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>Similarly, the various other reports can be expected to identify the bodies responsible for implementing specific recommendations. The Ad Hoc Group of Ministers concluded that where recommendations are made by an Incident or Outbreak Control Team, copies of the team&#146;s report should be sent routinely to the Scottish Executive. Mechanisms should also be introduced to ensure that such recommendations are given due consideration by the agencies to which they are directed. The Scottish Executive should be informed of action taken (or not) in response to the recommendations.</p>

  <p>There was no outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in Glasgow in August 2002. The monitoring system detected increased levels of cryptosporidium in the public water supply and precautionary advice was issued to boil the water before use. This precautionary advice may have prevented an outbreak.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-26583 by Ross Finnie on 24 June 2002, what evidence from water treatment plants throughout the United Kingdom that use the same technology as that proposed for the new water treatment plant at Milngavie can be provided on their effectiveness for cryptosporidium removal.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-09-19.72.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80155" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0919.htm#37">

  <p>The answer given to question S1W-26583 pointed out that the effectiveness of the treatment process proposed for Milngavie, like all treatment processes, was dependent on the monitoring and control regimes put in place, but that Scottish Water planned to operate the new works in accordance with industry best practice.</p>

  <p>The proposed process is similar to the process used at the Balmore water treatment works which treats Loch Lomond water successfully. The process is used widely for the treatment of upland waters typical in Scotland and other similar parts of the United Kingdom e.g. Watchgate in Manchester. The suitability of the process for Loch Katrine water, including its ability to remove cryptosporidium sized particles, has been proved in extensive and independently verified pilot plant trials.</p>
