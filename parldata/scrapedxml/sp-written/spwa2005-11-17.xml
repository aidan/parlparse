  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will consider giving local authorities the power in legislation to require owners or occupiers of land to take action to prevent seagulls from nesting, or to remove or destroy their eggs, in locations where seagulls are a significant nuisance.</p>

  <p>Local authorities already have the powers, expertise and knowledge within their environmental health responsibilities to deal with the nuisance caused by seagulls. In addition, the Scottish Executive already issues General Licences to all local authorities to enable them to take action against Great Black-backed gulls, Lesser Black-backed gulls and Herring gulls in specified circumstances and for other gull species, individual licences can be sought from the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is considering the findings and recommendations of a research project - <em>Review of Urban Gulls and their Management in Scotland</em> &ndash; completed for the Executive by BTO Scotland and the Centre for Conservation Science at the University of Stirling. My officials have met with Scotland&rsquo;s local authorities to gauge the extent of the problems posed by nesting seagulls in urban areas, and have discussed both practical solutions they can use and whether additional legal powers are required to allow new measures to be introduced.</p>

  <p>This research work is intended to provide a basis for new guidance to local authorities on best practice measures and I expect the findings to be published early in 2006.</p>

  <p>The average is affected disproportionately by a small number of waits that may be clinically appropriate. As NHS Scotland makes progress towards meeting the Executive&rsquo;s waiting time targets and treats more patients who have had longer waits, median waiting times will rise</p>

  <p>This can be demonstrated from the information in Table 1. in Q2 2002 the median wait was 18 days and 73% of patients were treated within one month of diagnosis; in Q1 2005 the median wait was 20 days and 81% of patients were treated within one month of diagnosis.</p>

  <p>(a) Diagnosis to Start of Treatment</p>

  <p>Breast Cancer</p>

  <p>Information is collated centrally to report performance against the Scottish Executive target that by October 2001, women who have breast cancer and are referred for urgent treatment will begin that treatment within one month of diagnosis, where clinically appropriate.</p>

These proposals are intended to enable the agency to recover its regulatory costs in line with the &quot;polluter pays&quot; principle.</p>

  <p>The proposed charging scheme is currently out to public consultation. The Executive will review all responses to the consultation before deciding whether to approve the proposed charges.</p>

  <p>SEPA has a duty to consider the costs and benefits of its activities, including the pursuit of enforcement against any breach of an environmental licence. In considering the appropriate enforcement action to pursue, SEPA takes account of the scale of environmental impact, the attitude and response of the person responsible and the history of the activity or site. This approach to enforcement is in line with the principles of the Cabinet Office&rsquo;s Enforcement Concordat, published in 1998.</p>

  <p>The Executive fully involved local authorities in the consultative process towards the recently published Coastal and Marine strategy for Scotland. Local authorities are represented by COSLA on the Advisory Group on the Marine and Coastal strategy which will take the strategy forward and help to determine how best to put the objectives and outcomes of the strategy into practice nationally and locally. Local authorities are also involved in the Executive&rsquo;s Sustainable Marine Initiative which is piloting new ways of managing marine and coastal activity in three locations around Scotland&rsquo;s coast.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Executive supports the Scottish Coastal Forum (SCF) which works with COSLA to find ways of improving the coastline and managing the resources sustainably. The SCF is currently assessing the views of the local authorities to find common objectives and then aims to develop guidance on delivery of Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) for local authorities, in partnership with local authority representatives. Stage one of this will be a report on a framework and hierarchy for ICZM in Scotland currently being produced by a sub group of the SCF which is due to be completed in February 2006.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Coastal Forum (SCF) has also been working with the local coastal partnerships around Scotland in order to improve the relationship between national and local levels in Integrated Coastal Zone Management. The Chairman of the Solway Firth Partnership represents the local partnerships on the SCF, and the SCF project officer attends regular meetings with all local coastal partnerships to provide information and guidance.</p>

  <p>Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) manage, on behalf of the Executive, over 250 coastal sites aimed at environmental and species protection in partnership with local organisations and authorities.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it accepts the statement by Dr Steven Gaines, Director or University of California&rsquo;s Santa Barbara&rsquo;s Marine Science Institute that &quot;there are virtually no exceptions to the fact that all (no-take zones) have the exact same result: Where the average abundance (of marine species) goes up, the average size goes up, and the numbers of species goes up&quot; and that fishermen would benefit from the spill over of species into unprotected areas and what the reasons are for its position on the matter.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-11-17.26.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80032" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa1117.htm#11">

  <p>The success of no-take zones (NTZs) is critically dependent on the mobility of the species that live within the zone and how fishing effort is displaced from the zone. Where species remain in the NTZ for most of their lives and fishing effort is removed from it, then there are usually benefits of the kind described by Dr Gaines. Typically such NTZs are successful in tropical reef systems where organisms are site specific. Where species are highly mobile and migrate freely through the zone, NTZs offer little or no protection. This is a common occurrence in temperate systems typical in Scottish waters and applies to most of our principal commercial fish species. Furthermore, where fishing effort is displaced from a NTZ, fishing activity may be aggregated on the margins of the zone and can actually cause additional damage through excess concentration of effort that may outweigh the benefits within the NTZ.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has indicated in its Sustainable Framework for Scottish Sea Fisheries that it believes there is a place for area based closures and restrictions in the management of fisheries. Such closures and restrictions will need to take into account the biology of the fish they are intended to protect and the activity of fishing vessels affected.</p>

  <p>Whilst on rare occasions avian influenza can pass to humans it requires very close contact with infected birds. As such the use of licensed landfill is unlikely to pose a risk to the public but the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the local consultant public health medicine will be involved in any decision to use individual landfill sites.

  <p>The Scottish Avian Influenza Contingency Plan sets out the measures we will take into any confirmed outbreak of Avian Influenza in Scotland. The response will eradicate the disease as quickly as possible, minimising its impact and through this supporting the continuing sustainability of the Scottish poultry industry.</p>

  <p>The Executive is deeply concerned by the high levels of heart disease and other long-term conditions in areas of deprivation. We have set a target to reduce premature mortality from chronic heart disease by 27% over the next five years in the most deprived communities.</p>

  <p>Our recent document, <em>Delivering for Health</em>, sets out our plans to develop anticipatory care. This will ensure that people at greatest risk of ill health are actively identified and offered opportunities for early detection, advice and treatment. Strengthening primary care services in these communities can reduce premature mortality through preventative medicine, changing the focus to &quot;anticipate and prevent&quot;.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is taking action on a number of fronts.</p>

  <p>The Chief Medical Officer will issue guidance to older people to keep warm, use the winter fuel payment to ensure their homes are adequately heated and to wear sufficient warm clothing when they go outside. He will also remind neighbours, relatives and carers to check up regularly on older people during cold weather.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive supports an annual influenza vaccination campaign to vaccinate those aged 65 and over and those in risk groups under 65. This campaign includes a central information letter which is sent to all those aged 65 and over across Scotland reminding them that they are eligible for free flu immunisation.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Executive&rsquo;s central heating and Warm Deal programmes provide free central heating for pensioners who have none or whose system is irretrievably broken; to those over 80 whose systems are partial or inefficient, and insulation measures for all pensioners. The central heating programme also provides energy efficiency advice on keeping warm and keeping bills down, and the offer of a benefits health check to ensure that people are claiming all the benefits to which they are entitled.</p>

  <p>Enhanced External Counter Pulsation Therapy (EECP) is not currently available in Scotland. It is for NHS boards to decide whether to offer the procedure.</p>

  <p>The Interventional Procedures Programme of National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) is currently considering EECP and will issue a consultation document shortly about its safety and efficacy. Their final report is expected in spring 2006. This will not require NHS boards to introduce EECP, but will specify the appropriate level of service and safety if they do choose to provide it.</p>

  <p>The Ministerial Healthcare Associated Infection (HAI) Task Force is nearing completion of a three-year programme of work to improve prevention and control of HAI (of which MRSA is an important element). It is a multi-disciplinary group including several representatives from key areas in health (e.g. NHS boards, clinical staff, infection control experts, cleaning staff) and lay members. NHS boards have confirmed that alcohol handrub was made available at every frontline bed by April 2005. I launched a tool to monitor compliance with cleaning standards on 14 November. Guidelines for prudent prescribing of antibiotics were launched in September 2005, and arrangements for monitoring the effectiveness of this guidance will be overseen by the Antimicrobial resistance strategy working group.</p>

  <p>The HAI Task Force is embarking on a new programme of work focusing on implementation and delivery which will involve extensive and continuing discussions with NHS boards.</p>

  <p>Earlier this year, NHS boards&rsquo; performance on tackling HAIs was discussed at the Annual Accountability Reviews, which I chaired. Each board provided an update on HAI issues, including discussions on their compliance with infection control standards, their infection control programme for 2005, infection control training and the monitoring of health care cleanliness.</p>

  <p>The overall measure of effectiveness in MRSA control is the quarterly report on mandatory surveillance of MRSA blood infections. These rates show that MRSA rates have now stabilised. We will continue to work with NHS boards to drive these rates down.</p>

  <p>Lord Fraser of Carmyllie has publicly criticised the reporting of his views of the Lockerbie trial and in particular the evidence of Tony Gauci whom the trial court, having heard all the evidence in the trial, found to be credible and reliable. He has made it clear that he has no concerns about the credibility of Tony Gauci or the basis on which Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi was convicted of the murder of 270 people in the Lockerbie bombing.</p>

  <p>The Executive now needs to consider the practicalities surrounding their recommendations - including issues of legislative competence - before determining the next steps.</p>

  <p>PFI is an additional source of funding which contributes substantially to capital investment in NHSScotland. It makes more of resources available, giving immediate access to significant sums and delivering new services more quickly than would be possible with a publicly funded capital programme alone.</p>

  <p>Improved value for money is achieved by risk allocation, competition and innovation and the inclusion in some cases of services such as portering and cleaning allows the NHS body to focus on its core business of providing health care. A high standard of building maintenance throughout the life of the contract ensures that the facilities are handed on to the NHS in an excellent condition.</p>

  <p>My department has commissioned research into the urban design aspects of new residential streets, and into the associated process of road construction consent. The objective is to demonstrate that new residential areas can be designed with the needs of people uppermost and with reduced car dominance. The results of the research are twofold: a Planning Advice Note 76 New Residential Streets was published on 7 November, and the report of the research on Road Construction Consent was published on the Scottish Executive website on the same day. My officials conducted three presentations to stakeholders round Scotland in October, and are opening a debate on the way forward with local authority Heads of Planning and Chief Officers of Transportation.</p>

  <p>A leaflet entitled <em>Do you know what&rsquo;s happening to school lunches?</em> , was produced by the Executive and distributed to all primary pupils in September 2004, and to pupils starting primary school in September 2005. The leaflet sets out the improvements to the quality of food and the dining environment which parents can expect as a result of Hungry for Success. It also includes guidance on free school meal eligibility to ensure that all eligible families are aware of the free school meal scheme and have the information they need to register. Copies of the leaflet are available on the Executive&rsquo;s website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Education/School-Education/18922/19348" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Education/School-Education/18922/19348</a></p>

  <p>In August 2002, the Executive commissioned qualitative research to gather the views of primary and secondary pupils on various aspects of school meals, to support the work of the Expert Panel on School Meals. The study was carried out by NFO Social Research. The research found that:</p>

  <p>&quot;In schools where anonymity of free school meals was ensured, there was little evidence to suggest that the reasons for not taking school meals differed between those who are entitled to free school meals and those who have to pay for their meal. Issues such as choice and quality of food and the dining environment were important to all pupils, irrespectively of free school meal entitlement. Indeed, such issues may be more salient for those who are entitled to free school meals, given their more limited scope for opting for alternative provision.&quot;</p>

  <p>Hungry for Success requires local authorities to take action to improve uptake, for example by improving the choice and quality of food, promoting healthy eating in the classroom and dining room, reducing the amount of time spent queuing and making the dining environment attractive. In addition, schools and local authorities must minimise any stigma associated with receipt of free school meals, by implementing systems to maximise anonymity.</p>
