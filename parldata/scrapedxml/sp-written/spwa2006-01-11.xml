  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many specialist prostate cancer nurses there have been in each NHS board in each year since 1999 and whether it has any plans to increase the numbers of such nurses.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-01-11.S2W-21650.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80057" speakername="Mr Andy Kerr" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0111.htm#1">

  <p>Latest statistics as at 30 September 2004 suggest that NHSScotland does not employ specialist prostate cancer nurses. However, other clinical nurse specialists may provide a service in this area as part of their current role, e.g. urological nurse specialists and urology/oncology cancer nurse specialists.</p>

  <p>Staffing numbers across a range of professional groups will be forecast by NHS boards and regions as they develop and submit their workforce plans in 2006, taking into consideration a range of drivers affecting future demand such as<em> Delivering for Health</em>.</p>

  <p>Information on staff in post - including clinical nurse specialists - in NHS Scotland is published on the Scottish Health Statistics website under Workforce Statistics, at <a href="http://www.isdscotland.org/workforce" target="_blank">www.isdscotland.org/workforce</a>.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will instigate an income maximisation campaign for carers to increase benefit uptake and, if so, what steps it will take to introduce such a campaign.</p>

  <p>The UK Government, through the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), is responsible for social security benefits and for campaigns to maximise their uptake. The Care 21 Report <em>The future of unpaid care in Scotland</em> calls, amongst other things, for a review of the benefit entitlements available to carers, and I have made DWP Ministers aware of this.</p>

  <p>Under our Carers&rsquo; Strategy we are working with stakeholders to improve carer access to information and advice on sources of support, including financial assistance. An important strand here is the duties placed on local authorities and NHSScotland by the Community Care and Health (Scotland) Act 2002. The Care 21 report recognises that many of the necessary policy mechanisms are already in place, but that systematic implementation needs to happen Scotland-wide. We will be considering these matters further in our response to the report.</p>

  <p>The Centre for Confidence and Well-Being is an independent not for profit organisation which aims to improve confidence and well-being in the general population in Scotland.</p>

  <p>In 2005-06 the Scottish Executive provided funding to the Centre for Confidence and Well-Being: &pound;60,000 to support the delivery of action research training on confidence-focused interventions, and &pound;52,000 to support the delivery of at least 10 one-day targeted networking events for key public sector workers. In addition to this, &pound;30,000 has been offered to the Centre for Confidence and Well-Being to support its involvement in the Schools of Ambition project with school pupils. As with all projects that the Scottish Executive funds, delivery and effectiveness of the projects are monitored through the submission of six monthly progress reports.</p>

  <p>As I indicated in the answer to question S2W-21026 on 8 December 2005, there were no reports, outcomes or action points made of the discussions at the conference. The day aimed to strengthen communications and relationships across public and independent sector boundaries and to create a platform for opportunities for innovative solutions for the future.</p>

  <p>The influence of motor transport on air quality in any particular place depends on local circumstances and it is not possible to generalise concerning the relative contribution of different types of roads. Each local authority in Scotland is required to review and assess air quality in its area based on monitoring and modelling. Through this process, it is possible to identify where local circumstances, traffic related or otherwise, contribute to an air quality problem and act to address these.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-21279 by Mr Andy Kerr on 12 December 2005, what the certain circumstances are in which a number of traffic-derived air pollutants have the potential to adversely affect human respiratory health.</p>

  <p>Local authorities review and assess air quality in their area against objectives for a number of pollutants contained in the Air Quality Strategy. Where this shows the objectives are being exceeded, or are likely to be exceeded, the local authority has to declare an Air Quality Management Area and establish an action plan to deal with the problem. The circumstances leading to a need to declare vary, but experience to date has shown that traffic emissions are the main source of local air quality hotspots.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what capital provision for equipment was (a) allocated and (b) spent in each NHS board area in each year from 2000-01 to 2004-05 inclusive, expressed in real terms.</p>

  <p>Specific capital allocations for medical equipment were not given for the years requested. Prior to 2002, NHS trusts had to bid for capital funding which was held centrally. 2002-03 saw a major change in the methodology for allocating the Health Department&rsquo;s capital budget with the majority of the available budget allocated on the basis of the Arbuthnott formula adjusted for cross boundary patient flows and weighted for the provision of regional specialities. This means that NHS boards can prioritise their investment requirements within defined resources, including those on equipment, based on their local knowledge or the local needs of the local area how this money should be spent.</p>

  <p>Following the publication of the Audit Scotland report <em>Better Equipped to Care? &ndash; Follow Up Report</em> on 26 February 2004 the Executive announced an additional &pound;125 million over three years to support investment in new and replacement medical equipment.</p>

  <p>Specific data on medical equipment expenditure is not collected separately but is included within the general equipment categories as per NHSScotland Accounting Manual guidance. For expenditure on capital equipment (in real terms), for the years stated I refer the member to the answer to question S2W-16390 on 26 May 2005.
