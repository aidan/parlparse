  <p>We are committed to sharing the UK Government&rsquo;s long-term target to eradicate child poverty by 2020 and will continue to do all that we can to ensure that Scottish policies and programmes make the maximum contribution towards the milestone of halving child poverty by 2010.</p>

  <p>We are currently reviewing existing policy commitments in this area and will make clear what our priorities are in the coming months.

  <p>We will continue to take forward the implementation of <em>Workforce Plus</em> and <em>More Choices, More Chances</em> to get more people into sustainable employment and more of our young people into employment, education or training. In addition, we have already announced a number of additional measures which will enhance our efforts to tackle child poverty. These include trialling approaches to extend free school meals for P1 to P3 pupils in selected schools, a new skills strategy by the end of the summer, development of a new early years strategy to ensure that all children have the best start in life and the establishment of a Ministerial Task Force on Health Inequalities to tackle the most significant inequalities in the health of the people of Scotland.</p>

  <p>During the course of the Housing Debate on 21 June 2007 I spoke about the need to deliver our housing and regeneration commitments through a simpler public sector landscape. It is important that decisions about changing the way Communities Scotland&rsquo;s functions are delivered are taken on an informed basis. I am currently in discussions with officials about the role and functions of Communities Scotland and hope to reach firm conclusions in the next few months.</p>

  <p>In 2001 the government set up the languages fund to support language learning and teaching in both primary and secondary schools, and in particular to support the implementation of the recommendations made in the report <em>Citizens of a Multilingual World. </em> It is for education authorities to decide the extent to which this is directed to primary or secondary schools and we do not ask them to report on the amounts allocated to each sector.</p>

  <p>In January 1993, ministers announced that all Scottish primary schools should offer teaching in a modern European language. To facilitate this, a national Modern Languages in the Primary School (MLPS) training programme was set up to train primary languages teachers. Between 1993 and 2001 over &pound;23 million was provided for MLPS training.</p>

  <p>Following the publication of the report <em>Citizens of a Multilingual World in 2000</em> and the Executive&rsquo;s response to this in 2001, MLPS funding was replaced by a general languages fund, which could be used by authorities to support language learning and teaching in primary as well as secondary schools. Details on this funding stream are provided in the response to the answer to question S3W-1009 on 26 June 2007.

  <p>In relation to any former employee now working in a care setting or school, we would expect employers to have carried out rigorous recruitment checks and to have firm child protection policies and procedures in place. This is a requirement in the relevant National Care Standards published by the Scottish Government. The Care Commission is required to take these Standards into account when it inspects care services. Safer recruitment requirements are also set out in both the <em>Code of Practice for Employers of Social Service Workers (Scottish Social Services Council)</em> . In, addition the recent guidance published by the Scottish Executive, <em>Safer Recruitment Through Better Recruitment</em> reinforces and underpins these requirements.</p>

  <p>In any case where there may be a report to the Procurator Fiscal, it is a matter for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service to decide whether or not there are criminal proceedings.</p>

  <p>Glasgow City Council has referred individuals to the Disqualified from Working with Children List (DWCL). I met the Director of Social Work Services on 21 June 2007 to discuss the council&rsquo;s report on the Kerelaw investigation, including the number of former employees covered by the report.</p>

  <p>Anyone who is provisionally listed on DWCL is not barred from working in a child care position. All known employers are notified of provisional listing; employers can undertake a risk-assessment to decide on what action is appropriate; the period of provisional listing is kept as brief as possible, and provisional listing shows up on a disclosure check.</p>

  <p>As part of the actions responding to the council&rsquo;s review of its management of Kerelaw, I will be meeting with residential providers to identify what further improvements may be needed to protect children from abuse in residential care.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>An initial proposal was received in January 2006, further information was sought by Communities Scotland and that was received by May 2006. As the proposal potentially had implications for other local authority areas consideration had to be given to whether a national approach was required. That consideration concluded that the Shetland proposal could in fact be considered on its own merits and that assessment is currently underway.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S2W-32268 on 16 March 2007, which stated that Glasgow Housing Association (GHA) is expected to seek and act on its own legal advice in relation to specific issues. I understand that GHA has done that in relation to the period of time it can allow owners to repay costs without jeopardising its charitable status.

  <p>Following a meeting on 15 June 2007 of the West of Scotland Transport Leads, group discussions are beginning with Glasgow Community Transport, SPT and the west of Scotland NHS boards on how to create improved community transport in Ayrshire specifically focused on improving access to health care. These discussions are at a very early stage. There are no details at the moment on what may be possible from such a community transport initiative, as a full business case would have to be developed with Glasgow Community Transport, SPT and local Ayrshire community transport groups.</p>

  <p>The creation of the extended Stagecoach route 24 would directly benefit residents travelling from South Carrick as it would reduce the number of bus changes required for residents from these areas to access the main Ayrshire general hospitals i.e. Ayr and Crosshouse Hospital. This will result in reduced travel time and cost for passengers.</p>

  <p>One of the principles of <em>Hungry for Success</em> , the report of the Expert Panel on School Meals published in 2002, was eliminating stigma. A key recommendation within the report was that schools should explore processes to protect the anonymity of those in receipt of free school meals. The Scottish Executive has supported Local Authorities and schools in taking this forward through the funding provided for <em>Hungry for Success</em> , &pound;120 million up to 2008, and by sharing good practice. Progress has been made, but a new duty under the Schools (Health Promotion and Nutrition) Scotland Act 2007 will require all local authorities to ensure that anonymised systems will be in place in all of their schools. This new duty is intended to commence in August 2008.</p>
