  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what progress has been made in Brussels with regard to the State Aid Map submitted to the European Commission by the Department of Trade and Industry on behalf of the Scottish Executive; whether this map has been regarded as not meeting European Union criteria; whether the map is likely to be approved by 31 December and, if it is not, what the implications for Scotland would be.</p>

  <p>Discussions continue with the European Commission on the proposed new Assisted Areas Map submitted by the UK Government in July. The Commission has made no formal statement on these proposals. It has not proved possible to have a new map agreed before the end of December. In common with most other member states, for a period from 1 January there will be no approved regional aid schemes in the UK.</p>

  <p>In consequence, until a new map is agreed, it will not be possible to make new awards of Regional Selective Assistance or under other schemes dependent on the Commission&#8217;s regional aid derogations. Payments of financial assistance may continue where aid has been offered under the arrangements in place before the end of December.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive will be prepared to consider new applications and assess them against the range of provisions of the previous RSA scheme. Such applicants will, however, have to accept there can be no guarantee of any sort on their eligibility for such assistance until the new Assisted Area map is finally agreed.</p>

  <p>Ministers and officials of the Scottish Executive are in close touch with the progress of the UK Government&#8217;s exchanges with the Commission on a new Assisted Areas Map. All concerned are committed to seeking an early resolution and acceptance for an effective new state aid map for the period to end-2006.</p>

  <p>It is the responsibility of health boards to assess local needs for patients with hepatitis C, and arrange provision of appropriate treatment and care services. Last year, the Scottish Office commissioned the Scottish Needs Assessment Programme to establish a working group to consider all aspects of hepatitis C including epidemiology, prevention, investigations, and treatment, and to estimate future implications for the Scottish population and for service needs. This working group is expected to report early in 2000.</p>

  <p>There are no plans at present to introduce national guidelines. It is for health boards to assess the local needs for patients with hepatitis C, and many health boards have developed local treatment guidelines and protocols.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Health Purchasing Information Centre (SHPIC) published a report on hepatitis C in September 1998. This report was updated to include recommendations on the use of combination treatment with Interferon Alfa and Ribavirin and disseminated to the NHS in Scotland in February 1999. The working group set up under The Scottish Needs Assessment Programme will be further considering Interferon Alfa and Ribavirin treatment. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence in England is also to consider the issue of antiviral combination treatment for hepatitis C early in 2000. The conclusions of these bodies will help to inform decisions about the provision of this treatment within the NHS in Scotland. <br /></p>
