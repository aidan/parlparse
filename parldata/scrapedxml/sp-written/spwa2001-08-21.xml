  <p>The First Minister&#8217;s remarks on children in poverty referred to the change in the estimated number of children living in low income households between 1996-97 and 1998-99, a more detailed explanation of which was given in answer to question S1W-13002. The drop of one percentage point referred to in the question relates to the percentage point difference in the proportion of children in low income households in Scotland between 1997-98 and the latest 1999-2000 figures. The Households below average income survey results demonstrate steady progress in reducing the proportion of children living in low income households.</p>

  <p>As stated in the Scottish Climate Change Programme, the absence of Scottish emissions data, both historical and projected, and the complexities involved in monitoring the effects of both reserved and devolved policies means that Scottish reduction targets are not currently practical. The Executive is working with the UK Government to improve and expand on available Scottish data and, once a robust set of data is available, we will consider whether a Scottish target would be an appropriate response measure.</p>

  <p>We are committed to placing the environment and climate change at the heart of policy-making across the Executive. In recognition of this, the policies in the Scottish Climate Change Programme (SCCP) cut across a number of different areas and, whilst the main driver may not necessarily be climate change, they will deliver greenhouse gas emissions reductions. The SCCP, available on the Executive&#8217;s website at www.scotland.gov.uk/library3/environment/ccm.pdf, includes detail of planned and actual expenditure in a number of these policy areas. For example, we have allocated &#163;2.14 million for each of the three years 2001-02 to 2003-04 for the activities of the Energy Saving Trust to stimulate energy efficiency savings, a core part of the SCCP. That expenditure will, however, bring social and economic benefits as well as reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

  <p>For the Forestry Commission&#8217;s own forests, Forest Enterprise has agreed management plans with Historic Scotland for all scheduled ancient monuments on the Commission&#8217;s land. Each plan contains a programme for positive management, including regular monitoring and controlling regeneration as appropriate. For privately owned forests, the Forestry Commission will only approve management plans if they contain satisfactory proposals for safeguarding any scheduled ancient monuments covered by the plan.</p>

  <p>A number of areas of current work cover aspects of GP workload. They are as follows:</p>

  <p><ul>
<li>The National Primary Care Research and Development Centre 
                  in Manchester is currently undertaking a survey which covers 
                  GP workload and which will have the ability to compare the position 
                  in Scotland with the rest of the UK</li>
<li>The Remote And Rural Areas Resource Initiative (RARARI) is 
                  currently looking at recruitment and retention in remote and 
                  rural areas</li>
<li>An initiative looking at reducing bureaucracy has identified 
                  a number of areas where workload and bureaucracy can be reduced 
                  and we are currently taking these forward with the Scottish 
                  General Practitioners Committee of the BMA</li>
<li>Continuous Morbidity Recording (CMR) is an on-going information 
                  system which feeds back regular data on workload issues such 
                  as face to face clinical contacts between GPs and patients.</li>

  <p>The information requested is shown in the following table, which should be read in conjunction with the notes below. In particular, the figures do not reflect directly the availability of dermatology services, because in many instances doctors employed in one health board area also provide service in another. It should also be noted that at March 2001 the number of posts for Specialist Registrars currently training for a Certificate of Completion of Specialist Training (CCST) in dermatology was increased from 14 to 17, a rise of 21% in the last year. Further information on the current Specialist Registrar establishment is contained in NHS HDL(2001) 63, which was published on 30 July 2001. A copy of this is available in the Parliament&#8217;s reference centre (Bib. no. 15193).</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is in regular contact with the Ministry of Defence (MOD) on a wide range of issues. This includes the Interim Storage of Laid-up Submarines study, but such discussions have not included potential land storage sites. I understand that the MOD expects to invite industry to bring forward land storage proposals early next year. Only then would possible sites emerge.</p>

  <p>Discussions between the MOD and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and other Government Departments are matters for those bodies.</p>

  <p><i>Making it work together - A programme for government</i> , published in September 1999, stated that we would establish the framework for a national transport timetable system by end 1999, and implement it by end 2000. Traveline (Scotland) became operational on 3 January 2001. This national public transport information system provides route and timetable information for bus, coach, underground, train, ferry and Scottish internal air services through a single national-rate call.</p>

  <p>Transport operators and local authorities have worked in partnership to deliver Traveline (Scotland), with the support of the Scottish Executive. Traveline will form part of the GB Transport Direct initiative, to which we are committed. Transport Direct will be a phone and internet system to allow people to plan their journeys, to compare routes and prices and to purchase tickets.</p>

The Glasgow north/south Crossrail scheme is the responsibility of Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive, and it is up to it to take matters forward and bid for funds.

  <p>The budget provision shown against the Scottish Renewables Obligation (SRO) is to cover the Fossil Fuel Levy in Scotland, which is set by the energy regulator each year to cover the cost of renewable energy projects operating under the SRO. The levy in the current year is 1.2% and is expected to rise to 2.1% over the next three years as more SRO projects are built and their costs fall to be met by the levy. That is why the provision shown in the budget rises over the next three years.</p>

  <p>However, this is not a cash provision, as the Fossil Fuel Levy is levied on all electricity suppliers by the energy regulator Ofgem, and used to offset the above market cost of renewable energy projects under the SRO. There is no Government cash expenditure involved.</p>

  <p>Responses to our initial consultation on the Renewables Obligation (Scotland), or ROS, raised concerns about the future of Scotland&#8217;s existing large hydro stations.</p>

  <p>We have accepted that additional support was required and have successfully argued that case with colleagues in the UK Government. I was therefore able to announce recently that we will extend support under ROS to refurbished hydro stations up to 20 megawatts in size, and also to support the building of new hydro stations of any size, subject to their obtaining the necessary consents. This additional support will secure continuation of the refurbishment of Scotland&#8217;s existing large hydro stations, and represents good news for the engineering jobs dependent on that refurbishment work.</p>

  <p>Our final statutory consultation on the ROS was published on 3 August, and is available in the Parliament&#8217;s reference centre.</p>

It may differ from any figure which the local authority would provide now, because it does not take account of any subsequent changes or corrections that the local authority may have made to the statistical information, for use at local level, about the location of each accident, based upon its knowledge of the road and area concerned.</p>

  <p>&#163;2.5 million was allocated between local authorities as part of the agreed local authority settlement in 2000-01, for planning and preparation for implementation of the National Waste Strategy. In 2001-02, this amount was included within the waste management grant-aided expenditure figure, although it is for authorities to determine their actual level of expenditure.</p>

  <p>Additional grant-in-aid has also been announced for the Scottish Environment Protection Agency to take account of the duties that will fall to it in fulfilling the Executive&#8217;s Programme for Government commitments. This includes the implementation of the National Waste Strategy and assistance with the preparation of the Area Waste Plans.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive was involved with instigating the REMADE Scotland project which aims to encourage markets for recycled materials and has contributed &#163;50,000 support each year since its inception in 1999. In addition, the Executive has agreed to contribute &#163;2.1 million over three years towards the national Waste and Resources Action Plan set up to help overcome barriers to recycling. Both of these projects will be addressing problems of recycling several types of material, including paper.</p>

  <p>The <i>National Waste Strategy: Scotland</i> was published by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and adopted by the Scottish Executive in December 1999. The strategy sets out the framework to make waste management in Scotland more sustainable and to meet targets for reducing the reliance on landfill for waste disposal. Implementation of the strategy is now being taken forward.</p>

  <p>The Executive has introduced several initiatives to help take forward implementation of the strategy and thereby to make waste management more sustainable. These include:</p>

  <p>making an additional &#163;3 million available as a specific grant in 2000-01 for local authorities to increase recycling and composting;</p>

  <p>making &#163;50.4 million available through the Strategic Waste Fund for local authorities to begin implementation of the Area Waste Plans - which are currently being prepared, and</p>

  <p>support for the REMADE Scotland and Waste and Resource Action Programmes which aim to develop markets for recyclable materials and break down barriers to recycling.</p>

  <p>Environmental and safety regulation of specific sites are matters for the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the Health and Safety Executive. The Scottish Executive recognises the continuing public concerns over the possible health effects of emissions from incinerators, particularly dioxins and heavy metals. To address these concerns, a number of recent epidemiological studies have investigated the incidence of various diseases in populations likely to be affected by these emissions. However, no convincing evidence of any such link has been established. The University of Dundee is currently carrying out a further epidemiological study and I await the findings of this.</p>
