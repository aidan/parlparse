  <p>Such an understanding of future assessment is incorrect. Through Curriculum for Excellence, for the first time since devolution, all teachers will have responsibility for improving the literacy and numeracy of all children. Literacy and numeracy will be developed to agreed national standards at all stages from early to senior. For the first time, there will be new qualifications in literacy and numeracy from S3 onwards to accredit the skills developed through Curriculum for Excellence.</p>

  <p>Each child and young person will be formally assessed throughout all stages, from early years to senior and secondary education. Learning will be assessed against the standards and expectations set out in the curriculum guidance and in line with the strategic vision for assessment, published on 23 September this year. Children and young people will be assessed through a wide range of tasks and activities, including dialogue and interactions with peers, as well as through written, oral and practical activities and tasks, including tests and examinations, including from S3 onwards the literacy and numeracy qualifications. The framework for assessment, and the quality assurance and moderation model, to be published in due course, will provide more detailed guidance on assessment in Curriculum for Excellence.</p>

  <p>Such an understanding of future assessment is incorrect. The standards and expectations within the curriculum guidance provide a common basis of understanding across sectors. One of the key aims of Curriculum for Excellence is to ensure well-planned and effective transition between all stages of the 3-18 curriculum.</p>

  <p>At particular points &ndash; especially points of transition &ndash; teachers will work with children and young people to provide clear information about each child&rsquo;s or young person&rsquo;s progress and achievements, including in literacy and numeracy. The new national system of quality assurance and moderation will ensure that there is confidence in assessment judgements and that the information is valid and reliable.</p>

  <p>Parents will also get regular information at all stages about their children&rsquo;s progress in achieving Curriculum for Excellence levels in key areas of learning, such as literacy and numeracy. In addition to individual reports on the progress of their child, parents will receive information on how well learners and particular groups of learners are achieving in relation to expected levels at particular stages, as well as how the school is applying national standards and expectations.</p>

  <p>As part of this improvement programme, on 1 December a new data capture system will be introduced across the 21 local PACE teams. This will combine information on redundancies of 20 or more from the HR1 system with information on smaller scale redundancies based on local intelligence collected by local PACE teams.

  <p>The actions in the Better Heart Disease and Stroke Care Action Plan are framed in a way that should make them cost neutral or susceptible to implementation in the longer term. Many of them relate to ensuring that existing good practice, standards and guidelines are implemented consistently across Scotland.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether capacity to provide adult respiratory extracorporeal membrane oxygenation treatment at the Leicester centre has now been doubled and, if so, when was this achieved.</p>

  <p>Prior to the H1N1 pandemic, Glenfield Hospital had the capacity to provide respiratory ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) to a maximum of five patients, both adult and paediatric. In line with recommendations made by the UK Critical Care Capacity (UKCCG) sub-group on H1N1 in September 2009, capacity for adult respiratory ECMO at Leicester was increased to eight beds.</p>

  <p>This was achieved by re-directing paediatric ECMO patients to centres commissioned to participate in the UK&rsquo;s paediatric ECMO network; by reducing cardiac elective capacity; by maximising the rotas of existing trained staff and by ensuring all post-ECMO patients were transferred out to referring units as soon as possible. Additional accredited surge capacity has also been commissioned temporarily at the Royal Brompton and Papworth Hospitals. There are now 12 beds in the UK for adult respiratory ECMO, which represents more than a doubling in capacity.</p>

  <p>As the UK&rsquo;s designated centre for adult respiratory ECMO, Leicester is and remains the gateway and first option for access to this treatment. The UK CCG, which reconvened to assess the current provision of ECMO at this stage of the pandemic, recommended on 11 November that Glenfield will maintain its capacity at the current level of eight active ECMO beds in order that this central role can be maintained.</p>

  <p>Information on the number of people registered with a local authority or housing association as looking for a home is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does however collect information on the number of applications there are on local authorities&rsquo; housing registers. This information is published at local authority (LA) level on the Housing Statistics for Scotland website:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/Browse/Housing-Regeneration/HSfS/StockManagement" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/Browse/Housing-Regeneration/HSfS/StockManagement</a>.</p>

  <p>As the information is collected at aggregate LA level from the individual local authorities it is not possible to break it down by parliamentary constituency area.</p>

  <p>These figures show that at March 2009, there were almost 200,000 applications recorded for Scottish local authority owned housing. It is important to note that this will include a significant and unquantified level of double counting as people looking for a home can record an application with a number of local authorities and will appear on multiple lists.</p>

  <p>At March 2009, there were also around 244,000 applicants registered on registered social landlord (RSL) waiting lists. This data is collected by the Scottish Housing Regulator (SHR) and is only available broken down by RSL.</p>

  <p>Note that neither the RSL nor LA lists show the number of people waiting for social rented accommodation, but the number of applications. There is potentially a large, unquantified level of duplication within and between the lists. It is also possible that some people on RSL and LA waiting lists have already secured social rented accommodation but have not informed the other RSL&rsquo;s and LA&rsquo;s, so continue to be counted on the other lists for a period of time.</p>

  <p>At present this information is not collected or held centrally.</p>

  <p>However, through our Keeping Childbirth Natural and Dynamic (KCND) programme, we are working in partnership with all NHS boards to offer women early, seamless access to maternity services through attending a midwife as their first professional contact in pregnancy. We have also recently introduced pathways for maternity care, which facilitate robust risk assessment in early pregnancy and timely intervention for women and families. These pathways outline the usual schedule of antenatal visits for healthy women who are first-time and previous mothers across NHS Scotland. Also, through evaluation of KCND we will be collecting data on the number of antenatal visits for all women within every NHS board.</p>

  <p>Our national maternity policy, <em>A Framework for Maternity Services in Scotland, </em> outlines our commitment to offering women choice in relation to place of birth. Principles 10 and 11 of this framework make specific reference to our expectations that services offer one-to-one care in established labour and support women&rsquo;s right to choice around birth options. We expect all NHS boards to plan maternity services to meet the needs of their local population and ensure that care is in line with evidence around best practice guidance and our national pathways. There are currently 22 community maternity units and 18 consultant-led units across NHS Scotland. In addition, many of our consultant-led units have alongside midwife-led birthing facilities and all NHS boards offer women the option of home birth.</p>

  <p>Our Nursing and Midwifery Workload and Workforce Planning Programme collected data across Scotland between June 2007 and August 2008, using &quot;Birthrate Plus&quot; and &quot;Professional Judgement&quot;. Although limitations were noted in the tools, this data collection demonstrated a good relationship between current budget whole-time equivalents of midwives and the output of the tools. This data is being used by NHS boards to inform local workforce planning and one of our key aims is to ensure that provision of one-to-one care in established labour.</p>

  <p>This government has honoured the previous administration&rsquo;s commitments to the school building programme since May 2007, to ensure that pupils, staff and communities continued to benefit and indeed provided additional resources to meet the financial shortfall for PPP projects inherited. Ministerial visits to any of these schools is entirely consistent with that approach. In addition, we have announced the new &pound;1.25 billion school building programme which will lift 35,000 more pupils out of poor condition schools.</p>
