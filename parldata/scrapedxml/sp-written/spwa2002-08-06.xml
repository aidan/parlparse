  <p>Scottish Enterprise commissioned the <i>Direct Air Services Action Plan</i> at a cost of &#163;50,000. The plan, which was completed in January 2000, was developed to analyse the viability of, and identify opportunities for, new routes to/from Scotland. The information was made available to airlines and airport operators. It is for the Executive&rsquo;s agencies (Scottish Enterprise and VisitScotland) to decide how best any available funding can be deployed for the greatest benefit of the Scottish economy and tourism.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what is being done to address the doubling of the incidence of testicular cancer in the last 20 years.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-08-06.S1W-27451.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80140" speakername="Malcolm Chisholm" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0806.htm#3">

  <p>Testicular cancer is one of the most curable of cancers, even if it is at an advanced stage at diagnosis, and effective platinum-based chemotherapy has been widely available for nearly 20 years. Although cancer of the testis was one of the most common forms of malignancy in men aged 15-34 between 1989 and 1998, it accounted for less than 2% of all male cancers.</p>

  <p>Due to improvements in treatment, with dose intensification and the development of new drugs, the outlook should improve for the small proportion of patients with poor prognostic disease, although this will not have a huge effect overall on this disease as the results are already very good.</p>

  <p>Therefore, although the incidence is rising in most countries in the western world (there are many theories &ndash; trauma, vasectomy, infective causes such as mumps, more fat in diet, more oestrogens in agricultural residues) the death rate is low and falling.</p>

  <p>The projected trends for testicular cancer suggest a continued increase in incidence to a level over 10 per 100,000 by 2010, with a small decrease in mortality.</p>

The total spent on the maintenance and refurbishment of Jedburgh Sheriff Court in each of the last five years is set out in the following table. The expenditure in 2001-02 included a general redecoration of the court and provision of a new fire detection system.</p>

  <p>The consultation exercise by the Scottish Court Service on the alternative proposals for the delivery of court business in Peebles will provide an opportunity for any additional costs or savings to be identified. At present, while it is recognised that there may be a small increase in some costs due to the increased travel, for example for witness expenses, it is not anticipated that there will be significant additional costs to the public purse given the low level of business currently undertaken at Peebles.</p>

  <p>Should any additional costs be identified these would have to be weighed against the potential savings to the Scottish Court Service and the substantial cost required to upgrade the court.</p>

  <p>Ministers have no powers to direct that private solicitors undertake legal aid work; this is a commercial decision by solicitors. I understand that a legal aid practitioner in Peebles, which undertook 15 cases in 2000-01, has decided not to undertake new civil legal aid cases. There are, however, two firms of solicitors who provide civil legal aid in Galashiels and a further two firms in Selkirk.</p>

  <p>The provision of legal advice and representation in rural areas is a priority area for pilot work as part of the Review of Legal Information and Advice Provision in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Figures are held only for the public space closed circuit television (CCTV) projects funded through the &lsquo;Make Our Communities Safer&rsquo; Challenge Competition. Grant is conditional on the submission of a report of the effectiveness of the system not later than 18 months after it becomes operational. Of the 161 projects part-funded through the competition, 127 have submitted completion certificates. To date, 60 of these have provided independent evaluation reports, with 40 recording a decrease in crime in the CCTV area and two showing an increase. The remaining 18 do not include crime statistics but all report that CCTV has made a positive contribution to the well-being and safety of the areas in which it is deployed. It is proposed to evaluate the new arrangements for funding community safety partnerships introduced on 1 April, which supersedes challenge competition funding, and to include a review of the effectiveness of CCTV and other community safety initiatives funded by the Executive.</p>

  <p>I am advised that the Food Standards Agency (FSA) is active in communicating with consumers and stakeholders on matters concerning GM foods. The FSA website contains detailed information about GM foods, including how GM foods are assessed for safety and explaining the current labelling rules for GM foods. A factsheet has also been produced to provide comprehensive background information on GM foods.</p>

  <p>The FSA is also exploring ways of further involving the public in issues relating to GM foods. It has held two meetings, including one in Scotland, with interested parties to discuss European Commission proposals concerning the traceability and labelling of GMOs and GM food and animal feed. Interested parties will be updated as negotiations progress.</p>

  <p>I am also advised that, as the FSA does not regulate GM crop trials and that material from these trials is not harvested for use in the food or feed chain, the FSA does not have a role in informing consumers or stakeholders about these matters. This would be a matter for SEERAD.</p>

  <p>A statutory Code of Conduct for Councillors will come into effect later this year. The code sets out the financial and non-financial interests which must be registered and declared by councillors. The code was prepared by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, at the request of Scottish ministers, as part of the framework introduced by the Ethical Standards in Public Life etc (Scotland) Act 2000 and was approved by the Scottish Parliament in December last year together with a model Code of Conduct for members of devolved public bodies.</p>

  <p>Primary care teams and local health care co-operatives have an important role in developing systems to deliver national and local standards in mental health in primary care. A number of measures are in place to support the provision of services in primary care for patients who experience mental health problems. For example, the Mental Health and Wellbeing Support Group was established in March 2000 to offer advice locally and to the Scottish Executive on solutions and best practice in the implementation of the <i>Framework for Mental Health Services in Scotland</i> and the priorities in the health plan - <i>Our National Health</i> . Developing capacity and improving access and the range of services available to patients are major components of investment and reform in primary care, including &#163;12 million in 2002-03 as part of a &#163;30 million package over three years. The Primary Care Modernisation Group has recently made a number of recommendations in its report <i>Making the Connections &ndash; Developing Best Practice into Common Practice</i> , in relation to the management of mild to moderate mental health in primary care, which NHS boards are expected to address.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is in regular contact with the UK government on a wide range of issues, including the proposed EU Directive on Market Access to Port Services. Since the proposal was published in February 2001, the Executive has considered the implications closely with the Department for Transport in consultation with the ports sector throughout the UK. A number of significant UK amendments reflecting concerns raised have been successfully negotiated and included in the latest draft text agreed as a common position at the Transport Council of Ministers of 17 June 2002. These amendments cover specific Scottish interests, in particular for arrangements to ensure that the directive does not prejudice the management of services at ports serving lifeline ferry routes throughout the Highlands and Islands. The Executive will continue to liaise with the UK government on the draft directive as it passes to the European Parliament for second reading, and throughout its subsequent stages.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Yes, Clause 49 of the contract between SPS and Kilmarnock Prison Services Limited permits, but does not require the disclosure of Confidential Matters as defined in paragraph 1.1.14. In deciding whether disclosure is appropriate, in each case account is also taken of the public interest, and of the contractor&rsquo;s position regarding company commercial confidentiality at the time in question.</p>

  <p>Almost all of the contract has been published and is available on the internet. In addition, arrangements were made to show the Justice 1 Committee the full contract under appropriate confidentiality arrangements.</p>

  <p>The cost of providing night-time sanitation is not separately identifiable from the other necessary improvements in living conditions in the prison service. The independently verified costs of improving the estate were set out in the Executive&rsquo;s consultation paper of the future of the Scottish Prison Service estate, which show that the public sector whole life costs would be about double those of the private sector for the same quality of output.</p>

  <p>There are no plans to publish the responses we have received.</p>

  <p>When Scottish ministers have arrived at a determination, we will ensure that the decision letter is placed on the Planning Register at the relevant local authorities. The letter itself will contain the main reasons and considerations on which the decision was based. Where consent has been granted, the letter will outline the measures to avoid, reduce and, where possible, offset the major adverse effects of the development.</p>

  <p>Detailed action to prevent suicide in specific parts of Scotland is a matter for the relevant NHS board. The Executive is also currently developing a National Framework for Prevention of Suicide and Self-Harm, which I plan to launch later this year. All NHS boards and local authorities will require to take account of the broad parameters of the framework, although the detailed approach for each area of the country will remain a matter for individual authorities.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it is considering introducing legislation to facilitate the maintenance of common paths and ground which local authorities have not adopted.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-08-06.S1W-27421.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80252" speakername="Mr Jim Wallace" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0806.htm#19">

  <p>The Title Conditions (Scotland) Bill, which was introduced on 6 June, will facilitate the maintenance of facilities such as amenity ground and paths within private housing estates where these have not been adopted by local authorities. Section 28 of the bill provides that where conditions in title deeds impose an obligation on owners within a community to maintain, or contribute towards the cost of maintaining, common property, then the owners of a majority of the properties will be able to decide that maintenance should be carried out, in circumstances where the title deeds of the properties do not provide a means for such decision making. Owners will also be able to instruct or carry out such maintenance. Each owner may be required to deposit a sum of money which is that owner&rsquo;s apportioned share of a reasonable estimate of the cost of maintenance. For the purposes of the bill, a &quot;community&quot; is the collective term for those properties which are all subject to the same obligation imposed in their respective title deeds and which can also enforce it: this is sometimes known as a &quot;common scheme&quot;.</p>

  <p>This is an important reform which will allow a great deal of essential maintenance work to be carried out. At present if title deeds do not specify any mechanism for decision making on having work carried out, then the common law demands that all owners should consent and unanimity is very often impossible to achieve.</p>

  <p>The Housing Improvement Task Force is also considering all aspects of common and shared maintenance, with a view to making property owners aware of their obligations and ensuring that effective arrangements for necessary work are in place.</p>
