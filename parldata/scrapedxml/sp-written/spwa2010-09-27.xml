  <p>The First Minister and the Sports Minister will each attend part of the 2010 Commonwealth Games as representatives of a competing nation and to support our athletes, explore economic opportunities in India and to prepare Scotland for the world stage in the lead up to Glasgow 2014. As the next host nation of the Commonwealth Games, Scotland has a close interest in the Delhi Games, not least in the Closing Ceremony where we will celebrate the formal handover from Delhi to Glasgow.</p>

  <p>Ministers are attending the event as guests of the Commonwealth Games Federation and the organisers of the Delhi Games. The details of the programme and Ministerial support are still being finalised but we are working to ensure the best value for money. Numbers will be less than the delegation which attended the 2006 Melbourne Games.</p>

  <p>The Blue Badge scheme has been running since 1971, originally known as <strong><em> </em></strong> the Orange Badge scheme. The Scottish Government is currently undertaking a wide ranging consultation on the scheme to ensure that it remains fit for purpose in the 21st <sup> </sup> Century. No decisions on any possible alterations to the scheme will be considered until the consultation period has ended on 8 October 2010 and the responses analysed.</p>

  <p>The revised clinical guideline (Guideline 101) on the management of asthma, published on 30 June 2009 by the British Thoracic Society in conjunction with the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN), recommends that people with asthma should be offered self-management education that focuses on individual needs, and that this should be reinforced by a written personalised action plan.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>The basic unit of analysis for these figures is a continuous stay in hospital. Probability matching methods have been used to link together individual SMR01 (Scottish Morbidity Record 01) hospital episodes for each patient, thereby creating &quot;linked&quot; patient histories. Within these patient histories, SMR01 episodes are grouped according to whether they form part of a continuous spell of treatment (whether or not this involves transfer between hospitals or even NHS boards).</p>

  <p>All discharges (hospital stays) with an initial main diagnosis of asthma are included in the analysis. Each discharge is then compared with the next admission to hospital for asthma for the same patient. If this subsequent admission occurs within 28 days of the date of discharge for the previous hospital stay and is coded as an emergency admission, it is selected as a relevant readmission.</p>

  <p>The information presented relates to the conventional approach that relies on the statistical circumstance that the distribution of the interval to emergency readmissions forms a distinct peak in the days following discharge. Readmissions fall away thereafter to approach background level of admission. This suggests that there is a strong probability that readmissions in the period following discharge are in fact related to that discharge. The period of 28 days is to some extent arbitrary, but has been widely adopted as maximising the trade off between including as many related readmissions as possible and excluding as many unrelated readmissions as possible. The figures include readmissions within 28 days whether or not the readmission was related to the previous hospital stay.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>The basic unit of analysis for these figures is a continuous stay in hospital. Probability matching methods have been used to link together individual SMR01 (Scottish Morbidity Record 01) hospital episodes for each patient, thereby creating &quot;linked&quot; patient histories. Within these patient histories, SMR01 episodes are grouped according to whether they form part of a continuous spell of treatment (whether or not this involves transfer between hospitals or even NHS boards).</p>

  <p>All discharges (hospital stays) with an initial main diagnosis of asthma are included in the analysis. Each discharge is then compared with the next admission to hospital for asthma for the same patient. If this subsequent admission occurs within 28 days of the date of discharge for the previous hospital stay and is coded as an emergency admission, it is selected as a relevant readmission.</p>

  <p>The information presented relates to the conventional approach that relies on the statistical circumstance that the distribution of the interval to emergency readmissions forms a distinct peak in the days following discharge. Readmissions fall away thereafter to approach background level of admission. This suggests that there is a strong probability that readmissions in the period following discharge are in fact related to that discharge. The period of 28 days is to some extent arbitrary, but has been widely adopted as maximising the trade off between including as many related readmissions as possible and excluding as many unrelated readmissions as possible. The figures include readmissions within 28 days whether or not the readmission was related to the previous hospital stay.</p>

  <p>The Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) of the new GMS contract incentivises GPs to record the number of patients diagnosed with asthma and to put in place a system for their ongoing review. The Scottish Government is not aware of any studies examining the impact of quality improvement measures such as the QOF on admission or readmission rates for asthma in Scotland.</p>

  <p>In addition, NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS) published clinical standards for asthma services for children and young people in March 2007, which provide clear advice and guidance on effective clinical practice. NHS boards&rsquo; progress towards implementing the standards was reviewed in November 2008 and the recommendations contained within the NHS QIS national overview report are being taken forward by the respiratory managed clinical networks (MCNs) which have been developed in all NHS Boards with pump priming funding from the Scottish Government. The MCNs act as the vehicles for local implementation of relevant standards and guidelines. This helps ensure consistency of care, as well as the delivery of HEAT target T6, which includes reducing hospital admissions for those with a primary diagnosis of asthma.</p>

  <p>We have real concerns about the impact these proposals might have and are taking steps to ensure that the views of the people of Scotland are heard in London. It is essential that any changes do not affect the most vulnerable households, who simply cannot afford a reduction in housing benefit. Officials have been in contact with a broad range of key Scottish stakeholders, including COSLA, to discuss the implications of the UK Government&rsquo;s proposals and to ensure that their views and concerns are reflected in our discussions with Whitehall.</p>

  <p>The specific information requested is not available centrally.</p>

  <p>The current waiting time standard is for 98% compliance with the national maximum wait of 24 hours from admission to a specialist unit for hip surgery following fracture, subject to medical fitness and during safe operating hours. The standard came into effect from 31 December 2007.</p>

  <p>Performance on delivery of the 24 hour standard was compiled from the Scottish Hip Fracture Audit at NHS hospital level. The table below provides performance against the standard by NHS board for the period 2006-07, 2007-08 and 1 April to November 2008 and for the last reported month of 31 December 2008.</p>

  <p>NHS Scotland delivered the hip fracture target in December 2007 and maintained it throughout 2008. Due to this excellent performance by NHS Scotland it was decided to stop the Scottish Hip Fracture Audit and re-invest the funding into a service where there was a need for significant improvement in access to treatment.</p>

  <p>From 2009, NHS boards should be monitoring performance against the waiting time standard locally to ensure continuing delivery.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises that falls are a major problem for frail older adults living within care homes and that exercise and nutrition is important in fracture prevention. An AHP Consultant has, therefore, been appointed within the Care Commission to work with the national falls lead to address the issue of falls prevention strategies across Scotland. One of the key strands of this work is the development of an electronic falls and fracture prevention self-assessment resource pack to support staff in care homes, which will enable the implementation of a systematic, person centred approach to falls prevention and management, based on best practice and the current evidence base. It is anticipated that the resource pack will be made available to the early implementation sites by January 2011.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what role self-management will play in the NHS Quality Strategy and whether condition-specific self-management plans will be promoted.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-09-27.S3W-36267.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80379" speakername="Shona Robison" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa0927.htm#9">

  <p>Self-management has a central role in NHS Scotland&rsquo;s Healthcare Quality Strategy which includes three key quality ambitions: that services should be person-centred, safe and effective.</p>

  <p>The person-centred quality ambition promotes mutually beneficial partnerships between patients, their families and those delivering healthcare services which respect individual needs and values and which demonstrate compassion, continuity, clear communication and shared decision-making. This means staff should work with people to set personalised goals and signpost them to the type of support and information they need to help them live well. This includes information on self-management.</p>

  <p>This ambition closely mirrors the principles of self management that are central to the <em>Gaun Yersel&rsquo;</em> self-management strategy for Scotland, developed by the Long Term Conditions Alliance Scotland. Implementation of the self-management strategy is being delivered as part of our long-term conditions action plan and is a key improvement intervention within the quality strategy.</p>

  <p>Supporting people to understand their symptoms and to have more confidence and control in managing their conditions improves their health and wellbeing, enables earlier and more effective intervention by the right team at the right time and so supports our &quot;effective&quot; quality ambition.</p>

  <p>Self-management also has a key role in improving safety in NHSScotland. People who have the right information and advice about their condition are far more likely to have a full understanding of treatments and interventions, to manage their medication safely, recognise flare-ups at an early stage and avoid harmful triggers and situations.</p>

  <p>Condition specific self-management plans are already in use throughout NHS Scotland, particularly for conditions such as diabetes, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and epilepsy. These help people understand their symptoms, provide guidance on who to turn to for further support and information, and enable them to make health choices and be properly involved in decisions about care and treatments. People living with more than one long-term condition may be better served by a generic self-management plan, which, if appropriate, may also include a personalised healthcare and support plan.</p>

  <p>Prior to 2010, specific data on awake craniotomy procedures were not collected and it was therefore not possible to analyse the geographical distribution of patients who have had this procedure. Through the work of the Neurosurgery Managed Service Network, however, it is now possible to gather data on awake craniotomy, and this will enable future analysis of NHS boards&rsquo; referral patterns.</p>

  <p>Deaths occurring in the community, in the ambulance or on arrival in the emergency department and recorded as myocardial infarction may have been from a cardiac arrest. It is important to note that data on out-of-hospital deaths from cardiac arrest are probably underestimates and hence the survival rates are likely to be overestimates.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The basic unit of analysis for these figures is the number of cardiac arrests recorded either in a continuous stay (CIS) in hospital or on a death registration. Probability matching methods have been used to link together death registrations from the General Register Office for Scotland (GROS) and individual SMR01 hospital episodes for each patient, thereby creating &quot;linked&quot; patient histories. Within these patient histories, SMR01 episodes are grouped according to whether they form part of a continuous spell of treatment (whether or not this involves transfer between hospitals or even NHS boards).</p>

  <p>2. All discharges (hospital stays) with a main or secondary diagnosis of cardiac arrest in addition to all deaths where cardiac arrest is recorded as the underlying or one of 10 secondary causes of death are included in the analysis. Death registrations corresponding to linked hospital discharges are excluded. The discharge code from the last SMR01 episode within the CIS determines whether the patient was discharged from the continuous stay alive or dead.</p>

  <p>3. These statistics are based on the linked data set of SMR01 (Scottish Morbidity Record 01) and death records held by ISD Scotland. SMR01 collects information on inpatient and day case discharges from non-obstetric and non-psychiatric hospitals in Scotland. The linkage and use of the death records is by permission of the General Register Office for Scotland (GROS).</p>

  <p>4. Up to six diagnoses (one main and five secondary) may be recorded on an SMR01 record. Up to 10 causes of death (underlying and secondary) may be recorded on the GROS death registration. All diagnoses position on any SMR01 record of a hospital stay and all causes of death have been used to identify cardiac arrest admissions or out of hospital deaths. Cardiac arrest has been defined using ICD10 code I46.</p>

  <p>5. There will be some cases of myocardial infarction (MI) where a cardiac arrest occurred during the hospital stay but was not mentioned on the discharge summary.</p>

  <p>Heart disease, and the treatment of heart attack, remains a clinical priority for NHS Scotland and we want people to have access to the best possible treatment at the earliest possible opportunity, including potentially life-saving defibrillators.</p>

  <p>Making further reductions in the number of deaths from heart attack is an important theme of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Better Heart Disease and Stroke Care Action plan, published in June 2009. The action plan includes an action which places responsibility on NHS boards to look at introducing defibrillators in public places and our National Advisory Committee on heart disease will monitor the progress that is being made.</p>

  <p>We also want to ensure that the best equipment is in place for patients and we are providing &pound;7.5 million of funding to provide cutting-edge defibrillators in Scotland&rsquo;s ambulance fleet. We believe this investment in the most up-to-date technology will improve heart attack survival rates and save lives.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service recognises the importance of reaching people who have had a cardiac arrest quickly and treating them effectively. It therefore has two local delivery plan (LDP) targets related to cardiac arrest:</p>

  <p>Between 12-20% of eligible cardiac arrest patients with Return of Spontaneous Circulation on arrival at hospital, and</p>

  <p>Reach 80% of cardiac arrest patients within eight minutes (mainland Scotland).</p>

  <p>Our priority is to ensure that the Government Car Service is delivered in the most efficient and cost effective manner, offering the best deal to the taxpayer. The number of vehicles in the fleet, currently 24, is kept under review to ensure that it reflects the demands on the service. The typical vehicle now used has CO2 emissions that are 31% lower than the vehicles used by ministers under the previous administration. The vehicles combine low carbon emissions with the need to meet business requirements. Wherever possible public transport is utilised as an alternative to GCS.</p>

  <p>(c) Along with this major investment in high quality rolling stock, additional measures such as new and enhanced, secure storage facilities will be installed at some stations on the North Berwick line to enable passengers more choice to leave cycles at stations.

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to GB targets for casualty reduction in the period 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2010. The targets, compared with the average for 1994-98 are:</p>

  <p>40% reduction in the number of people killed or seriously injured;</p>

  <p>50% reduction in the number of children killed or seriously injured, and</p>

  <p>10% reduction in the slight casualty rate.</p>

  <p>By 2009, all deaths and serious injuries in Scotland were 49% below the baseline, while child deaths and serious injuries were 69% and slight injuries 38% below their base lines.</p>

  <p>On 15 June 2009 the Scottish Government launched a Road Safety Framework for Scotland for the period to 2020. The Framework set challenging targets for casualty reduction in Scotland to commence from 1 January 2011 after the GB targets period ends. The new targets compared to the average for 2004-08 are:</p>

  <p>40% reduction in the number of people killed, with a milestone of 30% by 2015;</p>

  <p>55% reduction in the number of people seriously injured, with a milestone of 43% by 2015;</p>

  <p>50% reduction in the number of children killed, with a milestone of 35% by 2015, and</p>

  <p>65% reduction in the number of children seriously injured, with a milestone of 50% by 2015.</p>

  <p>Progress against the targets will be given in <em>Reported Road Casualties Scotland </em>published annually by the Scottish Government.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has made new funding of &pound;4.5 million over three years (2008-09 to 2010-11) available to Scottish local authorities for the Enhanced Tobacco Sales Enforcement Programme. The allocation made to each local authority is intended broadly to support achievement of the range of agreed outcomes and therefore it is not possible to provide a breakdown for funding devoted to individual activities, such as test purchasing or business advice and support. Moreover, while it was envisaged that the new funding would be allocated to trading standards departments, it was made available through the mechanisms provided by the new national performance framework for local authorities enshrined in the Scottish Government and local authority concordat. Under the concordat it is for local authorities to determine how best to utilise the resources in support of the agreed outcomes.</p>

  <p>The funding allocated to individual local authorities remained the same for 2008-09, 2009-10 and 2010-11 and is shown in the following table.</p>

  <p>National targets were set under the programme rather than individual local authority targets. For 2009-10 a target of six joint operations was set and I am pleased to report that the target was exceeded, with 16 operations reported to have taken place over that period.

  <p>Although there have been no direct discussions between the Scottish Government and Midlothian Council, the chief executive and his staff within sportscotland have been working closely with the council to identify ways of strengthening the management and operation of the centre. This has enabled sportscotland to play a crucial role in the council being able to take the decision to continue to operate the Midlothian Snowsports Centre. I have been kept closely informed of the progress of these discussions.</p>
