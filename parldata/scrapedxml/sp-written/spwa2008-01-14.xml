  <p>There is no requirement in planning legislation or guidance to require such a quota.

  <p>The UK cannot place a unilateral ban on the export of calves as this would contravene free trade rules and would be illegal under EU law.

  <p>Although the slaughter of animals without pre-stunning does not take place in Scotland, it would be perfectly legal for this method to be used in Scottish slaughterhouses.

  <p>A pilot Real Time Closures scheme was introduced in Scotland on 1 September 2007. Fifty-four samples have been taken and to date there have been no closures as the level of juvenile cod on any monitored voyages has not reached the trigger point, though examples of behavioural change on the part of fishermen avoiding small cod have been noted. The trigger point was originally set at 60 juveniles per hour&rsquo;s fishing effort and was subsequently reduced on 8 November 2007 to 50 juveniles per hour&rsquo;s fishing effort. So far the scheme is voluntary and there is no obligation on vessels to report quantities of fish discarded prior to landing. We expect to expand the scheme in 2008.</p>

  <p>(iii) The number of eligible businesses will be lower than the number of non-domestic properties in each area, because some businesses have more than one property. This may affect eligibility for relief under the Small Business Bonus Scheme, which will depend on:</p>

  <p>the combined rateable value of all properties in Scotland properties in Scotland for which the business is liable to pay rates;</p>

  <p>whether the property is eligible for one of the existing rates relief schemes, and</p>

  <p>the level of other public sector assistance received by the business.</p>

  <p>In answering the many parliamentary questions about upgrading the A9 in this parliamentary session we have made it clear that we are committed to investing progressively in the A9 on a continuing and long-term basis. During 2008-09 work is scheduled to start on the following schemes: Crubenmore (dualling); Bankfoot (junction improvements), and Loch Moy (WS2+1 overtaking lane). We plan to continue delivering further improvements during subsequent years of the current programme to 2012 with future investment for the next investment period, from 2012 to 2022, emerging from the Strategic Transport Projects Review which is due to report to ministers this summer (2008). The government is committed to plan for dualling the A9.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government had no corporate plans to celebrate Christmas. However, Christmas Day was a public holiday and Boxing Day a privilege holiday. In addition, and in keeping with previous years, the following arrangements were in place:</p>

  <p>Christmas trees in the main buildings</p>

  <p>The enforcement authorities - Trading Standards Officers and police - are responsible for reporting to the Procurator Fiscal alleged breaches of the law relating to the sale of age-restricted goods. The Procurator Fiscal then decides what action to take. Where an accused is convicted of such offences the court will decide the appropriate sentence. Licensing Boards are advised by the police of any alcohol test purchase failures and may decide to suspend the accused&rsquo;s licence in such cases.</p>

  <p>Trading standards officers currently do not undertake alcohol test purchasing which is the responsibility of the police. The Scottish Government will be providing local government in Scotland with record levels of funding over the period covered by the spending review 2008-11. The vast majority of the funding, including the funding for trading standards services to enforce tobacco and other age restricted laws will be provided by means of a block grant.</p>

  <p>It is the responsibility of each local authority to allocate the total financial resources available to it on the basis of local needs and priorities having first fulfilled its statutory obligations and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities including the Scottish Government&rsquo;s key strategic objectives and manifesto commitments. However, within the broader framework of the new partnership with local government, we are also in discussion with COSLA and the Society of Chief Officers of Trading Standards in Scotland about what more the Scottish Government might do to enable trading standards officers to enforce tobacco sales law more effectively including through test purchasing programmes.</p>

  <p>Sales of cigarettes, including from vending machines, are governed by the provisions of the Children and Young Person (Scotland) Act 1937. Trading standards officers routinely enforce the law in relation to vending machines in the same way as they do at other points of sale, including through test purchasing exercises and will take necessary action if they find illegal sales are being made. The law currently makes provision for a court order to be made stipulating precautions to be taken by the owner or operator to prevent vending machines being used by under 18s or, if necessary, for the machine to be removed altogether where the court is satisfied any person under 18 has used it. In developing proposals for the proposed five-year Smoking Prevention Action Plan which we will be publishing in the spring course, we will also be looking at what further steps might be taken to ensure more rigorous enforcement of tobacco sales law.</p>

  <p>Licensing Standards Officers (LSOs) are responsible for ensuring compliance with licensing conditions and offering support to licensees and members of the public. They are not responsible for enforcing the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005 legislation and thus will have no role in relation to test purchasing. However, we would expect LSOs to work closely with the police and to bring to their attention any concerns they might have if an offence is being committed.</p>
