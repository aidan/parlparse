  <p>The Scottish Executive has made no specific study of the economic impact of the proposed scheme. As part of the proposal, HITRANS commissioned a study from Steer Davis Gleave which included an analysis of potential economic impacts in accordance with <em>Scottish Transport Appraisal Guidance</em> .

  <p>Following the publication of the Audit Scotland Report <em>Adapting the Future: Management of Community Equipment and Adaptations</em> the Scottish Executive will be updating national guidance on roles and responsibilities in relation to equipment and adaptations.</p>

  <p>Local authorities cannot charge for the personal care they provide at home for people over 65, including the provision of devices to help memory and improve safety. Authorities have discretionary powers to charge for other care at home services. These charges should be reasonable; take account of ability to pay, and be no more than the cost of providing service. COSLA, in consultation with the Scottish Executive, issued guidance in May 2002 to address variations in charging for these services.</p>

  <p>Equipment provided by the National Health Service is provided free of charge.</p>

  <p>Overall provision for local authority funding through Grant Aided Expenditure for Community Care is &pound;1,600 million in 2005-06. Grant Aided Expenditure allocations are not spending targets or limits and individual councils will establish their local spending priorities.</p>

  <p>Following the publication of the report of the Strategy Forum <em>Equipped for Inclusion</em> the Scottish Executive is forming an Implementation Steering Group to take forward the recommendations of the report.</p>

  <p>The Implementation Steering Group will be considering how best to capture the potential of technology, to create an integrated portfolio of products and services, and how best to ensure co-ordination at a local level.</p>

  <p>The concept of city regions, as used in the National Planning Framework and Smart Successful Scotland, assists in developing effective economic development policies which recognise the relationship between cities and their regions.</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>the new city region plans for our four largest cities, which replace structure plans;<br />
              the support for realising different city region visions provided through the Cities Growth Fund, and<br />

  <p>There are many Scottish Executive funding streams which are able to support play facilities, including funding allocated to local authorities through revenue support grant via the Grant Aided Expenditure mechanism.</p>

  <p>More specific funding streams include: the Quality of Life funding which supports increased opportunities for children and young people including the development of play provision and play areas; Active Schools funding which includes support for active play; the Children, Young People and Families Unified Voluntary Sector Fund which core funds a number of organisations to take forward play in Scotland, and Health Department&rsquo;s Physical Activity Strategy which supports play.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-05-26.S2W-16524.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80032" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa0526.htm#9">

  <p>The precautionary principle as set out in the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development states that where there are threats of serious or irreversible environmental damage, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing cost effective measures to prevent environmental degradation. The principle is now accepted as applying broadly where there is a threat of harm to human, animal or plant health, as well as in situations where there is a threat of environmental damage.</p>

  <p>In applying the principle, the Scottish Executive has regard to the general principles of risk management set out in the European Commission&rsquo;s 2001 Communication on the precautionary principle (COM(2000)1, which can found at: <br /> <a href="http://europa.eu.int/eur-lex/lex/LexUriServ/site/en/com/2000/com2000_0001en01.pdf" target="_blank">http://europa.eu.int/eur-lex/lex/LexUriServ/site/en/com/2000/com2000_0001en01.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p>These are that measures taken should be proportional to the desired level of protection, non discriminatory in their application, consistent with measures already adopted in similar circumstances or using similar approaches, based on an examination of the benefits and costs of alternative courses of action or inaction, and kept under review in the light of developing scientific knowledge and information on their impact.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-05-26.S2W-16208.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80123" speakername="Mr Jim Wallace" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa0526.htm#10">

  <p>Under the devolution settlement in the UK, matters of EU policy are reserved to the UK Government. However, the Scottish Executive fully supports the UK Government&rsquo;s response to the European Commission&rsquo;s Action Plan on Better Regulation and has worked closely with the UK Government. The Scottish Executive promotes &quot;better regulation&quot; in Scotland through its Improving Regulation unit and in December published it first annual report which includes an annex covering Regulatory Impact Assessments (RIAs). This showed that 47 RIAs had been processed in the year to 31 March 2004. Since then, a further 60 have been received, 37 of which are of EU origin.</p>

  <p>Regulations are usually amended or simplified. It is therefore not possible to give figures for reductions in bureaucracy. The Executive works to ensure that all regulations are necessary and proportionate. In particular, for regulations which impact on business, charities and the voluntary sector, the use of the Regulatory Impact Assessment and the review Regulatory Impact Assessment help ensure that regulations are proportionate, necessary and fit for purpose when they are introduced and that they remain so over time.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) published a guideline on the management of osteoporosis in June 2003 and updated in April 2004. We expect NHS boards to take account of these guidelines in the development of their services locally.</p>

  <p>As part of the essential services element of the new GMS contract, general practices provide care of patients with long-term conditions. Practices can identify patients with particular diagnoses through their IT systems in order to put in place appropriate care arrangements. Osteoporosis would be one such condition.</p>

  <p>As the Minister for Health and Community Care made clear yesterday in his announcement on the Kerr Report, we support the new approach it advocates to the management of long-term conditions. People with osteoporosis will benefit from an approach designed to address an individual&rsquo;s total needs and quality of life, by providing co-ordinated care in and close to home.</p>

  <p>The entitlement card programme with local authorities is designed to help ensure that citizens get access to all of the services that they are entitled to, and that access to those services is as convenient as possible. This includes the use of a citizen&rsquo;s account, where, for example, citizens will be able to access services online, and the use of a citizen&rsquo;s entitlement card to provide a wide range of card based services on one single card.</p>

  <p>This is quite different from national UK identity cards as envisaged by the UK Government prior to the election.</p>

  <p>The purposes of the identity cards bill as re-introduced at Westminster this week include proving and protecting identity, demonstrating the right to live and work in the UK and supporting the fight against various types of crime, all of which are matters reserved to Westminster. Some public services &ndash; such as social security services &ndash; would in time require use of identity cards to establish eligibility. The national identity register supporting identity cards would include information about a person&rsquo;s nationality and immigration status, employment entitlement and biometric data.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is keen to ensure that decisions to release prisoners on Home Detention Curfew (HDC) take account of victims&rsquo; interests as far as possible. The mechanism for taking account of these will be a robust risk assessment process, which all prisoners considered for HDC will be subject to.</p>

  <p>All decisions on whether to grant HDC will have regard to protecting the public, as specified in the bill. The majority of prisoners likely to be granted HDC will be short-term prisoners. For the small group of long-term prisoners who might also be granted HDC, victims who have joined the Victim Notification Scheme will be told of their imminent release.</p>

  <p>The risk assessment for HDC will draw on a variety of information, primarily from the Scottish Prison Service, and criminal justice, and community social workers. This will identify whether there are any victim issues that decision-makers should be aware of that might preclude release, or which require special conditions to be included in the licence.</p>

  <p>An additional safeguard which takes account of victims&rsquo; interests, is the exclusion of some categories of offender from HDC, including those serving an indeterminate sentence and those on the sex offender register. The exclusions are specified on the face of the bill.</p>

  <p>HDC will not be granted to any prisoner who might pose a risk to those they would be living with, or who might pose a risk to the community more generally.</p>

  <p>The purpose of the ministerial power of direction in section 2(10)a of the Management of Offenders etc (Scotland) Bill is to ensure consistency and comparability across all Community Justice Authorities (CJAs) in the manner they carry out their administrative functions. It is expected that the powers of direction under 2(10)a would be particularly relevant in the following areas:</p>

  <p>management and reporting of performance &ndash; directions could be used to establish consistent monitoring regimes which will provide data comparable across CJAs. The bill also enables CJAs to take action where there is evidence that local authorities are failing to perform adequately, or to make recommendations to ministers concerning Scottish Prison Service performance. Directions could be used to establish those situations in which it would be appropriate for CJAs to take this action.</p>

  <p>sharing of information &ndash; directions would provide a means of ensuring consistency across Scotland in how information is shared between partners within a CJA. This would ensure that national organisations do not have to adapt to a variety of protocols used by different CJA areas.</p>

  <p>NHS boards have not expressed concerns about the future supply arrangements for stoma appliances. A number of patients and patient groups have expressed concern that they will no longer continue to receive the appliance which best meets their clinical need, that they will no longer receive support from specialist stoma care nurses, and that other services such as home delivery and flange cutting will no longer be available.</p>

  <p>This will not be the case. The intention is that the current level of service and supply will be maintained and improved. To that end, my officials have established an action plan for the development and subsequent implementation arrangements that will involve all interested parties, including representative patient groups. A Health Department Letter is being issued advising stakeholders about this. As part of the Plan, a National Steering Group is to be established which will also include representation from all key stakeholders, including patient interests to oversee implementation of the plan.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>No. The necessary removal of security and personal data would render the reports of such investigations meaningless as much of the reports concern these matters. The purpose of the investigations is to clarify what went wrong so that steps can be taken to try and minimise such incidents happening in the future. The SPS will shortly be providing the minister with an overview of the first year of the contract which will include material on releases in error which can be released.</p>

Scottish ministers maintain an on-going dialogue with the relevant UK Ministers to discuss all issues affecting the shipbuilding industry. Officials represent and promote Scottish interests on the DTI UK Shipbuilding Forum and its sub-groups. In these meetings, and through the on-going regular interfaces, the question of State aids to shipbuilders is addressed both EU wide and domestically, the latter within the context of the MOD Defence Industrial Strategy and the existing state aid frameworks.

  <p>In order to ensure that a safe and secure environment is always maintained throughout the Parliament, it is not possible to allow all staff access to a lunch break between 12 noon and 2.00pm each day. It is particularly difficult on business days when more posts have to be covered and when business continues beyond 12 noon which means many more staff must have their break scheduled into a shorter period. In order to accommodate all staff, lunch breaks start at 11.30am with the final breaks at 1.30pm so that all have access to the restaurant which serves lunch until 2.30pm.</p>

  <p>The staff who are scheduled for a one hour lunch break from 11.30am are normally those employed on shift work contracts and they receive a further one hour break before the end of their 10 hour working day. Between eight and 12 staff are scheduled for lunch at 11.30am each day and since breaks are organised on a rota basis the same staff are not affected every day. If all security personnel were to have lunch between 12 noon and 2.00pm then additional staff would be needed but they would be surplus to requirements outwith that two hour period.</p>
