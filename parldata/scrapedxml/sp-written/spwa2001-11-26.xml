  <p>The Executive is taking a range of measures to tackle alcohol misuse in Scotland. Work is currently going on to develop a nationally recognisable proof of age card in conjunction with Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and Young Scot. Funding is also being provided for the Health Education Board for Scotland, Alcohol Focus Scotland and Drinkwise which raise awareness of alcohol misuse and undertake preventative activities with young people and community groups. Health education in schools is being improved in a number of ways and the Executive is also continuing to support the work of Alcohol Misuse Co-ordinating Committees which co-ordinate local prevention and treatment activities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Advisory Committee on Alcohol Misuse (SACAM) was set up in 1999 to advise on the development of a national strategy. SACAM, which I chair, has taken a central role in advising on the development of the Executive's national Plan for Action on Alcohol Problems which we expect to publish by the end of the year.</p>

  <p>Liquid-based cytology (LBC) is an alternative method of taking cervical smears. Pilot studies in Scotland and elsewhere in the UK are examining the practicalities and cost-effectiveness of this method.</p>

  <p>The National Advisory Group on Cervical Screening will be considering a report from its steering group on the outcome of the Scottish cervical screening LBC pilot at its meeting in December. The report will include the findings of the Health Economics Research Unit&#8217;s (HERU) economic evaluation of the pilot. Depending on the outcome of the group&#8217;s considerations, the Health Technology Board for Scotland may wish to undertake an assessment on LBC for the cervical screening programme in collaboration with the National Institute of Clinical Excellence.</p>

  <p>All relevant evidence on the introduction of LBC, including the HERU evaluation findings, will be published when a decision on the new smear-taking method is made.</p>

  <p>The recent Scottish pilot of liquid-based cytology (LBC) will provide the information needed to assess the practicalities and the cost-effectiveness of this alternative method of cervical smear taking. The cost of an LBC kit used in the pilot was &#163;3.55 compared to the conventional smear cost of approximately 20p. The pilot studies will also take account of other costs associated with existing and LBC methods, including the cost of training and capital or lease costs for processing machinery.</p>

  <p>In England the pilot LBC studies are also looking at the feasibility of using human papilloma virus testing for the triage of mild or borderline smears. The costs associated with this test are not known. The Scottish Executive will consider the English pilot.</p>

  <p><i>Cancer Scenarios: An aid to planning cancer services in Scotland in the next decade</i> was published by the Executive in May 2001. It sets out projected patient numbers and looks at possible future influences on cancer services and models these to provide a foundation on which to plan care for people with cancer.</p>

  <p><i>Cancer in Scotland: Action for Change</i> was launched in July 2001, setting out a clear strategy and future direction for cancer services in Scotland.</p>

  <p>On 6 November the first annual Implementation/investment plans to support implementation of <i>Cancer in Scotland: Action for Change, </i>and totalling more than &#163;10 million, were published. More than &#163;5 million has been allocated to West of Scotland regional cancer services to secure additional oncologists and other specialists, more specialist nurses and professions allied to medicine as well as support staff. Replacement and additional equipment to secure more rapid diagnosis and treatment will also become available during the coming months as these plans are put into place. All of these plans and investments &#8211; which are over and above existing local and national investment in cancer services &#8211; are aimed at improving access to cancer services.</p>

  <p>Detailed national and regional plans are available on both the Scottish Executive and Scottish Health on the Web (SHOW) websites &#8211; www.scotland.gov.uk and www.show.scot.nhs.uk. Copies have also been placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>So far as radiotherapy treatment is concerned investment of more than &#163;10 million has already seen the building and commissioning of the new Beatson Oncology Centre out-patient linear accelerator facilities at Gartnavel Hospital. Two of the planned three new linear accelerators are up and running and the third is expected to come on line within the next few weeks. In addition, the on-going linear accelerator modernisation programme, funded by the Scottish Executive, is now in its third wave. This will see a further two linear accelerators and a replacement tracking system commissioned in Glasgow during 2002-03.</p>

  <p>The employing authority of individual professional members of the Scottish Cancer Group (SGC) was not taken into consideration when planning its restructuring.

  <p>There are a variety of ways in which needs assessments are informed. For cancer services these include,</p>

  <p>the Scottish Executive&#8217;s on-going modernisation programme for radiotherapy treatment equipment. This programme has already seen three new linear accelerators sited in the new Beatson Oncology Centre facility at Gartnavel Hospital:</p>

  <p>a preparatory assessment of chemotherapy needs for breast, lung, colorectal and ovarian cancers was carried out by the previous Scottish Cancer Group (SCG). This work is shortly to be taken forward by the current SCG and will inform service planning in the future;</p>

  <p><i>Cancer Scenarios: an aid to planning cancer services in the next decade</i> was published by the Scottish Executive in May of this year;</p>

  <p>the Royal College of Radiologists, which includes radiation oncology, published two reviews in 1999, one on workforce needs and one on linear accelerator needs, and</p>

  <p>in 1999, the Scottish Medical and Scientific Advisory Committee (SMASAC) undertook an assessment of radiology equipment needs.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive expects that the advice of Royal Colleges and other professional advisory bodies be taken into account when local NHS providers are planning the delivery of services.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive have no specific plans to target 12-year-olds with health promotion programmes beyond those already offered in health services throughout Scotland. 76% of children in this age group in Glasgow are registered with a general dental practitioner. Through targeting younger children from six years of age onwards and making payments to dentists for preventive treatments will reduce dental disease in 12-year-olds considerably. Research would suggest that programmes such as the enhanced capitation and preventive scheme recently introduced into NHS dental services this year, could reduce dental disease in 12-year-olds by up to 50%.</p>

  <p>Entry to the Dentists Register is an issue for the General Dental Council. This body and such issues are reserved and dealt with through the Department of Health in England.</p>

  <p>Entering the Dentists Register in the UK is not the same as working in the UK. Entry to the register does not guarantee entry to the UK or a work permit to work here. Home Office permission must still be granted and immigration criteria satisfied, for dentists from outwith the European Economic Area (EEA). Dentists who qualify in the EEA are entitled to free movement within that area, including the UK.</p>

  <p>In Scotland, 98.3% of General Dental Practitioners trained in the UK, (91% in Scotland) 1.8% elsewhere (EEA including Ireland and overseas).</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive Health Department is pursuing policies aimed at retaining Scottish graduates in Scotland.</p>

  <p>We recognise that raising Scotland's performance on research and development is central to achieving a smart, successful Scotland. The Enterprise Networks are taking this forward, and one of the progress measures which we plan to use to guide their priorities is business investment in research and development as a proportion of GDP.</p>

  <p>Following publication in February 2001 of the Scottish Executive Report on the Knowledge Economy Cross-Cutting Initiative &#163;7.5 million was allocated over three years for the expansion of existing innovation schemes (SMART/ SPUR, TCS and Faraday Partnerships). Greater commercialisation of research is being encouraged through a variety of initiatives including: the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council&#8217;s (SHEFC) &#163;6 million Knowledge Transfer Grant; Royal Society of Edinburgh/Scottish Enterprise Enterprise Fellowships, and the Proof of Concept Fund to which the Executive has allocated an additional &#163;19 million bringing that total to &#163;30 million. Further proposals to support commercialisation will arise from SHEFC&#8217;s Review of Research Funding.</p>

  <p>In addition, earlier this year, I commissioned a review of the RSA scheme, partly to consider what more we could do to support high technology projects and encourage growth in our knowledge based businesses. I expect to receive the report of the review in the course of next month and thereafter to announce some further related initiatives.</p>

  <p>There is no fixed definition of, nor is the UK fleet segmented separately into "the whitefish fleet". It is also possible to interpret the question in a number of ways.</p>

  <p>In determining eligibility for access to the Scottish decommissioning scheme, we took account of actual and potential whitefish capacity (based on the category of fishing licence held) alongside EC requirements relating to decommissioning grant. Using the resulting catchment of eligible vessels as the baseline, the total number of applications received and qualifying bids received under the scheme represent, respectively, 40% and 36% (based on the tonnage of the vessels concerned.)</p>

  <p>The best scientific advice is that ash from pyres across the country should be disposed of at licensed engineered landfill sites. There is material at two sites in Dumfries and Galloway and one in the Scottish Borders which requires disposal but there are no such sites in those areas. Following consultation with the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency, it was concluded that the Best Practicable Environmental Option is to dispose of the material at Garlaff Landfill site, the nearest suitable facility in Scotland.</p>

  <p>There is no risk of the material harbouring the foot-and-mouth virus. The transportation of the ash to a site outside Dumfries and Galloway and the Borders does not jeopardise any livestock either en-route or in the vicinity of the final disposal site.</p>

  <p>The curriculum offered by a further education (FE) college is a matter for the college&#8217;s Board of Management to determine. The Scottish Executive has, however, issued guidance to the Scottish Further Education Funding Council emphasising the importance of developing a workforce of entrepreneurs and of promoting an entrepreneurial culture.</p>

  <p>The Funding Council&#8217;s current corporate plan in turn emphasises the FE sector&#8217;s strong role in promoting enterprise and entrepreneurship through the services provided for local business.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Medicines Consortium will provide a single source of advice to local Area Drug and Therapeutic Committees using the evidence available at the time of marketing of new drugs. Once sufficient evidence is available, this initial national advice might be the subject of a more measured assessment by the Health Technology Board for Scotland (HTBS) or by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE). HTBS carries out full health technology assessments based on evidence of use of health technologies, including drugs, in the NHS. HTBS also provides administrative and methodological support to the consortium.</p>

  <p>The Chief Medical Officer has asked Professor David Lawson to establish a Scottish Medicines Consortium to make recommendations to all NHS Boards and their Area Drug and Therapeutic Committees about the formulary status of all newly licensed medicines, all new formulations of existing medicines and any major new indications for established products. This advice should be promulgated as soon as practical after the launch of the product involved. A number of individuals are being approached by the Chief Medical Officer to serve on the consortium. However, as this process is not complete a full list of members will be placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre as soon as it is available.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Medicines Consortium will provide a single Scottish source of advice to local Area Drug and Therapeutic Committees and NHS Boards. Clinical freedom will still allow clinicians to make prescribing decisions using their skills and knowledge of individual patients. However, increasingly they will do this against a background of Scotland-wide advice and will, under clinical governance, have to justify any divergence from that national advice.</p>

  <p>There is not at present any reliable method of identifying patients at a high risk of developing osteoporosis, nor is there any evidence that physiotherapy can do anything to prevent it from developing. The only measures known to prevent the development of osteoporosis are exercise, low alcohol consumption, not smoking and a balanced diet with a higher consumption of calcium and vitamin D and lowered consumption of sodium, protein and caffeine. These are all measures which are actively promoted by the Executive, because they reduce the risks of developing many other conditions as well as osteoporosis.</p>

  <p>There is already provision for such concerns to be addressed, in the first instance by discussion with the prescribing clinician. If parents are still not satisfied it is open to them to seek resolution through the NHS complaints procedure.</p>

  <p>Section 1.4 of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) Guideline 52 on <i>Attention Deficit and Hyperkinetic Disorders in Children and Young People</i> makes it clear that its good practice guidance should not be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding all other acceptable methods of care aimed at the same results.

  <p>It has been estimated the Glasgow housing transfer will create over 3,000 full-time jobs in the construction and other related industries. It is intended that contractual arrangements will be put in place between the Glasgow Housing Association and the Direct Labour Organisation in respect of continuing repairs and maintenance work.</p>

  <p>A significant number of Udal proprietors have recorded their titles in the register of Sasines. In such cases, the document used to effect a transfer of title is normally a Disposition, in a style similar to that used in mainland Scotland for the transmission of title to feudal property. It is not known how many properties in Orkney and Shetland are held on unwritten titles.</p>

  <p>Anyone acquiring Udal land after the commencement date of the Land Register in Orkney and Shetland on 1 April 2003 will be able to obtain a real right only by registration in the Land Register. Existing proprietors&#8217; rights will not be affected. The Keeper has discretion under section 4(1) of the Land Registration (Scotland) Act 1979 as to what evidence is acceptable in a particular case. He has not yet set a policy on what evidence he will require for the registration of Udal land. However, he has begun research on the implications of Udal law, and will take into account any available information as to current practice in the transmission of Udal land.</p>

  <p>The Executive attaches a high priority to ensuring that the NHS offers high quality maternity services in all parts of Scotland. Among the comprehensive principles identified in the <i>Framework for Maternity Services in Scotland</i> , published in February this year, were safety, choice, quality and access. Within the guidelines set out in the framework, it is for the NHS locally, working with service users and planning partners, to determine what initiatives and investment are necessary to develop services in their areas. Information about the cost of service developments is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>Highland NHS Board carried out a review of maternity services throughout the Highlands earlier this year. The review was informed by wide public consultation with local communities. The review report, published in August, made 41 recommendations for developing Highland maternity services in line with the Scottish framework. NHS Highland has started to implement these recommendations, in consultation with service users and planning partners.</p>

  <p>Local authorities are not obliged by law to apply bio-diversity principles when considering planning applications. However, the <i>National Planning Policy Guideline on Natural Heritage</i> (NPPG 14) stresses the importance of safeguarding and enhancing biodiversity and states that planning authorities should provide for the conservation of biodiversity in development plans. It also stresses that planning authorities should have full regard to natural heritage matters when considering individual planning applications. We have also issued a Planning Advice Note, PAN 60, on <i>Planning and Natural Heritage </i> setting out the ways in which planning <i> </i> can improve biodiversity objectives.</p>

  <p>National Planning Policy Guidelines and Planning Advice Notes may, as far as they are relevant, be material considerations to be taken into account in development plan preparation and development control.</p>

  <p>Planning applications for developments taking access from a trunk road must be assessed on their individual merits. Such proposals are likely to lead to an increase in the amount of traffic entering and leaving the trunk road. Road safety issues are extremely important and I do not accept that a blanket presumption in favour of a right of access in these circumstances would be appropriate. Development proposals that seek to take access from local roads are for planning authorities to consider.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mr Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Prior to implementation of the new procedures, the Scottish Prison Service sought advice from a number of relevant bodies including the Office of the Information Commissioner. The tenor of that advice suggested that public bodies should all adopt such a procedure and we were told that many have done so.</p>

  <p>Relocation decisions are based on a range of issues including costs, quality and efficiency of service, economic factors such as unemployment, availability and suitability of property and staff, transport issues, and the position of staff concerned. Further criteria to be taken into account will depend on the organisation itself and the nature of the work in question.</p>

  <p>In my interview I indicated that a range of factors was taken into account in deciding where the Scottish Public Pensions Agency should be sited. Scottish Executive officials also met with North Ayrshire Council to explain the range of factors taken into account. Each case is considered on its merits.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to the promotion of renewable energy in Scotland, and to its accounting for 18% of electricity supply in Scotland by 2010. This will be achieved by means of the Renewables Obligation (Scotland) which will start next year, subject to parliamentary approval.

  <p>Financial assistance for the development of specific renewable energy technologies is a matter for the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI).

  <p>There are very few local authority homes catering for physically disabled people. Table 4.7 in <i>Scottish Community Care Statistics 2000</i> shows that there were three such homes open at the 1999 census and four at the 2000 census. The average weekly charge figures are therefore based on a very small number of homes and any changes e.g. homes opening or closing may have a significant effect on the average in this table.</p>

  <p>In addition, Lothian Health will receive &#163;3 million over a three-year period to lead the demonstration project<i> </i>Healthy Respect. Launched late last year, the project aims to help young people develop a positive attitude to sexual matters and ultimately to reduce the rates of unplanned teenage pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases. The Health Education Board for Scotland also takes initiatives in relation to sexual health, funded from its general allocation.</p>

  <p>Local authorities have a statutory duty to provide a service for individuals in their area who, following release from prison or other form of detention, are required to be under supervision. In addition, local authorities provide an after-care service to anyone who asks for it within 12 months of their release. The level of this social work supervision is set out in <i>the National Objectives and Standards for Social Work Services in the Criminal Justice System</i> . Further guidance was also issued in November 1998 for those subject to extended sentence.</p>

  <p>Supervision depends on the nature of the offender and the nature of the offence. It includes advice, guidance and assistance on release from custody, as well as specific requirements for instance to undertake courses to address offending behaviour or live in a specific type of accommodation all designed to reduce the risk of re-offending and reintegrate the offender into the community. An offender released on licence may be subject to recall to custody if specific conditions are not kept.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no plans to review the business rate liability specifically for indoor equestrian arenas. All businesses occupying properties with a rateable value of &#163;10,000 or less benefit from a 2p reduction in the poundage this year.</p>

  <p>For businesses suffering financial hardship, local authorities can grant up to 100% relief from rates. The Scottish Executive pays 75% of the cost of this relief. For the period 1 April to 31 December 2001 the Scottish Executive is funding 95% of the cost of hardship relief for businesses occupying properties with a rateable value of &#163;12,000 or less affected by the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in rural local authority areas. In recognition of the exceptionally difficult conditions in the Dumfries and Galloway and Scottish Border Council areas, the rateable value threshold has been raised (with retrospective effect from 1 April) to &#163;50,000.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive provides all local volunteer development agencies (LVDA&#8217;s), including Volunteering Highland, with generous grant towards their running and programme costs. In 2001-02, Volunteering Highland will receive over &#163;41,000 from the Scottish Executive, via Volunteer Development Scotland.</p>

  <p>In total, Scottish Executive grant funding for the LVDA network in 2001-02 will be around &#163;1.2 million. As a condition of grant, each LVDA is expected to secure match funding. It is incumbent on each LVDA to arrange match funding as part of its on-going business.</p>

  <p>The Executive does not operate a specific programme which encourages the development of CFC recovery technology. The Executive has written to waste metal recyclers and industry to inform them of the forthcoming legislation and discussed the need for this technology with a number of industry representatives. In this way the Executive aims to ensure industry is aware of the new opportunities likely to arise from the legislation. It is up to industry to identify and take advantage of a business opportunity as a particular market presents itself in this way.</p>

  <p>The Priority Waste Stream projects are being taken forward by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) as part of the <i>National Waste Strategy: Scotland</i> (NWS). Additional grant-in-aid totalling some &#163;16.5 million over the three-year period 2001-02 to 2003-04 was announced for SEPA as part of Spending Review 2000. This included additional funding for SEPA's work to implement the NWS. No ring-fenced funding has been allocated for the Priority Waste Stream Projects or any other specific initiative.</p>

  <p>Most offenders under 18 are not subject to criminal proceedings. There is a presumption that cases reported against offenders under the age of 16 will be dealt with by the Reporter to the Children's Panel unle ss there are compelling reasons in the public interest to take criminal proceedings. Further, offenders aged 16 and 17 who are subject to a supervision requirement may also be dealt with by the Reporter.</p>

  <p>In the event that court proceedings are taken against a persistent young offender, there are at present no special provisions to expedite the case. However, consideration is being given to the priority accorded to cases against child offenders (i.e. those under 16).</p>

  <p>In addition, the committee set up under Sheriff Principal John McInnes is to examine the operation of the summary justice system. It is hoped that increased efficiency of the summary courts will impact upon the speed at which all offenders, including persistent young offenders, are brought before the courts.</p>
