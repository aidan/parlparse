  <p>The Chartered Institute of Housing in Scotland has been commissioned by the Executive to undertake an annual exercise to determine the use being made of anti-social behaviour orders (ASBOs), which came into force on 1 April 1999.</p>

  <p>The first two reports, covering 1 April to 30 November 1999 and 1 December 1999 to 30 November 2000, did not break the figures down by local authority area. Additional investigation has shown that for the period 1 December 1999 to 30 November 2000 no ASBOs were granted in Stirling or Clackmannanshire; seven were granted in Fife. The latest report, covering the period 1 December 2000 to 30 November 2001, is expected to be published by the Chartered Institute later in the summer. Copies of the report will be placed in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>The terms of the question do not reflect the procedures under the central heating programme, as administered by Eaga. An application does not qualify until after a surveyor has visited the home to verify that the terms and conditions of the programme are met.</p>

  <p>When eligibility is confirmed, Eaga pass the applicant&rsquo;s details to a heating company. Details are generally passed on in the order in which applicants are confirmed as eligible. The period between determining eligibility and giving the applicant&rsquo;s name to a heating company will vary between parts of Scotland and over the duration of the programme. There are no figures by local authority area. When the heating company is authorised to proceed, the central heating is normally installed within three months.</p>

  <p>The Executive has no plans to review the funding for dentists. Increases in the level of fees paid to dentists for undertaking NHS general dental services are recommended annually by the Doctors' and Dentists' Review Body (DDRB), which is independent of government. The DDRB's recommendations are based on all the evidence laid before it by the Health Departments and by representatives of the profession, including both the British Dental Association and the General Dental Practitioners' Association.</p>

  <p>The Executive monitors the provision of dentists and I recently announced a package of measures aimed at recruiting and retaining dentists within the general dental services. Further measures are being discussed with the dental professions' representatives.</p>

  <p>Currently, 62% of executive agencies and 35% of non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs) have a stated policy on equal pay. Not all of the remaining bodies/agencies actually employ staff, but all of those that do have an equal opportunities policy, which provides that staff should be treated equally in respect of all matters. For NDPBs, monitoring and compliance with good practice are monitored centrally within the Scottish Executive. Executive agencies have responsibility for monitoring and encouraging compliance with good practice.</p>

  <p>There are no current plans to give local authorities the right to decide whether council by-elections should be held by postal ballot only. The Scottish Local Government (Elections) Act 2002 allows ministers to extend successful pilots throughout Scotland by order but it is unlikely that they would do so on the basis of a single pilot.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has two job evaluation systems. Senior Civil Service posts are evaluated using Job Evaluation for Senior Posts (JESP) while Job Evaluation and Grading Support (JEGS) is used for all other posts. The purpose of both systems is to establish job weight of posts on a consistent basis. This ensures that all posts of comparable weight are placed in the same pay range. More detailed information about the two systems can be found on the Cabinet Office website at:</p>

  <p>Information is collected centrally on sexual assaults in the recorded crime statistics, which are collected as an aggregate quarterly return from the eight police forces in Scotland. The returns give the total number of crimes recorded and cleared up by the police within each council area and police force area in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Information is not collected centrally on the circumstances of the crime or on the victims of crime.</p>

  <p>The crime group of sexual assault is formed from the crime categories of rape, assault with intent to rape and indecent assault.</p>

  <p>The responsibility for the provision of recreational and leisure services is primarily a matter for local authorities.</p>

  <p>However, applications for the provision of such facilities can be made to <strong></strong>sportscotland under the Lottery Sports Fund&rsquo;s Sports Facilities Programme and the recently launched Social Inclusion Partnership Programme. Another possible funding route is the PE and Sport in Schools strand of the New Opportunities Fund also launched earlier this year. Funding may also be available from the Awards for All programme though the maximum level of award is &#163;5,000.</p>

  <p>Recruitment processes are a matter for higher education institutions (HEIs) themselves. In deciding on individual recruitment strategies, HEIs are able to work with local authorities to identify any localised skills shortages which may exist, and to seek to recruit students to meet this demand.</p>

  <p>From September 2002, the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (as amended by the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001) will make it unlawful for HEIs to discriminate against a student on grounds of their disability. This new duty will apply in relation to admissions, as well as education and associated services, and exclusions. Therefore, HEIs should take account of the Disability Rights Commission Code of Practice (Post 16), which will be published shortly, in considering their recruitment and admission policies.</p>

  <p>Note:</p>

  <p>* The revision to PGCE intake levels announced in March 2002 does not effect these projections. These changes were made to avoid a likely excess of the supply which would neither be in the interests of the individual students, nor the teaching profession as a whole.</p>

  <p>The estimated 3,000 additional teachers required in order to implement the agreement <i>A Teaching Profession for the 21st Century</i> are included within these projections.</p>

  <p>The estimates of teacher deficit will vary from year to year as information varies on early retirements, resignations and the level at which qualified teachers return to the profession from career breaks.</p>
