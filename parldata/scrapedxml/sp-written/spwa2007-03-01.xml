  <p>Yes. The Invergarry-Kyle of Lochalsh Trunk Road (A87) Extension (Skye Bridge Crossing) Toll Order (Revocation) Order 2005 does not affect the 1992 Special Road Scheme Order. The classes of traffic prescribed by the Order therefore still apply.</p>

  <p>Information on waiting times and waiting lists for a first out-patient appointment following referral from a general medical or dental practitioner, is collected at specialty level only and not at hospital department level.</p>

  <p>The current national maximum waiting time for a first out-patient appointment at a consultant-led clinic, following referral by a general medical or dental practitioner, is 26 weeks. This commitment is being met by all NHS boards. The national maximum waiting time will be reduced to 18 weeks from the end of this year.</p>

  <p>Median waiting times are derived from continuous retrospective data. To remove the effects of seasonality and to minimise the effects of data shortfalls, rolling annual data has been used to calculate the median waits. Comparable information is available only from the year ended 31 March 1998.</p>

  <p>Median waiting times for a first out-patient appointment with a consultant, following a general medical or dental practitioner referral, at Dundee Dental Hospital, Edinburgh Dental Institute and Glasgow Dental Hospital and School, by dental specialty, and compiled on a rolling annual basis, for the years ending 31 March 1998 to 30 September 2006 have been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 42003).</p>

  <p>Dental out-patient waiting list information has only been collected centrally since 31 December 2004. Information on the number of patients waiting for a first out-patient appointment with a consultant, following referral from a general medical or dental practitioner, by dental specialty, at Dundee Dental Hospital on each quarterly census date from 31 December 2004 to 31 March 2006, at Edinburgh Dental Institute on each quarterly census date from 31 December 2004 to 31 December 2006 and at Glasgow Dental Hospital and School on each quarterly census date from 30 September 2005 to 31 December 2006, has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 42004).</p>

  <p>In addition, we have recently undertaken a Route Improvement Strategy Study of the A9 from Perth to Blair Atholl which identified &pound;165 million worth of long-term improvement work. Detailed studies are now being carried out on how best to take forward these improvements to the A9 including dualling between Perth and Pitlochry, safe overtaking provision and reconstruction along this environmentally sensitive route.</p>

  <p>Local authorities have discretionary powers under the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 to determine the specification of vehicles which they will license as a taxi or private hire car having regard to the type, size and design of the vehicle and whether it is safe for use. The Scottish Executive has encouraged local authorities to use those discretionary powers to improve the accessibility of taxis to disabled people.</p>
