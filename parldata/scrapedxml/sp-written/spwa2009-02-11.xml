  <p>The Green Jobs Strategy was published in June 2005 and implemented under the previous administration. A fresh approach has been taken by this Scottish Government under the Government Economic Strategy, which sets out how we will achieve our overall purpose &quot;to create a more successful country, with opportunities for all of Scotland to flourish, through increasing sustainable economic growth&quot;. Delivery is underpinned by a national performance framework of strategic targets, outcomes and indicators, including the Greener Strategic Objective &quot;to improve Scotland&rsquo;s natural and built environment and the sustainable use and enjoyment of it&quot;.</p>

  <p>On 2 February we announced ten energy pledges, aimed at ensuring that Scotland gains maximum economic advantage from the move towards a low-carbon economy, including jobs in renewable energy, energy efficiency and clean fossil fuel technology.</p>

  <p>If a member of any diplomatic mission is alleged to have committed a road traffic or vehicle offence, the relevant police force should notify the Diplomatic Protection Group of the Metropolitan Police, who will then report it to the Protocol Directorate of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO). The FCO would then take the appropriate action.</p>

  <p>For a minor offence, this is usually a formal letter to the relevant mission, bringing the alleged offence to their attention and reminding them of their duty to obey the laws of the UK.</p>

  <p>For more serious offences, consideration will be given to making a formal request for immunity to be waived.</p>

  <p>The principal role of the Victim Steering Group was to oversee the implementation of <em>Scottish Strategy for Victims</em> and the related action plan. Since the key elements of the action plan have been implemented the function of the group has been fulfilled and consequently there have been no meetings of the group since May 2007.</p>

  <p>The Victim Steering Group was instrumental in producing the <em>Scottish Strategy for Victims</em> . The main elements of the strategy have been implemented, including the extension of the Victim Notification Scheme and the introduction of the Victim Statement Scheme. The strategy is currently being reviewed and this is examining how best to engage victims and victims organisations in policy development and service delivery. Any future role for the Victim Steering Group will be considered as part of this examination.</p>

  <p>The information requested is set out in the following table. Part (a) shows the latest estimate of working age population (males aged 16 to 64 and females aged 16 to 59) by local authority.

  <p>Care should be taken when comparing local authority staff levels to the working age population as some members of local authority staff may work beyond standard working age.</p>

  <p>Glasgow Royal Infirmary &ndash; officials in NHS Greater Glasgow are in discussion with their PFI contractor about how the reduction to the standard rate of VAT can be implemented, and</p>

  <p>Ninewells Hospital, Dundee &ndash; as the car parking charge is rounded to the nearest 10p, the reduction to the standard rate of VAT did not change the level of car parking charge.</p>

  <p>The information on pain clinics, which comes from NHS boards, is as follows:</p>

  <p>NHS Ayrshire and Arran holds four clinics and three treatment sessions per week for pain management.</p>

  <p>NHS Borders holds one pain clinic for new referrals three times per week.</p>

  <p>NHS Dumfries and Galloway routinely has two pain clinics per week with regular additional clinics.</p>

  <p>NHS Fife holds five hospital-based clinics per week and three primary care-based sessions per week in West Fife.</p>

  <p>NHS Forth Valley runs one multi-professional clinic over two sites, providing a total of 17 medical sessions per month.</p>

  <p>NHS Grampian holds two pain clinics per week.</p>

  <p>NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde holds 26 general out-patient pain clinics and one specialist clinic for spinal cord stimulation per week. The board also operates a chronic pain Managed Clinical Network (MCN), with Scottish Government pump-priming funding.</p>

  <p>NHS Highland holds three pain clinics per month.</p>

  <p>NHS Lanarkshire holds five consultant-led clinics, three nurse-led clinics and one GP-led clinic per week, as well as an intervention session enabling patients to go to theatre for intervention such as epidurals.</p>

  <p>NHS Lothian holds one clinic daily at the Western General Hospital; full-day clinic every two weeks from the Royal Infirmary, and a pain management programme undertaken over an 11 week period, with daily assessment appointments, at the Astley Ainslie Hospital.</p>

  <p>NHS Orkney holds one pain clinic as and when required<em>.</em></p>

  <p>NHS Shetland holds two pain clinics per week.</p>

  <p>NHS Tayside holds three clinics at three different locations per week.</p>

  <p>NHS Western Isles holds one pain clinic as and when required.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Pain Association Scotland works with NHS Ayrshire and Arran, NHS Dumfries and Galloway, NHS Fife, NHS Forth Valley, NHS Grampian, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, NHS Highland, NHS Lanarkshire and NHS Tayside in the delivery of pain management services which help people living with chronic pain to manage their own condition.

  <p>Within Curriculum for Excellence, provision of two hours quality physical education for each child every week is a key element of the health and wellbeing experiences and outcomes which are being finalised for publication later in the year. The experiences and outcomes are being revised to reflect feedback obtained via online questionnaires, school trialling, Continuing Professional Development (CPD) events and focus groups. The Health and Wellbeing area within Curriculum for Excellence explicitly reflects our commitment to two hours quality PE for each child every week. Schools will begin to introduce the new curriculum from August this year with full implementation by August 2010.</p>

  <p>Three inquiries conducted under The Inquiries (Scotland) Rules 2007 (Scottish Statutory Instrument 560/2007) have so far been established under the Inquiries Act 2005.</p>

  <p>These are: the ICL Inquiry into the circumstances leading up to the incident on 11 May 2004 at the premises occupied by the ICL group of companies, Grovepark Mills, Maryhill, Glasgow; the Fingerprint Inquiry into the steps that were taken to identify and verify the fingerprints associated with, and leading up to, the case of <em>HM Advocate</em> v. <em>McKie</em> in 1999, and the Penrose Inquiry into the circumstances of HIV and Hepatitis C being transmitted through blood products in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Section 17 of the 2005 act requires both that the procedure and conduct of an inquiry are to be such as the chairman of the inquiry may direct and that, in making any decision as to the procedure or conduct of an inquiry, the chairman must act with regard to the need to avoid any unnecessary cost (whether to public funds or to witnesses or others). Section 39 of the 2005 act requires ministers to pay inquiry expenses, subject to certain limitations.</p>

  <p>Funding requirements of any Inquiries established under the 2005 act are thus determined to a great extent by the directions of the chairman on an inquiry&rsquo;s procedure and conduct, which may vary greatly. The full expense is required to be met by a re-prioritisation of resources from within existing programmes.</p>

  <p>Specific financial provisions made for the Penrose Inquiry are described in response to the answer to question S3W-19572 on 23 January 2009.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has set a target to generate 50% of Scotland&rsquo;s electricity demand from renewable sources by 2020, with an interim milestone of 31% by 2011. The renewables capacity installed, consented and under construction now exceeds the capacity we estimate will be necessary to meet the 2011 milestone. The targets are not broken down by sector.</p>
