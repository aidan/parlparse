The expert seminar <i>Women and Alcohol </i> was funded by the Scottish Executive and we have noted the recommendations emerging from it.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the Forestry Commission has reviewed all existing consents, permissions or other authorisations with the potential to affect capercaillie in Natura 2000 sites under Regulation 50 of the Conservation (Natural Habitats &amp;c) Regulations 1994 and, if not, what powers the Forestry Commission and Scottish Natural Heritage have to prevent action being taken on the basis of existing consents, permissions or other authorisations before they have been subject to such a review.</p>

  <p>The Forestry Commission is currently identifying all the existing Woodland Grant Schemes (WGS) and felling approvals granted during the last five years likely to have a significant effect on Natura 2000 sites. Where the proposed work might adversely affect capercaillie in a Natura 2000 site, the commission will discuss the proposals with the owners or managers of the land with a view to making specific arrangements for protecting capercaillie.</p>

  <p>Under the Conservation (Natural Habitats, &amp;c.) Regulations 1994 the Forestry Commission is required to have regard to the requirements of the Habitats Directive. In addition, all woodland owners are required to comply with the UK Forestry Standard which states that, when carrying out any forestry operations, owners must make specific arrangements for the protection of protected habitats and protected species of wildlife. Under the Environmental Impact Assessment (Forestry) (Scotland) Regulations 1999, forestry projects, such as afforestation and deforestation, which are likely to have significant effects on the environment can only proceed with the consent of the Forestry Commission. An environmental impact assessment of these projects is required.</p>

  <p>Consideration of existing WGS and felling approvals is the responsibility of the Forestry Commission as the competent authority and Scottish Natural Heritage have no powers in this respect. The Forestry Commission has no specific statutory powers to modify or revoke existing felling approvals. Nevertheless, if conditions specified in felling licences are not complied with in individual cases, the licence can be withdrawn.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is sympathetic to the possibility of a Children&#8217;s Commissioner but would wish to be clear about the functions a Commissioner might have and the added value he or she might bring. We will wait for the committee to report before considering the issue further.</p>

  <p>The Executive has no current plans to relocate staff from Edinburgh to Eilean Siar. Discussions have been held with Highlands and Islands Enterprise about opportunities across their area, with the agreement of the local authorities concerned.</p>

  <p>Last December I announced to Parliament that detailed reviews of the Edinburgh operations of six public bodies would be undertaken to individual timetables based on lease breaks and other operational factors. The reviews will determine the most efficient and effective locations for the work concerned. No specific areas of Scotland will be targeted and equally no areas will be ruled out.</p>

  <p>I also announced at that time that the Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care and the Scottish Social Services Council would not be located in Edinburgh. Mr Chisholm announced on 6 March that the national offices of these two new bodies will - if the Parliament passes the necessary legislation to enable them to be established - be located in Dundee. In addition there will be five further regional offices for the commission. The locations being considered are the Inverness area, the Aberdeen area, the Paisley area, the Hamilton/East Kilbride area and East Lothian. Decisions on regional offices for the commission will be announced shortly.</p>

  <p>The Computers for Teachers scheme is operated by Learning and Teaching Scotland on behalf of the Scottish Executive. All GTC registered teachers in publicly funded primary and secondary schools, including publicly funded special schools and units, are eligible to apply for a rebate of &#163;200 against the cost of a modern computer. The payment is a taxable benefit, but the Scottish Executive has made arrangements to settle the tax and National Insurance centrally. No liability will fall on the individual teachers.</p>

  <p>In the first phase of the scheme, which finished in March 2000, 4,003 teachers were supported at a total cost of &#163;1,146,324.</p>

  <p>The second phase has just concluded and final payments are being made. 6,133 teachers have been supported in this phase, at an estimated cost of &#163;1,711,979.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council&#8217;s proposals for redistributing funding among institutions and subjects in its recent interim report on teaching funding are consistent with the Executive&#8217;s policy objectives, in particular those relating to the development of the knowledge economy.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Higher Education Funding Council (SHEFC) issued a consultation paper with its proposals for teaching funding on 19 December and a further paper providing more information on 9 February. It has not issued an interim report on teaching funding. The consultation period has just concluded and the council is considering its proposals in the light of the response to this and the need to minimise disruption and deliver the Executive&#8217;s priorities. I have asked the council to keep me in touch with developments prior to any final decisions being taken.</p>

  <p>The teaching funding consultation paper included proposals for the introduction of premiums to institutions for students from under-represented groups and disabled students. SHEFC published its allocation for academic year 2001-02 at the end of March which will rise from &#163;618 million this year to &#163;673 million and included a 5% premium on teaching grant to improve the retention and progression of students from under-represented groups at a cost of over &#163;3 million and &#163;1 million to support disabled students. These are consistent with our priorities and will support the development of the knowledge economy.</p>

  <p>I also welcome the fact that the allocation includes a 4% increase on the units of funding for teaching and research, 1,000 additional funded places, an additional &#163;10 million for science research infrastructure, an additional &#163;2.1 million to improve IT infrastructure, &#163;2.5 million to support the development of greater pervasiveness of ICT, and a recurrent stream of funding to support knowledge transfer including an additional &#163;2 million for conversion of previous initiatives. All of these are consistent with the priorities of the Executive and will support the development of the knowledge economy.</p>

The Review RIA will ensure all regulations introduced by the Scottish Executive which impact on business will remain &quot;fit-for-purpose&quot;.

  <p>The air quality objectives set under the Air Quality Strategy are kept under a rolling review. Consideration is currently being given to whether it will be possible to set a more stringent objective for particles than the existing one for PM <sub>10</sub> . The Scottish Executive hopes to be in a position to consult on a new objective for particles this summer.</p>

  <p>The Expert Panel on Air Quality Standards (EPAQS) was set up in 1991 to advise the Government on air quality standards. As part of the current review of particles, the panel was asked to consider whether a different component of the particle mixture in air would be more appropriate for an air quality standard for the UK.</p>

  <p>The panel published a report entitled <i>Airborne Particles: What is the appropriate measurement on which to base a standard?</i> on 3 April 2001. The report can be viewed at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.environment.detr.gov.uk/airq/aqs">http://www.environment.detr.gov.uk/airq/aqs</a></p>

  <p>and copies are available from the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre). The panel concluded that the particle fraction PM<sub>10</sub> remains the most appropriate. In doing so they noted that the health studies suggest that the toxic effects of particles are not limited to fine particles, but that bigger particles are also associated with effects. Measurement of PM<sub>10</sub> allows the capture of both the fine and course fraction.</p>

  <p>However, the panel recommended that the development of a standard which better represents the toxic components of the particle mixture might be technically possible with further research. We have already introduced measurement of a wide range of particle metrics (including PM<sub>2.5</sub>, particle numbers, chemical composition and a trial on surface area measurements) into the national monitoring networks to support such studies in the future.</p>

  <p>A range of funding support is available, in recognition of the valuable contribution that community health projects and initiatives can make. Each year, as part of the Section 16B Grant Award Scheme, some &#163;4 million is provided to voluntary sector local initiatives by health boards (in addition to the funding provided at national level by the Scottish Executive). Health boards have also been advised that their allocations from the new Health Improvement Fund should be invested in projects and services that have been discussed with local partner organisations, including voluntary/community agencies, and that those allocations may be invested through such partner organisations. A further &#163;34.5 million is being made available from the lottery-supported New Opportunities Fund, to facilitate the creation of a network of Healthy Living Centres in communities across Scotland: the first four were announced by Susan Deacon last November and further successes have brought the total to 10.</p>

  <p>As part of their annual benchmarking exercise, Scottish Enterprise produces an ICT connectivity indicator that shows the proportion of companies using a website, e-mail and/or Electronic Data Interchange. Figures are currently available for 1998, 1999 and 2000. Neither the public resources nor the burden on businesses required to conduct this exercise on a monthly and quarterly basis could be justified.</p>

  <p>There are, however, other sources of e-commerce statistics available for Scotland. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce, for example, have recently added e-commerce questions to their quarterly surveys. In May, the Office for National Statistics is due to publish the results of a survey of interconnectivity and the level of sales over the internet, which will provide information at a regional level.</p>

The council project has been fully funded.</p>

  <p>The kiosks are based upon a product provided by &quot;StartHere&quot;. The support from the fund will allow the council to cover the costs of the kiosks and to provide additional content relating to services in the Dumfries and Galloway area.</p>

  <p>In addition to the agreed funding for the council project, the Scottish Executive will provide additional funds to support the development of national content for the &quot;StartHere&quot; kiosks.

  <p>The revised <i>NPPG 1: The Planning System</i> , <i> </i> published in November 2000, includes guidance on the need for brevity, clarity and precision when preparing development plans and on the importance of managing the process of the preparation of plans more efficiently. It also encourages planning authorities to set and publish demanding timetables for the preparation of plans, and gives examples of what those timetables should be. This guidance echoes a number of the research recommendations.</p>

  <p>The researchers&#8217; emphasis on the need for better management of the process is also reflected in the shift in focus of the work of the Scottish Executive Planning Audit Unit (PAU) from development control to development planning. The PAU has carried out pilot audits of three planning authorities&#8217; development plan procedures, to identify best practice and changes that might be made to improve procedures. An overview of preliminary findings is contained in the <i>Third Annual Report of the Planning Audit Uni</i>t, which was published on 30 March and copies are available from the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre. The findings will be fed into the current review of strategic planning. Consultation will take place this summer on the review.</p>

  <p>Capital allocations are designed to meet both routine expenditure (such as maintenance and the replacement of vehicles) and the cost of large projects.</p>

  <p>Strathclyde&#8217;s allocation for 1999-2000 included &#163;3.528 million for major work at the Saltcoats and Kirkintilloch stations as well as Phase 3 of the force&#8217;s Traffic Complex. In addition, the force received &#163;1.060 million to help with millennium compliance costs, leaving &#163;5.144 million for routine expenditure.</p>

  <p>In 2000-01, &#163;3 million was set aside for the completion of Phase 3 of the Traffic Complex, leaving &#163;6.076 million for routine capital expenditure, an increase of over 18% on the previous year&#8217;s figure for similar costs. The allocation of resources is an operational matter for the Chief Constable, in consultation with the Joint Police Board, to decide upon. Given the increase in resources for routine expenditure, however, any impact on operational performance is likely to have been beneficial.</p>

  <p>No estimates are available of the additional tourist revenue generated directly by Scotland House.</p>

  <p>Scotland House is an inclusive body that involves a range of interests. Its principal components are the Scottish Executive EU Office (SEEUO) and Scotland Europa, which in turn houses a number of its subscribers. Scotland House does not have direct responsibility for generating additional tourist revenue. Most of the bodies located in Scotland House have the following functions in common:</p>

  <p>Maintaining close contact with key people in the EU institutions, including the Scottish MEPs</p>

  <p>Following the European legislative process and highlighting issues of relevance to Scotland</p>

  <p>Sharing information and resources between the Scotland House residents as appropriate</p>

  <p>Increasing the range and depth of information on EU affairs flowing back to Scottish bodies &#8211; including visitscotland</p>

  <p>Advising Scottish bodies about EU procedures and how to become more involved &#8211; including the highlighting of Scottish best practice in Europe.</p>

  <p>Scotland House is also active in raising Scotland&#8217;s profile in the EU. This has included some tourism aspects, namely:</p>

  <p>visitscotland promoted a travel offer between Scotland and the Benelux countries to coincide with the October 1999 Scotland Week organised by Scotland House</p>

  <p>Scotland House has supported a number of festivals/events celebrating links between the Low Countries and Scotland and also supported tourism to Scotland</p>

  <p>Scotland House recently organised a cultural tourism seminar examining other European approaches to cultural tourism with a view to developing further the Scottish approach</p>

  <p>Literature from visitscotland is prominently displayed in Scotland House for all visitors and enquiries.</p>

  <p>In addition, visitscotland is a member of Scotland Europa and both it and the Tourism Cluster Group of Scottish Enterprise are alerted to all EU opportunities and developments by Scottish Enterprise International Operations.</p>

  <p>We make no direct subsidy for municipal waste incineration. However, under the Scottish Renewables Obligation (SRO), there is a subsidy towards the cost of electricity generated by a SRO project. The only SRO energy-from-waste plant in operation in Scotland is at Baldovie in Dundee. For reasons of commercial confidentiality, we cannot provide detailed information in the form of the breakdown required.</p>

  <p>Level Playing Field Support, however, has been provided over the past two years to Dundee City Council for the Baldovie energy-from-waste Public/Private Partnership project.

  <p>The definition of recycling, for the purpose of setting targets, is being considered by the Recycling Targets Group which has been established by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and is made up of representatives from SEPA, the Scottish Executive, COSLA, local authorities and Recycling Market Development Scotland (REMADE). A consultation paper will be issued to local authorities in the next few weeks and a final report issued later in the year.</p>

  <p>Researchers within the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe) each have responsibility for providing research services across a range of subject areas. These 18 subject specialists currently work in pairs, with each pair covering one of the following portfolios: civil law &amp; parliament; economic development &amp; lifelong learning; education, family law &amp; the arts; environment &amp; transport; health &amp; public finance; housing, planning &amp; social inclusion; law and order &amp; legal aid; local government, social work &amp; voluntary sector; rural affairs &amp; conservation. The research service is in the process of restructuring into teams of four or five researchers covering wider subject portfolios. This will provide a greater degree of flexibility and enable staff to cope with vacancies and other unanticipated demands.</p>

  <p>The Senior Research Specialist covering the rural affairs<i> </i>&amp;<i> </i>conservation portfolio began a two-year secondment to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency in November 2000. A replacement to cover this secondment period started work with SPICe on 17th April 2001. Included within this portfolio are the subjects of land, ecology, agriculture and animal experiments.</p>

  <p>There are currently two vacant Senior Research Specialist posts, covering the portfolios of transport &amp; the environment and education, family law &amp; the arts. When a vacancy exists relating to a particular portfolio, a designated Research Specialist, with assistance from SPICe colleagues, takes responsibility for providing research services relating to that portfolio until the post is filled.</p>

  <p>An updated edition of <i>Who Does What in SPICe</i> for spring 2001 is now available on the Parliament&#8217;s intranet. This provides guidance to MSPs and their researchers as to whom they should approach if they have a particular enquiry.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe) has a complement of 41 posts. This includes 20 staff in the information services team (which includes reference, resources and document supply services) and 20 in the research team, 18 of whom are responsible for specific subjects across the range of areas devolved to the Parliament.</p>

  <p>The priority for SPICe researchers is to provide research support to the Parliament&#8217;s committees. This includes general advice and support in the work of each committee, specific SPICe briefings and on occasion the commissioning of external research. SPICe researchers also prepare briefings on Bills and in relation to key parliamentary debates. They also respond to enquiries from individual MSPs, and provide research support to other areas of the Parliament. Currently there are no devolved subject areas that do not have at least one designated researcher. Information and briefing on reserved matters is provided at a reference level, and there are no researchers assigned to reserved areas.</p>

  <p>Full details of SPICe services are available on the Parliament&#8217;s intranet.</p>
