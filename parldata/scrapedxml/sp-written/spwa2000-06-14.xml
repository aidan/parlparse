  <p>No file is totally closed. Any file may be made available to those who have a legal right to see it, and any decision on access by researchers is made in the spirit of the Code of Practice on Access to Scottish Executive Information introduced on 1 July 1999.</p>

  <p>It is the policy of the Scottish Executive that as few files as possible should be subject to a &quot;closure&quot; period of more than thirty years, and a programme carried out in 1995 to examine all files in this category ensured that only very sensitive, mainly personal ones, are still not openly accessible.</p>

  <p>Policy in this whole area will be reviewed in the context of the forthcoming Freedom of Information legislation.</p>

  <p>The comparisons made by OECD can only be regarded as approximate as for most countries the figures used are based on a prescribed curriculum.</p>

  <p>The figures stated for Scotland by OECD represent only the <i>minimum</i> of time to be spent on maths and science contained in the Structure and Balance guidelines. The actual curriculum data for Scotland for 1997 indicates that pupils in S1 and S2 spent 22% of their time on maths and science rather than the recommended minimum time of 20% assumed by the OECD.</p>

  <p>Within the Scottish curriculum guidelines there is a 20% flexibility factor which schools are encouraged to use for activities which reflect their own needs and circumstances. Schools may choose to allocate some of this time to maths and science.</p>

  <p>In Scotland there is no statutory amount of time required for any curriculum area or subject. However, in the 5-14 curriculum (covering P1-S2), national guidelines recommend that education authorities and schools have a minimum time allocation of 15% for the expressive arts (including physical education). In addition, Scottish curriculum guidelines include a 20% flexibility factor which schools are encouraged to use for activities which reflect their own needs and circumstances. Some schools may choose to use some of this time for physical education.</p>

  <p>For secondary schools approximately 90 minutes of physical education per week is received by S1 and S2 pupils and 115 minutes per week by S3 and S4 pupils. For S5 and S6 pupils there is no nationally recommended minimum time allocation for physical education. However, around 5,500 pupils in S5 and S6 participated in National Certificate or Higher courses in physical education this year.</p>

  <p>Information on the average number of hours of physical education received by pupils in primary schools is not collected by the Scottish Executive.</p>

These grants were made, in the main, to new start-up and very early stage businesses.</p>

  <p>A further &pound;1 million was provided to new businesses under the Scottish Executive&#8217;s SPUR Programme in 1998-99, &pound;1.5 million in 1999-2000 and &pound;0.2 million in the first two months of the current financial year.</p>

  <p>Financial assistance under the RSA scheme is available to both new start and established businesses. Data on assistance offered under RSA, however, is not collated on the basis of the date of formation of the companies applying for grant.</p>

  <p>Financial assistance for new start-up businesses from local enterprise companies and their agents is an operational matter for Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise and I have asked the chairmen of both organisations to reply to the member. A copy of the reply will be placed in SPICe.</p>

  <p>Under the terms of the nuclear site licence issued by the Health &amp; Safety Executive (HSE), the licensee, British Nuclear Fuels plc will be required to put in place a decommissioning plan. This would be expected to cover plans to remediate contamination on the nuclear licensed site and should show how radioactive wastes will be stored in a manner whereby the waste is immobilised and the need for maintenance, monitoring or other human intervention is minimised until all nuclear materials, including waste, have been removed from the site.</p>

  <p>Before starting decommissioning, British Nuclear Fuels plc will also be required to make an assessment of the environmental effects of their proposed decommissioning plan, to consult the public, and to have consent from the HSE. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) and local authorities would be consulted by the HSE in that process and HSE would be required to take account of any written representations from members of the public. SEPA&#8217;s authorisation would be required in advance for disposal of any radioactive waste on or from the site or its vicinity.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has already developed significant new measures to ensure the protection and enhancement of nature. We are promoting legislation on National Parks to secure the sustainable management of large parts of Scotland&#8217;s natural heritage. We have reformed agricultural support, including the development of a new Rural Stewardship Scheme to support farmers&#8217; management of nature. We have announced an increase in SNH&#8217;s budget from &pound;39 million in 1999-2000 to &pound;46.5 million in 2001-02 to support positive management of the natural heritage.</p>

  <p>We remain committed to fulfilling our obligations under the EC Habitats and Birds Directives to protect the most important natural places in Scotland. That is why I am today identifying further sites as possible Special Areas of Conservation under the EC Habitats Directive.</p>

  <p>Before I decide whether to propose the 90 sites in the table below to the European Commission as candidate SACs, I want to ensure that owners and occupiers and other interested parties have been consulted about the scientific case for the proposal. The list is based on scientific advice from Scottish Natural Heritage and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee and I believe it is substantially complete. But I am also open to consideration of scientific evidence about any exceptions to the completeness of this list. I shall not make a final decision about proposing any sites to the Commission until I have considered the results of consultation.</p>

  <p>I believe we can still do more for Scotland&#8217;s nature. I intend as soon as possible to publish a policy statement setting out further reforms, so that we can work better with Scottish communities to look after our natural heritage. I intend in that paper to propose measures to tackle wildlife crime and measures to improve the way we work with local people to protect our most special natural places.</p>

  <p>Medical devices are regulated at UK level by the Medical Devices Agency who advise that there are no plans to alter policy in relation to the use of silicone gel breast implants. Such policy is determined on the basis of advice on the safety of these implants provided by the Independent Review Group convened by the UK Department of Health in May 1997. This group reported in June 1998 and continues to meet to review new information on the safety of silicone gel breast implants. To date the group&#8217;s conclusion remains that the risks associated with silicone gel breast implants are similar to those of other implants. Any new findings arising from the work carried out on behalf of the European Parliament will be considered by the Independent Review Group.</p>

  <p>Medical devices are regulated at UK level by the Medical Devices Agency. The Scottish Office was informed in February 1999 of the proposed withdrawal of these implants from the market in March 1999. An Independent Expert Group was established at that point to assess the clinical risk and recommend the most appropriate action to protect public health. The Scottish Executive has been kept informed of developments since then.</p>

  <p>Advice has been given to all health boards and NHS Trusts and an information handout has been prepared. Information is available through the NHS Helpline and a 24-hour helpline dealing specifically with this issue has been established. The Medical Devices Agency and the manufacturer are currently developing a care package for those affected and it is envisaged that all operations to remove the implants can be completed within one year. All costs will be met by the manufacturer.</p>

  <p>All expenditure on Individual Learning Accounts (ILAs) has been directed through the Enterprise Network.</p>

  <p>During 1999-2000 the Enterprise Network spent &pound;1.2 million on developing the ILA model and determining operational requirements, as well as piloting the design. This also included an allocation of &pound;0.4 million to Scottish Enterprise Grampian for its pilot, of which &pound;0.3 million was for the payment of incentives to ILA holders.</p>

  <p>Some further learning account projects were also run by a number of LECs, including Fife, during 1999-2000 using European Objective 4 funding together with their own discretionary funds. Information on the costs to individual LECs is not available.</p>

  <p>Whilst a number of spending commitments have been made in the current year, actual expenditure to date by the Enterprise Network as a whole, including the LECs, has been &pound;30,000.</p>

  <p>Quality Meat Scotland (QMS), which is not solely a meat promotional body, was formed by key meat and livestock industry interests in response to devolution. This was done in recognition that a single body would be more responsive to Scotland&#8217;s needs and to the particular challenges facing various sectors of our industry. I support the formation of QMS because I believe it will represent better value for levy money raised in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Information about the price paid for beta interferon by health boards is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>However, for a number of reasons, direct comparisons of prices of products of this type are misleading. They are often supplied direct to hospitals, making list prices less significant; some countries include distribution costs and some aspects of care within the list price while others account for them separately; and, because products are priced in the currency of the importing country, currency movements will affect the price paid.</p>

  <p>The <i>Programme for Government&#8217;s</i> commitment to deliver a part-time quality nursery place for every three-year-old whose parent wants it by 2002 applies to rural areas as it does to urban areas. We expect to meet this target.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive provides a rural supplement for pre-school education provision (&pound;6 million in 2000-01) to local authorities with significant rural areas. Almost 60% of three-year-old children in authorities in receipt of this rural supplement attend pre-school education. This is in line with Scotland as a whole.</p>

  <p>A complete answer to this question cannot be compiled without incurring disproportionate cost. However, relevant information relating to the three largest blocks of the Executive&#8217;s research expenditure is as follows:</p>

  <p>None of the &pound;132.9 million of research funding disbursed by the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council has been allocated to higher education institutions outwith Scotland;</p>

  <p>2.5% (by value &pound;1.34 million) of the Rural Affairs Department&#8217;s research contracts were awarded to bodies outwith Scotland;</p>

  <p>0.06% (by value &pound;0.15 million) of the research budgets administered by the Department of Health&#8217;s Chief Scientist Office was allocated to bodies outwith Scotland.</p>

  <p>This information relates to 1999-2000.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive recognises the difficult times affecting dairy farmers in Ayrshire. This is why the dairy sector was included in the recent special aid package announced on 30 March. The position is being kept under review. However, it is important to recognise that the nature of European Union dairy regime and the tightly drawn state aid rules mean that it is difficult to provide direct assistance outwith the normal rules.</p>

  <p>As part of the &pound;50 million package announced following the report of the Independent Committee of Inquiry into Student Finance, it has been agreed that personal contribution to tuition fees be abolished from autumn this year. This is a year earlier than recommended by the committee. This will apply to Scottish (and EU) full-time students already in further and higher education in Scottish institutions and those who start their course this year. These students will continue on the support arrangements which apply to them this year until they complete their course. Those who first enter higher education from 2001 will access the new student support and graduate endowment package which will provide targeted help for those who most need it.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive welcomes discounted fares initiatives such as the Moray Fare Travel Scheme which promotes greater accessibility to public transport for young people. Some public transport operators already offer a wide range of pricing initiatives and we expect that further development will be driven by operators&#8217; recognition of the potential commercial benefits in terms of increased patronage and revenue generation such initiatives can offer.</p>

  <p>A number of international aid/development agencies are based in Scotland. The Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations (SCVO), which receives support from the Scottish Executive, is assisting them to interface with DfID and to link with each other.</p>

Local authorities improved 22,554 of their own houses. The number improved by each authority is set out below. Resources go to authorities as landlords: the tenants do not receive grant. 16,050 households received a Warm Deal grant from Eaga, whose expenditure is not recorded by local authority area.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what estimate has been made of the cost to (a) business and (b) the Scottish Executive of implementing the EU Water Framework Directive and whether it will make a statement on the timescale for the implementation of this directive and the general impact it will have on Scotland.</p>

  <p>The negotiations on the proposed EC Water Framework Directive are not yet concluded.</p>

  <p>The Government commissioned consultants to undertake a cost/benefit study of implementing the proposed directive in the UK. A copy of their report, <i>Potential Costs and Benefits of Implementing the Proposed Water Resources Framework Directive</i>, has been placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 6683). The possible impacts of the proposed directive on business might include tighter controls on some waste water discharges, a system of controls on the abstraction and impoundment of water and the need to tackle environmental problems caused by diffuse pollution. Administrative, planning and monitoring costs would fall to central government and government agencies.</p>

  <p>The precise details of the timetable for implementation are still under negotiation. However, we currently expect that the requirement will be to phase implementation over the 10-16 years following adoption of the directive by the European Parliament and Council of Ministers, expected later this year. The Scottish Executive will consult extensively on its proposals for implementation. This will include consultation on regulatory impact appraisal, including costs.</p>

  <p>A number of organisations were consulted about the membership of the forum. In deciding on the membership I aimed to balance the experience, skills and backgrounds of the individuals with the need for the membership as a whole to cover the range of interests necessary to make the forum&#8217;s work a success. I look to individual members of the forum to contribute to the work of the forum so that it can reflect the views of communities and have access to wider networks; and have direct experience and understanding of the needs and experiences of the different minority groups in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The forum has met six times now in plenary, and the working groups have met on a number of occasions.</p>

  <p>No specific budget has been allocated for the forum; costs incurred are met from the Equality Unit&#8217;s budget for programmed expenditure.</p>
