  <p>The Executive has recently published an analysis of the public consultation on the recommendations in the report of the Scottish Charity Law Review Commission (the McFadden report). Whilst the majority of respondents agreed with the general thrust of the report&#146;s recommendations, it is clear that a number of the proposals need some refining if they are to be translated into durable practice.</p>

  <p>Officials are now approaching the organisations which have agreed to participate in the Charity Law Advisory Forum which I announced on 23 October 2001. The published analysis will provide important context for the forum&#146;s work. We will be expecting the forum to provide advice on the practical aspects of implementing the recommendations in the McFadden report to enable ministers to decide how best to proceed. That advice will be key, not only to the analysis of issues and proposals for legislation but also to the eventual successful implementation of reforms.</p>

  <p>In addition to the responses received to the public consultation on McFadden, the forum will have available to it the outcome of our Social Economy Review and any relevant recommendations arising from the Cabinet Office Performance and Innovation Unit&#146;s report on charities and not-for-profit organisations.</p>

  <p>The following organisations have agreed to be represented on the forum:</p>

  <p>Association of Charity Shops</p>

  <p>Association of Chief Officers of Voluntary Organisations in Scotland</p>

  <p>Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland</p>

  <p>British Heart Foundation</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive makes appointments to all posts excluding the Senior Civil Service in accordance with the principles set out in the code and without further reference to the commissioners. The Scottish Executive has therefore not consulted the Civil Service Commissioners before making any particular appointments at this level.</p>

  <p>In addition to its general health allocations, each NHS board receives earmarked funding for drug treatment services in line with the Arbuthnott Substance Misuse Formula. This formula takes account of deprivation and need, including population, age sex structure and service delivery costs due to remoteness. It is for each NHS board, in partnership with the relevant drug action team(s) and their constituent agencies, to direct its spending of these resources in line with local needs and priorities, taking into account other local spending decisions on drug misuse issues.</p>

This is not under active consideration currently.</p>

  <p>Two drugs, naltrexone hydrochloride and naloxone hydrochloride are similar in action in that they block the effects of opioids.</p>

  <p>Naloxone hydrochloride is used in overdosage with opioids. However, comprehensive figures for the number of patients who received this treatment are not available centrally. Data collected centrally relate to prescribed items dispensed in the community by community pharmacists and dispensing doctors.</p>

  <p>Naltrexone hydrochloride is used in the treatment of formerly opioid-dependent patients. In 2001, there were 2,041 prescribed items for naltrexone hydrochloride dispensed in the community. This figure does not take into account drugs dispensed by hospitals or hospital-based clinics.

  <p>The use of houses for multiple occupation is mainly driven by market forces. In that connection the Scottish Executive&#146;s role is to ensure as far as possible that the physical condition and management of such houses is to acceptable standards, giving protection to the tenants involved and to neighbours. The Executive introduced mandatory licensing for houses in multiple occupation in October 2000, and is currently reviewing the first year of operation of the licensing scheme.</p>

  <p>Some particular types of residential accommodation in multiple occupation are separately regulated under the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001. The Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 gives local authorities powers to provide discretionary grants for improvements by private owners including owners of houses in multiple occupation. Grants may also be paid specifically for the provision of fire escapes in houses in multiple occupation, and this will be extended to other means of escape from fire when Part 6 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 is commenced.</p>

  <p>The development funding for new housing provided by the Executive, through Communities Scotland, to Registered Social Landlords, funds a number of group homes where the occupants share facilities, usually with a care element. A small proportion of other housing provided with public funding is also likely to be occupied on a shared tenancy basis, in response to specific requests from prospective tenants.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally. Although some properties are built or adapted specifically for use as hostel type accommodation, it is not possible to distinguish how many other houses in any housing sector will be used for multiple occupation, since this is not necessarily determined by the design of the house.</p>

  <p>I am aware that constructive discussions are taking place at local level to resolve the difficulties at Carbeth which prompted the committee&#146;s report. All of us who are keen to see a fair and amicable settlement to this issue will hope for a positive outcome to the current discussions. I would not, however, wish to intervene in private negotiations, nor would it be appropriate to do so.</p>

  <p>I expect within the next few weeks to announce conclusions on the committee&#146;s report and the subsequent consultation. It is already clear however that there would be substantial drawbacks to any attempt to legislate in this area. Some of these were recognised by the committee itself. Such legislation would be contrary to fundamental principles of Scots law, in particular that leased land under a short lease reverts to the landlord at expiry of the lease and that property built on leased land belongs to the landlord. Moreover, legislation could not be retrospective or applicable to hutters only, and its promotion might precipitate changes to the ownership and management of comparable estates in Scotland which would be profoundly damaging to the interests of hutters.</p>

  <p>The names of the Scottish Executive departments have changed over the period reported. There have also been changes in the balance of functions between departments which will affect their demand for mail services.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive why monies are being collected under the Scottish Graduate Endowment Scheme, and whether such monies will be hypothecated and, if so, for what purpose.</p>

  <p>Monies will be collected under the Scottish Graduate Endowment Scheme because it is fair that graduates, who are the people who principally benefit from their higher education, should make a contribution to ensure that others can gain similar benefits.</p>

  <p>Section 2 of the Education (Graduate Endowment and Student Support)(Scotland) Act 2001 provides that the income arising from the graduate endowment will be used for the purposes of student support.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether teachers who retire now will receive a pension between 2% and 15% greater than teachers who retired previously with identical qualifications and length of service and what the reasons are for the position on this matter.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-04-24.31.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80183" speakername="Mr Andy Kerr" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0424.htm#17">

  <p>The formula for calculating teachers&#146; pensions has not changed recently. Teachers&#146; pensions are calculated on the basis of length of service and salary in the period before retirement, usually the last year of service. Pensions awarded to teachers on their retirement will, therefore, always reflect movements in salary levels.</p>
