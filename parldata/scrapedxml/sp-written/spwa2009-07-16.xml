  <p>To date, the Scottish Government has committed to invest over &pound;13 million in the CashBack for Communities programme which includes diversionary and participatory projects for young people across Scotland.</p>

  <p>&pound;3 million of this investment was allocated to YouthLink Scotland. Funding distributed through the YouthLink Scotland local youth project grant scheme is recorded by local authority.</p>

  <p>The following organisations in West Dunbartonshire received funding in rounds 1 and 2 after successful applications:</p>

</table></p>

  <p>This represents the full allocation to Argyll and Bute and so no awards were made in round 2.</p>

  <p>A further &pound;1 million has been allocated to YouthLink Scotland for a second grant programme which is currently open for applications.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Football Association (SFA) used &pound;8,800 and &pound;7,500 of their CashBack grants in West Dunbartonshire and Argyll and Bute respectively to deliver Midnight Football and Street Football in 2008-2009.</p>

  <p>Scottish Rugby are investing &pound;19,082 of CashBack funding in a range of diversionary school and club rugby activities in West Dunbartonshire and &pound;6,582 in Argyll and Bute.</p>

  <p>Basketballscotland is working to promote basketball participation across Scotland through the deployment of four regional co-ordinators funded by CashBack.</p>

  <p>The second culture strand of CashBack was announced in March 2009. The Creative Identities project is an 18-month programme of creative learning activities for young people targeting young carers in particular, but will be open to all young people. West Dunbartonshire is included in the West Central Programme Plan, which will be led by Glasgow-based partners Tramway and Glasgow Film Theatre. They have been allocated a total of &pound;343,600 to deliver projects across the region. Argyll and Bute is included in the Highlands and Islands Programme Plan, which will be lead by Eden Court and has been allocated a total of &pound;136,150.</p>

  <p>The environmental impact assessment being undertaken for the proposed scheme includes consideration of ecology and nature conservation. Ecological surveys have been carried out over an extensive corridor covering a wide array of species and habitats.</p>

  <p>Information regarding environmental surveys was published in a leaflet on the project website <a href="http://www.forthreplacementcrossing.info" target="_blank">www.forthreplacementcrossing.info</a> in March 2008. The results of these surveys have been used to inform the environmental impact assessment. The ecological assessment will be reported in the Environmental Statement to be published later in 2009.</p>

  <p>Reports to inform an Appropriate Assessment of impacts to the Forth Islands Special Protection Area (SPA) (including Leith Docks SPA), Firth of Forth SPA and River Teith Special Area of Conservation (SAC) are also being prepared.</p>

  <p>The European Commission on Human Rights has ruled that summary warrant procedure in Scotland, used for the recovery of local and other taxes, is compatible with Article 6 of the Convention. Assessments for tax are not civil rights protected by the Convention and summary warrants, and assessment for tax, can be challenged in court by various means. The Bankruptcy and Diligence etc. (Scotland) Act 2007 has increased safeguards by requiring debtors to be served with a formal charge for payment, to ensure more reliable notice of the grant of a summary warrant, before it can be enforced.</p>

  <p>In Scotland tax surcharges are levied on summary warrants for council tax, but the surcharge is a fixed charge designed to compensate for the lack of interest on arrears&mdash;and Scottish procedure remains compatible with the Convention.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-23794 on 26 May 2009. The European Commission has agreed that it would not be appropriate for information relating to its investigations to be published whilst investigations are live. The decision not to provide the information requested reflects that practice as well as EC Regulation No 1049/2001 and the freedom of information legislation.</p>

  <p>However, the Scottish Government remains committed to delivering a town centre to town centre passenger and vehicle service on this route. The Scottish Government is working hard to identify a solution for the route, and is keen to see the complex issues resolved at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>

  <p>Community engagement takes place through exhibitions, briefing sessions, group meetings, 1-2-1 meetings, newsletters, the project website and correspondence.</p>

  <p>Traffic studies for the Forth Replacement Crossing project have been undertaken using the Transport Model for Scotland (TMfS), with micro-simulation modelling to assess local traffic movement. The modelled base year is 2005 and the traffic model assignments were calibrated and validated using local traffic survey data which post dates the opening of the M9 spur and the removal of tolls on the Forth Road Bridge. This model was used for the DMRB Stage 2 Transport and Economic assessment work which has now been published on the project website at <a href="http://www.forthreplacementcrossing.info" target="_blank">www.forthreplacementcrossing.info</a> .</p>

  <p>A comparison of predicted traffic flows has been undertaken for the year after opening (2017). This compares the situation with and without the bridge. Verification and audit of this work is continuing.</p>

  <p>The environmental impact assessment being undertaken for the proposed scheme includes consideration of the potential effects on pedestrians, cyclists, equestrians and community facilities. The assessment includes the identification of local paths, core paths, rights of way, cycleways, National Cycle Routes, equestrian routes and key community and outdoor facilities within the study area. This information has been gathered through desk-based assessment, site visits and consultation with statutory and non-statutory organisations.</p>

  <p>The potential impacts on journey lengths, amenity value, community severance and outdoor access arising from the proposed scheme will be reported in Chapter 17 (Pedestrians, Cyclists, Equestrians and Community Effects) of the Environmental Statement to be published later in 2009.</p>

In common with the introduction of other new vaccine programmes a governance structure has been established to plan for the introduction and delivery of the Influenza A (H1N1) vaccine. This structure involves representatives from across the NHS and from partner delivery agencies, and work is currently underway to consider delivery models for the programme based on the most up to date information on expected vaccine delivery schedules.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how it expects local authorities to deliver home safety awareness and other home safety initiatives.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-07-16.S3W-24995.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80306" speakername="Fergus Ewing" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa0716.htm#8">

  <p>The Scottish Government takes the issue of home safety very seriously and is committed to promoting personal and community safety as expressed by the National Performance Framework through outcome 9: We live our lives free from crime, disorder and danger. Following the Concordat with local government, funding is no longer ring fenced for specific initiatives. This allows local authorities to identify local needs and priorities and direct resources appropriately. It is therefore the responsibility of local authorities and Community Safety Partnerships (CSPs) to set safety priorities (including home safety) and to measure the impact of these activities.</p>

  <p>At a national level, the National Community Safety Strategic Group (NCSSG), chaired by the Minister for Community Safety, brings together a range of partners to provide direction and address strategic challenges in all areas of community safety. Members of the group include the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA), COSLA, the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives and Senior Managers (SOLACE), the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland (ACPOS) and Chief Fire Officers Association in Scotland (CFOAS). Within this forum RoSPA plays a key role in providing strategic direction and challenge on issues of home safety.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will continue to support and encourage local government in their endeavours as well as continuing to work closely with RoSPA and other agencies to reduce the number of accidents in Scotland. The Scottish Government also provides funding (&pound;101,970 for 2009-10) to RoSPA to support a national home safety co-ordinator and home safety activities.</p>

  <p>At a local level there are a wide range of activities which take place to improve home safety across the population. Some examples follow.</p>

  <p>Fife</p>

  <p>The <em>Fife Cares</em> Child Safety Scheme has the aim of reducing the number of accidents in the home involving children. As part of the scheme families are offered a free child safety home risk assessment.</p>

  <p>Renfrewshire</p>

  <p>The West Johnstone Home Safety Project which provides new and expectant parents with the &lsquo;Buy Wise be Safe&rsquo; DVD which advises parents on a range of child safety issues to reduce unintentional injury rates in Renfrewshire.</p>

  <p>South Lanarkshire</p>

  <p>The Home Safety Cadet Scheme is an outreach programme which delivers a learning session specifically designed for P3 pupils. Through the programme, the profile of home safety is raised not only to pupils, but also to their families.</p>

  <p>Edinburgh</p>

  <p>The Risk Factory bases it activities on the principle that learning by experiencing situations is more memorable than just being told how to act. The Risk Factory allows pupils to discover how they react to a number of different scenarios including those that focus on home safety.</p>

  <p>The Planning etc. (Scotland) Act 2006 places a new duty on planning authorities to exercise their development planning functions with the objective of contributing to sustainable development. In the first instance, it is for planning authorities to consider how best to achieve this, in preparing each strategic development plan and local development plan and carrying out the related Strategic Environmental Assessment, as required by the Environmental Assessment (Scotland) Act 2005.</p>

  <p>Where there are outstanding objections to a plan, the 2006 act requires that an examination must be held. A reporter from the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Directorate of Planning and Environmental Appeals will hold the examination. If issues are raised around the way the content of the plan demonstrates compliance with the new duty, then they may be considered at the examination.</p>

  <p>As well as having a specific role in the final approval of Strategic Development Plans, Scottish Ministers are involved at each stage of the Strategic and Local Development Plan process and may intervene where there are concerns that statutory requirements are not being met. However, through close working between Scottish Government officials and planning authorities, as well as the early engagement of key agencies, it is hoped that late intervention can be avoided.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-24186 by Stewart Stevenson on 4 June 2009, whether Larbert residents of properties affected by passing coal trains are eligible for compensation under Part 1 of the Land Compensation (Scotland) Act 1973.</p>

  <p>Part 1 of the Land Compensation Act (Scotland) 1973 refers to compensation caused by the use of public works. The public works in this case is the Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine railway, which does not extend to Larbert. The railway at Larbert was operational prior to the opening of the Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine route. The Land Compensation (Scotland) Act 1973 also specifically excludes intensification of use as a result of the new railways works, such as the Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine Railway, as a ground for compensation under Section 9(7).</p>

  <p>The programme of proposed improvements to the Edinburgh-Glasgow rail corridor includes plans to provide two new services between Edinburgh and Glasgow Central serving both the Shotts and Carstairs routes.</p>

  <p>A new semi-fast service between Glasgow Central and Edinburgh Waverley (via Shotts) will be introduced from December 2009, and will significantly reduce journey times from the current 92 minutes to 65 minutes between the principal stations on the route.</p>

  <p>The introduction of an additional two-hourly service between Edinburgh and Glasgow through Carstairs is expected to be completed in 2014. The optimum calling pattern for this service has not yet been defined.</p>

  <p>Through Road Safety Scotland the Scottish Government is delivering a cohesive and co-ordinated suite of educational resources for children in Scottish schools, as well as road safety publicity campaigns and materials.</p>

  <p>Road Safety Scotland is implementing an overarching strategy for road safety education, <a href="http://www.road-safety.org.uk/education/national_strategy/index.asp" target="_blank"><br /> www.road-safety.org.uk/education/national_strategy/index.asp</a>, that sits within the Scottish Government framework for education &ndash; <em>Curriculum for Excellence</em>. The strategy covers all stages of a child&rsquo;s road safety education within both formal education and wider community settings, from pre-school through to secondary, and includes young people with additional support needs. It aims to ensure that a core of road safety is taught to all children, with overarching links to other areas within the curriculum.</p>

  <p>Road Safety Scotland has also developed a range of resources that are available, free of charge, for use in all schools from early years through to secondary and college, school clubs, youth and community groups, outreach education, and faculties of education. They are also available to adult literacy classes in Scotland. The resources enable children and young people to understand the nature of risk, employ safety strategies and perceive the road environment as a shared space. There are also a number of websites designed by Road Safety Scotland to support and enhance education resources and initiatives for children.</p>

  <p>As confirmed by the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning in her statement to Parliament on 17 June, we are now in discussion with COSLA and the Scottish Futures Trust to identify those local authorities and schools which will benefit from the first tranche of the programme, the first announcements of which will be made in September.</p>

  <p>In 2007, we first announced a new regime of capital funding for local authorities providing record amounts of capital funding over the local government settlement for 2008-09 to 2010-11.</p>

  <p>In December 2008, we announced that local authorities could accelerate capital expenditure from 2010-11. As a result around &pound;75 million of investment in schools is taking place earlier than it otherwise would.</p>

  <p>In February 2009, we indicated that we would be announcing later in the year the next phase of our school building programme, a commitment which the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning fulfilled in her statement to Parliament on 17 June 2009.</p>

  <p>Park and Ride schemes are delivered by Local Authorities and Regional Transport Partnerships.</p>

  <p>However, within the first six months of the 2007 election, the Scottish Government signed a Concordat with COSLA, which provided local authorities with record levels of funding over the spending review period 2008-11. This will empower local authorities to deliver improved local transport solutions through increased freedom over how they plan, manage and fund services on the basis of their assessment of local needs and priorities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has brought forward &pound;5 million in capital grant-in-aid to allow Strathclyde Partnership for Transport (SPT) to accelerate capital spending on Park &amp; Ride facilities across west central Scotland in 2009-10. This acceleration of funding from 2010-11 to the current year was announced by John Swinney, Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth during passage of the Budget Bill 2009-10.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Government has enhanced its manifesto commitment by taking Park and Ride into account under the Strategic Transport Projects Review (STPR) and it has also published <em>Park and Ride for Buses: A National Framework </em>on 30 June 2009.</p>

  <p>We are currently awaiting finalisation of an expert risk analysis on the pacific oyster, as part of the implementation of the GB Invasive Non-Native Species Strategy. When the GB risk analysis panel and GB programme board have signed off the analysis, it will be published on the Non-Native Species Secretariat website <a href="http://www.nonnativespecies.org/" target="_blank">http://www.nonnativespecies.org/</a> .</p>

  <p>Section 1 of the Nature Conservation Act 2004 places a duty on all public bodies and office holders to further the conservation of biodiversity and specifically to have regard to the United Nations Environmental Programme Convention on Biological Diversity. The UN Environmental Programme and the EU Biodiversity Action Plan both identify invasive non-native species as one of the most significant threats to biodiversity. The Scottish Government recently published a consultation paper on a proposed Wildlife and Natural Environment Bill that includes a description of the current legislation covering invasive non-native species in Scotland and proposed reforms.
