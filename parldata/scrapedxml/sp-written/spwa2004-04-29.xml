  <p>The quarterly GDP index that was revised in February 2004 was not used in any of the calculations in Government Expenditure and Revenues in Scotland (GERS) 2001-02. The estimates of GVA (GDP at basic prices) used in GERS are the annual estimates of the cash value of GVA produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) as part of regional accounts.

  <p>The Wanless Report, published in April 2002, concluded that private funding mechanisms, such as voucher schemes, tended to be more expensive and less equitable than the current model of financing the NHS. They are also regressive since those with the greatest health needs pay the most.</p>

In addition, Scottish ministers recently appointed new lay members to the Scottish Solicitors&#8217; Discipline Tribunal and Faculty of Advocates Disciplinary Tribunal following an open selection process involving advertisement of the vacancies in the press.</p>

  <p>Other measures recommended by the committee, for example, strengthening the statutory powers of the Scottish Legal Services Ombudsman, would require legislation. On 5 March 2004, I wrote to the convenor of the Justice 1 Committee confirming that the Executive would draw on the recommendations of the former Justice 1 Committee in developing an agenda of reform to improve complaints handling by the legal profession in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Executive will invest &#163;65 million in affordable housing in rural areas in 2004-05 to fund 1,408 houses. This is the highest percentage share of the programme ever allocated to rural areas having increased from 20% in 1999-2000 to 26% in 2004-05. The Executive is also conducting a review of affordable housing supply which will identify ways to address imbalances between supply and need where these occur.</p>

  <p>As part of our work on Choose Life, we commissioned work in February to begin establishing the territory for a series of research reviews. The first phase of this is to explore the views of local, national and international researchers in the field of suicide and suicide prevention. This will be completed by June. Following this work, further reviews will be commissioned, where there is reliable evidence to suggest gaps in information.</p>

  <p>In January 2004, the Mental Health Research Team commissioned a scoping exercise on behalf of Choose Life. The project, which will report to the Executive in June 2004, aims to explore the interests and areas of expertise of centres and individuals focusing on suicide-related research (nationally and internationally) and to invite experts to suggest the territory and focus for a series of reviews to collate and co-ordinate the existing evidence base. The reviews will be commissioned later this year and primary research will be commissioned as soon as gaps in the evidence base have been identified.</p>

  <p>The Effective Interventions Unit has commissioned a National Investigation into Drug Related Deaths in Scotland during 2003, on behalf of the Substance Misuse Division. The investigation will involve the collection of detailed information on the clinical and social circumstances surrounding each drug related death, including suicides.</p>

  <p>There is a growing market for tourism businesses which can demonstrate their green credentials to visitors.
