  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether all organisations and GPs involved with problem drug misusers now use SMR25a and SMR25b forms and what percentage of each is completed electronically.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2011-02-09.S3W-39037.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80306" speakername="Fergus Ewing" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-11/wa0209.htm#1">

  <p>Scottish Morbidity Record (SMR) 25a submissions can be made using either paper forms or by submitting an electronic form to NHS Information Services Division (ISD) Scotland. SMR25b submissions can only be completed electronically.</p>

  <p>At present, ISD Scotland gathers submissions of SMR25a (initial assessment) and SMR25b (follow-up assessment) forms from all services that provide a &quot;comprehensive or specialist assessment of a client&rsquo;s care/treatment needs in relation to drug misuse&quot;.</p>

  <p>For those services that meet this definition:</p>

  <p>a. Statutory (includes all NHS and local authority services) and voluntary drug treatment services:</p>

  <p>SMR25a forms are received from all statutory and voluntary drug treatment services in Scotland. Approximately 70% of these SMR25a submissions are completed electronically.</p>

  <p>In Greater Glasgow and Clyde and Aberdeen City approximately 65% and 75% respectively of statutory and voluntary drug treatment services currently submit SMR25a forms electronically to ISD Scotland.</p>

  <p>Outwith Greater Glasgow and Clyde and Aberdeen City, approximately 95% of statutory and voluntary drug treatment services currently submit SMR25a forms electronically to ISD.</p>

  <p>SMR25b forms are only submitted (electronically) by services who are also submitting electronic SMR25a forms. The vast majority of services that are submitting SMR25a forms electronically are also submitting SMR25b forms.</p>

  <p>ISD is working with data providers throughout Scotland to ensure that, as soon as possible, all services that provide a &quot;comprehensive or specialist assessment of a client&rsquo;s care/treatment needs in relation to drug misuse&quot; are submitting electronic SMR25a and SMR25b forms to ISD Scotland.</p>

  <p>b. Primary care providers (including GPs):</p>

  <p>SMR25a paper form submissions are received from a limited number of primary care providers. No electronic SMR25a or SMR25b submissions are received from primary care providers.</p>

  <p>ISD will shortly be following up its initial contact with GPs with the aim of reaching a point where all relevant GPs are submitting SMR25a paper forms to ISD. After this has been achieved ISD will work with these GPs with the aim of reaching a point where they are all submitting SMR25a and SMR25b data electronically.</p>

  <p>c. Prisons:</p>

  <p>Since 1 April 2010, drug treatment services within all 13 publicly funded Scottish prisons make electronic SMR25a and SMR25b submissions. At present, the two private prisons in Scotland do not currently submit any SMR25a or SMR25b data to ISD.</p>

  <p>ISD will shortly be engaging with the drug treatment services in the two private prisons with the aim of reaching a point where they are submitting SMR25a and SMR25b data electronically.</p>

  <p>The matter is reserved and therefore the information requested is not held centrally by Scottish Government.</p>

  <p>However, some figures for the UK are produced by the UK Department for Energy and Climate Change, and can be found at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/statistics/prices/prices.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/statistics/prices/prices.aspx</a>.</p>

  <p>Some external organisations also produce information on fuel prices, but these are not official statistics and are not verified by Scottish Government. The AA, for example, publishes a monthly <em>Fuel Price Report</em>, which contains figures for countries and regions of the UK as well as for a range of European and non-European countries. The latest report (January 2011) can be found at: <a href="http://www.theaa.com/motoring_advice/fuel/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.theaa.com/motoring_advice/fuel/index.html</a>.</p>

  <p>It is for each local authority to allocate the financial resources available to it on the basis of its statutory obligations and local needs and priorities. In doing so, local authorities will of course take account of the terms agreed between the Scottish Government and COSLA&rsquo;s leadership for the 2011-12 local government finance settlement.</p>

  <p>Staff from Waterwatch Scotland would be transferred to Consumer Focus Scotland on the commencement of the relevant provisions of the Public Service Reform (Scotland) Act 2010. A commencement order for these provisions can only be made after the Scottish Parliament elections in May 2011. To ensure the smooth transfer of business and staff the Scottish Government has agreed a planned transfer date of 1 July 2011 with Waterwatch Scotland, Consumer Focus Scotland and the Scottish Public Service Ombudsman.</p>

  <p>The UK Government will shortly be launching a consultation on its proposals for consumer advocacy and has made clear that Consumer Focus will continue to function well into 2012. The Scottish Government is in discussions with the UK Government and Consumer Focus Scotland as to the best way to maintain strong advocacy on a range of consumer interests, including water.</p>

The milk is supplied by Graham&rsquo;s Family Dairy, which is based in Bridge of Allan. The milk supplied is procured from 70 Farm Assured farms all located within Scotland. Due to the milk being supplied via our catering service provider, we are unable to state the average price paid per litre as this information is commercially sensitive.</p>
