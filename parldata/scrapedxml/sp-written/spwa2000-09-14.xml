  <p>I am pleased to report good progress on these issues. The census date for the identification of all bovines in Scotland was last weekend and the process of cleaning up this data and entering on to the Cattle Traceability System (CTS) database has started. The aim is for completion by end-December 2000. I very much welcome the industry-wide support given to this exercise particularly at such a busy time.</p>

  <p>Once completed this will provide a computerised record of all bovines in Scotland with unique identification numbers &#8211; which is the starting point for a fully electronic system.</p>

  <p>I announced on 22 June a short consultancy to identify the industry&#8217;s key data requirements and I have today put a copy of the final report into SPICe. It identifies industry key data requirement and also the arrangements necessary to allow electronic access to the CTS database. I am pleased to report that access systems, consistent with those recommended in the report, are already under development. I will be able to announce introduction of the new system within the next few months.</p>

  <p>In parallel, work has been progressing on electronic identification. So far this has concentrated on detailed technical aspects of the systems themselves, to ensure that workable and durable arrangements are identified. Again I will be able to make an announcement about these arrangements within the next few months.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s Rural Petrol Stations Grant Scheme provides a source of funding to rural petrol station proprietors to enable them to install LPG tanks and dispensers. Outwith the Highlands and Islands the scheme is administered by Scottish Enterprise through its Local Enterprise Company network and applications in the first instance should be made to the Local Enterprise Company.</p>

  <p>There are currently no provisions in Scots or UK law covering liability for damage caused specifically by genetically modified organisms. The ability of an individual to secure compensation for damage allegedly caused by GMO releases has not been tested in the courts. However, under the terms of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, there are powers to prosecute the consent holder where the limitations and conditions attached to a deliberate release consent are breached.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&#8217;s main priority is to protect human health and the environment. The farm scale trials are the latest in a comprehensive series of risk assessments designed to tell us what impact, if any, the management of GM crops will have on the environment and biodiversity.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) have been offered additional resources to ensure the efficient running of the awards system on several occasions over the past year. The Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning and I have asked our officials to discuss with SQA urgently their resource needs both for this and subsequent years.</p>

  <p>The recruitment of markers is an operational issue for the Scottish Qualifications Authority and does not require approval by the Scottish Executive. As I said in my statement on 6 September, I was informed by SQA that they have now identified eight probationary teachers who were used as markers this year. The normal quality assurance checks had been applied to their work before the issue of examination results and this resulted in the performance of all of the markers being placed in the top two categories of quality used by SQA. I received all of that information last week. The independent inquiry which I have commissioned will look at recruitment of markers and will make recommendations about how procedures should operate in future.</p>

  <p>All education authorities in Scotland have guidelines and procedures for Child Protection to ensure the safety and wellbeing of children and young people and to protect those adults working with them.</p>

  <p>Schools also play a part in the prevention of child abuse through the teaching they offer. Within the curriculum, health education, personal and social development and religious and moral education can all serve as vehicles for considering aspects of physical, social and emotional wellbeing. Schools should keep parents, carers and other agencies informed about school child protection policies and procedures and about the content of personal safety programmes.</p>

  <p><i>A Commitment to Protect - Supervising Sex Offenders in the Community</i> recommended amongst other things that all education authorities should have in place a personal safety programme promoting pupils&#8217; skills, knowledge and understanding to assist them in living safely and feel empowered to reject inappropriate behaviour. Practical advice on this recommendation is being developed by the Expert Panel on Sex Offending chaired by Lady Cosgrove. We look forward to receiving the panel&#8217;s report in due course.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has an ambitious programme to work in partnership with the voluntary sector. We welcome the substantial and growing contribution that the sector makes to Scottish life and we have taken early action to establish the modern legal, financial, and infrastructure framework that will allow the voluntary sector to prosper and the social economy in Scotland to reach its full potential.</p>

  <p>We have implemented the Scottish Compact to improve the effectiveness of our relationship with the sector, and our funding of the sector, direct and indirect, stands at &pound;300 million.</p>

  <p>We have also launched the Active Communities strategy, with a particular focus on excluded groups, to encourage volunteering and community participation.</p>

  <p>The water authorities are conducting a consultation exercise on proposals to withdraw relief on water and sewerage charges from certain customers. The exercise follows my intervention last year to delay for one year the withdrawal of relief in a number of cases. As part of that intervention, I required any further proposals of this type to be the subject of consultation with all customers that might be affected. The current consultation exercise is in line with that requirement.</p>

  <p>Under the Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994, the water authorities are required to endeavour not to show any undue preference or discrimination in respect of particular groups of customers. It is against this background that the authorities are conducting the present consultation exercise. The Executive believes that where reliefs are to be withdrawn, withdrawal should be phased to ease the immediate impact and those customers affected by withdrawal should be given sufficient warning so that they can make plans to meet increased bills.</p>

  <p>In common with all public bodies the water authorities are charged with operating procurement procedures which deliver value for money. Broadly all goods and services should be acquired by competition - section 4.5 of the finance section of <i>The Scottish Water Authorities: Management and Financial Memoranda</i> sets out the policy in more detail. There are no specific references to the bundling of contracts, to which the general principles apply, and there are no plans to make specific provision. A copy of the document is available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre.</p>

  <p>There is no daily cut-off time by which answers to written questions have to be made and in practice most answers are received by the Chamber Desk at the end of the working day. It is then necessary for the Chamber Desk to group questions by subject matter for the daily written answers report, prior to sending the answers to the Central Distribution Office (CDO) so that they can appear on the website. In practice, therefore, the daily written answers report cannot appear on the website until the day after answers are received.</p>

  <p>Exceptionally, some answers are received by the Chamber Desk earlier in the day and these include answers through which the Executive chooses to make an announcement by means of an answer to a written question. In response to concerns that MSPs were not alerted to such announcements the day they are made, the Parliamentary Bureau agreed the current arrangement whereby written answers are placed on the Intranet (SPEIR) when they are received, enabling MSPs and their staff to have access to Executive announcements given in answers to parliamentary questions as soon as practically possible. This arrangement has given rise to some duplication of functions and parliamentary staff are reviewing current practice with a view to improving efficiency.<br /></p>
