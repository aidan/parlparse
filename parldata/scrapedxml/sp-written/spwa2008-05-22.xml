  <p>This information is not held centrally. Previous estimates of the number of laboratory tests directly connected with alcohol misuse in Scotland have been based on the number of GP consultations for alcohol misuse derived from Practice Team Information (PTI). The small number of participating PTI practices prevents analysis at health board level.</p>

  <p>Based on an estimate of 130,250 GP consultations connected to alcohol misuse in 2006-07, and assuming two laboratory tests per consultation, the <em>Cost of Alcohol Use and Misuse in Scotland</em> report estimated there to have been 260,250 laboratory tests in Scotland connected to alcohol misuse at a cost of &pound;840,000.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is supportive of any proposals to build on existing child alert systems to provide a more efficient and effective exchange of information. The Scottish Government has had no discussions with MEPs on proposals for an EU-wide child alert system, which are at an early stage. We will contribute fully to discussions at EU level as these proposals develop.</p>

  <p>There is already international co-operation with regard to missing children and the National Missing Persons Bureau is working with Interpol and Europol to create a co-ordinated network of child rescue alert systems.</p>

  <p>Since May 2007 I have met with a number of equality organisations and discussed a wide range of issues. Time does not allow me to provide a comprehensive account of those organisations here and now but include:</p>

  <p>Inclusion Scotland, Capability Scotland and others to discuss independent living and how progress can be made towards increasing choice and control for disabled people, in July 2007</p>

  <p>I attended the Positive Action in Housing AGM on 7 September 2007. As you will know, PAiH play a lead role in lobbying and advocating for the housing needs of people from minority ethnic and refugee communities.</p>

  <p>In December last year, I met with representatives from STUC Women&rsquo;s Committee, Scottish Women&rsquo;s Convention and Scottish Women&rsquo;s Budget Group to discuss how to tackle the gender pay gap.</p>

  <p>I have chaired three meetings of the National Group to Address Violence Against Women, in June and November 2007 and February 2008.</p>

  <p>Also in February, I met with Stonewall Scotland and spoke at their conference on tackling work place discrimination.</p>

  <p>Earlier this month I met with the Yom Hashoah Glasgow Jewish Representative Council.</p>

  <p>As for my colleagues, the Minister for Children and Early Years met with &quot;For Scotland&rsquo;s Disabled Children&quot; for the second time on 20 March this year, to discuss improving life chances of disabled children and providing families with appropriate levels of support.</p>

  <p>The Deputy First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing met with Ethnic Enable earlier this month to hear about its work, meet with volunteers and discuss issues of multiple discrimination. Ethnic Enable is a disability organisation run by and for disabled people from minority ethnic communities.</p>

  <p>She also met with BEMIS in January this year to discuss their work, in particular with respect to the voluntary sector.</p>

  <p>The Minister for Europe, External Affairs and Culture met with LGBT Youth last Saturday to discuss human rights and LGBT equality.</p>

  <p>The Minister for Public Health met with a wide range of disability organisations at the STUC disabled workers conference in September 2007 and discussed a range of issues including employability, independent living and access to education and training.</p>

  <p>In April, The Minister for Community Safety gave a keynote address and met people attending the Faith &amp; Belief in Scotland &ndash; young people&rsquo;s event.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has made any preliminary assessment of the annual cost, in addition to current subsidies to Caledonian MacBrayne and NorthLink Ferries, of applying road equivalent tariff rates to the fares on all Scottish internal ferry routes and, if so, what the results were.</p>

  <p>The consultants undertaking the Road Equivalent Tariff (RET) study have undertaken an initial assessment of the annual reduction in fares revenue with the application of RET rates. This initial assessment has been carried out on all ferry services subsidised by the Scottish Government and is based on no change in travel demand. This change in revenue represents a consequential increase in subsidies additional to current subsidies. The following table sets out the reduction in fares revenue by area. The consultants final report, a copy of which will be sent to you shortly, provides a breakdown by route.</p>

  <p>At this stage, it is not clear whether the change announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 13 May will be for more than a single year. It will be necessary to see what the Chancellor does later this year and in future budgets in case the personal allowance thresholds are revised further by the time we implement a local income tax. In these circumstances, it would be premature to estimate with any certainty the impact of the increase in the personal allowance. The decrease in the higher rate will have no impact because our proposals for a local income tax envisage a rate of 3p in the pound for both basic and higher tax rates.</p>

  <p>The responsibility for insuring homes against flood damage rests with the owners and tenants. The Scottish Government can in certain circumstances also offer financial support under the Bellwin Scheme to a council or councils incurring eligible costs in dealing with a large scale emergency. This includes those incurred in safeguarding life and property, and preventing suffering or severe inconvenience in a local authority&rsquo;s area or among its inhabitants. Requests for further financial assistance for public bodies faced with a material unexpected financial burden in dealing with such an incident would be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>

  <p>Authorised firearms officers are trained and deployed in accordance with detailed ACPO/ACPOS (Association of Chief Police Officers/Scotland) guidance.

  <p>The provision of public transport infrastructure in rural Grampian is a matter for NESTRANS and the local councils. Projects recently completed include the new Bus Station in Aberdeen (for rural services), Quality Bus corridors on the Stonehaven, Banchory and Westhill services, improvements to the Inverurie and Peterhead services and seven Demand Responsive Transport services introduced to areas across Aberdeenshire. Further Quality Bus Corridor improvements are planned as is Park and Ride schemes at Bucksburn and possibly at Banchory.</p>

  <p>On rail, progress is being made on the reopening of Laurencekirk station, improved rail services to Inverurie and design work is underway for Kintore Rail Station. Connections from rural areas within Grampian are being considered as part of Transport Scotland&rsquo;s Strategic Transport Projects Review (STPR) within the Aberdeen &ndash; Inverness transport corridor. Transport Scotland&rsquo;s High Level Output Specification (HLOS) also contains an aspiration to upgrade the Aberdeen to Inverness Rail Line to allow an hourly service to operate.</p>

  <p>On road, major schemes to be taken forward by Transport Scotland in the Grampian area include the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route and the Balmedie to Tipperty improvement on the A90.</p>

  <p>There were 228,795 full-time students in Scottish institutions in 2006-07. Of these, 222,230 were potentially exempt from council tax. It is not possible to say that all were exempt because some may have made a contribution to council tax, for example if they were part of a household with other non-students shared or if they lived with a partner or spouse, or if they were a full-time student landlord, or if they were liable during the summer holidays as a consequence of the way the legislation interprets their enrolment information. However, we do not hold information on the numbers who may have been in these various categories.

  <p>Part-time students aged 18 and over are not exempt from paying council tax by virtue of their student status and so are potentially liable for council tax. Some full-time students in further education are enrolled on courses that do not qualify them for a council tax exemption as the course is not considered long enough to be full-time for council tax purposes, and they will also be potentially liable. On that basis, the numbers of part-time students that are potentially liable for council tax break down as follows:</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the First Minister&rsquo;s statement on 17 April 2008 that higher education students pay council tax dependent on where they stay ( <em>Official Report</em> , c. 7686), what analysis it has made of where students live.</p>

  <p>As a point of clarification, when the First Minister said that the number of higher education students paying council tax depends on where they stay, he was referring to the fact that some students live with non-students and partners and these students may be contributing to council tax as part of a household. While we do not hold information at this level of detail, we are consulting student representative organisations, amongst others, about our proposals and we expect that to provide additional information. An analysis of the consultation responses will be published in the autumn.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will provide calculations for the basis of the First Minister&rsquo;s statements on 24 April 2008 that around 160,000 students are not liable for the council tax and that the vast majority of these students do not earn enough to pay the local income tax ( <em>Official Report</em> , c. 7934).</p>

  <p>As a point of clarification, the First Minister referred in Parliament on 24 April 2008 to around 160,000 students in Scotland not earning enough to pay local income tax. He did not say that 160,000 students are currently not liable for the council tax.</p>

  <p>The total number of full time students in Scottish institutions in 2006-07 was 228,795. Initial estimates, using earnings related data for full-time students, indicated that perhaps around three quarters of these would not earn sufficient to bring them over the level of the personal allowance. The number who would be liable at the time of introduction of a local income tax would of course depend on the level of the personal allowance at that time.</p>

  <p>Vacancies for teaching posts occur throughout the year and it would be unrealistic to expect every post probation teacher to be in post each August. That said it is important that there is a broad balance between demand and supply. If it is evident that there is an imbalance we would be happy to meet with interested parties such as COSLA, the GTCS and teacher unions to examine the situation.</p>
