  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it is satisfied with the transition arrangements for people with autism from services for children and young people to adult services.</p>

  <p>Robust transition arrangements should be in place for all children and young people moving to adult services, including those with autism. Specifically, the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 requires education authorities to take action, where appropriate, to help young people with additional support needs, including autism, to make the transition from school to post-school life successfully.</p>

  <p>However, while there is evidence of much good practice, there is always room for improvement. That is why we have taken action on a number of fronts to strengthen transition pathways and improve life outcomes for all young people with autism.</p>

  <p>For example, we will publish shortly <i>The Autism Toolbox </i>for practitioners which will include planning for personal transitions and more effective multi-agency working for future service provision.</p>

  <p>We will fund an Additional Support for Learning Transitions Development Officer, who will be in place by April 2009. The officer will manage and co-ordinate local and national partnership approaches with a specific focus on successful transition for all young people at risk of missing out on education and training opportunities.</p>

  <p>In 2008, the Scottish Government published guidance for commissioners of health and social care services for people with autism. It addresses the need for appropriate services for young people during the transition to adulthood and provides examples of existing good practice.</p>

  <p>Our focus on personalisation through the <i>Changing Lives </i>work, encourages service providers to work with people in determining the supports they need at transition to help achieve the best social outcomes and inform future adult service provision.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Consortium for Learning Disability, funded by the Scottish Government is currently advertising a new post to build and sustain capacity across agencies to increase the number of people with learning disabilities and autism in employment.</p>

  <p>The licence issued by Scottish Government requires that sparrowhawks can only be held for a period of 24 hours. The trial aims to release captured sparrowhawks on the day they are trapped if that is possible. They are kept overnight only if there is no possibility of releasing them in daylight on the day they are caught.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is taking all necessary steps to ensure projects such as those highlighted in the question remain on track. Significant progress is being made on both projects.</p>

  <p>With guaranteed public investment of &pound;298 million contributing to an overall budget of &pound;373 million the 2014 Commonwealth Games provide opportunities for Scottish business - including the construction industry &ndash; at a time of economic uncertainty. The procurement process is already well underway for a number of major projects including the National Indoor Sports Arena and Velodrome and the Games Village. All of these projects are on schedule to be completed by the required dates.</p>

  <p>Since the approval of the Outline Business Case on 22 April 2008, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde have been preparing the project for procurement through the appointment of advisors, the development of detailed design requirements and the development of a robust procurement strategy. The project team and advisers are currently working to complete Phase 1A of the project i.e. Employers Requirement and the Exemplar Design (Tender Packages) to be ready to go to the market in early April 2009.</p>

  <p>The hard shoulder which forms part of the current proposals for the replacement crossing will have built in the capability of carrying multimodal public transport should there be some future reason why this cannot be accommodated on the existing Forth road bridge. The cost of this is included in the &pound;1.7 billion to &pound;2.3 billion cost estimate announced in December 2008.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of the comments regarding the reassessed cost of the Forth Replacement Crossing by the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth in the Parliament on 15 January 2009 ( <i>Official Report</i> c. 14088), on what basis the cost of the crossing was previously estimated to be &pound;4 billion and was reduced to &pound;2 billion.</p>

  <p>As the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth stated on 15 January, the reduction in costs can be attributed to the reduced width of the bridge, made possible by utilising the existing Forth Road Bridge for public transport, pedestrians and cyclists. Further reductions have been secured through the use of ITS which has enabled the extent of road construction on the bridge approaches to be reduced, and more refined estimating in light of further detailed surveys, investigations and design development has been possible at this stage.</p>

  <p>The reduced range of &pound;1.7 billion to &pound;2.3 billion represents the estimate of the cost for the delivery of the project by the most efficient form of construction contract. The choice of procurement options other than a publicly funded design and build contract would increase the cost or reduce the certainty of delivery.</p>

  <p>In response to question S3W-18821, I explained that the reduction in the cost estimates could be attributed to the reduced width of the bridge, made possible by utilising the existing Forth Road Bridge for public transport, pedestrians and cyclists. I explained that further reductions have been secured through the use of ITS which has enabled the extent of road construction on the bridge approaches to be reduced, and more refined estimating in light of further detailed surveys, investigations and design development has also been possible at this stage.</p>

  <p>The publicly funded design and build contract provides certainty that the project can be delivered on time and on budget. This certainty has contributed to the refinement of the cost estimates.</p>

  <p>The main objective of Homecoming Scotland is to increase tourism revenues and VisitScotland is working to a target of an 8:1 return on the core funding; meaning that a &pound;40 million increase in tourism revenues should be delivered. The Scottish Government is, however, confident that with all the additional activities and focus on homecoming across Scotland, this return will be exceeded.</p>

  <p>Homecoming should also have a significant impact on the annual survey figures that are used to judge the level of Scottish tourism visitor numbers and expenditure. The UK Tourism Survey (UKTS) and International Passenger Survey (IPS) provide the national statistics for the Office of National Statistics. It may not be possible to identify exactly the specific impact of Homecoming on the figures as it may not be clear whether a visitor only visited Scotland because of Homecoming.</p>

  <p>As well as this overall assessment of the tourism figures, detailed assessments of specific events and campaigns will be carried out by VisitScotland and EventScotland. There are three main strands to these technical evaluations.</p>

  <p>Conversion Studies of VisitScotland Marketing Activity</p>

  <p>VisitScotland will commission a dedicated conversion study into its Homecoming marketing activity in the US and Canadian markets. The study will be carried out independently and will target respondents to their US / Canadian campaigns. This will be an online survey and respondents will be asked, among other things, about the impact of Homecoming 2009 on their decision to visit. The survey will be carried out in the winter of 2009. A similar conversion study will also be carried out in the UK and in two key European markets.</p>

  <p>Event Organiser Outcome Reports</p>

  <p>Each event which is receiving funding for Homecoming from EventScotland will be required to conduct an event outcome report which assesses the impact and success of the event.</p>

  <p>Scottish Omnibus Surveys</p>

  <p>There will be six waves of the You Gov Scottish Omnibus Studies to assess awareness and favourability towards the Homecoming programme among the Scottish population.</p>

  <p>Successor arrangements for the present Bull Hire Scheme are under active consideration.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, it is envisaged that bulls from the existing stud should be made available in 2009 to groups of crofters which have hired a Scheme bull in the past three years. The Crofters Commission will invite expressions of interest from qualifying groups as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>The proposed charge of &pound;500 per bull plus approximately &pound;100 travel and VAT costs is equivalent to the cost of hiring a bull under the present Bull Hire Scheme. The group concerned would take ownership of the bull without further charge rather than returning it to the stud. No assistance is proposed for the purchase of bulls from elsewhere.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is taking a wide range of measures to support families living with disability. For example, we provide substantial funding (around &pound;3.3 million in 2008-09) for a range of organisations directly supporting families with disabled children. We also provide funding to the Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland to develop training, advice and information on tax credits and benefits for frontline workers working with children with disabilities and their families.</p>

  <p>We have also clearly committed to the UK Government&rsquo;s child poverty targets. We will do all within the powers available to us to help achieve the interim target of halving child poverty by 2010, and the goal of eradicating child poverty by 2020. We are also liaising closely with the UK Government on their initial proposals for a Child Poverty Bill.</p>

  <p>However significant short term action to combat child poverty and to meet the additional costs faced by families living with disability requires extra investment by the UK Government in tax credits and benefits. The Scottish Government does not currently have responsibility for personal taxation and benefits but we are working in the context of the National Conversation, to develop key principles for how the benefits and tax credits system could operate to tackle poverty and income inequality in the event of fiscal autonomy or independence.</p>

  <p>We recognise that such families may be at risk of fuel poverty and so we announced in November that from April this year our new Energy Assistance Package will provide a range of help for low income families with a disabled child, to reduce energy costs and lower fuel bills which may include free insulation or central heating.</p>

  <p>We set out our new approach to tackling poverty and income inequality in <i>Achieving Our Potential</i>, which together with the frameworks on health inequalities and early years, commit to a concerted approach with our partners to tackle disadvantage and promote equality for people with disabilities.</p>

  <p>The STPR has identified a number of strategic transport interventions. Potential improvements to the A737 have been highlighted under Project 22 &ndash; Targeted Road Congestion/ Environmental Relief schemes. Some proposals have been identified, including a bypass of Dalry and we will develop this, and other suitable schemes as resources and the STPR&rsquo;s wider priorities allow. A Kilwinning bypass has not been specifically identified, but may be considered if it is proven to make a similar contribution to the overall corridor objectives.</p>

  <p>Included in the recommendations are targeted road congestion/environmental relief schemes on the A737.</p>

  <p>The priority enhancement on this corridor was identified as a bypass around Dalry.</p>

  <p>However, as we progress through the development stage of this package, other interventions may be brought forward, providing they demonstrate at least as good a business case, meet the objectives of the Strategic Transport Projects Review and are affordable within the funding available at that time.</p>

  <p>Draft Road Orders for this Scheme were published on 1 November 2007, with the Draft Compulsory Purchase Order following on 10 July 2008. A number of statutory and non-statutory objections were received and whilst Transport Scotland and their agents have worked to resolve many of these, the matter has now been referred to the Reporters Unit of the Directorate for Planning and Environmental Affairs. Arrangements are underway to hold a Public Local Inquiry (PLI), sometime this summer.</p>

  <p>Subject to the ministers&rsquo; decision following the recommendation of the PLI, the earliest date for publication of the Made Road Orders is expected to be spring/summer 2010. Thereafter the processes of competitively tendering and funding the contract can be commenced.</p>

  <p>The National Indicators and Targets used in the development of the first phase of single outcome agreements (SOAs) are unchanged for the second phase.</p>

  <p>There are some changes to the Menu of Local Indicators but these changes are minimal. Most of the Indicators used in the first phase feature in the second phase guidance. In addition, several new indicators have been included in the second phase guidance based on the extent of their usage in the initial SOAs. However, it is important to recognise that the Menu of Local Indicators is not a mandatory menu. Priority outcomes contained in the 2009-10 SOAs, and agreed by the full Community Planning Partnership, may differ from those in the 2008-09 SOA. In such circumstances, the supporting indicators and targets would themselves differ. The guidance makes clear that the use of Indicators from the menu remains a matter for local choice.</p>

  <p>It is difficult to provide exact figures on the numbers employed in these sectors over the last five years, particularly as the Office for National Statistics counts those employed in waste management as including those working in sewage and sanitation.</p>

  <p>However, the figures sourced from the Office for National Statistics under the Annual Business Inquiry are as follows (rounded to nearest hundred):</p>

  <p>It is difficult to predict what the growth in employment will be in the waste management and recycling sectors over the next five years, particularly given the current economic climate.</p>

  <p>However, the on-going review of the National Waste Plan will attempt to address this by identifying where employment opportunities could arise. Consultation on a draft of the National Waste Plan will begin around June 2009.</p>
