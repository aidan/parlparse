  <p>The NHS Low Income Scheme (LIS) is administered by the Business Services Authority (BSA), a special health authority, on behalf of the health departments in Scotland, England and Wales.</p>

  <p>Anyone can apply for help through LIS and, therefore, the HC1 form is designed to be suitable for all members of the community including, for example, people in full-time employment, pensioners and students.</p>

  <p>The form was designed with the applicant in mind, and applicants are required to answer only those questions and sections which relate to them. The form was awarded the Crystal Mark, accredited by the Plain English Campaign, in March 2007, and in the BSA&rsquo;s most recent customer survey (2008) the user-friendliness of the form scored 8.5.</p>

  <p>The form gathers relevant information in an order that supports the BSA&rsquo;s claims registration system (CRS) and claims calculator. This aids the assessment process and helps to improve the speed and accuracy of the decisions.</p>

  <p>However, you may be interested to know that officials are currently in the process of reviewing the form to amend a small number of references which are no longer relevant to applicants from Scotland. We have no plans for a more extensive review.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has increased investment in student discretionary funds from the &pound;14.04 million it inherited from the last administration (2006-07) to &pound;16.1 million this year (2008-09). This is a rise of 14.6%.</p>

  <p>In academic year 2007-08 the following institutions exhausted the following funds:</p>

  <p>A total of three out of 56 institutions exhausted both their higher education discretionary and childcare funds:</p>

  <p>Barony College,</p>

  <p>Dundee College,</p>

  <p>Reid Kerr College.</p>

  <p>A further three out of 56 institutions exhausted only their higher education discretionary fund allocation:</p>

  <p>Edinburgh&rsquo;s Telford College,</p>

  <p>John Wheatley College,</p>

  <p>Newbattle Abbey College.</p>

  <p>A further eight institutions out of 56 exhausted only their higher education childcare fund:</p>

  <p>Borders College,</p>

  <p>Glasgow Metropolitan College,</p>

  <p>Oatridge Agricultural College,</p>

  <p>Stow College,</p>

  <p>Glasgow School of Art,</p>

  <p>Heriot Watt University,</p>

  <p>RSAMD,</p>

  <p>Strathclyde University.</p>

  <p>Funds are intended to be spent within the year in which they are allocated, thus providing the maximum sum available to students in each individual year. Any unspent funds are returned for redistribution in the following academic year and are thus returned to the discretionary funds system.</p>

  <p>The vast majority of funds should therefore be exhausted in the academic year for which they are allocated.</p>

  <p>During academic year 2007-08 the following institutions (out of 56) requested additional funds during the in-year redistribution process.</p>

  <p>It is not the purpose of single outcome agreements (SOAs) to provide a comprehensive description of all services provided by partners within a community planning partnership (CPP). SOAs set out strategic priorities for a local area, described as local outcomes. It is for each CPP to derive its local outcomes which should be drawn from an integrated profile of the social, economic and environmental conditions of the area concerned. In reaching agreement with CPPs on the SOA, the Scottish Government will be looking for evidence that local outcomes reflect an area&rsquo;s strategic priorities and that they are capable of being linked to one or more of the national outcomes.</p>

  <p>Tackling health inequalities was one of the key areas that the Scottish Government asked to be included in 2009-10 SOA&rsquo;s.</p>

  <p>Copies of all 32 SOAs for 2009-10 and beyond, which community planning partnerships and the Scottish Government agreed in June 2009, can be obtained via the following link to the Improvement Service website <a href="http://www.improvementservice.org.uk/single-outcome-agreements/" target="_blank">http://www.improvementservice.org.uk/single-outcome-agreements/</a>.</p>

  <p>It is the responsibility of the local government and NHS boards to work in partnership and allocate funds from the total financial resources available to them on the basis of local needs, priorities and agreed targets, including the Scottish Government&rsquo;s key strategic objectives and commitments.</p>

  <p>Spend on mental health services continues to be drawn from record funds allocated to NHS boards and local government overall. Funding is set to rise to record levels with the overall health budget increasing from &pound;10.6 billion in 2008-09 to &pound;11.03 billion in 2009-10. Each health board&rsquo;s allocation from this budget is based on a formula that includes information about characteristics that influence healthcare needs including deprivation. Local government funding will also rise, from &pound;11.2 billion in 2008-09 to &pound;11.8 billion in 2009-10.</p>

  <p><em>Equally Well</em>, the report of the Ministerial Task Force on Health Inequalities, recommends that NHS interventions on depression, stress and anxiety should be increasingly targeted at Scotland&rsquo;s deprived communities and tailored to these communities. It also recommends that the Keep Well health checks should identify depression and anxiety and provide adequate treatment and support within deprived communities.</p>

  <p>The draft guidance proposes that there should be a national standard maximum waiting time for people assessed as being at &quot;critical&quot; or &quot;substantial&quot; risk of six weeks from confirmation of need to delivery of assessed personal and/or nursing care services. Where there are major risks to an individual&rsquo;s independent living or health and well-being, services will be provided immediately or within approximately one to two weeks of their care needs assessment. Applying the six week target to personal and nursing care services only is intended to allow flexibility for other community care services. For example, major adaptations or specialist equipment may take longer than the six week timescale to deliver.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service, to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>It is too early in the development of the new Sex Offender Treatment Programme (SOTP) to be prescriptive about what the motivational aspects will be.</p>

  <p>Studies conducted with sex offenders who refuse to participate in SOTPs indicate two main reasons for non-participation: a fear of participation in prisoner programmes and denial of their offence. Therefore, consideration is being given to:</p>

  <p>Involving sex offenders in a preparatory programme early in their sentence, and</p>

  <p>Adapting the style of delivery for the main programme to address some of the issues presented by sex offenders who deny their offence.</p>

  <p>At this stage programme developers are conducting research to establish whether these approaches, which have been used in other jurisdictions, are likely to be effective.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether all girls born after 1 September 1990 and who have left school have been sent a letter about the human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-07-23.S3W-25325.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80379" speakername="Shona Robison" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa0723.htm#10">

  <p>No such letter has been sent to all girls nationally. Responsibility for delivery of HPV vaccination locally, including identification and contact with the cohort of older girls who had left school, is a matter for health boards. It is likely that in most cases boards would have contacted this cohort of girls directly by letter or through other means.</p>

  <p>Additionally, the HPV marketing campaign was developed and delivered in such a way to ensure older girls had as much opportunity as possible to find out about the vaccination programme. The marketing campaign meant that information materials about the vaccination were available in locations where older girls were likely to see them. This included community settings, GP surgeries, and educational institutions. The campaign also delivered a series of road shows across Scotland to raise awareness and there was extensive newspaper coverage of the vaccination programme.</p>
