  <p>Discussions have been held with airlines on the new direct air routes which could be supported by the Route Development Fund &ndash; this has included a potential connection between Scotland and Munich. The Executive will consider any approach by an airline to commence services to Munich or other destinations which will improve business links and encourage inbound tourism, and which meets the fund&rsquo;s criteria. The detail of any discussions is commercially confidential.</p>

  <p>I very much regret the news that Strand Lighting has entered into a period of consultation with a view to closing its facility in Kirkcaldy which employs nearly 90 people. Scottish Enterprise Fife has a track record of working very closely with the company and has provided assistance in an attempt to avoid this outcome.</p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise Fife will continue to work closely with the company during the consultation period. Should the closure go ahead, the first priority will be to support the employees faced with losing their jobs. Strong partnerships exist between local enterprise companies, local authorities, JobCentre Plus and Careers Scotland. These partners have considerable experience in responding to redundancy situations and can offer advice, support and guidance on retraining, upskilling and employment opportunities.</p>

  <p>Since its launch in March 2002, the globalscot initiative has grown to an active network of over 800 international business people who have links to Scotland and want to contribute to its economic development. Approaching half of the members are based in the USA with around 40% in Europe and 10% in Asia.</p>

  <p>In the last year globalscot recorded over 500 contributions by members, 300 of which involved direct assistance to Scottish organisations and individuals. Examples of support include meeting and advising Scottish businesses when they visit new markets; taking up appointments as directors with start-up companies, and participating in Enterprise in Education programmes as role models for school pupils and students.</p>

The Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the local authority environmental health department were consulted with regard to the burial site of culled stock.</p>

  <p>The information held by the Scottish Executive is from a survey of graduates from higher education institutions conducted around six months after their graduation. At present, the Executive does not hold data which could be used to track graduates from Scottish institutions over a longer period. A follow-up survey to take place three and a half years after graduating is planned and I would refer you to the answer to question S2W-16979 on 8 June 2005, for further information on this survey. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at: <a href="../../../webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a></p>

  <p>Notes: Data have been rounded to the nearest five.</p>

  <p>1. Estimates prior to 2001/02 in the &quot;Sub degree&quot; category differ from those from 2001-02 onwards due to improvements in the data collection for graduates from further education colleges. However, the 2001-02 and 2002-03 figures should still be regarded as estimates rather than actual numbers.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive holds data collected from surveys conducted around six months after students graduate from higher education courses at Scottish higher education institutions and further education colleges. The survey of graduates from higher education institutions, which is carried out by the Higher Education Statistics Agency, gives data on the location of employment for those graduates who are employed at that point. If the graduate has gone on to further study, the name of the institution at which they are studying is collected. Although not all graduates respond, response rates are high, typically 70 to 80 percent, so this survey gives valuable information on the movement of graduates soon after they graduate.</p>

  <p>I would refer you to the answer to question S2W-16979 on 8 June 2005 for information on the planned follow up to this survey. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at: <a href="../../../webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a></p>

  <p>For higher education graduates from colleges the Scottish Further Education Funding Council collects information on whether the any employment is in Scotland or elsewhere.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Labour Force Survey (LFS), which is carried out by the Office for National Statistics, can be used to monitor the movement and location of graduates. The LFS questionnaire includes a variety of questions on labour market activity, residency and qualifications. However, the LFS does not ask where a graduate obtained his/her degree so graduates of Scottish institutions cannot be specifically identified.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has made available an international development fund of &pound;3 million per year from 2005-06. The funding criteria and application forms for funding from the International Development budget have recently been launched by the Scottish Executive. The deadline for receipt of completed applications is 17 June 2005. These applications will then be considered by the Scottish Executive and the recently appointed expert group before any funding commitments are made.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has committed the following costs to tsunami reconstruction work:</p>

  <p>Renfrewshire Council sending environmental health officer to Sri Lanka - one off payment of &pound;6,000</p>

  <p>Education Coordinator for Edinburgh Council &ndash; one post at &pound;33,000 for 18 months</p>

  <p>Match funding for house building project with Fife Council (to backfill posts) - &pound;60,000 over three years.</p>

  <p>There are a number of other proposals being considered, and some provisional decisions to fund activities have been made. We have committed &pound;360,000 over three years to improve maternal health in Malawi. We have also agreed to fund an administrative resource within NIDOS for the benefit of all NGOs and we have agreed to work with VSO to help meet the costs of an extra 10 volunteers in Malawi. Costs for these have not been finalised.</p>

  <p>Details of expenditure will be available on the Scottish Executive website in due course.</p>

  <p>Although the negotiation of international instruments falls within the reservation of international relations under Schedule 5 to the Scotland Act 1998, the Scottish Executive liaises where appropriate with UK lead departments during this process. The implementation of such instruments, so far as the subject matter is devolved, is not covered by that reservation. Accordingly, the implementation of instruments dealing with judicial cooperation which relate to devolved matters of criminal law and procedure, will fall within devolved competence.</p>

  <p><em>The Renewables Supply Chain Gap Analysis Study</em> , published by Renewables UK in January 2004 assessed the status of the renewables industry in Scotland including its related economic impact. The study estimated the monetary value of the Scottish renewable industry output at &pound;80 million <sup>1</sup> . The study also estimated that there were around 2,000 jobs <sup>2</sup> in Scotland associated with the renewable energy sector.</p>

  <p>Source: Renewables Supply Chain, Gap Analysis.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The monetary value estimate adjusts for imports and is based on the assumption of no net cross border flows.</p>

  <p>2. The jobs estimate is expressed in full-time equivalents and includes induced jobs. Induced jobs are defined as jobs outside the renewable energy industry and its associated supply chain that are created because of activity in the renewable energy industry; e.g. additional jobs in retail arising from the increased economic activity.</p>

  <p>The UK Government is currently considering whether measures are needed to support the biomass heat sector. My officials are keeping in close touch with that work as it progresses. When the results become available, expected towards the end of this year, the Forum for Renewable Energy Development in Scotland (FREDS) will reconvene its Biomass Energy Group to consider whether further action needs to be taken specifically in Scotland.</p>

  <p>At present, through our Scottish Community and Householder Renewables Initiative, we are providing advisory and grant support for the installation of small scale biomass technologies.

  <p>No specific steps are being taken. Following the publication of the Forum for Renewable Energy Development in Scotland&rsquo;s (FREDS) report into the future of the biomass industry in Scotland, we are working with the enterprise networks and others to consider how best we might support biomass supply chain innovation and development.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Community and Householder Renewables Initiative (SCHRI) commenced at the end of 2002-03. Funding is separated into two streams: a householder stream and a communities stream. Since the introduction of the scheme, grant funding has been awarded to 132 new-build domestic projects under the community stream, e.g. awards to local authority sponsored projects. Information on whether technologies installed under the householder stream are in new-build households is not recorded.</p>

  <p>Visitors to the visitscotland.com website were given incorrect information when trying to book accommodation in the holiday home and caravan site sector between 27 and 30 May.

  <p>The Allowances Schemes approved by the Parliament, the most recent of which was approved on 21 June 2001, made provision for the payment of interest due on capital borrowed by a member in order to purchase a property in accordance with the scheme. It is not an allowance to purchase the property. There is an annual rate up to which a member may claim and, like other allowances, must be claimed and vouched.</p>

  <p>The total number of members who have made a claim against this allowance to meet interest payment on borrowed capital is 48.</p>

  <p>In answer to (a), none. This is personal information which the Allowances Office does not require to have to administer the Allowances Scheme as approved by the Parliament.</p>

  <p>In answer to (b), the Allowances Office checks annually the mortgage statement of accounts for each member who claims. The scheme only allows for payment of interest on capital borrowed to purchase a property. An extension of mortgage beyond the capital borrowed to purchase the property would not qualify for interest payments under the Allowances Scheme.</p>
