  <p>I met local MSPs on 30 March to discuss action following the company&#8217;s announcement. The Executive and its agencies will maintain the close contact it has had with the company since Marks and Spencer&#8217;s decision to terminate its contracts with the company last October. Officials visited the company on 28 March to discuss support and also I intend to visit in the next few weeks. Action from the Executive will focus on helping those made redundant find new jobs and, as required by the company, providing training programmes for those who will remain. We shall ensure that such support is being provided in accordance with the principles set out in our PACE (Partnership Action for Continuing Employment) document last month.</p>

  <p>The first meeting of the Joint Ministerial Committee on the Knowledge Economy, chaired by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and attended by the First Minister and the Secretary of State for Scotland, was both useful and productive.

  <p>The reason for detrunking the A98 was given in the consultation document <i>Local Government Reform &#8211; Shaping the Trunk Road Network</i> which was published in October 1994. Given the generally local nature of trips on the A98 between Fraserburgh and the A96 at Fochabers, the coastal route was removed from the national trunk road network.</p>

  <p>Public Private Partnerships can provide an appropriate means of securing improvements in the school stock across a range of circumstances. Such partnerships will not, however, necessarily be suitable in all situations, and local authorities continue to have substantial resources available to them under the traditional capital allocation arrangements. The suitability or otherwise of Public Private Partnerships will be influenced by a number of factors relevant to particular proposals and geographical considerations need not be dominant. Public Private Partnership proposals involving a number of schools in rural areas are currently being progressed. We continue to work with authorities to support their consideration of Public Private Partnerships where they express interest in taking them forward.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to be able to report that the working group has completed its consideration of the scope of the package of safeguards. It has concluded that the package of safeguards is sufficiently complete, wide-ranging and robust. The working group took account of existing good practice in Scottish schools, the professional judgement of teachers, the quality assurance systems used in schools and authorities, and the awareness and involvement of parents. This has already ensured that inappropriate teaching or use of inappropriate materials has been prevented. I have noted the reservation of the representative of the Catholic Education Commission that the new section in the Ethical Standards in Public Life etc. Bill does not mention marriage.</p>

  <p>I am grateful to the group for completing its first task so quickly. The group will now continue with its remaining work. This will include the preparation of: summary guidance for teachers on the available curriculum advice and materials; advice to schools and teachers on effective consultation with parents; and a national package of information for parents on the nature and purpose of sex education in Scottish schools. Drafts of these materials will be issued for consultation.</p>

  <p>A copy of the report has been made available to all MSPs and can be found in SPICe.</p>

  <p>The Ministry of Defence (MOD) is required to seek open market value for property disposals, including to public sector bodies. Officials from the Scottish Executive and Highlands and Islands Airports Ltd (HIAL) have met their counterparts in MOD&#8217;s Defence Estates Organisation to secure the continued provision of airport infrastructure for essential air links. The purchase of Stornoway Airport by HIAL represents the best deal achievable and secures the public interest. The transfer cost was met from HIAL&#8217;s resources in 1999-2000.</p>
