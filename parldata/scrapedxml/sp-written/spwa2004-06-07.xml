<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2004-06-07.1.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80032" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-04/wa0607.htm#1">

  <p>I attended the one-day Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels on 24 May 2004 with Ben Bradshaw.</p>

  <p>On fisheries, the Council reached political agreement on the Regulation establishing regional advisory councils (RACs). The creation of RACs is a key element in the continuing reform of the Common Fisheries Policy; the regulation represents an important step towards greater regional management of Europe&#8217;s fisheries and it reflects the important work that has been undertaken by the North Sea Commission&#8217;s Fisheries Partnership. RACs will now bring together fishermen, scientists and all those with an environmental or economic interest in fisheries, to advise on the fisheries management issues within their designated areas. The Council of Ministers decided to establish seven RACs, including those for the North Sea; the North Western Waters; and the widely disbursed Pelagic fisheries (mackerel, herring, blue whiting and horse mackerel). The Regulation provides RACs with the operating principles and guidelines that are necessary to perform their work, and also provides each RAC with Community financial assistance for start-up and operating costs. Discussion at Council concerned the appropriate level of funding and the requirement for RACs to work transparently, in public. A compromise agreement on these issues was reached &#8211; and supported by the United Kingdom.</p>

  <p>The Council also reached a political agreement on amending the current Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG) Regulation (2792/1999), in order to further specify the detailed rules regarding structural assistance for the fisheries sector. The amendment was technical and detailed, and limited in its scope. It was proposed to clarify arrangements, especially for the benefit of new member states, and also to support implementation of the Community&#8217;s recently agreed strategic framework for aquaculture. Discussions in Council centred on proposed changes to the regulation concerning circumstances for socio-economic assistance, support for environmentally friendly fishing methods, the appropriate level of private contribution rates, compensation for shellfish farmers and available assistance to vessels affected by stock recovery plans. The United Kingdom raised concerns that interventions could lead to unfair competition and, with the support of others, secured a compromise agreement that ensured any such interventions would only apply either in exceptional circumstances or within specified set limits.</p>

  <p>Both the regulations will now be adopted without further discussion, at a later date, following the translation of the political agreements into all Community languages.</p>

  <p>Under any other business, the United Kingdom provided written information and a statement to Council on <em>Net Benefits</em>, the UK Cabinet Office&#8217;s recent report to government on the future of the fishing industry and the Commission reported the development of increased enforcement activity by Canadian authorities in the NAFO (North Atlantic) regulatory area.</p>

  <p>There was no substantive discussion on agriculture matters.</p>

  <p>Yes. We want to ensure that Scottish audiences have the opportunity to enjoy the highest quality and widest range of cultural experiences we can provide. Opera provision is a key part of the cultural landscape &#8211; and one which we want to retain.</p>

  <p>Scottish Opera has worked hard in recent months, with our and the Scottish Arts Council&#8217;s help, to draw up plans to set the company on a stable footing for the future and to identify a clear vision for opera provision in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Today we are in a position to provide information on Scottish Opera&#8217;s announcement of the way forward.</p>

  <p>Following a period of transition over the next two years, Scottish Opera aims to have completed the process of re-establishing itself in the cultural life of the country. Scottish Opera&#8217;s plans for the future involve:</p>

  <p>Main scale and medium scale productions in the cities of Scotland</p>

  <p>Smaller scale productions in remoter parts of the country</p>

  <p>Primary schools education programmes</p>

  <p>Secondary school syllabus work</p>

  <p>Work with youth and the over 50s</p>

  <p>All of this will lead to the development of a cohesive cultural strategy for the company as a whole.</p>

  <p>We have always maintained that Scottish Opera should be capable of living within its budget. We are reaffirming that view today. Scottish Opera takes a very significant share of the Scottish Arts Council&#8217;s resources, and it is vital going forward that it be managed in a way which does not lead to one financial crisis after another. At the end of last financial year, the company had overspent its grant by over &#163;4 million. It is the responsibility of everyone to use public money effectively. Such overspending cannot continue. The Board of Scottish Opera has accepted that a fundamental restructuring of its operation is required to ensure the company lives within its known means and that no further options exist for future intervention by the Executive.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers have been clear from the start of this process &#8211; we want a first class national opera company that is structured in a way to make sure that its future is sustainable. Because of this commitment, we recognise that a degree of short-term additional investment will be necessary to help the company deliver the changes it has decided on. That is why we have agreed to invest additional resources over the next two years to support the plan drawn up by Scottish Opera to ensure it is placed on a stable financial footing for the future.</p>

  <p>We shall be making available up to &#163;7 million to support the business plan during the transition period. This will allow Scottish Opera to run down its accumulated deficit and take the necessary steps to restructure, so that we do not end up in this situation again in a few years time. This includes provision to cover the possible losses which the Edinburgh Festival Theatre and the Theatre Royal in Glasgow may incur due to the fact that no main scale opera will be performed by Scottish Opera between June 2005 and March 2006.</p>

  <p>There will sadly be job losses to get the company into shape, but the funding we are providing should enable the company to keep redundancies to a minimum.</p>

  <p>It no longer makes sense for Scottish Opera to run a commercial theatre in Glasgow whilst also running an opera production company. Scottish Opera is expected to conclude a deal to lease the Theatre Royal to another operator, freeing it to focus on what it does best. Scottish Opera will also review the future of its technical services department.</p>

  <p>We also support the view that the future business plan can best be implemented by Scottish Opera and Scottish Ballet restructuring into two separate companies with the management and artistic team of the Opera fully committed to its vision and business plan.</p>

  <p>The precise financial details need to be worked through by Scottish Opera and the Scottish Arts Council and will remain commercially confidential for the time being. We need to ensure that we get maximum value for money from taxpayers&#8217; funds.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers are committed to ensuring that we continue to enjoy a vibrant cultural scene here in Scotland, and that our creative talents are used to promote Scotland to the outside world. That is why we have agreed to support today Scottish Opera&#8217;s plans to ensure a successful and sustainable future for Scottish Opera.</p>

  <p>Although the restructuring process will undoubtedly be painful, I am confident that with the full delivery of Scottish Opera&#8217;s plan, opera provision for Scotland can now have a secure place on the Scottish cultural scene in the future.</p>

  <p>Once the guidance and rules of the waterborne freight grant (WFG) scheme have been finalised it will be promoted by the Scottish Executive. We will ensure that all sectors of the freight industry including shipping companies, ports and logistics companies are aware of the opportunities that the new grant scheme will offer.</p>

  <p>The great length of our coastline means that there is considerable potential for transferring freight from roads to water in many parts of Scotland. It will be for the freight industry to identify which Scottish ports could most appropriately handle new WFG supported traffic flows.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is not aware of any data which would provide a reliable basis for assessing what number of graduates in chemistry and closely-related subjects might be regarded as sufficient, and is not confident that it is possible to produce such data. Although there have been no recent representations to the Executive of a shortage of graduates in these disciplines, the Executive is aware of concerns about a long-term falling trend in the level of demand from school-leavers to study chemistry at degree level. We are exploring with Future Skills Scotland the scope for developing better information on the supply of and demand for people with science qualifications.</p>

  <p>Like other community disposals, breach of a restriction of liberty order is not an offence but is reported to the court simply as a breach. We do not hold centrally records on reoffending as the commission of a further offence by anyone subject to any community disposal is a matter for the police and the procurator fiscal.</p>

  <p>Restriction of liberty orders have only been available across Scotland since May 2002. The follow-up data on reconvictions of the offenders subject to these orders will be published in the next Statistical Bulletin in spring 2005.</p>

  <p>The Tartan Day Working Group was set up to take forward and co-ordinate the participation by the numerous Scottish public organisations interested in participating in the Tartan Day 2004 celebrations. The objectives of the group are to co-ordinate activity to maximise impact. Its current members are:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive (Chair)</p>

  <p>The Scottish Parliament</p>

  <p>Scottish Development International</p>

  <p>VisitScotland</p>

  <p>The Scottish Arts Council</p>

  <p>National Museums of Scotland</p>

  <p>The British Council</p>

  <p>Edinburgh City Council</p>

  <p>Glasgow City Council</p>

  <p>The Royal Society of Edinburgh</p>

  <p>Scottish Screen</p>

  <p>University of Edinburgh</p>

  <p>University of Dundee</p>

  <p>The group met at regular intervals from the autumn of 2003 through to March 2004. This approach to planning and co-ordination proved successful and is one we shall repeat for Tartan Day 2005, ensuring the maximum public sector engagement and developing new links with the private sector.</p>

A Progress Report for 2003-04</em> will be published today that reflects a number of initiatives that have been taken forward by public and private sector partners working together to contribute towards the growth of tourism in Scotland. Copies of the report have been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre under (Bib. number 32869).</p>
