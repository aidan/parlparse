  <p>Importation of game birds into the UK from other European countries is done under strict EU-wide trade rules and is subject to veterinary supervision. As such this legal trade does not represent a significant risk of spreading H5N1 avian influenza and the Executive is working with a wide range of stakeholders to ensure that all sensible precautions to minimise the risk of avian influenza are taken. In particular, post import procedures have been strengthened as part of the process of minimising the risk of avian influenza entering the UK.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The funding made available to GHA to support owner occupier costs was an integral part of the stock transfer financial arrangements, Communities Scotland will continue to monitor this programme however there are no plans to extend the scope of this funding to other groups at this time.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is aware that there are a number of issues around owners affected either directly or indirectly by GHA&rsquo;s investment programme and we are working with both GHA and Glasgow City Council to seek workable solutions.</p>

  <p>Glasgow City Council administers support for other owners within the City seeking financial assistance to improve and repair their homes, which is funded from Private Sector Housing Grant provided by the Scottish Executive.

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Glasgow Housing Association (GHA) is the factor of certain owner occupied properties previously purchased under the Right To Buy. GHA&rsquo;s factoring service is provided by a subsidiary company, GHA (Management) Ltd (GHA(M)). GHA is an independent Registered Social Landlord (RSL), which is subject to regulation by Communities Scotland, in line with published Performance Standards. In relation to factoring, these Performance Standards require that RSLs are fair, efficient and effective factors for other property owners and manage factoring funds on behalf of owners in a proper and accountable manner.</p>

  <p>GHA has a significant agenda to reform its housing services and has recently completed a review of how all of its front-line services are delivered, to tenants and owners. Its factoring policy and procedures are currently under review by GHA(M), to reflect the changes which emerge from this reform agenda. This review will address, in particular, the way in which charges to owners are determined.</p>

  <p>The British Medical Association (BMA), NHS boards and NHS Education for Scotland are members of the Modernising Medical Careers (MMC) Scottish Delivery Group and are therefore fully involved in overseeing MMC implementation. There is also regular contact with the General Medical Council (GMC) which, in collaboration with the Postgraduate Medical and Training Board (PMETB), recently undertook an inspection of a pilot programme of Quality Assurance of MMC Foundation Training in the North of Scotland.</p>

  <p>In Scotland, MMC implementation is being led by NHS Education for Scotland. NES have set aside &pound;4.5 million in 2006-07; &pound;5.7 million in 2007-08 and &pound;5.7 million in 2008-09 for this work. There is no comparable national educational organisation within England with which to make comparisons on amounts spent, and Deanery administrative structures are very different to those in Scotland. Comprehensive data on amounts spent in England is not currently available as allocations to strategic health authorities (SHAs) in England for 2006-07 have not yet been announced.</p>

  <p>In recognition of the need to ensure NHSScotland Bodies comply with the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s principles and policies on sustainable development, the Scottish Executive Health Department&rsquo;s recently revised <em>Environmental Management Policy for NHSScotland</em> NHSHDL(2006)21 requires NHSScotland Bodies to set year-on-year targets for increasing the amounts of waste designated for re-use, recycling or recovery. These targets are required to be set by individual boards, in accordance with EU, UK and Scottish Executive legislation, to contribute to the Executive&rsquo;s National Waste Plan which aims to achieve a national target of 25% recycling and composting of municipal waste by 2006 and 55% by 2020.</p>

  <p>Operational guidance on the management and disposal of clinical and domestic waste is provided to NHSScotland by Health Facilities Scotland.</p>

  <p>NHSScotland has long been recognised as a leader in the field on environmental management which has been widely recognised elsewhere in the UK and more recently by the European Health Property Network.</p>

  <p>Data on how much waste was produced by NHSScotland over the last 10 years by NHS board is not available. However, the annual <em>NHSScotland Environment Report</em> has, since 1996-97, provided monitored data on volumes of clinical waste at a national level and, since 2001-02, both domestic and clinical waste at national level and also broken down by care groups.</p>

  <p>The annual Environment Reports are available online at <a href="http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/pef" target="_blank">http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/pef</a>.</p>

  <p>The monitoring of domestic waste is difficult as not all healthcare bodies are provided with the necessary data by the waste contractor and therefore the data on domestic waste streams within the reports are based in part on estimated values.</p>

  <p>Yes. A route following the corridor of the A709 was assessed in 1996. It was not taken forward on cost and environmental grounds. That decision was confirmed by a recent STAG Appraisal carried out by Dumfries and Galloway Council.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland has the operational responsibility for this area, and can be contacted for more information if required.</p>
