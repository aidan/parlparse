  <p>Independent consultants carried out the analysis of the responses to this consultation paper and I have today placed the analysis report in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre. The report will also be available on the Scottish Executive website.</p>

  <p>Sixty-eight organisations and individuals, representing a wide variety of interests responded to the consultation. The proposals put forward in the paper were, as a whole, extremely well received and supported by those who responded. After considering the analysis, it is intended to bring forward legislation to implement wide-ranging reform of the enforcement system as a whole.</p>

  <p>I shall, however, be looking at the responses to one point of the consultation as a matter of urgency. This is the part that asks for views on how a statutory national debt arrangement scheme should be taken forward. The framework of the scheme, including power to make regulations, is contained in the Debt Arrangement and Attachment (Scotland) Bill currently before the Parliament. Now that an analysis of the responses is available, the Executive will be looking to bring forward regulations to implement the scheme as quickly as possible taking due account of the consultation results.</p>

  <p>Our policy on flexibility and innovation within the school curriculum enables education authorities and schools to adopt the particular approaches to teaching and learning that best meets the needs of all pupils. It is for education authorities and schools themselves to consider whether to offer pupils the opportunity to take A and AS level examinations as well as those provided by the Scottish Qualifications Authority. However, in line with our guidance on flexibility and innovation, education authorities and schools wishing to do so would have to clearly identify the gains to pupils and ensure consistency with the National Priorities in Education. They would also have to undertake full consultation with stakeholders (including parents, teachers and pupils) and achieve consensus prior to implementing their proposals and ensure open and rigorous quality assurance arrangements are in place to monitor and evaluate the results of any changes.</p>

  <p>I have asked Graeme Munro, Chief Executive of Historic Scotland to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The amount of grant awarded but unclaimed at the end of 2001-02 under the Historic Buildings Repair Grants Scheme was &#163;2.9 million. This was due to projects failing to start on site on the date previously notified to Historic Scotland and to delays in the works programmes of projects already on site, all leading to a lower level of grant being claimed in the financial year.</p>

  <p>I have asked Graeme Munro, Chief Executive of Historic Scotland to respond. His reply is as follows:</p>

  <p>No. Historic Scotland has never knowingly discouraged suitable applications from being made under the Historic Buildings Repair Grant Scheme. Previously, general advice was given to applicants on when their projects might gain a place in Historic Scotland&rsquo;s forward programme in the light of the demand for these grants. This advice was intended to assist applicants to plan their fund raising and the preparation and submission of technical information. Such advice is now given on a case-by-case basis and updated as the application proceeds through various stages.</p>

  <p>I have asked Graeme Munro, Chief Executive of Historic Scotland to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Against a total commitment of &#163;12.7 million for the current year grantees are currently indicating to Historic Scotland that they intend to draw down &#163;11.7 million (this is against a budget allocation of &#163;11.1 million). In calculating this figure, Historic Scotland has used the information provided by grantees, or the relevant professional advisers, about the progress of work on site. However, from experience, Historic Scotland does not expect a full drawdown of this amount. The figure is updated monthly.</p>

  <p>The actual spend to 31 October 2002 expressed in cash terms is &#163;4.45 million or 41.6% of the budget. In resource accounting terms, valuations amounting to &#163;3.3 million (31%) have been received by the agency.</p>

  <p>Under section 5 of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979, if it appears to Scottish ministers that any works are urgently necessary for the preservation of a scheduled monument, they may enter the site of the monument and execute those works after giving the owner and the occupier notice in writing of their intention to do so. Such powers would be exercised on behalf of Scottish ministers by Historic Scotland. There are currently no plans to exercise these powers in respect of Castle Tioram.</p>

  <p>In his report following the Public Local Inquiry the reporter found that the castle was inherently strong but concluded that without major consolidation work the risk of further collapse in five to 10 years was significant. Under section 5 of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979, if it appears to Scottish ministers that any works are urgently necessary for the preservation of a scheduled monument, they may enter the site of the monument and execute those works after giving the owner and the occupier notice in writing of their intention to do so. Such powers would be exercised on behalf of Scottish ministers by Historic Scotland. There are currently no plans to exercise these powers in respect of Castle Tioram but Scottish ministers would like to see all erosion arrested as any decay can compromise the cultural significance of a monument.</p>

  <p>The owners of Castle Tioram have lodged an appeal with the Court of Session on a point of law. However, officials in Historic Scotland would be happy to discuss long-term conservation measures with them if an approach was made.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Cardiothoracic specialties include: cardiothoracic surgery, cardiac surgery, thoracic surgery.</p>

  <p>2. Scottish residents only.</p>

  <p>The planned development of cardiac services in Scotland is set out in the <i>Coronary Heart Disease and Stroke Strategy for Scotland</i>, published on 3 October 2002. An additional &#163;40 million is being made available to implement the strategy, and this will support achievement of the new waiting times targets. By 2004, the maximum wait for angiography will reduce from 12 weeks to eight weeks, and for cardiac surgery or angioplasty from 24 weeks to 18 weeks.</p>

  <p>Maximum capacity of the Adult Cardiac Centres in Scotland is dictated by a range of factors, notably availability of skilled staff including surgeons, anaesthetists and nurses. Under the CHD and Stroke Strategy, NHSScotland is pursuing a number of initiatives the effect of which will be to increase capacity and thus help to further reduce waiting times.</p>

  <p>The general funding made available to Scottish police forces takes account of the wide range of policing functions which they undertake, and the methodology by which allocations are made between forces is reviewed from time to time. Forces also receive additional specific funding from the Scottish Executive to meet the costs of ports policing. That additional funding, which covers policing at both Stranraer and Cairnryan, has been the subject of a separate review which concluded earlier this year.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The question asked for the cost to be based on the cost of the contract. Non-domestic rates are not a contractual cost but are a separate obligation on SPS and were therefore not included.</p>

  <p>If the cost of rates had been included, this would not have had a material impact on the annual average cost per prisoner place.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The information requested is not available. Some prisoners are imprisoned frequently, for short periods and re-offend very shortly after release. It is therefore possible for a prisoner to be received into custody under sentence for offences committed before those for which they had last been remanded in custody. The available information therefore cannot identify how the offences for which a prisoner is serving a sentence relate to the charges for any previous period on remand.</p>
