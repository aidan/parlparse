  <p>The latest information available from ISD Scotland shows no medical staff employed by North Glasgow University Hospitals Trust in the specialty of audiological medicine as at 30 September 2000. This is a relatively recent addition to the specialty list and it may be that staff recorded in other ways were carrying out audiological services. Local NHS management will hold information on the current position.

  <p>As with all cancer centres, the numbers of patients treated at the Beatson Oncology Centre depend on the numbers of new patients referred and the pattern and disposition of in-patient and out-patient services. Out-patient facilities are delivered both at the Beatson and at outreach clinics across the West of Scotland. Chemotherapy treatment is often delivered at local hospitals and clinics so that patients are treated as close to home as possible.</p>

  <p>During the year ending 30 September 2001 the following in-patient and day case episodes and out-patient attendances were recorded at the Western Infirmary, Glasgow, for clinical and medical oncology. The Beatson Oncology Centre is sited within the Western Infirmary.</p>

  <p>Nineteen applicants were ineligible because they had a working central heating system and one applicant had not occupied the house for the required 12 months.

  <p>We have already said that we are aiming to make better use of technology and civilian staff as well as cutting paperwork. The drive to reduce bureaucracy is being taken forward on a range of fronts including, for example, the review of common police services; through the implementation of best value principles; through provisions in the forthcoming legislation and in other ways to release more police officers for front line work; and through investment in better information and communications technology.</p>

  <p>These measures are just part of the wide-ranging reform agenda for the police in Scotland which we are taking forward in partnership with police authorities and police associations.</p>

  <p>A local authority may refer a homeless applicant to another authority if the applicant (a) has no local connection with the authority to whom he/she has applied, (b) has a local connection with the other authority and (c) will not be at risk of domestic violence in the other local authority area.

  <p>There is no provision under the terms of the Individual Learning Accounts (ILA) scheme to make compensation payments.

  <p>It is not possible to quantify this figure on a monthly basis. In total over 215,000 Individual Learning Accounts (ILA) were opened in 2001 and over 108,000 activated. The number of learners taking up learning, with or without an ILA grant, would be expected to vary from year to year.</p>

  <p>The following is a copy of the letter issued on 27 June 2001:</p>

  <p>Dear Sir/Madam</p>

  <p>INDEPENDENT ASSESSOR POSTS TO OVERSEE THE PUBLIC APPOINTMENTS PROCESS IN SCOTLAND</p>

  <p>I am writing to seek your assistance in identifying individuals who might be considered for appointment as Independent Assessors for Public Appointments. I am also writing in similar terms to a wide range of groups and organisations throughout Scotland seeking nominations for consideration for appointment (the list at Annex A refers). It is anticipated that up to 10 appointments will be made in total from across the diverse range of Scottish society.</p>

  <p>The role of the Independent Assessor is to assist Scottish Ministers in the task of making effective public appointments that command public confidence and to provide an assurance that the appointment process has conformed with the principles and practices set out in the Code of Practice issued by the Commissioner for Public Appointments. Details of the 7 principles contained in the Commissioner&rsquo;s Code are attached at Annex B for ease of reference. In short, an Assessor has to be able to provide an assurance that appointments have been made on merit after fair, open and transparent process.</p>

  <p>As you will be aware, in his statement to Parliament on proposed changes to public bodies and the public appointments system in Scotland on 21 June, the Minister for Finance and Local Government announced that in the future responsibility for the appointment and training of Independent Assessors would transfer to a new Scottish Commissioner for Public Appointments. However, until formal arrangements are in place to implement all the proposed changes we need to have sufficient numbers of Assessors in place to ensure that the current system continues to function.</p>

  <p>Ten of the Executive&rsquo;s 25 Assessors are due to stand down on 30 June. Ministers have agreed that 10 new Assessors are needed to ensure that the appointments system continues to operate effectively during the period of transition ahead. The Executive is keen to ensure that these new appointments should reflect the diversity of modern Scottish society and that is why I would like to enlist your help in identifying possible candidates to carry out this role during the transition period. Thereafter it would be for the Scottish Commissioner to decide whether or not to retain the services of these Assessors.</p>

  <p>I hope that you will be able to assist by providing names of potential candidates for these posts. If you would like further information, a job description, person specification and application form please contact:</p>

  <p><u>The Principles</u></p>

  <p>The Commissioner for Public Appointments&rsquo; Code of Practice covers all Ministerial appointments to the boards of executive and advisory non-departmental public bodies, health bodies, public corporations and nationalised industries.</p>

  <p><u>Ministerial Responsibility</u></p>

  <p>The ultimate responsibility for appointments rests with Ministers.</p>

  <p><u>Merit</u></p>

  <p>All public appointments should be governed by the overriding principle of selection based on merit, by the well-informed choice of individuals who, through their abilities, experience and qualities, match the needs of the public bodies in question.</p>

  <p><u>Independent Scrutiny</u></p>

  <p>No appointment shall take place without first being scrutinised by a panel which must include an independent assessor.</p>

  <p><u>Equal Opportunities</u></p>

  <p>Departments should sustain programmes to promote and deliver the principles of equal opportunities.</p>

  <p><u>Probity</u></p>

  <p>Board members must be committed to the principles and values of public service and perform their duties with integrity.</p>

  <p><u>Openness and Transparency</u></p>

  <p>The principles of open Government must be applied to the appointments process, its working must be transparent and information must be provided about appointments made.</p>

  <p><u>Proportionality</u></p>

  <p>The appointments procedures need to be subject to the principles of &lsquo;proportionality&rsquo;, that is they should be appropriate for the nature of the post and the size and weight of its responsibilities.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what its position is on the planned withdrawal of core funding for Borders Women&rsquo;s Aid, reported in <i>The</i> <i>Southern Reporter</i> on 24 January 2002, and, in light of the service this group provides to women and children who are victims of domestic violence in the Scottish Borders Council area, what action it will take to ensure that this service continues.</p>

  <p>The Local Government Spending Review 2000 provides an extra &pound;1.2 billion in support for local government over three years &ndash; an increase in real terms of 10.5%. It is the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s view that this should enable all local authorities to provide the necessary support for all women&rsquo;s refuges. It is therefore the responsibility of Scottish Borders Council to allocated funding according to its priorities. The National Group on Domestic Abuse, which I chair, will be looking at funding for service provision as part of its future work programme.</p>

  <p>Apart from three Social Inclusion Partnership areas in Glasgow which have made specific representations to the Executive in relation to their boundaries, there are no plans to review the coverage of Social Inclusion Partnership areas in Glasgow.</p>

  <p>In relation to the three areas under review at present, there is of course no guarantee that this review will lead to a change in the position.</p>

  <p>The boundaries of area-based Social Inclusion Partnerships (SIPs) are not co-terminous with those of parliamentary constituencies in Glasgow and in some cases individual Social Inclusion Partnership areas extend into a number of different constituencies. For this reason it is extremely difficult to attribute a specific amount of SIP spend to individual constituencies. There are also three thematic SIPs in Glasgow, the Big Step, Routes Out of Prostitution, and Glasgow Anti-Racist Alliance whose spend is not attributable to any parliamentary constituency as they serve communities of interest rather than physical communities.</p>
