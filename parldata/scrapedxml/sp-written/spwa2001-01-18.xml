  <p>I understand that, on 19 December, you met with Mr Adrian Lucas, the Chief Executive of the Scottish Ambulance Service, to discuss ambulance cover in Banff and Buchan. Following that meeting he wrote to you to confirm that you will receive the further data which you requested from Mr Raymond Gordon, Divisional Manager of the Ambulance Service&#8217;s North East Division.

  <p>Provisional figures indicate that the number of pupils studying mathematics at SCE Higher/National Qualification Higher level in the 1999-2000 session increased slightly from 1998-99. The number taking physics did, however, decline slightly over the same period. The introduction of new National Qualifications at Intermediate level have seen an encouraging rise in participation rates in physics and mathematics which are likely to result in increased participation at the higher levels of study in future years. The Executive is also preparing a science strategy which will cover science education including physics.</p>

A number of other applications are currently under consideration which, if approved, could take the total assistance to some &#163;4.3 million.

  <p>The Executive will continue discussions with the fishing industry about the economic impact of the outcome of the December Council early in 2001. Only in relation to North Sea cod and North Sea whiting would we expect to see significant shortfalls compared to landings in 2000.

  <p>Scotland currently educates 14.5% of the UK total of medical students, which is significantly more than its pro rata share of 10% based on relative population size.</p>

  <p>The number of medical students should not be decided in isolation. It should be linked to the number of career-grade doctors that the NHS in Scotland will need in the future, and the number of postgraduate doctors in training that are needed to provide services and to supply those career-grade doctors. <i>Our National Health</i>, the health plan for Scotland published on 14 December, includes a commitment to a fundamental review of medical workforce planning, including the intake of medical students and the possibility of fast-track graduate-entry medical degree courses in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Each year local authorities receive a block allocation for expenditure on a number of services including transport. It is for local authorities to set their priorities and allocate resources according to local circumstances.</p>

  <p>However, this year we provided an additional capital allocation of &#163;5.2 million to local authorities to take forward work specifically on safer routes to school. This money could have been used on cycle parking facilities or on capital expenditure to facilitate cycle training if the local authority chose to do so.</p>

  <p>In 1998, some &#163;580,000 of grant was provided through the Cycle Challenge Initiative as pump priming to 35 innovative cycling projects throughout Scotland. Of these, four related directly to school cycling projects.</p>

  <p>Finally, I recently announced that in the third round of competition for the Public Transport Fund, &#163;4.3 million was awarded to cycling and walking projects.

  <p>The overall management of their school building stock is a matter for individual education authorities. Detailed consistent information of the kind requested is not available centrally. Education authorities generally have their own assessments of school building maintenance and other needs, although these may not be on a basis which is consistent across authorities. We will be discussing with local authority representatives aspects of school building needs, including the scope for improving the consistency of such information across all authorities.</p>
