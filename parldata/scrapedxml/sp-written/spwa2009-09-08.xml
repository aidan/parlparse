  <p>The dialogue around identity and the meaning of multiculturalism or pluralism in modern day Scotland is being taken forward in partnership with a range of stakeholders including Black and Ethnic Minority Infrastructure Scotland (BEMIS) and Council for Ethnic Minority Voluntary Organisations (CEMVO). These stakeholders are in turn in contact with a range of communities, and we would expect that they would engage those communities, including the Irish Community organisations. It is our intention to involve as many minority ethnic communities as possible, including the Irish community, in our work around identity and multiculturalism. The race conference planned for early 2010 will provide an excellent opportunity to focus on these issues and the Irish community organisations will be invited to attend.</p>

  <p>The option of tax increment financing (TIF) is currently being explored as one of a number of possible ways to fund new infrastructure development in Scotland. Work on potential TIF pilots is being led by individual councils together with the Scottish Futures Trust, in consultation with the Scottish Government, COSLA and other partners. One of the objectives of the Scottish Futures Trust in its Business Plan for 2009-10 is to examine the TIF structure to assess whether it is replicable in suitable areas of Scotland. The Scottish Government is supporting this work. All emerging TIF proposals would be assessed on their individual merits.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government and COSLA jointly published guidance on local housing strategies in 2008. The guidance indicates that the housing need of the six equality strands should be written into the local housing strategy. I understand that Falkirk Council intend to consult with a range of stakeholders over the course of 2009-10 when preparing their next full local housing strategy, and are also modifying the structures that are in place to support this process. The Scottish Government continues to support all councils in developing their local housing strategies through on-going liaison and, through this route, promote the importance of the involvement of all equalities groups.</p>

  <p>There are 12 Care and Repair national indicators introduced with effect from April 1999. These can be seen at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.careandrepairscotland.co.uk/static/docs/performance_indicators2006_07.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.careandrepairscotland.co.uk/static/docs/performance_indicators2006_07.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p>However, these national indicators focus on monitoring inputs and outputs rather than outcomes. While it is important to measure these, there are questions about whether the current measures are fit for purpose and whether these provide the evidence to judge how effective the service is in delivering local and national outcomes.</p>

  <p>The recently published review of Care and Repair therefore recommends the introduction of a national performance monitoring framework to measure the outcomes of Care and Repair agencies, to allow them to benchmark their achievements against others, and to be able to articulate how this contributes to local and national housing priorities, to the housing contribution to the health and social care agenda and to the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Purpose. We are now taking this forward. <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2009/08/12134857/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2009/08/12134857/0</a>.</p>

  <p>There are 68 ViSOR terminals now available for use in Criminal Justice Social Work with a further eight terminals soon to be deployed. This, in addition to improvements in technical functionality to save staff time and the provision of specialist training, will result in greater use of ViSOR by Criminal Justice Social Work.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Prison Service (SPS) currently has access to a ViSOR terminal and inputs data prior to the release of sex offenders. In the longer term, SPS is considering the feasibility of developing electronic links between ViSOR and its own IT system.</p>

  <p>National Objectives and Standards for the delivery of social work services in the criminal justice system, with the associated guidance, set out the principles of planning and preparation for release and supervision of offenders in the community.</p>

  <p>We plan to introduce a revised and updated version of these standards, which will provide a concise statement of core processes and practices to be applied in a variety of duties and contexts, including risk assessment and case management</p>

  <p>We are also working with local authorities to introduce the Level of Service Case Management Inventory (LS/CMI) which will introduce a common approach to risk assessment and case management for criminal justice social work and other responsible authorities. This approach includes a method for assessing the nature, pattern and seriousness of offending and where a risk of harm is identified it provides a framework for risk management planning. The method of delivery for this project is currently subject to a national consultation exercise, which will also aims to establish the quality assurance framework which will support long term delivery of consistent approaches to risk assessment and risk management.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is working with agencies to introduce the Level of Service Case Management Inventory (LS/CMI) which aims to introduce a common approach for risk assessment and case management across agencies tasked with managing offenders. The version of LS/CMI proposed for use across agencies also includes a method for assessing the nature, pattern and seriousness of the offending and, where a risk of serious harm is identified, provides a framework for risk management planning.</p>

  <p>No formal assessment has been undertaken, although it is reasonable to assume that general business concerns regarding prompt payment also apply in the case of public sector supply chains. The Scottish Government&rsquo;s own standard terms and conditions of contract have, for some time, required prime contractors to pay their sub-contractors promptly. Our standard contracts have now been amended to require prompt payment throughout the supply chain within 30 days of receipt of a valid invoice. The new clause requires the contracting body to specify an individual to whom non-compliance of the terms and conditions should be reported.</p>

  <p>I can confirm that all applications were subject to the same four stage assessment process: an initial sift to check eligibility, scoring against key assessment criteria for the fund, consideration of the ranked order by an Independent Advisory Panel before final deliberation by myself and ministerial colleagues. Our decisions were guided by the extent to which projects demonstrated that they met the aims of the fund, whilst taking as much account of geographic spread as was possible.</p>

  <p>The assessment process is detailed in full on the Scottish Government website at:</p>

  <p>As of September 2009, we have allocated &pound;2.196 million to WATES projects, and a further &pound;0.75 million on the infrastructure needed to deploy them at the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC) in Orkney.</p>

  <p>This leaves &pound;8.459 million of WATES project money and over &pound;2 million of related infrastructure funding still to be drawn down. Four of the eight WATES projects are complete, with the remainder still on track for completion by March 2011. This means that, as things stand, there will be no unused funds.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is continuing to provide direct capital support to several projects which were awarded grants under the first WATES round. We expect some of these projects to start receiving revenue payments in the near future, following their successful deployment at the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC) in Orkney.</p>

  <p>We have also introduced the highest levels of revenue support for wave and tidal power within the UK, following recent changes to our Renewables Obligation legislation with five ROCs for wave and three ROCs for tidal stream projects.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government also welcomes the proposed &pound;22 million Marine Energy Proving Fund, announced by DECC and which will be available for projects across the UK. This fund will build on our successful WATES scheme, supporting the testing and demonstration of pre-commercial wave and tidal stream devices.</p>

  <p>We have also introduced the &pound;10 million Saltire Prize challenge, which will<strong> attract international investment in the commercial deployment of marine renewables in Scottish waters.</strong></p>

  <p>The emerging offshore renewable sectors will need sound infrastructure, and a strong and responsive supply chain. These are critical issues, pinpointed in our Renewables Action Plan and the recently published Marine Energy Road Map. The Scottish Government is working with its partners to look at the improvements which are needed and how they might be delivered.</p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise and <em>Highlands and Islands Enterprise</em> (HIE) are carrying out a strategic assessment (the National Renewables Infrastructure Project). This is looking at the ports and harbours infrastructure that the offshore renewables technologies will need. It will develop a spatial framework for port and port-side land infrastructure (including sites for integrated manufacturing, and maintenance/vessel support bases) which can support the manufacturing, construction, operation and maintenance of commercial wave, tidal and offshore wind devices.</p>

  <p>The findings from this work will be reported back in October 2009, and the findings will help inform future strategic investment decisions. As part of this work I will lead a trade mission to the German port of Bremerhaven, recognised as a leader in supporting offshore renewables.</p>

  <p>At a local level Single Outcome Agreements now reflect a Community Planning Partnership&rsquo;s agreed outcomes for their local area, taking into account local circumstances and therefore the particular local priorities needed to make progress.

  <p>: The Scottish Parliament Christmas card, for members&rsquo; use in their capacity as elected representatives, features the Scottish Parliament logo. There are specific rules in place relating to the Parliament&rsquo;s logo which is an armorial bearing. These state that</p>

  <p><em>Members should not allow other people to use the logo. Any permitted use is for use by the member only and not by any other person.</em></p>

  <p><em>&hellip;</em>and <em>the logo is subject to heraldic, copyright and Trade Mark laws and that misuse of the logo or of Parliamentary stationery bearing the logo may result in legal action or may constitute a breach of the Code of Conduct.</em></p>

  <p>Members&rsquo; names can be included in the cards, but not names of specific family members such as spouses.</p>
