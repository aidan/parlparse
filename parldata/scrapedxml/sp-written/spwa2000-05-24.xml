  <p>I have announced on 15 May that I shall be setting up a task force to identify the true extent of the problem and its characteristics, set out a detailed programme of action, detail where resources have to be spent and provide targets to drive forward improvement.</p>

  <p>Meantime, the Executive is funding a 40,000 increase in student places in the FE colleges. I have asked the Scottish Further Education Funding Council and the colleges to consider what proportion of the additional places should appropriately be targeted at those in need of basic skills courses.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Screening Programme Central Co-ordinating Unit provides guidance to Breast Screening Centres about repeat mammogram appointments. The number of views taken at repeat mammography appointments is based on an assessment of each individual case and depends on the reason for calling the woman back and on the individual's physical condition. Geographical location is not taken into account in determining the number of views.</p>

  <p>The results of the Scottish project aimed at assessing the implications of extending the upper age limit of invitation for breast screening are being considered by the Scottish Breast Screening National Advisory Group.

  <p>Schedule 2 of the Further and Higher Education (Scotland) Act 1992 does not provide that any member of a board of management must be a representative of a trade union. However, it does provide that one of the board members shall be elected by the teaching staff of the college from within their number and one by the non-teaching staff of the college from within their number.</p>

  <p>I have no plans to do so.</p>

  <p>Schedule 2 of the Further and Higher Education (Scotland) Act 1992 requires that not less than half of the total number of the board must be appointed by the board from among persons, not being members of the staff or full-time students at the college, appearing to them to have experience of, and to have shown capacity in, industrial, commercial or employment matters or the practice of any profession. One such person must be a person nominated by the local enterprise company for the area in which the college is located.</p>

  <p>Accordingly, the board is expected to fill a vacancy, other than those places reserved for the Principal and for representatives of staff and students, by deciding which persons appear to them to be most suitable in terms of their experience and capacity to contribute to the management of the college.</p>

  <p>College boards have a statutory duty to manage their colleges and to ensure that they provide suitable and efficient further education to students of their colleges. They have powers to remove members from office in particular circumstances. Scottish Ministers also have powers to remove any or all members of a board if it appears to them that the affairs of the board have been or are being mismanaged.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Further Education Funding Council is responsible for ensuring that the highest standards are in place across all colleges&#8217; activities, including the efficient management of colleges. I look forward to receiving shortly a report commissioned from the council following a review of the Management of Scottish Further Education Colleges. I shall consider carefully the council&#8217;s findings and recommendations.</p>

  <p>As part of England&#8217;s public health agenda, as detailed in its White Paper <i>Saving Lives: Our Healthier Nation</i> , a Public Health Observatory is being established in each of its eight NHS Regions. Their role will be to facilitate local priority-setting and planning by monitoring disease patterns and trends at local level; to analyse data to give early warning of emerging health problems and changes in health trends, and to evaluate the impact of local actions and assess the effectiveness of local agencies in improving health and tackling health inequalities. In Scotland the forthcoming creation of the Public Health Institute, which was proposed as part of the review of the Public Health Function, will contribute to the development and co-ordination of the efforts of the organisations already working on such issues.</p>

The Scottish Executive already recognises the importance of a flexible approach to decision making in Scottish local government. We acknowledge that different arrangements in different councils are sometimes necessary due to the diverse nature of Scottish councils.

  <p>The means test used to assess contributions in higher education has not changed materially for many years. We plan to radically review the existing arrangements and will consult on any proposals for change. Information about any particular areas of concern will be considered as part of this process.</p>

  <p>Currently, the parental contribution is normally based on the gross income of the parent(s) for the immediately preceding financial year, less certain deductions, which for the most part are those allowable for tax purposes. Estimated income for the current financial year may be used instead where it can be shown that a parent&#8217;s income is likely to drop by 15% or more compared to the previous year.</p>

  <p>I can today announce the publication of our consultation document <i>Scotland: The Learning Nation &#8211; Helping Students.</i></p>

  <p>This booklet gives more detail about our proposals for changing the way we help students in further and higher education. It builds on our initial response in January to the Cubie Report and responds to all 52 recommendations.</p>

  <p>Our plans include; &pound;3 million for each of the next two academic years to be spent on support with childcare costs for students on further education courses, in particular for students on part-time courses; and bursaries of up to &pound;2,000 for young students in higher education. We will also provide older students in higher education who have additional responsibilities with extra money through bursaries, over and above the available loan support.</p>

  <p>The launch of <i>Helping Students</i> signals the start of a comprehensive consultation exercise on our proposals. People have until 31 August to let us have their views. I am particularly keen to have comments on our plans for the Graduate Endowment and its collection as part of the pre-legislative consideration.</p>

  <p>Copies of the document can be found in SPICe and at:</p>

  <p>I expect to receive the report from Professor McCrone's Committee on Wednesday 31 May. In terms of the committee's remit, the report will be made jointly to me and to the Convenors of the employers and teachers side of the SJNC.</p>

  <p>I am confident that the report will be both thorough and wide-ranging. The report will undoubtedly require careful and thorough consideration. It will be important that all parties with an interest have the opportunity to consider the report and its recommendations in detail. I made clear when I established the committee that I would undertake consultation with the relevant parties before decisions on implementation were made. I have therefore written today to the Convenors of the employers and teachers sides to set out my proposals for consultation and for detailed discussions about implementation. Copies of my letter are available in SPICe. I have said that I intend to meet each of the parties in a series of bilateral consultations in the course of the summer and that implementation should be discussed in a specially convened Implementation Group, which I shall chair. I propose that the Implementation Group will hold its first meeting in early September and that it should aim to reach conclusions by the end of the year 2000 with a view to implementation of changes starting from April 2001.</p>
