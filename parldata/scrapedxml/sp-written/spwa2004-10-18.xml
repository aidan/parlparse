  <p>Carbon dioxide emissions data for Scotland and the UK are available in the publication <em>Greenhouse Gas Inventories for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland: 1999-2001</em> , a copy of which has been placed in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib number 32027) and is also available on the Executive&rsquo;s climate change web-site at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/climatechange" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/climatechange</a> .</p>

  <p>Both the European Environment Agency and the United Nations publish data on European and international carbon dioxide emissions which can be accessed at <a href="http://www.eea.eu.int/" target="_blank">www.eea.eu.int/</a> and <a href="http://unfccc.int/" target="_blank">http://unfccc.int/</a>.</p>

  <p>Care must be taken when comparing countries emissions levels, which are not always reported on a like-for-like basis. For example, in the case of carbon dioxide, the &quot;National Total&quot; on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Greenhouse Gas Inventory database does not include emissions from biomass burning or emissions or removals from the land use change and forestry sector. By contrast, the UK inventory does include such emissions and removals.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to state what proportion of pig farms comply with the requirements of the Welfare of Farmed Animals (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 2003 as we do not have information on every pig farm. However, the State Veterinary Service (SVS) and local authority animal health and welfare officers undertake visits to pig and other livestock farms on a routine basis to monitor compliance with EU welfare requirements. Other targeted visits are conducted following any complaints.</p>

  <p>We have no central records for local authority visits. During 2004, the SVS have recorded 60 visits to pig breeding establishments and 50 visits to growing establishments to date. Only a small proportion of these visits revealed non-compliance with the provision of manipulable material and breaches relating to tail docking. In cases where there is non-compliance with the legislation, but no immediate pain or distress, the SVS initially takes an advisory approach. In only one case did this not rectify the problem and a statutory notice was served by SVS to resolve the matter.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally. Decisions relating to the funding provided to Community Councils are made locally by individual local authorities and we do not collect this information.</p>

  <p>We strongly support the principle of local communities benefiting from ownership of renewable energy developments. Highlands and Islands Enterprise is pioneering a scheme that will enable communities within its area to own or share in renewables developments. We are monitoring this closely and will consider whether it might be possible to extend the principle to other areas of Scotland.</p>

  <p>We believe that it is important that the renewable energy industry&rsquo;s immediate and future skills needs are identified and plans put in place to deliver these needs. The Forum for Renewable Energy Development in Scotland (FREDS) has therefore established a sub-group to look at this issue, it will report in the spring of next year. In taking forward its remit, the sub-group will work with the appropriate sector skills councils and take account of existing education and skills policies.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive <a name="QuestionText">whether it is aware that the water supply for the communities at Ardgour and Clovullin has been contaminated with cryptosporidium since the end of August 2004 and that there has been no potable supply of water since that date; what steps Scottish Water has taken, and is taking, to address the situation; how it will now provide a clean water supply; why Scottish Water did not supply bottled water immediately after the discovery of cryptosporidium; who was responsible for taking the decision not to supply bottled water, and whether such a decision was taken to save costs.</a></p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is aware that the Consultant in Public Health Medicine (CPHM) for Highland NHS Board has required Scottish Water to issue advice to its customers in Ardgour to boil their drinking water because of high levels of Cryptosporidium in the supply. Boiling the water makes it safe to drink but Scottish Water is also supplying bottled water to customers in the area with special needs. Customers with special needs are identified by the local authority and the NHS Board.</p>

  <p>Scottish Water has plans in its current investment programme to improve the Ardgour supply but these are not scheduled to be complete until 2005. The plans involve a sub-sea pipeline under Loch Linnhe and although Scottish Water is looking at how these plans can be accelerated, this may not be possible due to technical difficulties.</p>

  <p>Scottish Water continues to liaise with the CPHM regarding the Boil Water Notice which will stay in place until the level of Cryptosporidium in the supply falls to an acceptable level.</p>
