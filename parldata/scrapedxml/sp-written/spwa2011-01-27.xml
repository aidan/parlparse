  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the health impact of a minimum price of 45p per unit of alcohol would be compared with the UK Government&rsquo;s proposal to ban the sale of alcohol below the rate of duty plus VAT.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2011-01-27.S3O-12723.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80396" speakername="Nicola Sturgeon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-11/wa0127.htm#1">

  <p>The UK Government&rsquo;s proposal would create a range of minimum prices, typically in the region of 20 to 25 pence per unit of alcohol depending on the product. This means the retail price of drinks will not change and the policy will have little or no impact on deaths, chronic and acute illness and violent crime.</p>

  <p>By contrast, a 45p minimum price would save 225 lives per year, reduce chronic and acute illnesses by 2,600 per year, reduce crimes by the same amount, and would generate a harm reduction value of &pound;721 million over the first 10 years.</p>

  <p>On abolition in 2007, the tolls on the Forth Road Bridge (FRB) for cars and light goods vehicles were &pound;1 per crossing. North bound only.</p>

  <p>This meant an annual cost of tolls of &pound;230 per annum (based on a five-day working week over a 46-week working year, assuming six weeks holiday per annum). Frequent user discount vouchers were available on the FRB. If these were used then the reduced rate of &pound;0.90 was applied and the annual cost would have been &pound;207 per annum based on the same conditions above.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is mindful of the importance of school security for pupils and staff at all schools across Scotland. The resources provided within the local government settlement reflect the need for school security measures, although it is for each authority to decide on the extent, focus and detail of such expenditure. If any particular problems are experienced by any faith school the Scottish Government is prepared to discuss them with that school.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government published a draft version of the Electricity Generation Policy Statement to coincide with the publication of the Report on Proposals and Policies (RPP). The RPP has common proposals and was subject to a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) within the terms of the Environmental Assessment (Scotland) Act 2005. This draft publication of the Policy Statement was to provide the committee with sufficient information in order to scrutinise the RPP and the analytical assumptions on which it was based.</p>

  <p>It is therefore our intention following this process to establish what elements within Electricity Generation Policy Statement require further assessment within the terms of the 2005 act and to undertake in the coming months a meaningful assessment and consultation on those elements.</p>

  <p>However, there is extensive guidance on the appropriate use of pesticides in the Pesticides Code of Practice for using plant protection products in Scotland.

  <p>This information is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The Scottish House Condition Survey measures the impact of all energy efficiency measures installed in the housing stock each year.</p>

  <p>In order to tackle fuel poverty, the Home Insulation Scheme provides intensive promotion of a range of energy efficiency programmes and related support to householders on the door-step in specific areas. In addition to insulation measures, HIS ensures that households that are likely to be fuel poor in targeted areas are systematically offered support from the Scottish Government&rsquo;s fuel poverty programme, the Energy Assistance Package. In respect of HIS areas supported by 2009-10 budgets, this has provided:</p>

  <p>- 4,503 referrals to benefits checks to increase incomes</p>

  <p>- 10,419 referrals for tariff checks to reduce fuel costs</p>

  <p>- 4,226 referrals for heating systems and other measures.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has carried out an assessment in our paper &quot;Housing Benefit changes: Scottish Impact Assessment&quot; which estimates that, as a result of the initial tranche of reforms to be introduced this April, 55,000 households claiming Local Housing Allowance in the private rental sector could be directly adversely affected losing an average of &pound;10 per week. This represents around 2.4% of all households in Scotland and 97% of households claiming Local Housing Allowance.</p>

  <p>It is for local authorities as independent corporate bodies to decide whether they dispose of their assets to community groups or trusts. New Regulations were introduced on 1 June 2010 simplifying the procedures local authorities must follow when considering a disposal at less than best consideration.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government supports local authorities making local decisions to meet the needs and priorities of their local communities. It also recognises that, in the right circumstances, community asset ownership can be a powerful way for communities to develop and become more empowered. For that reason, we have invested &pound;250,000 in a programme run by the Development Trust Association Scotland which aims to learn from and promote good practice in transferring assets from local authorities to community groups.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive for what reason Moray Council&rsquo;s grant allocation has reduced from 1.629% of the Scottish budget in 2010-11 to 1.601% in 2011-12.</p>

  <p>The present needs-based distribution formula for local government funding is one which has been in place for many years. The formula was reviewed jointly, by the Scottish government and COSLA, in 2009, and it concluded that the existing indicators were reasonable and should be retained and updated for 2011-12.</p>

  <p>The key changes which have led to the Moray Council&rsquo;s reduction in share are as a result of the following reasons:</p>

  <p>Population is the key driver and latest estimates show that the Moray Council&rsquo;s population for young people aged five to 15 has fallen by 8.2% for 2011-12 compared with those used in the 2010-11 settlement. The Scottish average is a reduction of 4.6%.</p>

  <p>The Moray Council&rsquo;s share of the former ring-fenced grants has fallen to 0.98% for 2011-12 compared to 1.27% in 2010-11. This represents a drop of &pound;2.8 million from 2010-11. Again, this is a result of updated needs-based indicators as agreed with COSLA.</p>

  <p>The Moray Council will receive &pound;11.735 million for Loan Charge Support in 2011-12 compared to &pound;13.611 million 2010-11, a decrease of &pound;1.876 million. This is equivalent to a 13.8% fall in funding compared to the Scottish average of 11.6%. These allocations are based on the council&rsquo;s outstanding debt and latest interest charges.</p>

  <p>In allocating the available capital grant, the funding allocations for flood prevention schemes that were approved earlier were protected. That is why the Moray Council receives the lowest reduction in its overall capital support of -9.0%, compared to 2010-11, than other councils (Scottish average is -18.0%). It is also why in 2011-12 the Moray Council receives the highest<strong> </strong>per capita capital funding of any mainland authority and 111% above the Scottish average.</p>

  <p>The First Minister&rsquo;s statement was accurate. A newly qualified nurse would currently make &pound;21,176 per annum in basic pay. In order to calculate total cost, it is necessary to add 33.6% to this figure to represent both employer on-costs and additional payments which nurses are eligible for such as unsocial hours supplements. This then gives a figure of &pound;28,291 which divides into &pound;30 million 1,060 times.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Figures include long-term prisoners recalled from licence. For such prisoners, it is not possible to determine whether they have spent time in the Open Estate prior to their initial liberation.</p>

  <p>2. Prisoners may be released from closed conditions after having spent a period of time in the Open Estate. For the purposes of this analysis, these have been classified as having spent time in the Open Estate.</p>

  <p>3. The figures supplied are for convictions subsequent to release resulting in a custodial sentence only. This subsequent conviction may be for offences committed before the original period in custody.</p>

  <p>I have asked John Ewing, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS), to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>SPS does not hold this information as it is not practicable or cost effective to assess all prisoners to determine their literacy or numeracy needs.</p>

  <p>However, any prisoner who engages with the prison learning centre undergoes a detailed literacy and numeracy screening assessment to establish the individual&rsquo;s starting point level. The SPS classifies a prisoner&rsquo;s capabilities based on the national levels of Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) qualifications. Those identified at SQA Intermediate 1 level are deemed to be functioning at approximately foundation/general level at standard grade. Anybody at or below Intermediate 1 is considered to be lacking functional literacy or numeracy.</p>

  <p>The SPS will introduce a new literacy and numeracy screening and levelling tool as part of the new learning and skills contract which is scheduled to go live on 1<sup> </sup>August 2011. This tool will be applied to all prisoners serving six months or more.</p>

  <p>The following table shows the level of assessed literacy and numeracy need of those who attended the prison learning centres during 2009-10.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland is aware that queues occasionally form back onto the northbound M77 at times of exceptionally high retail activity. This is due to congestion arising from insufficient capacity on the privately-owned distributor roads serving the car parking areas, during these periods of very high demand. The developer&rsquo;s designers are currently in discussions with Transport Scotland to mitigate queuing at this exit. In the meantime our operating company Amey, Strathclyde Police and Traffic Scotland monitor queues implementing warning messages and other traffic management measures where necessary.</p>
