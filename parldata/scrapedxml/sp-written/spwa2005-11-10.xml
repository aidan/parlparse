  <p>The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) provides a licence for any given medicine in the UK. This ensures that medicines meet acceptable standards on safety, quality and efficacy. The Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) advises NHSScotland on the costs and benefits of new medicines after they have been licensed by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency/European Medicines Evaluation Agency.</p>

  <p>Currently the Scottish Medicines Consortium does not recommend that Memantine (Ebixa &reg;) is used to treat moderately severe to severe Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease.</p>

  <p>In England, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) has published an appraisal consultation document entitled &quot;Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease - donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine and memantine&quot;. The consultation closed on 22 March 2005 and can be accessed at <a href="http://www.nice.org.uk/page.aspx?o=245912" target="_blank">http://www.nice.org.uk/page.aspx?o=245912</a>. The consultation document does not constitute the Institute&rsquo;s formal guidance on these drugs and the recommendation made is preliminary and may change after the consultation.</p>

  <p>Once the final recommendation has been made NHS Quality Improvement Scotland will consider the implications of the guidance from NICE on these drugs for NHSScotland.</p>

  <p>Regional Selective Assistance grants are available to all eligible businesses, and are not restricted to specific sectors, nor is priority given to specific sectors. In practice, all projects that the Scottish Executive considers meet in full the criteria of the scheme will be offered Regional Selective Assistance.</p>

  <p>In general, prospective entrepreneurs can get advice on, and access to, public sector business support from the Business Gateway. Support is provided through four core programmes (business information; business start-up; business growth, and business high growth) to those who meet the eligibility criteria.</p>

  <p>The needs of frail older people will continue to be assessed by GPs, health visitors, OTs and social workers as required. However <em>Delivering for Health </em> (Bib. number 37847), the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s response to the <em>Kerr Report</em> (Bib. number 36608), commits the Health Department to the development of a risk prediction tool by 2006 which will allow for the identification of those liable to hospitalisation. NHS boards will then be expected to provide comprehensive, integrated care for those with the most complex health care needs and greatest vulnerability to emergency hospital admission.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Eaga Partnership Ltd administers the central heating and Warm Deal programmes on behalf of Communities Scotland. Complaints received directly by Communities Scotland are dealt with as part of complaint handling arrangements in place between Eaga and Communities Scotland. These arrangements require Eaga to undertake investigations into complaints received and to report back on the outcome to Communities Scotland. Should the circumstances warrant it, independent scrutiny of the nature of the complaints can be undertaken. The following table shows the number of complaints received regarding Eaga Partnership Ltd, since the central heating programme began in September 2001 to October 2005.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not available.</p>

  <p>The official source of low income data for Scotland is the Households Below Average Income (HBAI) dataset available from 1994-95. This is derived from the Family Resources Survey (FRS). The sample size of the FRS in Scotland is relatively small and can only be used to provide information for Scotland as a whole.</p>

  <p>The following link provides the latest low income headline figures for Scotland (2003-04), together with data for previous years. This was published on 30 March 2005: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/03/29170611/06123" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/03/29170611/06123</a>.</p>

  <p>A snapshot analysis of Benefits, such as Income Support and Job Seeker&rsquo;s Allowance, may be used as a proxy for low income poverty by geographical area. Such analyses need careful interpretation, however as changes in the benefits system affect the results over time: <a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/tabtool.asp" target="_blank">http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/tabtool.asp</a>.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it is satisfied with each of its departments&rsquo; policies in respect of public procurement processes and how it will ensure that the needs of local communities are taken into account in the development of such policies, in light of the recent decision to tender ferry services currently provided by Caledonian MacBrayne.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for public procurement policies within the Scottish Executive rests with the Scottish Procurement Directorate as opposed to each individual department.</p>

  <p><em>The Scottish Public Finance Manual </em>sets out a number of requirements in respect of procurement policy, including requirements that all procurement of goods and services should be based on value for money, having due regard for propriety and regularity.</p>

  <p>The specification of requirement would normally be designed to ensure that, where appropriate, the needs of the community are reflected. This would normally apply to service contracts. The Executive consulted widely on the draft service specification for the ferry services currently provided by Caledonian MacBrayne on the west coast. Some 705 responses were received. All of the points raised by the local island communities and other interest groups are being considered fully and will be factored into the final specification where possible.</p>

  <p>This is primarily a matter for fire and rescue authorities and joint fire and rescue boards. Procedures for promoting multi-tier entry to uniformed roles will be considered further once the change from a rank-based structure to a role-based structure (the Integrated Personal Development System) are completed, no later than the spring of 2006.</p>

  <p>HM Fire Services Inspectorate report that there has been a significant number of staff recruited into non-uniformed roles within the Fire and Rescue Service into non-operational positions which were historically occupied by uniformed staff. Further details are available on the Inspectorate&rsquo;s website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/hmifs" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/hmifs</a>.</p>

  <p>There is currently no specific procedure for accelerated promotion within the Fire and Rescue Service. However, it is open to staff to develop and compete for promotion to any role within the Integrated Personal Development System.</p>

  <p>In addition to consulting a wide range of stakeholders on specific fire and rescue service issues, the Scottish ministers have the benefit of advice prepared by HM Chief Inspector of Fire Services in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has consulted widely on proposals for a replacement advisory structure. In April 2005, we published the analysis report of the consultation responses. In the light of those responses, which generally supported two of the proposed six models for a new structure, we have been in discussion with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the Chief Fire Officers Association on how they see the model favoured by the majority of respondents as working in practice. We will give consideration to the final proposals and will advise stakeholders of a decision in due course.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the proposed Sildarvinnslan fishmeal processing factory at Sella Ness accords with advice on blue whiting from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea and the long-term management plan agreed for the stock by the European Union, Faroe Islands, Iceland and Norway in 2002.</p>

  <p>The currently agreed long-term management plan for the blue whiting stock sets an agreed target of maintaining a precautionary fishing mortality rate below F=0.32. The recent ICES advice notes that this target allows a Total Allowable Catch (TAC) of 1.5 million tonnes (mt) to be established for 2006. Neither the management plan nor the advice is concerned with capacity or location of processing facilities.</p>

  <p>A single electronic health record system accessible by patients and health care professionals will be procured over the period 2006-07 and rolled out across Scotland over the period 2007-10. The system will contain facilities for archiving and transmitting digital images such as x-rays and scans, electronic prescribing in hospitals, online diagnostic test ordering and clinical decision support.</p>

  <p>By June 2006:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>A single national electronic &quot;emergency care summary&quot; will be available across Scotland available to out-of-hours doctors and NHS 24 in the first instance and thereafter to other health care professionals with the need to know.</p>
<p>A growing number of out-patient referrals will be sent electronically, currently 60% and expected to rise to 90%.</p>
<p>Use of the CHI number will be universal.</p>
</blockquote></p>

  <p>Modern information support systems will also be in place in all accident and emergency departments to support our objectives for improvements to patient care in accident and emergency departments.</p>

  <p>The Executive recognises the difficulties faced by first-time buyers. We are investing &pound;1.2 billion in affordable homes, for affordable rent and low cost home ownership (LCHO), over this and the next two years. This represents an 80% expansion in the LCHO programme, and will support the provision of nearly 5,000 homes for LCHO across Scotland by 2008.</p>

  <p>The Homestake shared equity scheme, launched in March 2005, is targeted at first time buyers. Within three years, we expect to fund 1,000 Homestake houses a year across Scotland, making affordable housing available to those on low to modest incomes who aspire to home ownership.</p>

  <p>The full extent of the Executive&rsquo;s policies on affordable housing, including measures to assist first time buyers, is set out in our housing policy statement <em>Homes for</em> <em>Scotland&rsquo;s People</em>, published in March this year.

  <p>As Schedule 1 of the Identity Cards Bill stands at present, this would not be possible. Clause 4(1)(b) of Schedule 1 refers to &quot;the number of any ID card issued to him&quot;, and &quot;ID card&quot; is defined at Section 43 of the bill as meaning a card issued under the identity card scheme as specified by Section 8(1) of the bill.</p>

  <p>The bill allows for Schedule 1 to be amended via secondary legislation. However, we are not aware of any plans to seek to do so in the foreseeable future.</p>

  <p>The children of migrant workers are entitled to the same levels of education, health care and social support from local authorities and NHS boards as the children of our indigenous population.</p>

  <p>The Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 requires education authorities to identify, meet and keep under review the additional support needs of all pupils, including those for whom English is an additional language. The act also introduces a new framework for collaboration between schools and other agencies to ensure that all the needs of the individual child are met. For 2005-06, we are providing &pound;9.5 million to support implementation of the act, &pound;25 million to support the inclusion of pupils with additional support needs in mainstream schools and &pound;7.2 million for specific staff training around additional support needs.</p>

  <p>The Executive has commissioned the Scottish English as an Additional Language Co-ordinating Council (SEALCC) and the Centre for Education for Racial Equality in Scotland to produce a document on good practice for teaching pupils who have English as an additional language. This document will be published early next year. The Executive has already published an Education Guide for Asylum Seekers which may also be of use to migrant workers and their families. Our Relocation Advisory Service also provides information on education and child care opportunities to families who are considering relocating to Scotland.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not available. The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service&rsquo;s Case Management Database records details of the charges against each accused in terms of the specific common law or statutory offence that is alleged to have been committed. There are over 3,000 separate charge codes in use at present. These charge codes are not routinely categorised into broader categories of offence.</p>

  <p>Information is collected regularly about cases in which a decision is made that there should be &quot;No Further Proceedings&quot;. This information does not, however, distinguish between cases where the original decision was to initiate proceedings in the Sheriff court, cases where the original decision was to initiate proceedings in another court and cases where the original decision was to pursue a non-court disposal such as a Fiscal Fine.</p>

  <p>Since the Scotland Act came into force on 1 July 1999 all legislation enacted by the Scottish Parliament has required to comply with the convention rights as defined in the Human Rights Act 1998, and members of the Scottish Executive have had no power to make subordinate legislation or do any other act that would be incompatible with the convention rights. The convention rights are therefore taken into account in the preparation of all primary and secondary legislation within devolved competence. The Scottish Executive does not possess a comprehensive list of all legislative provisions applicable to Scotland that have been enacted specifically as a consequence of incorporation of the convention into Scots law, and such a list could only be produced at disproportionate cost.</p>

  <p>The Executive has received a number of written communications from individual local authorities on the subject of the implementation of the single status pay agreement. The issue has also been raised in the course of discussions that have taken place between COSLA and the Executive.</p>

  <p>However, it remains the case that the pay and conditions of local government staff are matters for local authorities. Although the Executive provides funding for salaries and wages as part of the block grant provided to local authorities, it is the responsibility of each authority as to how this money is allocated. The Executive was not involved in the negotiations between COSLA and the trade unions which resulted in single status pay agreement in 1999. In implementing the agreement, the Executive has made clear its view that local authorities should strike a balance between what is fair and equitable not just for the staff concerned but also for council tax payers.</p>

  <p>Decisions about discharging someone from NHS care and how their continuing care needs might best be met should be taken following an appropriate multi-disciplinary assessment of the patient&rsquo;s health, social care and housing needs in consultation with the patient&rsquo;s relatives and carers.</p>

  <p>The NHS will pay for care where someone meets the eligibility criteria for continuing NHS inpatient care outlined in NHS MEL (1996) 22 and if not eligible then the local authority also has a duty under the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 to assess the needs of and arrange for the provision of appropriate services. Residents placed by local authorities would normally be liable to contribute to their care home fees although those with assets of under &pound;19,500 would qualify for means-tested local authority funding. Those with higher capital may be eligible for free personal and nursing care support if they are aged 65 and over.</p>

  <p>Both NHS MEL (1996) 22 and the Framework for Mental Health Services in Scotland require that the individual is only discharged when an agreed care plan, support and accommodation are in place, available and properly resourced.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive issued detailed guidance to NHS boards on 1 November 2005 regarding the implementation of tariffs to 2005-06 cross boundary flows between NHS boards, i.e. activity carried out by host NHS boards on behalf of patients who reside in other NHS boards areas in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The guidance explains that tariffs will be phased in from the current financial year, 2005-06, to a selection of specific procedures (cardiac surgery and orthopaedics). The range of procedures to which the tariff will apply will be increased progressively over the next two financial years until it covers all tariff-based cross boundary flows. The introduction of tariffs will create an incentive for efficiency by encouraging benchmarking between boards and improve the accuracy of financial data by ensuring better recording of both costing and activity data.</p>

  <p>NHS boards have been asked to agree financial flows for tariff based activity using the national tariff by the end of November 2005. Further guidance will be issued to NHS boards by the end of December regarding the increased application of tariffs for 2006-07.</p>

  <p>A Tariff Reference Group with representation from NHS boards, the Health Department, and the Information Services Division (ISD) of NHS National Services Scotland, has been set up to assist with developing the tariff and will continue to monitor progress on implementation and explore options for the further development of the tariff.</p>

  <p>The previous employer of any individual recruited into NHSScotland is not information that is held centrally.</p>

  <p>The only information held relates to medical staff recruited into NHSScotland detailing if their qualification was obtained outwith the European Economic Area (EEA) and this was broken down each year since 1999. This information has already been provided in the answer to question S2W-19952 on 2 November 2005.</p>

  <p>Most recent figures held by the Royal College of Nursing to September 2004 identified that almost 1,000 whole-time equivalent internationally qualified nurses from outwith the EEA were employed in Scotland&rsquo;s health care system. This represents 2% of the national nursing workforce, 80% of whom are employed in the independent sector.</p>

  <p>Information on the country of origin of health care professionals is not held centrally although data on country of qualification for medical and dental staff was already provided per year from 1999 in S2W-19952 answered on 2 November 2005.

  <p>As part of the initial scoping exercise for monitoring compliance of the Code of Practice for international recruitment of health care professionals, data will be requested from NHSScotland boards on a quarterly basis commencing in December 2005 and will include recruitment of temporary professional health care workers from overseas.</p>

  <p>It is most likely that health care professionals from developing countries working in NHSScotland will have applied for positions personally and should be considered for employment if they are suitably qualified. It should also be noted that such individuals are at liberty to improve their position in society.</p>

  <p>Over the years, a number of programmes have been run locally by NHS health boards to provide internationally qualified nurses (IQN&rsquo;s) with &quot;supervised practice&quot; programmes. This is the term used by the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) as the recommended period required for an IQN to train to be &quot;fit for practice&quot;.</p>

  <p>The NMC have tightened standards for IQN&rsquo;s across the health care sector to ensure that they are consistent, transparent and equitable. The new standards which came into force on 1 September 2005 are now known as the Overseas Nurses Programme (ONP) and will consist of a minimum of 20 days protected teaching time. Higher education institutions (HEI&rsquo;s) will hold overall responsibility for these programmes. It will be compulsory for all international applicants and its core elements must be completed successfully before applicants will be registered with the NMC.</p>

  <p>Current timing is advantageous in setting up a structure for a national model and an expert working group was set up to review this. Recommendations from the IQN Working Group are currently being drafted for ministerial approval, outlining a national ONP model and infrastructure and support to match locally domiciled IQN&rsquo;s to vacancy posts.</p>

  <p>Partnership representation on this group included the independent sector and HEI&rsquo;s who engage across the health care sector.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive why the Dalkeith northern bypass is now regarded as urgent and what evidence the Executive has that the current estimate of &pound;40 million represents best value for taxpayers in terms of transport options for the area, given that the multi-modal appraisal promised by it following the strategic roads review in 1999 has never been carried out.</p>

  <p>The Strategic Roads Review decision intended that a number of schemes, including the A68 Dalkeith Bypass, should be brought forward after the schemes approved for construction had been completed. That stage has now been reached.</p>

  <p>The Dalkeith bypass is being taken forward as part of a range of measures to improve accessibility to the Borders, including the promotion of a new rail link. The economic benefits of the bypass have been reassessed and continue to indicate a positive return on proposed investment.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what steps are being taken, and what further steps will be taken, to ensure that contractors co-ordinate the timing of road works in areas of close proximity with a view to minimising the impact on local commuters.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-11-10.90.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80109" speakername="Tavish Scott" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa1110.htm#37">

  <p>Utility companies employing contractors to carry out work on their behalf have a duty to give advance notice of non-emergency works to the roads authority. The roads authority then has a duty to ensure that works are co-ordinated. Roads authorities have powers to give directions as to the timing of such works.</p>

  <p>The Transport (Scotland) Act 2005 will improve co-ordination through the statutory provision of notices for all proposed works. Both roads authorities and utility companies will be required to place notices on the Scottish Road Works Register. Increased powers of direction for roads authorities as to the timing of works, placing of apparatus and restrictions following substantial road works will also help minimise the impact on commuters.</p>

  <p>The global tourism market is rapidly increasing its propensity to use the internet to make holiday bookings online and often at the last minute. visitscotland.com is designed to attract an increasing share of these bookings, with over &pound;40 million worth of business generated, much of it for small hotels and B&amp;Bs, since its inception.</p>

  <p>Visitscotland.com is the trading name of e-tourism Ltd, a joint venture with the private sector in which VisitScotland has a 25% stake. It is an increasingly effective shop window for Scotland, promoting a wide variety of Scottish tourism products and events to the global market. The visitscotland.com business plan always anticipated that it would run at a loss for the first few years, as is the case for many new businesses, especially new dotcom ventures. The management of visitscotland.com remain confident that it is on track to break even in the next two years and achieve profitability thereafter.</p>
