  <p>The Deer Commission for Scotland, which is funded by the Scottish Executive, has undertaken research into issues relating to wild deer welfare and public safety, which included deer related road accidents in Scotland. A summary of the research was published in the <em>Deer Commission for Scotland: Annual Report for 1999-2000</em> , a copy of which is available in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 9425). The commission is currently undertaking research on the threat that deer pose to public safety on certain identified stretches of road. The commission is also considering further research on the effectiveness of measures to reduce the risks, with the aim of identifying appropriate initiatives to address issues relating to public safety and deer welfare.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is participating in research along with the UK Government into the level of deer-related road accidents and the development of a database of such accidents.</p>

  <p>It is key to the success of our further education colleges that they are governed and managed to the highest standards in order to ensure the quality of service delivered to students and communities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Further Education Funding Council is responsible for funding Scotland&#146;s colleges and for securing the adequate and efficient provision of further education (FE). As part of that responsibility, the funding council works closely with Scotland&#146;s colleges in encouraging high standards across all aspects of college activity, including in their management. I look to the funding council to continue to support improvements in the operation of our FE colleges.</p>

  <p>In terms of direct activity by the Scottish Executive, we last year provided additional funding for the creation of a FE development directorate in the funding council. The directorate has been given the task of improving governance and management in a wide range of issues by drawing on existing expertise within the sector. We will continue to look at ways to build on such initiatives and to support further steps to improve quality within FE colleges.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not maintain central records concerning industrial relations within individual further education colleges. Industrial relations are primarily a matter for college boards of management and representatives of the staff.</p>

  <p>I recognise that, in a sector employing over 22,000 staff, it is possible that disputes will occur from time to time. I do not take the view, however, that the overall industrial relations record of the further education sector varies significantly from other parts of the public sector. I expect management and unions throughout further education to foster a strong mutual commitment to promote good relations.</p>

  <p>The outcome of the ministerial review of governance and accountability in the further education sector was announced on 28 March. While the review did not propose any substantial change to industrial relations arrangements, I do expect all further education colleges to promote good industrial relations with their staff to ensure the continuing efficient and effective delivery of further education to students.</p>

  <p>As part of the package of measures which will be taken forward as a result of the review, we have given a commitment to consider the case for further changes in two years&#146; time. Any future need to address industrial relations issues will be addressed as part of that consideration.</p>

  <p>The Executive's vision for maternity services, set out in the report of the Expert Group on Acute Maternity Services, is of a woman and baby centred service, with a range of provision for care in childbirth including midwife-led care in local community maternity units and consultant-led units. The EGAMS report recommended that consultant-led units dealing with low- to medium-risk pregnancies and labour should have onsite paediatric facilities. It further recommended that tertiary referral centres dealing with more than 3,000 deliveries per annum should have access to onsite neonatal intensive care and access to neonatal surgery, and onsite adult intensive care facilities to ensure effective management of risk for both mother and baby.</p>

The use of such a Code of Conduct is designed to ensure high standards of integrity in the voluntary housing movement. The need to maintain confidentiality also has to be balanced with operating in an open and accountable manner and an RSL should ensure that information is publicly available unless it is personally confidential or commercially sensitive.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how it plans to help people from deprived urban areas exercise their statutory rights of access to mountains under the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003.</p>

  <p>Part 1 of the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 establishes rights of responsible access for everyone to land and inland water in Scotland. The act also places a duty on local authorities and National Park authorities to draw up plans for systems of core paths sufficient for giving the public reasonable access throughout their areas. It is expected that most people will choose to exercise their access rights mainly in the countryside around where they live. However, core paths will link up where appropriate with upland paths to improve access to mountain areas.</p>

  <p>We intend to issue guidance to authorities on the drawing up of core paths plans. As required by the act, a draft of this guidance will be laid before Parliament, probably early next year.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what arrangements each NHS trust has in place to receive and assist an unaccompanied disabled person on their arrival at a hospital, whether as an in-patient, out-patient or visitor, who has been dropped off at the hospital entrance and what guidance it has issued to trusts on this matter.</p>

  <p>While this is a matter for NHS Holding Bodies (NHS trusts or NHS boards) with no information of the nature requested held centrally, compliance with the Disability Discrimination Act is an issue which the Scottish Executive takes very seriously.</p>

  <p>We have issued NHS MEL (1999)67 which recommended that NHS bodies draw up programmes to ensure compliance within the timescale given in the act for implementation. To assist NHS bodies to meet with this timescale the Scottish Executive has provided a training video, good practice guidance, information on some of the key barriers to implementation of section 21 and an Access Audit Toolkit and Checklist.</p>

  <p>The Good Practice Guidance issued to NHSScotland in 1999 gave advice on procedures to be followed. The advice included a recommendation that hospitals should be made aware of the needs of disabled persons (when a disabled person is being referred to a hospital from another service and with that person&#146;s permission) and be prepared to respond appropriately.</p>

  <p>The Director of HM Prison Kilmarnock has told us that, following a comprehensive review of their suicide prevention strategy, apart from minor changes to some documentation the policy should remain unchanged.</p>

  <p>As ministers we want to be able to appoint more people to the boards of non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs) from population groups that are currently under-represented, including people under 35. That is why I welcome the recent appointment of the youngest ever member of an NDPB, Ceit-Anna Macleod, a 19-year-old student, to the board of the B&ograve;rd Gaidhlig na h-Alba.</p>

  <p>We are doing a great deal to try to attract more young people like her to apply. We have for example worked with organisations like Youthlink Scotland and the Scottish Youth Parliament on research programmes and a board member shadowing scheme.</p>

  <p>We have also legislated to give the new Public Appointments Commissioner for Scotland (PACS), who will be appointed by the Parliament later this year, a specific responsibility to promote diversity on our NDPBs. We look forward to working with the PACS as he or she draws up a diversity strategy for public appointments and reviews targets for under-represented groups. A key task will be to build on our work to date in raising awareness of the opportunities on NDPBs among younger people.</p>

  <p>Clause 59 of the Scottish Schools Standard Contract is designed to ensure the co-operation of any contractor in supplying the information that a public authority may require in order to respond to a request made to them under the Freedom of Information legislation.</p>

  <p>The absolute exemption in section 36(2) of the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act will only apply in circumstances where the disclosure of information by a public authority could constitute an actionable breach of confidence by a third party. In that event, authorities should discuss with the third party whether the information still needs to be classified as such. If these particular circumstances did not apply the public authority could not properly withhold information under that exemption.</p>

  <p>Any decision by a Scottish public authority to use this exemption would of course be subject to the appeal procedures set out in the act including a review by the Scottish Information Commissioner.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no specific schemes to encourage young people to gain employment in public transport. However, we welcome such initiatives on the part of transport operators and are aware of a small-scale initiative along these lines in Glasgow involving First Group, which stemmed from the Scottish Welfare to Work Advisory Task Force. The Scottish Executive has no plans to provide financial assistance to public transport operators to fund insurance cover for young drivers under the age of 21.</p>

  <p>As the partnership agreement, <em>A Partnership for a Better Scotland</em> , makes clear, we are determined to act against crime and vandalism. The travelling public and those who provide public transport services have the right to go about their business in safety, without fear of violence or injury.</p>

  <p>The police have a duty &quot;to guard patrol and watch so as to prevent the commission of offences, to preserve order and to protect life and property&quot;. Regular discussions take place between the Executive and the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland which cover a wide range of issues, including crime and vandalism.</p>

  <p>However, it is for each Chief Constable to determine how he uses the resources at his disposal to police his area. As regards public transport, I understand that Lothian and Borders Police, for example, plan to appoint a dedicated Public Transport Liaison Officer whose role will be to liaise with transport providers in promoting the implementation of specific schemes and projects aimed at enhancing safety on public transport.</p>

  <p>The regulation and safety of medicines is reserved and is the responsibility of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).</p>

  <p>The MHRA has advised that to date a number of UK licensed vaccines have had levels of thiomersal reduced or removed completely from the manufacture of the component antigens or from the final vaccine. While there is no set timescale for removal of thiomersal from vaccines, these developments are regularly reviewed and, on 1 April 2003, the MHRA wrote to UK vaccine marketing authorisation holders asking for an update on progress in reducing or removing thiomersal from vaccines.</p>
