  <p>The road lighting on Kincardine Bridge is at the end of its useful life, much of it dating back to 1936 when it was first installed. AMEY Highways Ltd has experienced intermittent problems with the road lighting since they took over responsibility for maintenance of the bridge. On 11 May 2001, the system failed completely and an investigation attributed the problem to the outdated electrical equipment. Following repairs the lighting was restored on 28 July 2001. However, as a result of a fire on the timber jetty, the lighting was switched off on 3 August 2001 as a safety precaution at the request of the Fire Brigade. After further inspection and testing the lighting was restored on 5 September 2001.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how regularly and by whom locking bolts/pins and expansion joints were checked for the local authority responsible for maintenance on the Kincardine Bridge prior to the contract being awarded to AMEY Highways Ltd and how regularly and by whom these points have been checked since.</p>

  <p>Prior to April 2001, when responsibility for maintenance of the Kincardine Bridge passed to AMEY Highways Ltd as part of the trunk road maintenance contracts, this responsibility lay with Falkirk Council on behalf of the Forth Local Authority Consortium. As part of his duties in connection with the Kincardine Bridge, adjacent depot and the emergency bridging stock depot at Bandeath, a Falkirk Council employee walked across the bridge each working day to check for obvious defects. This superficial inspection included the expansion joints. The moving components of the bridge&#8217;s opening mechanism have been immobilised and unable to move since 1988. There is therefore no need to inspect them outwith the formal inspection cycle by specialist bridge staff. The frequency of checking for the locking bolts by Falkirk Council is unknown.</p>

  <p>AMEY Highways Ltd carry out weekly routine inspections for the carriageway, including the expansion joints, as part of their contractual duties. This frequency is considered adequate for this type of bridge component. The locking bolts will be inspected as part of the formal inspection regime for the structure.</p>

  <p>I welcome the Care Development Group&#8217;s report which is available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre. I congratulate the members of the group for the excellent work they have done. They have come forward with a series of sound recommendations for the sustainable implementation of free nursing and personal care for all older people.</p>

  <p>The investment of &#163;125 million we have already pledged enables us fulfil our commitment to implement free personal care beginning in April 2002.</p>

  <p>The group supports the principle of free personal care, welcomes the financial provision we have made and makes specific recommendations on the definition of personal care and on how assessing people&#8217;s need for care must be built into the system for delivering personal and nursing care.</p>

  <p>They have recommended a definition of personal care which is in line with that taken by the Royal Commission.</p>

  <p>In defining personal care, the group has endorsed the need for people to continue to pay their own living and accommodation costs.</p>

  <p>They have recommended the removal of all charges for personal care in community</p>

  <p>For those in care homes currently meeting their own costs, the group has recommended that they should receive a payment of &#163;90 per week for personal care and a further &#163;65 per week if they need nursing care.</p>

  <p>We welcome all of these recommendations and believe they provide a fair and workable approach.</p>

  <p>The group also recommended further investment in improvements to services in the community to address the gaps and deficiencies that currently exist and to meet future demand for services from an increasingly older population.</p>

  <p>There is now a great deal of work for local authorities and others to do so that older people can benefit from the unprecedented investment we are making. I therefore intend to establish an Implementation Steering Group to begin work immediately with local authorities, the NHS and the independent sector to develop common arrangements that will enable free personal and nursing care to be delivered as an integral part of the care services older people need.</p>

  <p>I announced in Parliament on 25 April that the Executive would set aside up to &#163;10 million to fund measures which may be required by the closure of Motorola&#8217;s Bathgate plant.</p>

  <p>To date, funding has been called on to deliver the activities detailed in the Motorola Task Force&#8217;s Action Plan. The Action Plan, submitted by Scottish Enterprise Edinburgh and Lothian, was drawn up by local agencies to deliver an appropriate and comprehensive package of support.</p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise Edinburgh and Lothian has produced a monitoring report for the period 1 April - 31 July, which shows total costs to date of &#163;1.4 million (&#163;0.4 million actual; &#163;0.6 million committed; &#163;0.4 million absorbed). These figures cover the first four months following the announcement, during which time a significant portion of the workforce remained on-site.</p>

  <p>We will continue to provide additional resources to fund a range of training and supports over and above those provided by local agencies through their existing budgets. Over 800 people have secured alternative employment and 1,600 people are currently being supported through task force training.</p>

  <p>There are around 700 workers still to leave Motorola whose training and support needs are currently being addressed. This may result in further calls on funding which will be considered as they arise.</p>

  <p>The Environment Act 1995 requires local authorities to carry out a review and assessment of air quality within their areas and take action where air quality objectives are unlikely to be met within a set timescale. These requirements are set out in more detail in <i>The Air Quality Strategy for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. </i> In such cases the authority must declare an Air Quality Management Area (AQMA) and draw up an action plan that sets out the steps it intends to take in pursuit of the objectives. The objective for NO <sub>2</sub> is an annual mean of 40&#61549;g/m <sup>3</sup> to be achieved by the end of 2005. To date two AQMAs have been declared in Scotland (Aberdeen and Edinburgh) with Glasgow expected to follow shortly. All three are based on traffic-related NO <sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>

  <p>The only data held centrally on missed appointments is the number of first consultant out-patient appointments not attended.

  <p>Note: 2001 data is provisional.</p>

  <p>The average cost of a consultant out-patient appointment is &#163;72, which would imply that the total cost to the NHS of these missed appointments could be as high as &#163;8.6 million a year. In practice, the cost is likely to be less than this because clinics may schedule additional appointments to allow for failure to attend by a proportion of patients.</p>

  <p>The Scottish birth rate has been declining since 1960. This general trend is in line with the pattern in most other advanced industrial countries, although the birth rate in Scotland has declined more significantly than the rate for the UK as a whole. Actuarial predictions suggest that the Scottish birth rate will remain fairly constant over the next 20 years. As with any demographic trend, there will be a range of implications from the fall in the Scottish birth rate.</p>

  <p>The birth rate in Scotland has been declining for a number of years, from 19.2 per 1,000 in 1960 to 10.4 per 1,000 in 2000 (figures from GRO Scotland), although it is predicted that the rate will remain fairly constant up to 2021. The birth rate has fallen over the same period across almost every advanced industrialised country as people exercise their private and personal choices over family sizes. The Scottish Executive does not consider it feasible or desirable to attempt to influence this trend.</p>

  <p>Spending Review 2000 provided an additional &#163;500 million to the overall transport programme. The reference to public transport in the Press Release of 18 June was incorrect.</p>
