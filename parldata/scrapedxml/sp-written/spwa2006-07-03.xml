  <p>Agricultural output and food costs are affected by many factors and it is difficult to be precise about the impact of increased oil prices. Between 2004 and 2005, the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil increased by 42%. In 2005, fuel and oil costs borne by the agricultural industry accounted for &pound;61.3 million (or 14% of the Total Income from Farming), compared with &pound;49.8 million in 2004 &ndash; an increase of 23%. Over the same period the cost of fertilisers and chemicals used by the agricultural industry rose by 1% (&pound;177.5 million to &pound;179.3 million).</p>

  <p>The figures on persistent youth offending in Scotland were first collated for 2003-04. The statement I made to Parliament on 4 November 2004 made it clear that the 2003-04 youth justice report represented the agreed baseline. Data gathered in previous years cannot be directly compared.</p>

  <p>The 2003-04 report (Bib. number 34397) and 2004-05 report (Bib. number 37302) are available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre, and include data for every local authority area.</p>

  <p>The distribution of Scottish Executive funding for the Councils of Voluntary Service (CVS) in Scotland is determined by a formula introduced in 2001 after consultation with the network and the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations (SCVO). It provides:</p>

  <p>Each local authority area with between &pound;60,000 and &pound;75,000 per annum;</p>

  <p>Where there is more than one CVS in a local authority area they each receive a share of the funding allocation for their area, and</p>

  <p>A greater share for the Highland area, around &pound;330,000 per annum, in recognition of its rurality and population sparsity and the consequently high number of CVS it requires to support.</p>

  <p>In addition, SCVO is provided with &pound;200,000 per annum to fulfil its role in the development of co-ordination of the network. This award was determined on the basis of a full business case.</p>

  <p>The total level of Scottish Executive funding amounts to just over &pound;3 million, the full amount sought by the network when it submitted its business plan in 2005. This sum represents an increase of more than 30% since the formula was last revised in 2001.</p>

  <p>The police, local authorities, and the Children&rsquo;s Hearings system have all made clear national commitments to deliver improvements for communities &ndash; and for young people themselves.

  <p>All agencies who work with children have a responsibility to contribute to the prevention and reduction of youth offending.</p>

  <p>Key national partner agencies have made clear public commitments about their determination to make the necessary improvements.</p>

  <p>All local authority areas have local youth justice strategic groups who are responsible for identifying the nature and extent of youth crime in their area through youth crime audits, and for matching the range of local service provision to the evidence about service requirements.</p>

  <p>Within that local structure, partner agencies will have their own responsibilities for delivering improvements.</p>
