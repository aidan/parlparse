  <p>The draft budget, including the &pound;5 million for Carer Information Strategies (CIS), has to be approved by the Scottish Parliament.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many hectares of woodland area have been cleared in the last two years as a result of (a) wind farm developments and (b) bog restorations and how this compares with the number of hectares planted in the same period.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-12-07.S3W-37851.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80301" speakername="Roseanna Cunningham" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa1207.htm#4">

  <p>A breakdown of these figures is not readily available at present.</p>

  <p>Following discussions with the forestry sector this autumn, Forestry Commission Scotland will be piloting the collection of woodland removal data in the period 2000-10 within one of its five conservancies. The focus will be on wind farms and bog restoration, as these are known to be the primary causes of woodland removal this decade.</p>

  <p>The pilot exercise will also assess broader trends in woodland removal by analysing forest plans approved in the period 2000-10, calculating areas to be felled and areas to be restocked in each plan period.</p>

  <p>Providing the pilot can demonstrate that such information collection would not be disproportionately expensive in terms of cost or time, the methodology will then be rolled out to the remaining four conservancies in Scotland. It is anticipated that data from this project will be available by summer 2011.</p>

  <p>The Native Woodland Survey of Scotland is determining the precise area and status of native woodlands in Scotland for the first time, and will provide an accurate baseline for future monitoring. It does not include other types of woodlands, so cannot be used to determine overall woodland area. The total woodland area of Scotland is being assessed as part of the GB-wide National Forest Inventory, and we expect results to be published in spring 2011. These will show changes in woodland area compared to previous inventory information.</p>

  <p>I have asked John Ewing, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service, to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>All prisoners are given the opportunity to prepare for release. Prisoners serving long-term sentences are subject to an intensive case management process that includes ongoing assessment of their individual risk and needs. This assessment informs the preparation of a Community Integration Plan that focuses on assisting prisoners reintegrate back into their communities. This flexible plan covers such areas as accommodation, family contact and employment.</p>

  <p>In addition, all long-term prisoners are, on release, subject to robust licence conditions for the duration of their sentence. A serious breach of any condition can result in recall to custody.</p>

  <p>Average daily population for Castle Huntly and Noranside in 2007 is based on data from 1 January 2007 to 22 April 2007.</p>

  <p>Average daily population for HMP Open Estate in 2007 is based on data from 23 April 2007 to 31 December 2007.</p>

  <p>I have asked John Ewing, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS), to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>I have advised the Governor of HMP Open Estate and SPS Trade Union officials that the capacity within the Open Estate would need to be reviewed in light of the outcome of the Spending Review.</p>

  <p>I expect to meet with the Governor and Trade Union officials to discuss this matter further.</p>

  <p>I have asked John Ewing, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service, to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>There is no fixed minimum number of hours that a prisoner has to work.</p>

  <p>Work allocation is dependent upon capacity and work availability in each prison. Typically work sessions range from two and a half to three hours respectively in the morning and afternoon.</p>

  <p>Prisoners will work on average nine sessions per week. Some sessions may not be attended due to a prisoner being at education classes, participating in an offending behaviour programme or health centre or community agency appointments. The minimum time prisoners may work therefore ranges between 18 to 25 hours per week and will depend further upon attendance at any such appointments and Physical Training (PT).</p>

  <p>I have asked John Ewing, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS), to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>This information is not held in the format that has been requested. Typically, those prisoners employed in work parties will complete nine sessions of work per week ranging from two hours to three hours per session resulting in a range of hours worked from 18 hours to 25 hours per week per prisoner. Work party allocation will typically consist of a mixture of short-term and long-term prisoners.</p>
