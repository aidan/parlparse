  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to working with other funders to promote a stable funding environment for the voluntary sector including alcohol misuse projects. The Executive published Good Practice Guidance on funding of voluntary organisations to its departments, agencies and NDPB&#8217;s on 13 June. The Executive actively supports three-year funding for voluntary organisations.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to the long-term aim set in 1994 of 50% of women breastfeeding their babies at six weeks, by 2005.</p>

  <p>No breastfeeding target has been set for 2000. However, information on previous years&#8217; breastfeeding rates in Scotland is available on the Internet within the dedicated website &quot;Breastfeeding in Scotland&quot;, which includes information on research, statistics, good practice and other resources and can be accessed at http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/breastfeed/.</p>

  <p>The Health Education Board for Scotland (HEBS) was actively involved in promoting Breastfeeding Awareness Week, which ran from 14-20 May 2000. For this financial year HEBS has allocated &pound;30,000 to produce materials for Breastfeeding Awareness Week and also to develop a new five-year strategy for breastfeeding.</p>

  <p>Success can only be measured when breastfeeding rates increase both at birth and at six weeks or longer. Breastfeeding rates have been improving in Scotland over the past decade or so, but there is still a long way to go if we are to achieve our target of having 50% of women breastfeeding their babies at six weeks, by 2005. To help in achieving this target, the Scottish Executive supports and funds the Scottish Breastfeeding Group and the National Breastfeeding Adviser.</p>

  <p>While a crofting community background would obviously be desirable, it is more important that the successful candidate is selected on the basis of strong organisational, leadership and management skills to ensure he or she is able to lead the commission through a period of structural and organisational change.

  <p>The UK Government announced on 20 April proposals to set, from 1 August 2000, maximum prices for generic drugs. The consultation period ended on 24 May and there has subsequently been a further, limited consultation with the industry on revised maximum prices. My officials are in discussion with the Scottish Pharmaceutical General Council (SPGC) about the changes needed to the reimbursement arrangements for community pharmacists to ensure that the benefits of the proposed price cuts reach the NHSiS and patients. The overall prices of generic drugs have shown a consistent but modest rate of decline over recent months.</p>

  <p>Provision for prescribing is included as part of the overall resources within health boards&#8217; unified budgets. It is for health boards to decide locally how to allocate and manage their unified budget.

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to give precise figures on deaths resulting from tobacco use. However, it is estimated that each year more than 13,000 people in Scotland die from smoking-related diseases, including lung cancer, coronary heart disease and stroke (figures taken from <i>The UK Smoking Epidemic; deaths in 1995</i>).</p>

  <p>From estimates made for the United Kingdom as a whole by the Independent Expert Committee on Medical Effects of Air Pollutants, it is estimated that the number of deaths in Scotland brought forward by exposure to particulate, sulphur dioxide and ozone in ambient air is about 2,000 per year. This estimate is approximate because it does not take into account other pollutants or possible long-term effects on health and the figure in itself may be an underestimate.</p>

  <p>Scotland&#8217;s arrangements for clinical effectiveness are different from England and Wales. The Report of the Working Group on the Implementation of a Scottish Health Technology Assessment Centre, published on 17 November 1999, explains the reasons for establishing a special health board and how the board will work with reference to Scotland&#8217;s ongoing clinical effectiveness agenda led by the Clinical Resources and Audit Group (CRAG) and involving the Chief Scientists Office and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN).</p>

  <p>SIGN is an independent network of clinicians drawn from all Scottish medical colleges with financial support from CRAG. SIGN has produced over 40 guidelines since its establishment in 1993. SIGN enjoys an international reputation on guidance methodology and the new Health Technology Board will benefit from a close working and sharing of methodological expertise with SIGN.</p>

  <p>Reducing the number of delayed discharges is a high priority for the Scottish Executive. &pound;60 million is being made available to the NHS &#8211; on top of existing record levels of funding &#8211; to accelerate delivery of a number of priorities including a reduction in the number of delayed discharges. A learning network is also being established to encourage the sharing of best practice in this area.</p>

  <p>As regards the number of blocked beds in Angus hospitals, this is an issue for the Tayside Health Board to answer in consultation with the NHS Trusts and local authority partners. We also recently announced that an additional &pound;10 million taken from the central reserve would be used specifically to help tackle delayed discharges and thus free up &quot;blocked beds&quot; this winter.</p>

  <p>Carers who look after people with mental illness can be at a disadvantage to other carers. Mentally ill people might be more prone to confusion than other vulnerable people and this combined with possible negative reactions to prescribed drugs may lead to challenging behaviour. Problems in addition to mental illness, e.g. physical disability, can exacerbate a mentally ill person&#8217;s state of mind.</p>

  <p>Under the <i>Strategy for Carers in Scotland</i>, legislative proposals will be drawn up to effect better provision of services for all carers, including those who look after mentally ill people. <i>The Framework for Mental Health Services in Scotland</i> encourages all the care partner agencies involved in mental health to include carers and service users in the strategic planning process of the mental health services provided in their local area. The Mental Illness Specific Grant scheme provides funding via local authorities to local organisations offering services to carers of people who are mentally ill.</p>

  <p>It is not known how much public money is saved through informal caring of people with a mental illness or who are vulnerable in some other way. However, the <i>Strategy for Carers in Scotland</i> recognises that informal carers make a significant contribution to relieving pressure on public services.</p>

  <p>As the Deputy First Minister announced on 4 July, the Cabinet has guaranteed that at least &pound;34 million of the central reserve will be committed to health-related spending.

  <p>There are no formal guidelines specifically targeted at malnutrition in the community. In 1999 by the Scottish Executive Health Department set out an action plan for nursing homes to assess the nutritional status of residents and provide for their dietary needs in line with UK Department of Health Dietary Reference Values. The plan was also to be applied by health boards and Trusts in all NHS facilities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is also pursuing a range of initiatives to encourage and support people to make the lifestyle changes necessary to improve their health.</p>

  <p>Under <i>The Framework for Mental Health Services in Scotland</i> , published in 1997, it is for health boards and NHS Trusts to plan and deliver an appropriate level of provision for the treatment and rehabilitation of people with psychological disorders based on assessed need. This includes psychological therapies for a wide range of emotional, psychological and psychiatric presentations, for example, as a result of trauma, assault, and childhood sexual or physical abuse. As such the information requested on support and funding is not available centrally but the Mental Health and Wellbeing Support Group, established on 31 March, will meet with all health boards and their planning partners to pursue implementation of the Framework agenda.</p>

  <p>Also, research is being undertaking in conjunction with the Edinburgh Association for Mental Health which is looking at adult survivors of child abuse and their needs. The Scottish Executive is contributing to this and will consider the results in due course.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Executive funds Victim Support Scotland to provide practical and emotional support to all victims of crime. Specially trained volunteers provide specific help to victims of rape and sexual assault, irrespective of gender.</p>

  <p>The information is not held centrally. The precise cost of smoking related disease is difficult to ascertain, since cost data collected centrally from the National Health Service in Scotland cannot be attributed to individual disease. However, a report on hospital care for smoking related diseases in Greater Glasgow Health Board in 1992 estimated the cost of treatment at &pound;14.4 million. Adjusted for inflation this equates to some &pound;18 million in today&#8217;s prices. This does not take into account costs associated with community nursing services, prescribing drugs in the community and GP services.

  <p>All doctors are aware of the importance of patients stopping smoking following myocardial infarction. Patients taking part in cardiac rehabilitation programmes are given repeated brief and supportive advice on how to stop smoking.</p>

  <p>The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) in collaboration with Scottish Heart and Arterial Disease Risk Prevention (SHARP) and Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) have developed &quot;The Heart Pack&quot; which is an implementation kit designed to help GPs implement SIGN Guidelines 40 and 41: Lipids and the prevention of Coronary Heart Disease and Secondary Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease following Myocardial Infarction. The pack has been sent to every GP practice in Scotland. I was pleased to have been asked to launch this initiative in February of this year.</p>

  <p>GPs and other primary care staff are able to refer smokers for a course of specialist counselling, advice and support.</p>

  <p>Nicotine Replacement Therapy is also routinely considered as a means of assisting smokers to stop.</p>

  <p>Research suggests that the Dutch come because of their interest in castles, monuments, galleries and the quiet unspoilt nature of the countryside. There is an increasing interest in coming to Scotland for short breaks outwith the main holiday season. Outdoor enthusiasts consider Scotland as an excellent destination for outdoor activities, in particular for walking and cycling holidays, which are growing in popularity. However, research also suggests that some Dutch people visiting Scotland see it as an expensive destination with unreliable weather.</p>
