  <p>The proposed Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care will regulate all day care for children, whoever the provider. We believe that this will provide consistency and quality of regulation not only between the private and public sectors but also across Scotland. We intend to introduce legislation to establish the Commission as soon as possible, and we issued a pre-legislative consultation document: <i>Regulating Care and the Social Service Workforce</i> on 23 December.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has not made any estimates of the impact of regulatory factors on either job loss or job creation decisions but it recognises that regulations can have implications for the competitiveness of business and the economy and is committed to minimising the burden on business. Any new Scottish legislation or regulation, and any consultation papers on regulatory proposals that have an impact on business, are required to be accompanied by a Regulatory Impact Assessment. This structured document shows the expected compliance cost to business, particularly small firms, set alongside the benefits of non-regulatory alternatives. No legislative or regulatory proposal that has an impact on business will proceed without a Regulatory Impact Assessment that clearly demonstrates the worth of the proposed regulation.</p>

  <p>Yes. The Scottish Executive will monitor the new Objective 3 Programme in a number of ways, including the geographical distribution of the grant awards and the amounts of grant awarded to individual projects.</p>

  <p>No. Local authorities are autonomous corporate bodies; and they have powers to appoint officers on such reasonable terms and conditions as they think fit and similarly to terminate contracts of employment. In doing so they are, of course, required to comply with employment law; and their accounts are subject to audit by the Accounts Commission; but they are not answerable to the Scottish Executive, except where statute specifically provides so.</p>

  <p>The report has taken longer to complete than the Scottish Tourist Board expected. They now believe that it will be available during the week beginning 20 December. As it will not now contain commercially sensitive information, I have asked the Chairman of the STB to place a copy of the full report in the Parliament&#8217;s Information Centre as soon as it becomes available.</p>

  <p>Area Tourist Boards are core funded by discretionary grant aid from the Scottish Tourist Board and from local authorities, by membership subscription and by income from commercial activities. They receive no direct funding from the Scottish Executive. <br /></p>
