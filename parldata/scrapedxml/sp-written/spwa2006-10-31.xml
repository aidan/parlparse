  <p>The re-drafted strategy document on First Responder units has been completed and is available from the Scottish Ambulance Service National Headquarters, Tipperlinn Road, Edinburgh, EH10 5UU.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service&rsquo;s policy is to set up First Responder units in areas where there is sufficient demand and appropriate volunteers. These schemes cost around &pound;6,000 per year to run.</p>

  <p>The ambulance service recognises that some local communities who are not on the ambulance service&rsquo;s priority list want to establish their own schemes. The ambulance service supports these by providing appropriate training to ensure the safe delivery of patient care.</p>

  <p>There are no advanced apprenticeships in Scotland. These are available in England and Wales with study towards an NVQ level 3 and are equivalent to a Scottish Modern Apprenticeship (MA).</p>

  <p>On successful completion of an MA in Scotland, candidates achieve S/NVQ level 3 or above. Individual MA frameworks are designed by industry and must contain five core skills as a mandatory component. These core skills are Working with Others, Information Technology, Numeracy, Communication and Problem Solving. MA frameworks may also include sector specific qualifications, where appropriate.</p>

  <p>Forestry Commission Scotland&rsquo;s (FCS) spending is subject to the same scrutiny as other departments of the Scottish Executive. All departments, through their Accountable Officers, have a duty to promote the efficient and effective use of staff and other resources in accordance with the principles of Best Value. This duty is subject to scrutiny by the Auditor General for Scotland.</p>

  <p>Every two years FCS activities are examined in detail in the spending review to ensure it is delivering value for money. Financial and other targets are set, specifically for the Forest Enterprise Scotland Agency, which manages the National Forest Estate. These are published in the <em>FCS Corporate Plan</em> and reported annually in the <em>FCS Annual Report and Accounts</em>. The <em>2005-06 Report and Accounts</em> were laid before the Scottish Parliament on 24 July 2006, reference SE/2006/122. FCS is subject to annual examination by Audit Scotland and plays an active part in the Executive&rsquo;s Efficient Government Initiative, delivering over &pound;4,000,000 of efficiency savings over the period 2004-05 to 2007-08.</p>

  <p>Before taking any action, the Procurator Fiscal must be satisfied that the circumstances reported to him or her disclose a crime known to the law of Scotland and that there is sufficient admissible and reliable evidence. The Procurator Fiscal cannot raise proceedings if there is insufficient evidence.</p>

Assessment of the public interest will include consideration of such matters as the seriousness of the offence, the lapse of time since its commission, the interests of the victim and other witnesses, factors relating to the accused and any relevant local community issues.

  <p>Often acts will require to be commenced in stages (for particular provisions or particular purposes) for policy or practical reasons. Decisions about such matters are the responsibility of the minister in charge of the act and so the information requested is not held centrally. Acts of the Scottish Parliament and Scottish Statutory Instruments, including Commencement Orders, are published on the HMSO website. <em>Is it in Force? 2006</em> , which is published by LexisNexis, Butterworths, provides details of provisions in acts of the Scottish Parliament which have been brought into force. If the member would like information about any specific act or any specific provision or provisions in an act, the relevant portfolio minister will be happy to provide that information.</p>

  <p>While recruitment of police officers is an operational requirement for chief constables, the most recent Spending Review in 2004 provided for sufficient resources to deliver our Partnership Agreement commitment to increase the number of police officers in the current parliamentary session.</p>

  <p>Since 2003, 2,845 new police officers have been recruited in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Over the same period police officer numbers in Lothian and Borders Police have risen from 2,708 to 2,791 at 30 September 2006. In Scotland police numbers have risen from 15,385 to 16,261.</p>

  <p>Police numbers in future years are of course dependent on recruitment decisions of chief constables.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The SPS does not condone the illegal use of drugs by prisoners and is proactive both in detecting and deterring their use. Prisoners with drug problems are encouraged to come forward for proper care. Sanctions for illegal use include The Prisons &amp; Young Offender Rules (Scotland) (Rules 199 to 120) which set out a range of punishments, referral to the Police and restrictions on progression. The information on the number of cases is not available.</p>
