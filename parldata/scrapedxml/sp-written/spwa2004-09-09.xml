  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-9569 by Mr Frank McAveety on 3 August 2004, what publicity was given to the fact that the decision regarding the restoration of Castle Tioram was taken by Historic Scotland (a) at the time the decision was made and (b) subsequently.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers' decisions on Scheduled Monument Consent applications are routinely delegated to Historic Scotland, an agency directly accountable to Scottish ministers. Historic Scotland receives around 200 such applications each year. It has not been the agency&rsquo;s normal policy to publicise the outcome of consent applications either at the time of the decision or subsequently. However, copies of the decision letter are routinely sent at the time of issue to the local authority and those with a specific interest in the land affected e.g. as owner or tenant. In the case of Castle Tioram, no additional publicity was given to the decision at the time nor, for legal reasons, during the period when the applicant&rsquo;s appeal was before the Court of Session. Since then information on the decision has been provided in answers to parliamentary questions and in discussions, for example at a meeting of Highland MSPs.</p>

  <p>The Health Protection Agency, on behalf of the CJD Incidents Panel, has provided an assessment of the risk associated with each batch of plasma product; has advised which patients needed to be assessed and, where necessary, subsequently contacted, and has given advice on how the possible risks to public health should be managed.</p>

  <p>In the light of these assessments, the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health (SCIEH) are now initiating a process to notify patients of these developments. The SCIEH are sending information to clinicians to enable them to trace particular plasma products. The clinicians will then notify any patients identified as &quot;at risk&quot; as a precaution for public health purposes. Patients should expect to receive this notification within weeks.</p>

  <p>I will make a further statement at a later date, if necessary.</p>

  <p>The NHS scheme provides widowers&rsquo; benefits on the same basis as for widows in respect of service from 6 April 1988.</p>

  <p>The capitalised cost of providing widowers cover, for the period from March 1972 to April 1988, is estimated at approximately &pound;59 million. As the most recent valuation of the NHS scheme is still to be completed, this figure is based on the 1999 valuation of the NHS pension scheme in England and Wales.</p>

  <p>These costs would have to be met in full by the whole membership of the NHS scheme, and there is no indication that they would be willing to do so.</p>

  <p>All NHS boards in Scotland receive an annual uplift in their unified budget allocations which are designed to cover both local and national inflationary pressures, as well as service developments. The unified budget for each board is based on the allocation formula which aims to give each board its fair share of the resources available nationally. It is for each NHS board to manage within their resources, allocating their uplift as determined locally.</p>

  <p>There are a range of cost pressures which arise from national policies, primarily relating to pay, e.g. basic pay increase, Agenda for Change, the Consultant&rsquo;s Contract and the new General Medical Services Contract. The Executive&rsquo;s estimate of the increased cost of these policies is more than covered from the record uplift in allocations for 2003-04 and 2004-05, supplemented by additional allocations from the Executive.</p>

  <p>NHS Argyll and Clyde have identified that the annual uplift to the unified budget allocation for 2004-05 does not cover all national and local cost pressures as identified by the board. As a result, the board are planning to take a number of measures to reduce expenditure and identify savings over the course of the year.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive <a name="QuestionText">what response it will make to the submission of July 2004 by NFU Scotland (NFUS) regarding the EU Water Framework Directive; in particular, whether it will endorse the position that water abstraction controls in agriculture should only exist where a threat to ecological quality arises from a significant affect on water quantity; whether it will exclude very small water users from registration and, if so, how it will define this category; whether it will adopt the NFUS suggestion that all producers farming 50 hectares or less of enclosed land should be excluded from registration unless requiring water for irrigation or unless situated in a sensitive area; whether it will endorse the proposal that the lower boundary of registration under general binding rules be raised, subject to these provisos regarding irrigation and location, with a minimum threshold of 30 cubic metres per day consumption, and whether it will endorse the NFUS proposal that the upper boundary of registration under general binding rules be raised, subject to the proviso that those affected should not be irrigating in a sensitive area and, if so, whether it will endorse the upper threshold of 200 cubic metres per day.</a></p>

  <p>The Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) Act 2003-Controlled Activities Regulations consultation document was issued to a wide range of stakeholders and comments were invited on the issues raised. The Executive is currently in the process of analysing all responses, including that of the NFU Scotland (NFUS). In developing the final regulations, the Executive will ensure that all responses to the consultation are properly considered. It would not be appropriate to comment on any specific proposals at this stage.</p>
