  <p>On 3 August 2000, the Food Standards Agency, Scotland assumed responsibility for the algal toxin monitoring and sampling programme from the Scottish Executive. All aspects of the programme are continuously being reviewed, and consideration of a proposed new tiered approach to the sampling regime is well progressed. However, in the meantime the agency is continuing to follow existing procedures. The FSAS welcomes any suggestions that could help improve communication of information in respect of the monitoring programme, or its effectiveness.</p>

  <p>General practitioners, like other professionals, are encouraged to look at their own personal learning needs and the health needs of their patients and to seek training in specific areas. Guidance and assistance is available from the Scottish Council for Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education (SCPMDE) via the Postgraduate Directors of General Practice Education. Each GP also receives an annual Postgraduate Education Allowance to support an agreed amount of training.

  <p>Information is not held centrally in the format requested.</p>

  <p>Various methods are available for estimating survival and each has a different interpretation. Relative survival rates are essentially estimates of the net survival of a group of cancer patients in comparison with the overall survival of the general population and do not, as such, strictly indicate the actual percentage of patients alive at a given time after diagnosis.</p>

  <p>The table below shows age standardised relative survival rates (%) one year after diagnosis for women aged 15 to 99 diagnosed in each of 1993, 1994 and 1995, the most recent years for which these data are available. <i>Trends in Cancer Survival in Scotland 1971 to 1995, </i>published in 1999, provides full information on survival from all cancers and can be accessed at www.show.scot.nhs.uk/isd.</p>

  <p>The content of university medical courses is not a matter for the Scottish Executive to determine. The General Medical Council has a UK-wide responsibility for determining the extent of the knowledge and skill required for the granting of primary medical qualifications. The route to reaching these standards is a matter for each individual medical school.</p>

  <p>The content of specialist training for doctors is a matter for the Specialist Training Authority in the case of hospital doctors. The content of vocational training is a matter for the Joint Committee On Postgraduate Training For General Practice (JCPTGP) in the case of General Practitioners. The Scottish Executive would expect that, following completion of their training, doctors, as professionals, would keep their skills up to date in the areas which are relevant to their sphere of practice.</p>

  <p>Training for nursing staff in dealing with childhood sexual abuse is embedded within the curriculum for certain qualifications such as paediatric nursing, forensic nursing, health visiting and midwifery. Dealing with the survivors of childhood abuse is a highly specialised aspect of childhood sexual abuse and training is the responsibility of individual practitioners in this field and their employers who are required to assess and meet the training needs of the multidisciplinary team.</p>

  <p>Scientific studies of aquatic organisms in ships&#8217; ballast tanks indicate that a range of species can be transported in this way but transport is only the first of many stages to the process by which a species can become established in a new area. Very many organisms transported in ballast tanks do not survive the voyage. Of those that do, they must also survive being pumped out of the tanks, must be tolerant to the physical, chemical and biological conditions in the new area, and must also find food, habitat and in many cases, other individuals of the same species with which to reproduce. There is no scientific evidence that ballast water discharges in Scottish waters have had any harmful impacts on shellfish or marine life.</p>

  <p>From 1 January 1999, all British registered fishing vessels over 10 metres catching more than two tonnes of quota stocks have had to demonstrate an economic link with fisheries dependent communities in the United Kingdom. This link can be demonstrated in a number of ways, for example, by vessels landing at least 50% by weight of their quota catch into the UK or by employing a crew of whom at least 50% are normally resident in a UK coastal area.</p>

  <p>In the first year of operation over 1,750 vessels in the over 10 metre fleet caught more than two tonnes of quota stocks and in almost every case achieved a satisfactory economic link, primarily through landings into the UK. Where a small number have failed to make the full link in 1999, they will be expected to make this up in 2000 and future years. The new arrangements have resulted in a significant increase both in the volume of landings made by foreign-owned UK flagged vessels and in local expenditure on goods and services in the UK. They have also led to over 300 tonnes of additional quota being made available to fishermen in the under 10 metre fleet and non-sector.</p>

  <p>A full report by the Fisheries Departments in the United Kingdom on the operation of the economic link measures and their impact in 1999 has been placed in SPICe.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether, given the current unavailability of beds due to &quot;bed blocking&quot;, reducing the total number of NHS beds in the longer term can be justified, in particular with respect to the intended reduction in bed numbers from 1,029 to 894 on transferring services to the new Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.</p>

  <p>The NHS in Scotland keeps the number and mix of hospital beds under review to ensure that appropriate health services can be delivered to the people of Scotland in the light of changing patterns of treatment and care.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive believes that the problem of delayed discharges should be tackled systematically by the NHS and local authorities working together, and has allocated an additional &pound;10 million of recurring funding to local authorities for that purpose. This sum is over and above the &pound;60 million recurring funding, allocated to health boards in June to enable them to accelerate the delivery of national and local priorities, of which a total of &pound;9 million is being used by boards and Trusts specifically to tackle delayed discharges.</p>

  <p>The planned bed numbers for the new Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh are based on target levels of performance, determined by clinicians, and agreed between the health board and Lothian University Hospitals NHS Trust. The health board recognises that plans must be flexible, and that if experience indicates that the proposed balance between hospital and community services requires to be adjusted, then that will be done.</p>

  <p>We are presently finalising arrangements for a short TV filler advertisement which we hope will catch the attention and interest of TV viewers in Scotland, help raise the profile of this important issue and encourage people to think seriously and talk openly about the possibility of allowing their organs to be used to help others after they die.</p>

  <p>I know that in the Scottish Parliament there is a great awareness and interest, across all parties, in the promotion of organ donation. It would be invaluable, therefore, if the Scottish members could lead by example and join together to help publicise this issue in Scotland. I shall be writing out to all members soon inviting their participation in promoting organ donor awareness.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is keen to encourage and support, where possible, initiatives to promote organ donation. We have supported various promotional activities in the past and are always open to considering new and innovative proposals. We are also, as a matter of course, involved in the ongoing provision of supplies of organ donor leaflets and information in support of individual independent initiatives.</p>

  <p>We recognise the importance of purchasers having good information at a reasonable cost.</p>

  <p>Since then we have been monitoring the progress of the two market-led pilots in Scotland and have had a number of discussions with interested parties on how best sellers&#8217; surveys might be taken forward in Scotland. In particular, we are liaising with the Scottish Consumer Council which has recently published a report, <i>Home Truths,</i> which recommended the development of voluntary &quot;independent&quot; survey schemes, backed by a guarantee for the buyer.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Common Repair Working Group, chaired by my Department with representatives from a number of interested parties, has commissioned the preparation of two leaflets for owners and prospective owners explaining their responsibilities in respect of the repair and maintenance of communally owned property.

  <p>In June, the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) completed a safety review into reports of suspected adverse reactions to Men C vaccines. It concluded that most of the reported suspected adverse reactions are non-serious, that the vaccine appears to be safe and highly protective and that the balance of risk and benefit is overwhelmingly favourable.</p>

  <p>The CSM recommended that a number of suspected adverse reactions for older children, including seizures and anaphylactoid reactions, should be added to product information despite the fact that a causal association between seizures and meningococcal C vaccination has not been established, and that reactions were very rare (no reaction was reported at a frequency greater than 1 in 10,000 distributed doses and reported seizures were approximately 1 in 100,000 distributed doses). The addition of seizures to the product information is to ensure that health professionals, patients and parents are fully informed.</p>

  <p>On 4 August, the Chief Medical Officer sent the conclusions of this review to GPs via Directors of Public Health, asking them to bring it to the attention of practice nurses and health visitors to assist them in answering questions about the vaccines.</p>

  <p>The information leaflets for students and for children and parents have also been revised to reflect this additional information.</p>

  <p>The Health Technology Board for Scotland (HTBS) have agreed to my request that they provide advice on the clinical and cost effectiveness of the use of Beta Interferon and Copaxone in the treatment of multiple sclerosis.</p>

  <p>As the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) was carrying out a similar assessment for England and Wales, the board had hoped to obtain access to the evidence submitted to NICE but that has not proved possible.</p>

  <p>As the NICE process is ongoing, it is not possible to say with precision when the Health Technology Board&#8217;s advice will be available. However, to minimise delay, the board have established a group comprising experts in relevant specialties and people who suffer from multiple sclerosis. This group has met to prepare the ground and be ready to start the assessment as soon as the evidence is forthcoming. The HTBS process will include consultation and clarification phases to ensure a robust and inclusive evaluation of the evidence in relation to Scotland.</p>

  <p>At present, the Scottish Executive is largely a response mode funder of research and this role is well advertised throughout the medical and academic community. The Chief Scientist Office (CSO) has received no research proposals of a sufficiently high standard on multiple sclerosis (MS <i>)</i> recently and therefore has not directly funded research into this neurological disease in the period mentioned. However, CSO would be pleased to receive research applications on MS which would be subject to the usual peer and committee review.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive, through CSO, also supports research indirectly through its allocation of some &pound;29 million annually to the NHS in Scotland. Some of this funding may support research with a relevance to MS.</p>

  <p>We are aware of 303 research projects on MS<i> </i>which are currently taking place or have recently been completed in the UK, 19 of which relate to Scotland. The results of the projects undertaken throughout the UK will inform the future direction of research and treatment of this disease.</p>

  <p>Details of past and current research undertaken on MS in the UK are available on the National Research Register (NRR), a copy of which is in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre.</p>

Imported organic food is subject to the same checks and guarantees; importers must also be registered with one of the UK bodies.</p>

  <p>A ports policy paper, <i>Modern Ports</i> , has been published today and a copy has been placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. no 9874). The paper provides a comprehensive statement of future policy on a wide range of issues relating to the UK ports industry. It encompasses issues where the Executive has devolved responsibilities, and also issues which are reserved. It is therefore a joint UK-wide document combining these issues.</p>

  <p>Ports are vital to Scotland&#8217;s economy and international trade. They have an important role in our integrated transport policy. The Executive seeks to build on the many sound and well-established working relationships it already has with the industry.</p>

  <p>The paper sets out the key devolved ports responsibilities and policies. These policies recognise Scotland&#8217;s special circumstances and needs. They also recognise our own integrated transport framework and strategy, the special needs of industries such as oil, fishing and lifeline ferry services in the Highlands and Islands, and how sustainability and environmental issues are addressed in Scotland. It puts other key policies identified in a Scottish context where necessary.</p>

  <p>I am pleased that Modern Ports represents a UK-wide paper so that all of the strands of reserved and devolved policy can be brought together to provide a comprehensive strategy for the future development of ports in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The paper commits the devolved administrations to work with UK Government, the industry, its users and other interests to achieve four key objectives:</p>

  <p>to make regulation add value rather than unnecessary cost, ensuring that different regulators co-ordinate their overall demands;</p>

  <p>to promote agreed national standards and good practice for port management and port operations alike, without detracting from the legal responsibilities of harbour authorities and other port interests;</p>

  <p>to promote training and the recognition of skills for those who work in the ports industry at all levels &#8211; not just those engaged by harbour authorities;</p>

  <p>to maintain a balanced policy on development which aims to make the best use of existing and former operational land, secures high environmental standards, but supports sustainable projects for which there is a clear need.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) holds information on waste management issues obtained from a number of sources. Examples are data on licensed activities, exemptions, waste carriers and waste brokers which are held on public registers. Data on the amount of different wastes produced are obtained from specific surveys such as the joint Scottish Executive/SEPA survey carried out in 1999 to establish waste management data for 1997 and 1998.</p>

  <p>During this year, as part of the implementation of the <i>National Waste Strategy: Scotland</i>, baseline assessments of waste management activities in each of 11 Waste Strategy Areas have been prepared. These will form part of the final Area Waste Plans.</p>

  <p>SEPA is currently developing a system to ensure that all data on waste management issues are integrated within a co-ordinated waste management database. This forms part of SEPA&#8217;s Information Systems Strategy.<br /></p>
