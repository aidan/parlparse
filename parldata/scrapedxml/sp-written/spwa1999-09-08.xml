  <p>In October 1998, Michael Meacher announced to the House of Lords Select Committee that agreement had been reached in principle with the plant breeding industry for a jointly-funded programme of managed development of herbicide tolerant genetically modified crops. The invitation to tender was issued on 2 February 1999 and a consultation on the nature of the evaluations was issued on 25 February 1999. The announcement of the successful tender was made on 15 April 1999 by DETR news release. Information about the programme is contained on the DETR website including details of the 4 sites (in England) which have already been identified. Information on any Scottish sites will be publicised in advance.</p>

  <p>The announcement of the decision to award the contracts for the joint UK Government and Scottish Executive programme of farmscale evaluations of the management of genetically modified herbicide tolerant crops to a consortium consisting of the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology, the Institute of Arable Crop Research and the Scottish Crop Research Institute was made as an answer to a parliamentary question in Westminster, accompanied by a DETR press release, on 15 April 1999.</p>

  <p>The announcement contained details of the length of the programme, the costs involved, the fact that The Scottish Office, DETR and MAFF were jointly funding the programme and the reasons for the trials. It related to the UK as a whole.</p>

  <p>Details of this programme are openly available and contained on the DETR website and before any planting takes place the information on site location must be publicised in the relevant local press.</p>

  <p>In the autumn of 1997 Greater Glasgow Health Board consulted widely with over 100 organisations and individuals, including MPs and all Community Councils in Glasgow, on its Draft Strategy for Mentally Disordered Offenders which had been produced by a multi-agency working group. Support for the Strategy was almost universal from those who responded, including the Health Council, Strathclyde Police, the Area Medical Committee, Glasgow City Council and UNISON.</p>

  <p>In the following summer (1998) the Health Board and the former Greater Glasgow Community and Mental Health NHS Trust held meetings with local MPs, local Community Councils in the areas then under consideration (Stobhill and Ruchill), the Local Health Forum, and the Health Council to discuss the proposed local forensic unit.</p>

  <p>The further option appraisal, conducted in February 1999, involved representatives from the Greater Glasgow Community and Mental Health Services Trust, local authorities, UNISON, Strathclyde Police and others. MSPs, City Councillors and Community Councillors were informed of the proposals in July 1999. The Health Board have been holding a number of meetings with local groups. They have issued information to all local households and are dealing with correspondence with detailed responses and offers of further information.</p>

Officials of the Executive are currently in discussion with the hospitality trade in Scotland, and other key interests, with a view to negotiating a Public Places Charter.

  <p>The local waiting time guarantees for a first outpatient appointment following General Medical Practitioner/General Dental Practitioner referral are set and monitored by Health Boards taking account of local needs.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to set and monitor targets to speed treatment and shorten waiting times. We plan to ensure that this commitment extends to outpatients as well as inpatient and day case treatment and we will consult widely before targets are set. These targets will be closely monitored and will be published.</p>

  <p>The circumstances of the death of Ian Godley are being kept under regular review. Matters affecting the deployment of police officers to investigate crime are for the local police commander and not the Lord Advocate. In accordance with the usual practice in cases of suspicious death, investigation of the circumstances of Mr Godley&#146;s death was carried out by the police under the direction of the Procurator Fiscal. The Procurator Fiscal reported the results for the instructions of Crown Counsel, who instructed a number of specific further enquiries to be carried out by both the Procurator Fiscal and the police. These did not yield sufficient evidence to enable proceedings to be brought. It is considered that all avenues of enquiry have been explored, but the case remains open and will be reviewed if further evidence emerges.</p>

  <p>There are no plans for any such investigation at present. The Scottish Executive is well aware that disabled people need to have accessible transport available to them. A research study into the provision of transport for disabled people in Scotland has been completed recently and its findings will be carefully considered. Disabled people in rural areas are benefiting from the Scottish Executive&#146;s Rural Community Transport Grant scheme which is grant aiding many new community transport projects including the provision of wheelchair accessible minibuses. <br /></p>
