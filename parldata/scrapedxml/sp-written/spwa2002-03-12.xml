  <p>The EC Birds Directive requires member states to classify the most suitable territories in number and size as Special Protection Areas (SPAs) for the conservation of bird species identified as being particularly vulnerable.</p>

  <p>Since 1979, when the directive came into force, the UK has identified over 255 sites for designation as SPAs, of which 141 are Scottish. One hundred and thirty-five Scottish sites have already been classified.

  <p>These sites are all listed as potential SPAs in Annex D to the revised version of the <i>Scottish Office Circular 6/1995 </i>published in June 2000. In addition, an extension is proposed to the Forth Islands site.</p>

  <p>A decision on whether to classify any particular site as a Special Protection Area is only taken once all relevant documentation has been given full ministerial consideration. A key component of this documentation is the site consultation report, which is prepared by Scottish Natural Heritage on behalf of Scottish ministers. It is not possible to say precisely when any particular report will be received.</p>

  <p>This is an important study which adds to the breast cancer research and evidence base.</p>

  <p>On its own, however, it does not warrant a change in the advice given to women of all ages that they should be breast aware and ensure that if they notice any changes of concern to them they should seek medical advice as early as possible.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer given to question S1W-23166 today.</p>

  <p>I would also add that the Health Department&#146;s Chief Scientist Office (CSO) is responsible for encouraging and supporting research into health services and patient care within NHSScotland and, as such, is the main departmental funder of NHS-related research.</p>

  <p>CSO is currently funding 11 research projects with a total value of &#163;1,261,450 on breast cancer, five of which, with a total value of &#163;499,377, are into the causes of breast cancer.</p>

  <p>Details of these projects are available from the National Research Register, a copy of which is in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 17404).</p>

  <p>Cancer remains a health research priority and as such the CSO would be happy to consider further research proposals into this matter or related areas.</p>

  <p>The Medicines Control Agency (MCA) is the UK-wide medicines regulatory authority responsible for ensuring the safety, quality and efficacy of medicines available on the UK market.</p>

  <p>The MCA has advised that the decision to grant a marketing authorisation in the UK for a product containing levonorgestrel 0.75 mg (emergency hormonal contraceptive) followed advice from the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) who were satisfied as to the product&#146;s safety, quality and efficacy. The evidence considered by the CSM included two World Health Organisation sponsored pivotal studies. One study involving approximately 2,000 women in 14 countries including the UK, has been published in the <i>Lancet </i>(1998). The other, published in <i>Human Reproduction</i> (1993), involved 880 women. Other supporting data not in the public domain are confidential to the application.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to monitor repeated use of Emergency Hormonal Contraception (EHC) from data available centrally. EHC may be sold under the supervision of a pharmacist to women aged 16 and over without a prescription.

  <p>The Executive routinely makes direct investment in aquaculture through research and development work, in support of its statutory responsibilities for disease control and improving understanding of impacts on the marine environment; and through FIFG Structural Funds, where the priorities of the aquaculture scheme remain the efficient and hygienic production of quality fish and shellfish. In recent years, there has also been exceptional expenditure through the Highlands and Islands Enterprise Infectious Salmon Anaemia (ISA) Re-Start Scheme, to facilitate the sustainability of employment and business activity in fish and shellfish farming businesses in the Highlands and Islands, which had been adversely affected by ISA, as well as the payment of formation grant to a producer organisation.</p>

  <p>The Executive's aim is to secure a sustainable and competitive future for the aquaculture industry in Scotland, as one of our most important rural employers. We will achieve this through a partnership with all the relevant stakeholders, working together to balance their social, economic and environmental aspirations.</p>

  <p>We are currently consulting on a strategic framework which will shape the development of the industry for the medium-term. This will build on recent work, through the Tripartite Working Group, to maintain a healthy stock of wild fish; through the Aquaculture Health Joint Working Group, to prevent disease and improve fish health; and to streamline and improve the regulation of the industry.</p>

  <p>Further and higher education institutions are constituted as independent, autonomous bodies, and are consequently treated as such by the Scottish Executive.

  <p>The Further and Higher Education (Scotland) Act 1992 provides that the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council shall be responsible for administering funds made available to it by the Scottish ministers and others for the purposes of providing financial support for activities eligible for funding. Ministers are expressly prevented by the act from framing conditions of grant by reference to particular institutions, programmes of study, selection of staff or admission and selection of students. The Executive is currently conducting a review of higher education during which individuals and organisations are at liberty to propose changes to these arrangements.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Further Education Funding Council (Establishment) (Scotland) Order 1998 delegates to that council the former Secretary of State function of making public funding available to further education colleges.</p>

  <p>As a result of these arrangements, ministers set broad policy priorities through the medium of guidance to the councils, but do not prescribe sums of money for individual institutions.</p>

  <p>The procedure for the appointment of general practitioners is set out in the NHS (General Medical Services) (Scotland) Regulations 1995. The only statutory consultation which an Island NHS Board or Primary Care Trust is required to undertake is with the Area Medical Committee before a report is made to the Scottish Medical Practices Committee on the need to fill a vacancy. In the case of Helmsdale, Highland Primary Care Trust carried out that task. The nature of any informal consultation which the trust may have also carried out with local interests is a matter for the trust.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what powers local authorities have in respect of dealing with invasive plant species and whether such species include leylandii.</p>

  <p>The Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 provides local authorities with powers to take action in circumstances where the amenity of an area is affected by the presence of invasive plants such as, for example, Giant Hogweed and Japanese Knotweed. In natural heritage terms, leylandii (leyland cypress) is not regarded as posing a significant threat to the countryside.</p>

  <p>The problems associated with leylandii and other high trees and hedges, when grown in gardens are, however, generally well recognised. Local authorities are required, under powers derived from the Environmental Protection Act 1990, to investigate complaints about a statutory nuisance occurring on premises, including land. It is a matter for local authorities, in considering individual cases, to determine whether a particular high tree or hedge constitutes a statutory nuisance, and to decide what action should be taken.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer given to question S1W-12936 on 31 January 2001 about the problems caused by high hedges in Scotland, in which the Deputy First Minister announced that the Executive had decided in principle that a statutory remedy of last resort was needed, involving complaints to the local authority and enforcement action in appropriate cases. However, it was not possible to give a commitment as to when legislation would be brought forward.</p>

  <p>The Scottish University for Industry (SUfI) is a broker and facilitator of learning between individuals, learning providers and companies and has no direct role in delivering learning itself. SUfI is not a primary holder of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR). We therefore do not believe that the concept of technology transfer applies, nor does SUfI have any role in, or capacity to, undertake research and development functions relating to the application of IPR.</p>

  <p>The statutory right of excusal from jury duty is not a reserved matter and the Scottish Parliament could vary the categories to which the right of excusal extends, if it wished to do so. As indicated in the answer I gave to question S1W-21993 on 20 January 2002, we have no plans to introduce legislation for that purpose at present.</p>

  <p>It is worth noting that the report by Lord Justice Auld, following his review of the criminal courts in England and Wales, recommended that, except for those who have recently undertaken or have been excused by the court from jury service, no-one in England and Wales should be excusable from jury service as of right, only on showing good reason for excusal.</p>

  <p>Protection of other areas of deep-sea coral within Scottish territorial waters is a devolved matter. These areas can be designated as Special Areas of Conservation under the EU Habitats Directive, but any decision would be made on the basis of available scientific evidence.</p>

  <p>The UK Government has announced that it is currently taking steps to implement the site identification and protection requirements of the EU Birds and Habitats Directives beyond territorial waters where it claims sovereign rights. This will involve steps to provide protection where appropriate to several species and habitats, including reefs. As part of this process the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) have been commissioned to identify and agree relevant habitats and species in the 12-200 mile marine zone; to develop selection criteria and refine habitat definitions, and to collate known data on those habitats and species. The JNCC are due to report in April 2002 and the UK plans to host a European conference to discuss the findings of the report during the summer of 2002. Subject to the conclusions of the JNCC report, the Darwin Mounds appear to be a strong candidate for site protection under the Habitats Directive as a Special Area of Conservation.</p>

  <p>The Older People&#146;s Consultative Forum forms part of the Executive&#146;s wider strategy for involving older people. The main criterion for determining membership was that it should comprise older people themselves. Following consultations, national organisations which represent the interests of many older people's groups across Scotland were invited to nominate members.</p>

  <p>I am able to respond in respect only of ombudsmen whose jurisdiction covers Scottish public bodies for which the Scottish ministers have responsibility.</p>

  <p>Information on payments made to individuals following recommendations by Scottish public sector ombudsmen is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>There are no specific powers relating to awards to individuals following a finding of maladministration by a Scottish public sector ombudsman. Where an ombudsman determines that a person has suffered an injustice or hardship as a result of maladministration, he may recommend whatever action he considers appropriate to remedy that injustice or hardship. This may involve financial redress, the amount of which is wholly dependent on the circumstances of the particular case.</p>

  <p>Many public sector bodies in Scotland have been under a general obligation under the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 to promote race equality since April 2001.</p>

  <p>An order extending the list of bodies in Schedule 1A of the 1976 Act, including devolved bodies, to be made subject to the general duty to promote race equality was laid in Westminster in October 2001 and came into force on 3 December 2001.</p>

  <p>However, the act recognised that there would be a need to make provision for more specific duties to ensure the better performance by public bodies of the general duty.</p>

  <p>The Race Relations Act 1976 (Statutory Duties) (Scotland) Order 2002 was laid before the Scottish Parliament on 15 February 2002 and will come into force on 13 March 2002. Public bodies will require to comply with the duties by November 2002.</p>

  <p>The Commission for Racial Equality, Scotland will shortly be publishing for consultation a draft Statutory Code of Practice and associated guidance for devolved public bodies in Scotland. The code will provide practical guidance to bodies on how to fulfil both their general and specific duties and will be supported by examples of best practice.</p>

  <p>I have asked the Chief Executive of West of Scotland Water to respond. The response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The water in Loch Katrine originates from a number of lochs which form a complex combined catchment system. Loch Katrine is the lowest point of this system with Loch Finglas the highest point at 157 metres AOD. The difference in level between the top water level at Loch Katrine and the reservoirs at Milngavie is only 22 inches, an impressive Victorian engineering achievement and one which constrains solution development for the Katrine Water Project.</p>

  <p>The top water level to which the proposed solution will pump is approximately the same as the top operating level in Loch Katrine. On occasions throughout the year, when Loch Katrine is drawn down, the level to which water is pumped at Milngavie may be higher than the level of Loch Katrine but may not necessarily be higher than the level at which the water originated.</p>
