  <p>The Scottish Government does not interfere with the operational decisions of the Scottish Arts Council (SAC), which are the responsibility of the joint board of SAC and Scottish Screen. Where SAC implement national cultural initiatives on behalf of the Scottish Government, as is the case in relation to the Cultural Co-ordinators in Scottish Schools (CCiSS) Initiative, the government works in partnership with SAC to design the means of implementation and evaluation. Money for the implementation of such initiatives is provided to SAC as a &quot;restricted fund&quot;, which may be used only for the initiative in question, as is the case in relation to CCiSS. The detailed operation of such initiatives is, however, also a matter for SAC.</p>

  <p>As outlined in the Better Health, Better Care: Action Plan, one of the 2008-09 HEAT targets is &quot;To achieve agreed reductions in the rates of hospital admissions and bed days of patients with primary diagnosis of COPD, Asthma, Diabetes or CHD, from 2006-07 to 2010-11&quot;.</p>

  <p>Information relating to all in-patients and day cases discharged from non-obstetric and non-psychiatric specialties is collected via the SMR01 episode-based patient record.</p>

  <p>The data collected on the SMR01 record includes patient identifiable and demographic details, episode management details and general clinical information. Diagnoses are recorded using the International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10).</p>

  <p>A range of information such as waiting time for in-patient/day case admission and length of stay may be derived from the SMR01 record and can be aggregated to allow analysis at NHS board level.</p>

  <p>Within Local Delivery Plans (LDPs), performance against this target will be measured using information on the number of hospital episodes per 100,000 population for the specified long-term conditions. The number of bed days will also be considered.</p>

  <p>2007-08: &pound;50.3 million &ndash; Funding for additional teachers for the previous administration&rsquo;s commitments to reduce class sizes in P1 to 25 and S1/S2 maths and English classes to 20.

  <p>2008-09: Prior to the local government finance settlement and at the same time as the &pound;6 million was announced, funding of &pound;3 million in addition to the &pound;6 million was announced for the same purpose to be allocated from financial year 2008-09.</p>

  <p>For 2008-09 onwards, all of this funding will now be included in the overall local government finance settlement.

  <p>Providing local government in Scotland with record levels of funding over the period covered by the spending review 2008-11.

  <p>The Scottish Government has for some time recognised the concerns about declining sea trout catches on the west coast. Through our agency, Fisheries Research Services, the Shieldaig Sea Trout Project was set up in 1998 to address these issues. The project operates in partnership with the Loch Torridon Area Management Group, part of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Tripartite Working Group, to identify the causes of the decline in sea trout numbers on the west coast. The causes are likely to be complex and multi-factorial. The project is currently developing and testing restoration techniques. Improvements in marine survival have continued, and results from the Shieldaig Sea Trout Project for 2006-07 saw increased numbers of mature fish returning to spawn.</p>

  <p>The intention is for the final meeting of the taskforce to take place in June. The taskforce will report as soon as is feasible after that meeting. I expect the outcomes to be reported to the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Cabinet, amongst others and I would also expect our work to be published in due course. In addition, I plan to keep members of the further and higher education roundtable updated with its progress.</p>

  <p>A wide ranging review which might take years to produce results is not appropriate in this case. Membership of the taskforce has deliberately been restricted to the government, university principals and the chair of the Scottish Funding Council to ensure a short, sharp exercise that produces tangible outputs.</p>

  <p>The government does not see the taskforce&rsquo;s identification of challenges and next steps as being the end of the process. There will be an opportunity for wider engagement with a range of stakeholders beyond this. In particular, NUS and CHESS have been specifically asked to provide an input to the next meeting in February. I also intend to discuss the student perspective at an event in the spring.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises that the vast majority of landlords operate lawfully. No applications for registration have been rejected yet, but several local authorities are taking enforcement action where there are concerns. This may involve the landlord being invited to an interview with a panel of officials to discuss those concerns, or a hearing before the relevant council committee.</p>

  <p>Both online and paper applications require applicants to declare that the information provided is correct. Applicants are also informed that it is a criminal offence to give false information in an application for registration.</p>

  <p>If an applicant is found to have knowingly provided false information or has knowingly failed to provide the required information in an application form then enforcement sanctions are available to the local authority to take action.

  <p>The following table shows the number of applications for registration by private landlords and letting agents received by each local authority and the number of applications approved, as at 7 January 2008. Landlords and agents are required to register in each authority where they own or manage property, so these figures include multiple registrations for some individuals or organisations.</p>

  <p>Under the Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004, local authorities have a duty to provide applicants for registration with general advice on what constitutes good practice in the letting of houses. If a local authority proposes to refuse an application for registration or remove a registered person from the register then it can provide further advice to the applicant or registered person on actions they may be able to take to resolve the situation including the appointment of an agent to manage the property.</p>

  <p>Local authorities also have a duty to provide advice and assistance to tenants where a decision is made to refuse an application for registration from a landlord, remove a landlord from the register, or serve a Rent Penalty Notice suspending liability for rent at that property.</p>

  <p>Finally, in addition to certain prescribed offences, a local authority can also take into account any other information it considers relevant in determining whether the landlord is fit and proper to let property. This can include complaints from tenants.</p>

  <p>No specific funding was allocated to South Lanarkshire Council for 2007-08 to provide nursery places for vulnerable two year olds. The local government finance settlement for 2008-11 sees a move away from a focus on such inputs and targets to focussing on outcomes. Single outcome agreements will be agreed with each council which will set out the local priorities for each area. Record levels of funding have been invested in local government over 2008-11 to help them work towards the agreed priorities.</p>

  <p>The forecast liability for police pensions depends on assumptions about the numbers of police officers who actually retire when they are entitled to assumptions made about police rates of pay and estimates of pension entitlements. As a result, the forecasts can vary quite widely. The latest estimates provided by the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland (ACPOS) for the total pensions liability for 2008-09 are as follows:</p>

  <p>A similar breakdown is not available for future years but ACPOS estimate the total liability to be &pound;232 million in 2009-10 and &pound;215 million in 2010-11.</p>

  <p>The recruitment and deployment of police officers in Grampian is a matter for the Chief Constable of Grampian Police and it is for him to consider the projections of police numbers in Grampian with the Grampian Joint Police Board whose convener has announced that the force is on track to have unprecedented numbers of officers.</p>

  <p>As the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Development announced in his statement to Parliament on 13 December, funding for police pensions is included within the local authority funding settlement under the concordat with COSLA.

  <p>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The term &quot;financial penalties&quot; is not used in the contract. Service credits are applied where performance failure occurs. The minimum threshold standard is effectively the cap or the maximum number of failures that will be taken in to account in any given month for the calculation of the service credit.</p>

  <p>There has been no revisions to the contract in relation to either service credits or the minimum threshold standards.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>To date, there has been no variations to the annual budget set by SPS for this contract.</p>

  <p>In determining any additional expenditure, I would refer the member to response to S3W-8577 on 29 January 2008. The budget is based on the actual volume data for the previous calendar year, we have no estimates beyond fiscal year 2008-09 and would not anticipate any additional expenditure.</p>

  <p>The vacancy for the Chair of sportscotland will be advertised in the national press in the next few weeks and there is normally a minimum closing date period of four weeks. This is followed by a short-list meeting to select candidates for interview and finally the interviews themselves will take place. Once the selection panel has made their recommendations it will be sent to the cabinet secretary/minister for consideration. The process normally takes between three to four months to complete from advert date.</p>

  <p>&pound;13 million was added to the local government finance settlement in 2003-04 in respect of the newly introduced teacher induction scheme. In addition to this ongoing funding the following amounts have been paid to local authorities.</p>

  <p>2003-04 - &pound;9.4 million</p>

  <p>2004-05 - &pound;9.4 million</p>

  <p>2005-06 - &pound;18.1 million</p>

  <p>2006-07 - &pound;29.5 million</p>

  <p>2007-08 - &pound;36.1 million.</p>

  <p>Local government also had flexibility to allocate other resources to this area.</p>

  <p>Some spending on children and young people will have been subsumed within budgets that covered services to people of all ages - e.g. community health &ndash; and as such, it is not possible to identify the total budget for children and young people over period.

  <p>Whilst local government had flexibility to allocate other resources to this area, the specific amounts allocated to local government for additional teachers from 2003 to 2007 were as follows (Information on what total amount was allocated for additional teachers for early years is not available separately):</p>

  <p>2006-07: &pound;32.5 million - Funding for additional teachers for the previous administration&rsquo;s commitments to reduce class sizes in P1 to 25 and S1/S2 maths and English classes to 20.</p>

  <p>2007-08: &pound;50.3 million - Funding for additional teachers for the previous administration&rsquo;s commitments to reduce class sizes in P1 to 25 and S1/S2 maths and English classes to 20. In addition a further &pound;6m was allocated by this government as part year costs to enable local authorities to employ additional teachers in early years and for class size reduction in primary 1 to primary 3.</p>
