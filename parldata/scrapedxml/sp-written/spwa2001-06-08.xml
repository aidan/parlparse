  <p>From the start, provision has been made for some recognised rare animal breeds where bio-security can be adequately maintained. For all other cases the Executive has recently reviewed its policy on the contiguous cull of cattle and the 3km sheep cull. Infected premises and sheep and pigs on contiguous premises will continue to be culled. Any other disease control measures applied will be determined on a case-by-case basis.</p>

  <p>I refer to the answers given to questions S1W-15523 and S1W-15524. The Health and Safety Executive publish several leaflets on gas safety, including carbon monoxide risks. One of these leaflets is aimed at landlords to advise them that gas safety law requires them to maintain all gas appliances and flues they provide for tenants&#8217; use and to ensure that they are checked for safety each year by a CORGI registered installer.</p>

  <p>As I have always made clear, the timing of these reports is a matter for Sir Anthony and Dr Jandoo. I understand that both are working on their final reports and that these will be submitted to me as early as possible. Dr Jandoo has written to me to explain that he has only recently been able to complete his evidence taking, and that the task of drawing together all the evidence &#8211; including that provided by over 60 witnesses &#8211; and reaching conclusions will take some weeks to complete. Neither the Justice Minister nor I are aware of any emerging findings at this stage.</p>

  <p>Both reports will then be translated into Punjabi before publication.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what plans it has to review the powers of prison governors as a result of the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights legislation into Scottish law.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2001-06-08.6.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80252" speakername="Mr Jim Wallace" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-01/wa0608.htm#15995">

  <p>The system of discipline in Scottish penal establishments has already been reviewed by the Scottish Executive in the light of the incorporation into Scottish law of the European Convention on Human Rights. That review included consideration of the powers of Prison Governors in relation to disciplinary proceedings against prisoners.</p>

  <p>Ministers have subsequently been advised that it is possible that the imposition by Governors of additional days as a disciplinary punishment could be challenged under the European Convention on Human Rights. In order to minimise that risk, with the disruption to the operational stability of penal establishments that any successful challenge could cause, it has been decided that with effect from 11 June the awarding by Prison Governors of additional days or loss of remission as punishments for prisoners infringing prison rules will be suspended. Punishments made before that date will remain in force; but Governors have been instructed that from 11 June they are not to make any new awards of these punishments.</p>

  <p>The disciplinary situation in the prisons estate will be kept under review following this decision. However, the full range of other disciplinary punishments that currently exist, such as loss of privileges and cellular confinement, will continue to be available to Governors, and it is believed that these are sufficient to allow the satisfactory maintenance of discipline in penal establishments. Where serious criminal behaviour is involved, Governors will also continue as at present to be able to refer the matter to the police for possible criminal charges.</p>

  <p>Scottish Ministers are considering the future funding arrangements for the seven grant-aided schools. In the meantime, we have given a commitment to continue the current grant aid arrangements until March 2003. I have met representatives from the seven schools and I hope to complete a programme of visits to all the schools shortly. An announcement on future funding arrangements beyond March 2003 will be made in due course.</p>

  <p>All councils have been asked to carry out an audit of local needs to identify the range of challenging programmes required in their area. These programmes should have in-built monitoring to allow for evaluation of their effectiveness. The first formal reports on progress achieved are required by March 2002. Ministers will be seeking interim reports on the programmes and their targets before this. The Executive will also undertake its own evaluation of the effectiveness of the measures being introduced.</p>
