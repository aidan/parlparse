  <p>The Scottish Executive is investing &#163;26 million in 2001-02, &#163;30 million in 2002-03 and &#163;40 million in 2003-04. Allocations for the years beyond 2003-04 will be announced at the appropriate time. The Executive&#8217;s investment will be supplemented by private sector resources invested as part of the stock transfer process, but it is not possible to quantify the extent of this investment at this time. The investment by the energy companies under their Energy Efficiency commitment will follow from regulations to be made under the Utilities Act.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Drug Enforcement Agency (SDEA) works closely with Her Majesty&#8217;s Customs and Excise Investigation Service and the National Criminal Intelligence Service in providing a co-ordinated partnership approach to tackling drug trafficking in Scotland. The closure of the HM Customs&#8217; collection and co-ordination unit in Paisley, which is separate from the Investigation Service, is as a result of the establishment of a centralised unit in Ipswich. This internal reorganisation, about which the Scottish Executive was not formally consulted, will have no direct impact on the Investigation Service&#8217;s relationship with, nor on the work of, the SDEA.</p>

  <p>It is not unprecedented for authorities to make adjustments, both up and down, to planned budgets for services during a financial year.

  <p>The Scottish Executive has commissioned AEA Technology to undertake two studies:</p>

  <p>1. <i>Analysis of the Costs and Benefits of a More Stringent AQS Objective for PM10 in Scotland</i>. The Scottish Executive has received a draft final report for this study and will consider a dissemination strategy for this project on receipt of the final report.</p>

  <p>2. <i>Climate Change: Projections of Energy and CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions for Scotland</i>. The Scottish Executive has received a final report for this study and is currently considering an appropriate dissemination strategy for the work.</p>

  <p>No information is held centrally regarding the commissioning of research to particular contractors by other agencies or non-departmental public bodies, other than for projects to which Scottish Executive contributes to directly.</p>

  <p>However, in the case of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, it is our understanding, following contact with the agency, that it has not commissioned AEA Technology for any current research. To contact other agencies or non-departmental public bodies would incur disproportionate costs.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that the decision of a Procurator Fiscal to place an accused on petition is not an expression of his or her view of where proceedings should ultimately be taken. It is a preliminary procedure which is followed by further investigation and consideration of the case.</p>

  <p>The variation of fees is based on recommendations by the Gaming Board following a study of the board by the National Audit Office. It is designed to ensure that the licensing authorities (which in Scotland are the local authorities) recoup their costs without profit or loss, and without cross-subsidy between casino and bingo licensing. We have not calculated the specific revenue implications for local authorities, but expect the changes to be broadly neutral.</p>

  <p>The development of rail freight is a reserved matter and as such is the responsibility of the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA). However, in April, the Scottish Executive commissioned consultants to carry out a study to take a strategic view of the potential for developing sustainable freight movements across the whole of Scotland. This will enable prioritisation of investment projects aimed at promoting a shift to sustainable modes, such as rail, inland waterway or sea. The outcome of this study will assist our discussions with the SRA when it draws up the Freight Strategy for Scotland as part of its GB Freight Strategy.</p>

  <p>In August 2000, the Scottish Executive, the former Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and the then Shadow Strategic Rail Authority jointly commissioned Booze, Allen and Hamilton to carry out an indicative financial and economic feasibility study to look at potential rail options for rail links to Glasgow and Edinburgh airports. Booze, Allen and Hamilton produced their final report in March 2001.</p>

  <p>As I indicated in my answers to questions S1W-17421 and S1W-17422, the Scottish Executive is in the process of commissioning a more detailed study which will build on the initial scoping work carried out by Booze, Allen and Hamilton. The study is expected to take about eight months to complete.</p>

They will do so in relation to the forthcoming negotiations on the east coast main line franchise.
