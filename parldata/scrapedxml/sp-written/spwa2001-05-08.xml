  <p>The information is not available. The vast majority of claims were paid, at least up to the level of the safety net, by the end of April.

  <p>Through its Information Age Government in Scotland draft common framework, the Executive promotes the delivery of services through multiple methods which are appropriate to the customers of those services, and which meet the needs of excluded groups.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Executive seeks to ensure that its website is accessible to all by subscribing to the general principles of best practice contained within the <i>Guidelines for UK Government Websites</i> published by the Office of the e-Envoy and to the <i>Web Accessibility Initiative</i> standards published by the World Wide Web Consortium. The &quot;Web Accessibility Initiative&quot; is endorsed by the Royal National Institute for the Blind and other major bodies representing people with disabilities.</p>

The Scottish Executive has recognised the contribution of the route for the export of livestock from Orkney.

  <p>The Executive confirmed in discussions with the operator and Orkney Islands Council that a TRS allocation continued to be available for 2001-02 for the company, or any alternative operator, at the same assistance rate of 50% of shipping costs.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what estimated level of haddock discards was expected in the North Sea and built into the quota negotiations for 2001, whether this figure took into account the seasonal closure of fishing grounds under the cod recovery plan and whether there are any plans to revise the predicted level of haddock discards.</p>

  <p>The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) provided forecasts of landings and discards for a range of possible exploitation scenarios. At the exploitation rate corresponding to the agreed TAC, the annual estimated discard rate by weight in the human consumption fishery is 67% of the catch. These calculations did not anticipate the closure of any area as part of the cod recovery plan. Preliminary figures for the discard rate in the first quarter of 2001 estimated by Fisheries Research Services from observer samples are consistent with the ICES forecast.</p>

  <p>The state of the North Sea haddock stock will be evaluated by ICES in late June this year when revised estimates of discards 2001 will become available.</p>

Commissioning of any specific assessments is also a matter for the riparian landowners involved: information on any assessments that may have been undertaken is not held by the Executive.</p>

  <p>However, local authorities have a duty to assess the state of watercourses in their area to ascertain whether they are likely to cause flooding of non-agricultural land and to publish reports on flooding and measures to prevent flooding.</p>

  <p>We have taken steps to ease the cashflow problems of all farmers by paying the main livestock subsidies amounting to &#163;146 million as early as possible in April and May. I have also announced the payment of &#163;24 million of agrimonetary compensation to beef, sheep and dairy farmers during the same period. We are seeking the maximum flexibility possible under CAP rules to ensure that farmers do not lose out when they are unable to comply fully with scheme rules as a direct result of the foot and mouth outbreak.</p>

  <p>Farmers will be paid at market value or on the basis of a specific valuation for stock culled as part of the measures to control the outbreak and arrangements are in place to reimburse farmers for animals slaughtered for welfare reasons.</p>

  <p>We are also working with a wide range of agencies to ensure that farmers have ready access to information and advice on coping with practical, financial, business and emotional problems. To help with this process the Executive has set up a Farm Business Support Steering Group for the south of Scotland which comprises representatives from the Executive, Scottish Enterprise Dumfries and Galloway, the National Farmers&#146; Union of Scotland and the local farming community.</p>

  <p>Our primary aims are built around stopping the spread of the disease and restoring normal trading conditions as quickly as possible. A medium-term recovery strategy is also being prepared drawing on the longer-term Forward Strategy for Scottish Agriculture which I had intended to launch in early March this year before the start of the foot and mouth outbreak.</p>

  <p>The vaccination contingency plan was prepared only for cattle, and only for the three areas of Dumfries, North Cumbria and Devon. It is therefore not possible to give figures for sheep or pigs.

  <p>The answer to question S1W-15222 noted that the Executive has established an FMD Impact Assessment Group to study the economic impact of FMD across areas and sectors of Scotland. The group, through their existing information networks, has also received some anecdotal evidence of workers receiving reduced earnings. In addition, a survey recently commissioned by the group will help to illustrate measures taken by employers to minimise the impact on their businesses.</p>

  <p>Initial advice is being made available to any individual or business affected by the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak through the Small Business Gateway&#146;s helplines. Training for Work eligibility has been relaxed, ensuring that all individuals made redundant as a result of this outbreak in Borders and Dumfries and Galloway have immediate access to this programme. Immediate entry to Training for Work has now been extended to workers temporarily laid off as a result of foot and mouth in Dumfries and Galloway and the Borders.</p>

  <p>The Department for Education and Employment has introduced a new service, Rural Skills Action, as an emergency response to the employment and training needs of those worst affected by the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak.</p>

  <p>Geese are not considered to be the source of foot-and-mouth disease spread. This is due to the birds natural behaviour. Geese have to keep themselves clean in order to migrate successfully and there is a high probability that most of the geese will not come into contact with susceptible livestock. Based on initial analysis and epidemiological information, it is estimated that around 90% of the cases of infection are attributable to local spread between premises caused by animal and people movements.</p>

  <p>The Housing Improvement Task Force will consider the information provided to purchasers under the current arrangements and advise on whether changes to those arrangements to promote energy efficiency would be deliverable. The Scottish Executive will consider what legislative changes are necessary when the task force has completed its work.</p>

  <p>The Information and Statistics Division no longer collects monthly data on inpatient and day case waiting lists; validated data is collected and published quarterly. It is the Executive&#146;s view that quarterly progress reporting on this issue is the appropriate frequency. Data on outpatient waiting times is taken from case level data collected throughout the year, making quarterly analysis and publication the most practical frequency.</p>

  <p>The procedure involves a number of stages beginning with advertising for the positions for which we are seeking candidates. The advertisement was brought to the attention of a large number of diverse organisations and individuals to encourage applications, including MSPs and MPs to whom I wrote in early March. Applications received in response are assessed against the criteria for the positions, following which individuals are invited for interview. The interview panels, chaired by the Head of the Scottish Executive Health Department, and including an Independent Assessor, will make recommendations for appointment to the Scottish Ministers. This procedure complies with the guidelines of the Commissioner for Public Appointments.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive and the Forestry Commission, from time to time, may carry out surveys of timber merchants for a variety of reasons including timber marketing and contingency planning for ( <i>inter alia</i> ) foot-and-mouth disease. Marketing surveys may be carried out at a local level.</p>

  <p>No such contingency exercise was carried out during the period referred to. As far as can be ascertained, neither the Forestry Commission nor the Scottish Executive carried out any survey for marketing purposes during that period.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#146;s understanding is that there was no concluded contract of employment. VisitScotland announced on 19 April a remuneration package of &#163;145,000 per annum and a 20% performance bonus. Discussions between legal representatives are continuing. VisitScotland was keen to announce the appointment to end uncertainty and to enable the organisation to move forward.

  <p>Details of all those involved in waste minimisation are not held centrally. There are many waste minimisation initiatives in Scotland organised by a variety of groups including local authorities, local enterprise companies, universities, water authorities, private enterprise, non-departmental public bodies, chambers of commerce and the voluntary sector.</p>

  <p>The UK has a responsibility under the EC Waste Framework Directive to encourage the minimisation of waste. This is incorporated into Scottish law by the Environment Act 1995 which requires the national waste strategy to state policies for attaining the objective of &quot;encouraging the prevention or reduction of waste production and its harmfulness&quot;. <i>The National Waste Strategy: Scotland</i> (NWS), prepared by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), is the means by which this is being taken forward in Scotland.</p>

  <p>In 1998 SEPA established its Waste Minimisation Initiative. One of its main aims is to provide a co-ordination role for waste minimisation activities in Scotland and link into waste minimisation programmes and activities elsewhere. SEPA maintains a website (<a href="http://www.sepa.org.uk/wastemin" target="_blank">www.sepa.org.uk/wastemin</a>) which lists the waste minimisation projects and clubs in Scotland, outlines their objectives and membership and provides contact names and addresses.</p>

  <p>A component of the NWS is the development of 11 Area Waste Plans. These plans which are currently being developed by SEPA in collaboration with local authorities, local enterprise companies, the waste management industry and community waste groups, will include proposals for waste minimisation.</p>

  <p>The Waste Minimisation Act (1998) enables local authorities to take steps to minimise the generation of controlled waste in their areas.</p>

  <p>Under the Pollution Prevention and Control (Scotland) Regulations 2000, SEPA is required to ensure that waste production by certain industries is prevented or reduced.</p>
