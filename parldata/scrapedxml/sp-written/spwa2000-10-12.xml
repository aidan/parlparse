  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to tackling alcohol misuse and is working towards a comprehensive new strategy for tackling alcohol misuse in Scotland. Service provision, prevention and health promotion will form key components of the emerging strategy.</p>

  <p>Cancer is one of the three clinical priorities for the NHS in Scotland. Reducing waiting times for investigation and treatment are a high priority within the Scottish Cancer Group&#8217;s work programme.</p>

  <p>Initial treatment for cancer can take place in either an outpatient or inpatient setting. Information on waiting times for cases where treatment starts in an outpatient setting is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>Information on the time from a patient being placed on the waiting list for treatment of cancer and their admission to hospital is available centrally. The median waiting times for the four main cancers and all other cancers, in the year ending 31 March 2000, by health board of residence, is given in the table.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is providing additional funding to support the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. I recently announced a rolling modernisation programme which will provide new linear accelerators and treatment planning simulators in all cancer centres, new and replacement MRI scanners, and imaging equipment to help further speed up diagnosis.</p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise has recently met Social Firms Scotland, and is considering ways in which they might facilitate social business development.</p>

  <p>Social Firms have a useful part to play in the ongoing consideration of all aspects of the whole person approach to well-being, and of education, training and employment opportunities for people with disabilities, mental health problems, or with other support needs. This is of interest to the work of the National Action Group, established in response to the Beattie Report, the Learning Disability Review, and the Mental Health and Well-Being Support group.</p>

  <p>As explained in the answer to question S1W-5152, there are two main reasons for the variance between capital provision and recorded capital expenditure in any one year. These are: slippage of particular schemes where expenditure planned to be met in one year falls to be made in the following year; and the transfer of capital resources to revenue budgets to pay for minor works of a capital nature that do not add capital value to the NHS estate.</p>

  <p>The level of capital slippage in any year is determined by a range of factors, including the characteristics and spending profile of particular projects. It will therefore vary from year to year.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive monitors spending on particular projects against expenditure profiles provided by individual health boards and NHS Trusts, and has emphasised to them the need for profiles to be updated regularly so that any potential slippage is identified as early as possible and any resources underspent on a particular project in one year can be carried forward to the next. Prudent financial and project management means that it is not always appropriate for the whole of the capital allocation made available for a particular year to be spent in that year.</p>

  <p>Any underspending against profile on a specific capital project in one year is carried forward to the next year. The Scottish Executive can adjust each health board&#8217;s and NHS Trust&#8217;s capital allocation during any financial year, which could have the effect of transferring an underspent capital allocation from one NHS body to another. However, where underspending arises from slippage on a specific project, it will normally be more prudent to enable the underspend to be carried forward to the following financial year.</p>

  <p>The &quot;Smart Measures&quot; that are in place on the M8 include the following:</p>

  <p><u>Ramp Metering</u> &#8211; the Scottish Executive has been at the forefront of the development of ramp metering in the UK and presently has a very successful site operating at junction 16 slip road on the M8 in Glasgow. A study is presently underway to consider in what situations further slip road sites would provide benefits to travellers. Further ramp metering will be introduced where benefits can be demonstrated.</p>

  <p><u>Variable Message Signs</u> &#8211; there are presently five fully functional variable message signs, 33 single line gantry mounted variable message signs and 162 lane control signal gantries on the M8. The coverage of the Scottish trunk road network continues to be increased year on year with new signs being erected at appropriate locations.</p>

  <p>Both the existing ramp metering site and the various variable message signs are controlled and operated through the National Driver Information and Control System. This is one of the few national systems and has a capability which is among the most advanced anywhere in the world. Arrangements can be made for interested MSPs to visit the National Network Control Centre in Glasgow to see this leading edge system.</p>

  <p><u>Variable Speed Limits</u> &#8211; The Scottish Executive is committed to investigating the use of peak hour speed limits to control traffic speeds in congested areas. Where a value for money case can be made for the introduction of such measures at specific locations then each location shall be considered on its own merits.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive why the financial limits for agri-environment schemes are not the same in Scotland as they are in the rest of the UK.</p>

  <p>The position in Scotland is not directly comparable to that of the rest of the UK because of differences in farm structure and in the agri-environment schemes themselves. The financial limits for Scottish agri-environment schemes ensure that large farms do not consume a disproportionate share of finite resources to the detriment of smaller farms and crofts which could nonetheless demonstrate a conservation benefit.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body&#8217;s first report to MSPs of 9 June 1999 explained that RMJM Scotland Limited are partners with EMBT in the joint venture company EMBT/RMJM Limited, the architects of the new Parliament building. RMJM Services also separately provide mechanical and electrical engineering design services to the project.</p>

  <p>The Auditor General&#8217;s report on the new Scottish Parliament building, made available to MSPs on 19 September, gave latest approximate forecast outturn costs for the main project consultants at exhibit 14. I understand from the Convener of the Holyrood Progress Group that the majority of the individual fee agreements are based on a percentage of the construction cost and it is therefore unlikely that there will be any reduction in the total figure.</p>

  <p>The appointments of the main consultants to the Holyrood Project, including agreement on fee levels, were made prior to 1 June 1999 and were therefore the responsibility of the Scottish Office. I understand however that each member of the Design Team has been appointed under the appropriate terms of appointment as issued by the professional body relevant to their individual disciplines. The standard terms were amended to take into account the particular nature of the project and the specific requirements of the Client. The Construction Manager&#8217;s contract, for which there is no industry standard, was based on closely related contracts and was agreed by Scottish Office legal advisers. The Spencely report studied the consultants&#8217; fees and described them as conventional. The Auditor General for Scotland&#8217;s recent report confirmed that, in general terms, the appointments of the consultants were properly undertaken.</p>
