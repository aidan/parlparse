  <p>As can be seen, revenue from business property taxation represents 2.1 per cent of GDP in Scotland, as opposed to 1.8 per cent for the UK as a whole. However, as the report stresses, comparing individual taxes in isolation is misleading. Furthermore, comparison of total tax revenue raised from business follows the methodology and definition used by the Confederation of British Industry in their paper, <em>UK Manufacturing: Strategy into Action</em>, published September 2003. Such a comparison reveals that the overall tax revenue raised from business in Scotland is 10.4 per cent of GDP, the same level as in the UK. This level is comparable to Germany, and the Netherlands, and less than countries such as France, Finland, Belgium and Sweden. As is stated through-out the report, comparing individual tax revenues in isolation can be misleading and the 17 per cent figure quoted in your question, which is a percentage of two percentages, has limited meaning.</p>

  <p>Every day in every part of Scotland carers make an invaluable contribution to the care of vulnerable people, and I acknowledge that with thanks today. Most of the carers are middle-aged or young, but a significant proportion are older people. The last census indicated that there were then approximately 71,000 carers in Scotland aged 65 and over. That represents about 12% of the estimated total of carers and about 9% of the population aged 65 and over.</p>

  <p>Since we published our Carers Strategy five years ago, we have delivered a range of measures to assist carers as partners in the provision of care. In particular:</p>

  <p>we have quadrupled the resources available to local authorities to provide for carers;</p>

  <p>we have introduced new legislative rights for carers, and</p>

  <p>we have required local authorities to identify carers and advise them of their right to an assessment.</p>

  <p>I too am concerned about this important issue. I fully recognise the problems of access to dental services in Scotland and that some dentists are withdrawing NHS provision. That is why we are currently taking a fundamental look at the way NHS dental services are provided, including the remuneration system for dentists. The forthcoming response to our dental consultation, which we hope to make shortly, will include further measures to support NHS dentists. In the shorter term, we have already provided &pound;12 million over the past four years towards dental practice improvements, and have introduced a package of recruitment and retention measures (e.g. golden hellos).</p>

  <p>We will target those areas where BT are not enabling exchanges for broadband, as they clearly have no forecast provision. However, this may not necessarily result in exchange upgrades, as potentially any technology or mix of technologies could provide broadband coverage in these areas.</p>

  <p>The number of wage earners in a household is not collected. However, the number of people in paid employment in each household can be estimated from the Labour Force Survey.

  <p>The Third Home Energy Conservation Act Progress Report for Scotland, covering the period April 2001 March 2003 is being compiled at present.

  <p>Pursuing success in global markets is a key theme of the refreshed <em>A Smart, Successful Scotland</em> strategy published last week. We recognise that there is huge potential in China and we are committed to a long-term approach to helping Scotland grasp the opportunities.</p>

  <p>The First Minister made a week-long visit in October to raise Scotland&rsquo;s profile and support the links with China being developed by Scottish businesses and educational bodies like the Scottish Qualifications Agency. I myself will travel to China in January next year to lead a mission of life science companies and deepen our relationships with senior contacts. And given its growing international significance, China will continue to be a priority for future ministerial programmes overseas.</p>

  <p>Tailored assistance for Scottish companies to navigate complex Chinese markets is available from Scottish Development International (SDI). SDI first opened an office in China 10 years ago and now has two bases in Beijing and Shanghai. Firms can also access further support through the wider network of Scottish and UK trade bodies operating in China.</p>

  <p>In 2005 SDI will mount a targeted campaign across Scotland to raise awareness of business opportunities in China. SDI plans to double staff numbers on the ground from four to eight to cope with the expected increase in demand for support.</p>

The number of new and improved homes for social rent and low-cost home ownership approved with funding from Communities Scotland which were completed in the financial years 2001-02 and 2003-04 are as follows.</p>

  <p>The number of completions in an individual year is largely determined by the nature of the projects approved for construction in previous years. Large or complex housing projects, especially when linked to wider regeneration initiatives, will take over a year to be completed and in some instances, there is a time-lag in the recording of this data and these figures can therefore be subject to revision.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Shared ownership enables people who cannot afford outright purchase to buy an equity stake in a property. Sharing owners must also make an occupancy payment to a registered social landlord to obtain exclusive occupancy of that property.</p>

  <p>Shared equity also enables people who cannot afford outright purchase to buy an equity stake in a property. Shared equity differs from shared ownership however because a shared equity owner would not make an occupancy payment to a registered social landlord. A shared equity owner would be expected instead to maximise the use of their available funds towards the purchase of an equity stake in a property. They would therefore be expected to have a larger equity stake in a property than would be the case with shared ownership.</p>

  <p>Allergy management was only recognised as a specialty in 1999. Therefore, at present, treatment is provided by health professionals with an interest in allergies from a variety of specialties and disciplines, chiefly immunology but also respiratory medicine, dermatology, ENT surgery and ophthalmology.</p>

  <p>Between 1999 and 2003, there has been an increase of three consultant immunologists and the latest statistics show no vacancies in this specialty.</p>

  <p>The majority of cases of clinical allergy diagnosis and management are likely to be straightforward and take place appropriately in the primary care setting without referral to secondary care physicians.</p>

  <p>Consultant-led immunology and allergy services are available in Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow with these services also acting as reference centres for other areas.</p>

  <p>Over 90% of patient interaction with the NHS in Scotland starts and ends in primary care.</p>

  <p>What is most important is that people get the right care in the right place. That place should be as local as possible with services as specialised as they need to be. In Fife that is happening on a number of fronts. For example, the one-stop cardiology clinic being developed in St. Andrews; a managed clinical network for cardiac services, and access to new services in primary care through initiatives like specialist nursing care for older people and psychological therapies based in GP practice.</p>

  <p>(b) The Health Protection Agency (HPA) has no remit with regard to HAI in Scotland. The equivalent organisation in Scotland is the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health (SCIEH), which will be subsumed within Health Protection Scotland (HPS) when the latter becomes operational in April 2005. SEHD is leading activity related to the HAI Task Force, and SCIEH is an important source of scientific, technical and epidemiological advice to SEHD and NHSScotland. Discussion is currently taking place about the role of HPS in taking these areas forward in future.</p>

  <p>In response to the Parliament and the Health and Community Care Committee, we have decided that the provisions on retention of organs and transplantation merit a separate Bill.

  <p>Class 34 of Schedule 1 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Scotland) Order 1992 (the GPDO), grants a general planning permission (or permitted development right) for development by railway undertakers or their lessees on their operational land, required in connection with the movement of traffic by rail. Class 34 does cite specific exceptions, including the construction of a railway, hotel, railway station or bridge. The GPDO does not contain a general restriction on the use of these permitted development rights in conservation areas or sites of special scientific interest.</p>

  <p>Permitted development rights generally may be restricted in individual cases and a planning application required as a result. For example, most conservation areas, designated under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) (Scotland) Act 1997, are subject to directions under the GPDO which specify restrictions on classes of permitted development rights particular to the individual conservation area. A further example is where areas are designated Natura Sites under the EC Habitats or Wild Birds Directives. The Conservation (Natural Habitats, &amp;c.) Regulations 1994 contain restrictions on permitted development rights which may have the potential to affect Natura Site qualifying interests. Where a development may be likely to adversely affect the integrity of designated site an appropriate assessment of this a legal necessity. Also, where a project required environmental impact assessment under the planning provisions of the <em>Environmental </em>Impact Assessment (Scotland) Regulations 1999 (Bib. number 4851), then the permitted development rights would not apply and a planning application would be required.</p>

  <p>Over the past two years, the Scottish Executive has invested an additional &pound;16.5 million in the Scottish Ambulance Service enabling it to put 220 more paramedics and technicians on to front line emergency ambulances. This investment has also enabled the service to begin to develop more than 50 community first responder schemes which are designed to augment the paramedic-led emergency service. These initiatives are already leading to significant improvements in the responsiveness of the service to life threatening incidents.</p>

  <p>Drummore is one of a number of communities from which volunteers have come forward in response to the Scottish Ambulance Service&rsquo;s campaign to attract community first responders. I understand that the service plan to begin training the volunteers from Drummore early in the new year.</p>

  <p>These are operational matters for Scottish Water and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. I understand Scottish Water will shortly meet with you to discuss their capital investment process in Argyll and Bute directly.</p>

  <p>In January 2003, ministers established the Quality and Standard 3 project group made up of a range of stakeholders and experts to advise on the extent of the industry&rsquo;s investment requirements. This process has included a range of stakeholders the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, the Drinking Water Quality Regulator, the Water Industry Commissioner and Scottish Water as well as COSLA, Scottish Natural Heritage, Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, Homes for Scotland, CBI, Scottish Consumer Council, Water Customer Consultation Panels, Communities Scotland and various interests across the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>In July 2004, ministers issued a formal consultation<em>, Investing in Water Services 2006-2014</em> (Bib. number 33325) to some 6,000 individual and organisations. This was supported by the Water Customer Consultation Panels hosting a number of seminars throughout Scotland in August for stakeholders to discuss the issues raised in the consultation. In addition, we commissioned research to investigate the attitudes and priorities of Scottish Water&rsquo;s domestic customers.</p>
