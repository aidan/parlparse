  <p>For the next few years, the Central Heating Programme will focus entirely on the most vulnerable households: those lacking any form of central heating. We have already announced that the programme will be extended from 2004 so that 20,000 local authority dwellings can be upgraded from partial central heating systems to whole-house systems. The programme may be further widened thereafter and we will carefully consider the scope of any such extension so that help goes to those who need it most.</p>

  <p><u>Aims</u></p>

  <p>To promote the reduction of abuse or neglect of children, and to improve the services for children who experience abuse or neglect.</p>

  <p><u>Remit</u></p>

  <p>To review, throughout Scotland, the practice of medical, nursing, social work, police, children&#146;s reporters&#146;, education and other public, voluntary and private sector staff to examine how well these:</p>

  <p>identify those children who may be being abused or neglected;</p>

  <p>reduce such abuse and neglect;</p>

  <p>meet these children&#146;s needs, and</p>

  <p>make plans for the future well being of these children.</p>

  <p>To review how well agencies work together and public and professional confidence in these services.</p>

  <p>To review how well professionals work together and public and professional confidence in the way they work.</p>

  <p>To identify best practice.</p>

  <p>To learn lessons from international developments in this field.</p>

  <p>To report and make recommendations to improve professional working and the regulatory framework in which professionals operate.</p>

  <p><u>Consultation</u></p>

  <p>A letter seeking the views and comments of individuals and agencies involved in child protection will shortly be sent out. In addition a website is to be launched that, as well as providing information on the review, will offer anyone the opportunity to have their say. The review team is also carrying out a number of initiatives, in partnership with voluntary agencies, designed at getting the views of children and parents. A consultative group has been formed that represents a wide range of statutory and voluntary agencies involved in child protection in Scotland. The review team is carrying out individual discussions with experts in child protection and children and parents will be consulted as part of the audit.</p>

  <p>Figures published in the <i>Scottish Climate Change Programme </i> (available on the Executive's website at www.scotland.gov.uk/library3/environment/ccm.pdf) show that Scottish emissions of greenhouse gases fell by 3% over the period 1990-98.

  <p>Direct comparisons between emissions in England and Scotland must take account of factors such as differences in geography and energy mix. For example, Scottish emissions from the energy sector rose between 1990 and 1998 in contrast to those in England where they fell. This can be attributed mainly to increased Scottish exports of electricity to England (an activity which supports Scottish jobs) and to the significant shift from coal to gas generation in England over that period.</p>

  <p>Measures in place, and planned through the <i>Scottish Climate Change Programme </i>(available online at www.scotland.gov.uk/library3/environment/ccm.pdf) and awareness raising initiatives, including our do a little: change a lot campaign (www.dochange.net), will ensure that Scotland makes an equitable contribution to the UK Kyoto commitment.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to supporting carers and we are already making a difference to the lives of many. Under the <i>Carers Strategy</i> , we have doubled the resources available to local authorities to support carers, including the provision of advice and information as well as more practical support. From this April authorities are also receiving additional funds, over the next three years, to increase significantly the availability of short break services, benefiting many more carers and the people they care for.</p>

  <p>The Community Care and Health Bill, currently before Parliament, will increase the rights of carers to an assessment of their support needs. The Bill also proposes to extend the availability of direct payments to all client groups and to place a duty on local authorities to offer direct payments as an element in the overall package of care. Increased access to direct payments will inevitably benefit many people requiring support and their carers, particularly when it comes to purchasing short breaks. Guidance from the Executive will accompany the Bill, covering a range of issues affecting carers.</p>

  <p>Information from the Scottish Misuse Database indicates an increase in the last five years in reported use among new clients attending drug services. In 1996-97, 78 (2.1%) of people under 25 attending services reported cocaine as one of their drugs of use. By 2000-01 this figure had risen to 231 (4.8%).</p>

  <p>Several serious medical problems can be associated with cocaine misuse, including increased risks of myocardial infarctions and stroke. Other problems can include paranoia and psychosis, damage to nasal passages, hypertension, increased body temperature and agitated delirium. Intravenous use carries all the health risks associated with injecting illegal drugs. Smoking crack cocaine can lead to lung damage and chest pain.</p>

  <p>The Executive has introduced a number of measures aimed at improving access to procurement opportunities. A website, www.scotland.gov.uk/procurement, was launched in November 1999. The site provides information on the types of goods and services the Executive procures and guidance for those wishing to sell to the Executive. In 2000, the Executive introduced an online &quot;business enquiry&quot; service (available through the website above). The business enquiry service provides an easy way for potential suppliers to register their interest in selling to the Executive.</p>

  <p>Also, UK ministers recently announced that bidders for Government contracts were no longer to be required to have three years audited financial accounts and were no longer to be required to assume unlimited liability in all cases.

  <p>The Scottish Management and Enterprise Council has received support from the Scottish Executive to map the current provision of management development training in Scotland as an aid to employers and individuals, including small- and medium-sized enterprises.</p>

  <p>Scottish Equity Partners continues to manage the two venture capital schemes - Scottish Equity Partnership and Scottish Technology Fund (TSF) - set up by Scottish Development Finance as joint Public/Private Partnership. Both funds have now been substantially invested. Together with evaluation of a range of other public sector supported funds (Business Growth Fund, Eastern Scotland Investments, Strathclyde Investment Partnership) the current evaluation of STF will provide a basis for any future decisions on public sector investment in this area.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Court Service is committed to providing full access to the courts where possible. However, the court estate is varied in age, scale and condition. Around 85% of the estate is listed. It is inevitable that there will be some areas where the court buildings cannot be made fully accessible due to insurmountable planning or technical constraints.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, earlier this year, the Scottish Court Service appointed the Joint Mobility Unit, a specialist access consultant, to provide a comprehensive and detailed audit to establish the current compliance of the court estate with the Disability Discrimination Act. The results of the audit will inform plans for future investment in the estate to ensure compliance with the Act by the implementation date in October 2004.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&#146;s Housing Research Programme has commissioned a study of mortgage arrears and repossessions. The research, which is currently at the fieldwork stage, is collecting details of repossession cases from a sample of court records in 1994 and 2000. The study is also exploring, through questionnaires and interviews, the experiences of people who have had serious arrears or have had their houses repossessed, and the policies and practices of lenders.</p>

  <p>The study is due for completion in spring 2002.</p>

  <p>Court procedures are regulated by the court and not by the Executive.</p>

  <p>However, I understand that a review of small claim procedure in the sheriff court by the Sheriff Court Rules Council has just been completed and that new procedure rules are being proposed. The approval of new rules is a matter for the Court of Session under section 32 of the Sheriff Courts (Scotland) Act 1971.</p>

  <p>In the Sheriff Court, rights of audience are generally restricted to the parties themselves or their legal representative, unless specific provision has been made in the primary legislation. The Mortgage Rights (Scotland) Act makes no specific provision for lay representation.</p>

  <p>The approach taken in the Act requires that statutory notices to the debtor draw attention to the advisability of getting legal and other advice (such as advice on debt management). This should ensure that households facing mortgage repossession action secure appropriate advice and support at an early stage to help find a way through their difficulties and ultimately get back on their feet.</p>

  <p>Statistics on this matter are not collected for the High Court. Since 1995, there have been six Sheriff Court applications to have evidence taken on commission under section 271. All of these were granted. It is not known how many of them related to child witnesses.</p>

  <p>No, although the Executive intends to undertake research in connection with its forthcoming consultation paper on vulnerable witnesses. This will try to establish how often the measures available to assist such witnesses under section 271 are used, and the reasons for this. It is for the prosecution and defence to decide whether to make an application under section 271 in an individual case, and for the court to decide whether to grant such an application.</p>

  <p>The Executive considers reports of the Scottish Law Commission as a whole. As I have previously explained, the report recommended that it was not necessary to introduce legislation either to reform or restate the existing law on boundary walls. The Executive supports this view and does not plan to take any action in this area.</p>

  <p>The <strong> </strong> 1996-97 information is not directly comparable with that for later years due to differences in the way the information is collected. Gross expenditure on services for adults with mental health problems increased by &#163;15 million between 1997-98 and 1999-2000.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is strongly committed to improving the extent of commercialisation of research, as detailed in the:</p>

  <p><i>Report of the Knowledge Economy Taskforce</i>, published in April 1999:</p>

  <p>(http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library/documents-w9/knec-00.htm);</p>

  <p>the <i>Knowledge Economy Cross-Cutting Initiative Report</i> :</p>

  <p>(http://www.scotland.gov.uk/government/ketf_ccr.pdf), published in February 2001, and</p>

  <p><i>A Science Strategy for Scotland</i> (http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library3/education/ssfs-00.asp) published in August 2001. The Scottish Executive&#146;s survey <i>Intellectual Property Commercialisation in the Scottish Higher Education Sector</i>, published in August 2001, indicates that the sector has already made encouraging moves in this direction, with most universities now having established technology transfer offices (http://www.scotland.gov.uk/who/elld/reports/finalreport.asp).</p>

  <p>Commercialisation is supported by a variety of publicly funded initiatives, with our intention being to provide a pipeline of support at every stage along the path from university laboratory to full-scale production. These include the Scottish Enterprise/Royal Society of Edinburgh Enterprise Fellowships, Scottish Enterprise's Proof of Concept Fund; and the Executive&#146;s SMART, SPUR and TCS schemes, all of which have been started or enhanced since 1999. Last year, the Scottish Institute for Enterprise was established, with &#163;4 million funding from the UK Department of Trade and Industry to provide opportunities for scientists and potential scientific entrepreneurs to obtain the necessary management and business skills. It was recently awarded a further &#163;2 million to expand its work.</p>

  <p>In my annual guidance letter last year, I encouraged the Scottish Higher Education (SHEFC) Funding Council to continue its work in promoting commercialisation and to ensure that funding streams reflected this. As a result, SHEFC has set up a new Knowledge Transfer Grant of around &#163;6 million per year, and a joint SHEFC and Scottish Enterprise working group has also been established to consider how the two organisations can achieve greater complementarity in their policies for promoting commercialisation and innovation.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will detail (a) the inspection schedule for manhole covers on the M8 by the trunk road contractors; (b) the criteria to determine whether a manhole cover on a trunk road is inspected, and (c) the design standards for manhole covers on trunk roads.</p>

  <p>The inspection schedule for the M8 motorway, which is unchanged from the previous trunk road contracts, covers all inventory items, including manhole covers. The trunk road contract requires that a safety inspection is undertaken every seven days with a further safety patrol undertaken every seven days between safety inspections. Detailed inspections are carried out annually to establish programmes of routine maintenance operations not requiring urgent execution.</p>

  <p>British Standard BS EN 124 refers to current design standards for new manholes and is covered in the manual of <i>Contract Documents for Highway Works &#150; Volume 1</i>, <i>Specification for Highway Works &#150; Clause 507 &#150; Chambers and Volume 3</i> and <i>Highway Construction Details</i>.</p>

  <p>The funding arrangements that exist between local authorities and voluntary organisations are a matter for the parties concerned. However, the Scottish Executive is committed to encouraging other funders to work towards a stable funding environment for the voluntary sector and its indicative three-year financial settlements for local authorities will make it easier for them, in turn, to offer three-year funding to voluntary groups.</p>

  <p>As part of the Executive&#146;s review of its funding for the voluntary sector, we intend to look at whether it is possible for all funders of the sector, including local authorities, to work together to ensure that they are operating in way that meets their own needs and the needs of the sector.</p>
