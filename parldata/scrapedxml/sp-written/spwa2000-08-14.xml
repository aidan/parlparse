  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-8323 by Sarah Boyack on 12 July 2000, whether it holds any information on the percentage of households which own one or more cars as opposed to those which have regular use of a car; if so, what percentage of households owned one or more cars in each year from 1988 to date and, on the basis of current projections, when the percentage of households owning one or more cars will reach 70%.</p>

  <p>The only information held on household car ownership comes from the Scottish Household Survey, which started last year.</p>

  <p>The table below gives the latest information that is available. Because, for some purposes, vans are counted with cars, the table provides figures for vans as well as cars. The table shows separately all the types of ownership recorded by the survey. Each household is counted in the highest relevant category &#8211; for example, one with a privately-owned van and a company car would be counted under &quot;privately-owned van&quot;.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not have projections of household car ownership in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Ministers fully recognise the importance of the cashmere industry to the Borders and the potential impact on it of US punitive import tariffs. The Scottish Executive is working closely with Scottish Trade International, the Scotland Office, the Department of Trade and Industry and the sector itself to deal with the threat.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) has produced seven guidelines setting out best practice for the care and treatment of people with diabetes. These guidelines are currently under review. An updated diabetes guideline will be published next year. SIGN is funded by the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>Over 90% of GPs in Scotland provide a Chronic Disease Management Programme for diabetes. The requirements for this include the setting up of a register for all patients with diabetes; a call and recall system; education of all newly diagnosed patients, continuing education for diabetics, individual management plan, clinical procedures, professional links, referral policies, record-keeping and clinical audit.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is working to ensure that all health boards put in place a register of patients with diabetes to support the provision of a comprehensive diabetes service. Guidance on registers is due to be issued later this year.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>Source: SMR01.</p>

  <p>ISD Scotland reference HCIU 2000/1008.</p>

  <p>Data for the year ending 31 March 2000 are provisional. Data completion varies from one health board to another.</p>

  <p>SMR01 includes inpatient and day case discharges from non-obstetric non-psychiatric specialties in NHS hospitals in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Diseases recorded using the World Health Organisation&#8217;s International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD10). Diabetes defined as ICD10 E10-E14 (Diabetes Mellitus). SMR01 records up to six ICD10 diagnostic codes in each discharge record. The table above is based on the presence of a diabetes mellitus code in any of the diagnostic fields.</p>

  <p>Operations recorded using the Office of Populations Censuses &amp; Surveys 4th Revision Classification of Surgical Operations &amp; Procedures (OPCS4). Amputations defined as OPCS4 X07-X12.1. SMR01 records up to four operations (in the form of four pairs of OPCS4 codes). The table above is based on the presence of an amputation code in any of the four operation fields.</p>

  <p>The same patient may be admitted to hospital several times over the course of a year and will be counted each time. In addition, a patient may undergo more than one operation during a single visit to theatre. The table counts the numbers of operations performed.</p>

  <p>Greater Glasgow Health Board (GGHB) received a number of tertiary referrals from other health boards, particularly Argyll &amp; Clyde Health and Lanarkshire. This contributed to the excess numbers observed for GGHB for 1997-98 and 1998-99. The reduction in activity for 1999-2000 relates principally to incomplete data for the 1999-2000 financial year in the Glasgow Acute Trusts.</p>

  <p>The Paths for All Partnership was set up by Scottish Natural Heritage with the aim of achieving a significant increase in well-managed access provision close to where people live. An independent evaluation carried out last year of the first three years of the initiative concluded that the Partnership was fulfilling its remit and successfully pursuing its objectives. The Partnership, which has secured core funding for the next three years, is currently developing its strategy for the period 2000-03. I see &quot;Paths for All&quot; playing an important role in the provision of facilities to enable people to exercise the proposed new right of responsible access, particularly around the areas where they live.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will give the scientific basis for the issue of a licence by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency for the use of Calicide (Tefluburozuron) on salmon farms to control sea lice.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-08-14.13.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80134" speakername="Sarah Boyack" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa0814.htm#8133">

  <p>Calicide is the trade name given to a medicine used to treat sea lice infestations on farmed salmon grown in marine fish cages. The active ingredient in Calicide is teflubenzuron, a chitinase inhibitor which acts by inhibiting the formation of chitin in the exoskeleton of insects and crustacea. It affects the moulting stages of these organisms and therefore is effective in treating sea lice particularly when they are progressing through the various juvenile growth stages.</p>

  <p>It is administered to the fish by coating the fish feed. As the compound is then subsequently discharged to the marine environment via fish faeces or any uneaten food pellets, it constitutes part of the trade effluent discharged from the fish farm premises and must be authorised by a consent if the fish farm operator is to avoid contravening section 30F of the Control of Pollution Act 1974. To obtain a consent, a fish farmer must submit an application to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency.</p>

  <p>Calicide is an authorised fish medicine, having been through a rigorous assessment by the Veterinary Medicines Directorate of its general safety (including consumer, environment and operator safety) and its efficacy as a sea lice treatment. The manufacturer is obliged to carry out a full ecotoxicological risk assessment and submit a detailed safety case demonstrating compliance with all aspects before a marketing authorisation is issued. It is this process which is generally referred to when medicines are labelled as being &quot;licensed&quot; or not.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency approached the setting of consent conditions for Calicide according to the recognised method. It is based on risk management, and began with the Agency&#8217;s own ecotoxicological risk assessment, using data from both laboratory and field experiments requested from the manufacturers to derive a safe environmental concentration (often referred to as an environmental quality standard). The derivation of the environmental quality standard involved the identification of the most susceptible species through screening a range of marine animals, establishing the concentration of chemical at which there is no observable toxic effect, then applying a further safety factor to achieve the standard. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency then commissioned the Water Research Centre to carry out a peer review of this assessment. The agency accepted changes proposed by the centre.</p>

  <p>The agency then used predictive modelling techniques to estimate the limits which must be imposed on a particular discharge to prevent the environmental quality standard being breached. Restrictions have been placed on the quantity of Calicide which can be used in any particular treatment. The treatment method relies on the concept of a mixing zone (often now referred to as an &quot;allowable zone&quot; of effects) within which it is accepted that standards may be exceeded.</p>

  <p>In this way the Scottish Environment Protection Agency has endeavoured to protect the environment from significant harm and in doing so protect species which are exploited commercially by &quot;capture&quot; fishing techniques. The site-by-site discharge consent complements the Veterinary Medicine Directorate&#8217;s general marketing authorisation approach.</p>

  <p>I view the alleged discharge to the marine environment of chemicals which have not been subject to the assessment procedures of the Veterinary Medicines Directorate and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency with considerable concern. The practice is illegal and may pose considerable risk of damage to marine ecosystems.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency has issued warnings to the industry of the dangers to the environment and the likely risk to the industry&#8217;s reputation should these allegations be substantiated. It has stated its intention to investigate allegations vigorously and instigate enforcement action where clear evidence of a breach of the legislation exists.</p>

  <p>The agency has investigated several reports of the use of unlicensed chemicals to date. In 1998, following such investigations, a salmon-farming company in Shetland was fined &pound;1,000 at Lerwick Sheriff Court for discharging Deosan Deosect, a compound used to treat horses and poultry. In this case the agency detected residues in mussels growing nearby and established that the chemical had been supplied to the company by a veterinary surgeon. A number of other investigations are ongoing at present.</p>

  <p>The agency has also begun a programme of screening for such residues. This involves its officers visiting fish farm premises unannounced and taking samples of fish from the cages or mussels growing close by for analysis.</p>

  <p>: I announced a list of new proposed Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) on 14 June ( <i>Official Report</i> , 14 June 2000, question S1W-7913). Among those sites, the following were proposed for the protection of freshwater fish:</p>

  <p>I indicated when I made that announcement that I was open to consideration of scientific evidence about any exceptions to the completeness of the list. I am awaiting further advice from Scottish Natural Heritage on this matter.</p>

  <p>I trust that the proposed SAC designation of some Scottish rivers will be viewed as a positive move, with local interests, including District Salmon Fisheries Boards, working together to manage the sites for their conservation interests - as is happening already on the River Spey.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what environmental benefits, in terms of air quality improvements and reduced greenhouse gas emissions may be expected from the introduction of liquid petroleum gas as a fuel in rural areas and what assessment has been made of the environmental benefit if the budget to support conversion and infrastructure were instead spent on measures in urban areas.</p>

  <p>Information on the environmental benefits of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) powered vehicles is given on page 57 of <i>Alternative Fuels &#8211; An Assessment of the Emissions Performance of Alternative and Conventional Fuels</i> published by the Cleaner Vehicles Task Force in January 2000, a copy of which is available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. no. 7656). This demonstrates that LPG vehicles will offer most benefits to air quality when they are used in urban areas. However, the climate change benefits that LPG vehicles bring, through reduced carbon dioxide emissions, are the same in rural areas as they are in urban areas.</p>

  <p>The Executive takes a variety of measures in urban areas designed to improve air quality and contribute to climate change objectives. For example, the Public Transport Fund is assisting local authorities to provide alternative choices to car use and tackle problems of congestion. Of the &pound;58 million allocated so far from the first two rounds, over &pound;35 million has been allocated for projects in the four major Scottish cities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive promotes the use of alternative fuels through its funding of the Energy Savings Trust&#8217;s &quot;Powershift&quot; cleaner vehicle fuels programme and is currently reviewing funding for Powershift with particular reference to motorists in the Highlands and Islands. Powershift can provide a grant of up to 75% of the cost of converting a vehicle to LPG, which on average is around &pound;1,500 for a private car. It is estimated that converting from LPG to petrol can save a motorist around &pound;700 per year in fuel costs on an annual mileage of 12,000 miles. In addition the scope of the Rural Petrol Stations Grant Scheme has been extended to include for the installation of tanks and dispensers for the supply of LPG.</p>

  <p>: The Scottish Office incurred running costs of &pound;170,533 in responding to the <i>Braer</i> incident in January 1993 but did not make any financial contributions to third parties. The total Government claim in respect of Braer was &pound;3.5 million but this was withdrawn in 1999. No payments in respect of other incidents have been made.</p>

Railtrack recently submitted an application for a Freight Facilities Grant for the line. This is being appraised.

  <p>Data about injury road accidents are collected by the police and reported to the Scottish Executive using the STATS 19 statistical report form. These returns cover only road accidents in which one or more people were injured: they do not cover damage-only accidents.</p>

  <p>The table below gives the numbers of road accidents which were identified in the STATS 19 returns as occurring on the A811 between its junction with the A81 and the centre of Stirling over the period 1995 to 1999 inclusive.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that the statistics given below are based upon the data which are held in the central statistical database and which were collected by the police at the time of the accident and subsequently reported to the Executive. They may differ from any figures which the local authority would provide now, because they do not take account of any subsequent changes or corrections that the local authority may have made to the statistical information, for use at local level, about the location of each accident, based upon its knowledge of the road and area concerned.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is aware that Angus and Dundee City Councils as the local roads authorities are upgrading this route by means of a Public/Private Partnership project. I understand that prospective bidders for the contract have been invited through the Official Journal of the European Community (OJEC) notice of 7 July to take part in a prequalification process which is required under EC regulations. Bidders who apply at this stage will be assessed for their suitability to undertake the project before a short list is compiled and tender documents issued in October.</p>

  <p>In accordance with UK national standards, a General Inspection of the bridge is made every two years and a Principal Inspection, which is a close examination of all inspectable parts of the structure, will be carried out at intervals not exceeding six years. This work is undertaken for the concessionaire by an independent firm of suitably experienced consulting engineers. The Principal Inspection report is also required to be certified by the bridge designer.</p>

  <p>In addition, superficial inspections are undertaken at quarterly intervals by bridge staff who are required to bring any obvious deficiencies to the attention of the consulting engineers and the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>The recent Scottish Health Advisory Service (SHAS) report covers the findings of the investigating team that visited the State Hospital in January 2000. The report acknowledges the many significant improvements made within the hospital since SHAS last visited in 1994. Those areas where SHAS pointed to the need for improvement are areas which were also covered by the Mental Welfare Commission in their report of the Inquiry into the care and treatment of Noel Ruddle.</p>

  <p>As I announced when I presented the Mental Welfare Commission Report to Parliament on 30 March, the Chairman of the State Hospitals Board has been asked to establish a programme of change to address the commission&#8217;s findings and recommendations, and report to me in September on the progress that has been made.</p>

  <p>I know that when I met with the Mental Welfare Commission on 26 June that they were pleased with the measures taken to date and future plans. If these future plans require additional resources, then that is something which we shall consider.</p>

  <p>The care and treatment of people with the dual diagnosis specified is in most areas tackled through close co-operation between substance abuse services and general adult psychiatry services. Substance abuse services are generally an integral part of wider mental health services. Some areas - for example, Ayrshire and Arran &#8211; provide units and beds dedicated to the treatment of people with dual diagnosis. The extent to which services are integrated is determined by local need. Health boards, working with NHS Trusts, are responsible for assessing local health needs and for providing services to meet them.</p>

  <p>There is no maximum permitted level for chlorine in the Water Supply (Water Quality) (Scotland) Regulations 1990. The World Health Organisation guideline value for chlorine in drinking water is five milligrammes per litre but most individuals can detect chlorine at concentrations of between 0.6 and 1.0 milligrammes per litre. Levels above this range will begin to cause taste and odour problems. None of the regulatory samples taken by East of Scotland Water during 1999 exceeded the taste and odour standards set in the 1990 Regulations. <br /></p>
