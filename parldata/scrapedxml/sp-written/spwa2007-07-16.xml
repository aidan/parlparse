  <p>It is not the case that our events strategy is any more separate from our tourism strategy than it has ever been; they will continue to be very closely linked as essential drivers of sustainable economic growth. The fact that our tourism policy, and our strategy on major events, both important aspects of growing Scotland&rsquo;s economy, are now in complementary ministerial portfolios, does not inhibit that linkage. EventScotland continues to be an integral part of VisitScotland, but we want our major events strategy to work more closely in supporting the promotion of Scotland as a nation, external affairs, and sports and cultural policy as well as supporting strong tourism growth.</p>

  <p>I am considering how best the Executive can support how the courts deal with cases of alleged domestic abuse. I will take into account the independent evaluation of the pilot court in Glasgow Sheriff Court and also the progressive implementation of summary justice reform.</p>

  <p>The pilot court has brought a range of benefits to victims and families. At the same time, the research does not recommend simple replication of the Glasgow model. It stresses the need for local solutions to meet local needs.</p>

  <p>Domestic abuse touches on portfolios of several Cabinet Secretaries and, together, we are committed to finding a way forward which:</p>

  <p>reflects the seriousness of domestic abuse as a crime and sends a strong message of zero tolerance;</p>

  <p>capitalises on the learning of the pilot;</p>

  <p>provides adequate and timely support to victims of domestic abuse and their children, who can often be the unseen &quot;victims&quot; of this crime;</p>

  <p>respects the discretion of the judiciary to organise court business as they see fit;</p>

  <p>recognises that court-based action is one of a range of measures for combating domestic abuse which must be fully integrated and mutually supportive, and</p>

  <p>is affordable and sustainable for the long-term.</p>

  <p>We will announce our conclusions shortly.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive undertakes an annual teacher workforce planning exercise with the aim broadly to balance supply and demand at a national level and produce sufficient teachers to fill vacancies, not only at the start of term in August but also those emerging during the year ahead because of the normal turnover of staff.</p>

  <p>In previous years, surveys by the General Teaching Council for Scotland have found that around 90% of newly qualified teachers are working in schools by the autumn term and the Teacher Census shows the vast majority of them are working in August/September.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers have a close interest in the preparations for the launch of the Gaelic digital channel. Ofcom has a key role in monitoring the Gaelic Media Service (GMS) and the operation of the digital service. An Ofcom working group which includes the BBC, GMS, Scottish Executive, Scotland Office and DCMS meets regularly to discuss progress towards launch of the channel. This group was established to oversee the development of the channel. This arrangement will be revisited when the Gaelic digital channel is operational.</p>

  <p>This is primarily a matter for NHS boards. To encourage them to develop integrated pain services in their area, we issued the <em>McEwan Report</em> in December 2004 under cover of <em>Health Department Letter (2004)48</em> (HDL), which described the report as providing a helpful framework within which pain services can be enhanced. The HDL commended the report to boards, and asked them to give particular consideration to local issues in respect of the services they provide for chronic pain.</p>

  <p>We also expect boards to be familiar with the best practice statement on the management of chronic pain in adults issued by NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (QIS) in February 2006.</p>

  <p>NHS QIS has been following up both the <em>McEwan Report</em> and its best practice statement by means of a benchmarking exercise intended to establish the current adult chronic pain services across primary, secondary and tertiary care. The report on that exercise should be published in the near future and we will work with NHS QIS on the best way of taking forward the priority actions in that report.</p>

  <p>The question refers to integrated services, and we would encourage boards to investigate the pain Managed Clinical Network approach being developed by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde.</p>

  <p>The network will be responsible for implementing best practice and quality standards in the provision of chronic pain services, and developing patient pathways. As with all Managed Clinical Networks, the Scottish Government would be keen to spread the lessons learned, to enable the development of similar networks in other NHS board areas.</p>

  <p>Based on the numbers currently in post and on estimates of expected retirals gathered through local and national workforce planning surveys, there are sufficient GPs in post and in training to meet the demands of NHS boards in Scotland. New and extended roles, such as those of community practitioner nurse prescriber, nurse independent prescriber and community pharmacist will free up GP time for even greater patient care but are not specifically intended to compensate for retirals. The number of GP training places required is considered annually as part of the workforce planning process.</p>

NHS Quality Improvement Scotland provides advice on technologies assessed by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. The SMC and NICE consider cost-effectiveness information alongside the clinical and patient benefits. Net cost per QALY gained is one factor in the decision making process.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether there will be provision in the long-term conditions toolkit action plans for managed care networks to cover long-term conditions such as inflammatory arthritis, including ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis, and, if so, what the timescales are for the establishment of such networks.</p>

  <p>The toolkit is meant to promote the improvement of services locally, according to the prioritised needs of each locality. The development of Managed Care Networks for the conditions mentioned would be one of the possible vehicles for service redesign, and would be consistent with the thinking in HDL(2007)21 on strengthening the role of Managed Clinical Networks. It highlights the role of Managed Care Networks in promoting integration of services across the health and local authority sectors.</p>

  <p>We shall therefore keep this point in mind when considering the Action Plans derived from CHPs&rsquo; completion of the long-term conditions toolkit.</p>

  <p>As I outlined in my statement in the Chamber on 6 June, I have instructed the board of NHS Lanarkshire to review their original plans and to produce revised proposals that will enable accident and emergency services to continue at the three main hospital sites in the region. I have been clear that, as far as possible within the resources available to the board, I want them to retain their primary care and community development programmes.</p>

  <p>I recognise that there are many issues to address, for example relating to clinical workload and staffing. I want these challenges to be faced up to in a way that puts patients first and is innovative.</p>

  <p>It is now a matter for the board to determine how best to deliver these services and to produce proposals. Their proposals will then undergo a process of independent scrutiny, following which I expect to take a decision by the turn of the year.</p>

  <p>National Services Scotland (NSS) is given an annual capital allocation of c.&pound;5 million to meet minor capital requirements across all its internal divisions. All further capital funding is by way of additional allocation from the Health Department for specific projects.

  <p>The funding shown for SNBTS, the Protein Fractionation Centre (PFC) and Alba Bioscience (Alba) has therefore been made available from the minor capital fund allocated to NSS.</p>

  <p>Good progress is being made in most local authority areas in developing common housing registers (CHRs). There are operational CHRs in 10 local authority areas and 11 further areas expect their CHR to be operational later in 2007-08.</p>

  <p>Every local authority in Scotland has received funding to support CHR development, either through the Modernising Government Fund (2001) or the CHR programme (2004-07). Recently funding was awarded to allow the Scottish Housing Best Value Network to operate a CHR support service during 2007-08, providing practical advice and assistance to all social landlords.</p>

  <p>Under the historic-based system for Single Farm Payments adopted in Scotland, no payments have been made in respect of deer farming because it was an unsupported sector during the 2000-02 reference period. While it is possible to fund entitlements to Single Farm Payments for deer farmers from the National Reserve using Article 42(5) of EC Regulation 1782/2003, this must be justified in terms of avoiding land abandonment and/or compensating specific disadvantages for farmers. Until recently the National Reserve was operated on a UK basis, but following the June Agriculture Council it should be possible to operate the National Reserve separately in Scotland.</p>
