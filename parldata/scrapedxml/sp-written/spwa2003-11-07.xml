  <p>The Executive&#8217;s relocation policy does not target rural areas and therefore does not use a definition of rural.</p>

  <p>In 2002, the Executive announced a new strand of its relocation policy covering small location-independent units of work. It does not, however, propose to adopt a rigid definition of &quot;rural&quot; in applying the small units policy. Posts might be relocated to small communities across Scotland where employment opportunities are harder to find. As with the main relocation policy, decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis. Our expectation is that the locations benefiting from this initiative will generally be remote from Scotland&#8217;s main conurbations and the economic opportunities they provide.</p>

  <p>The Executive recommends to the bodies undertaking relocation reviews that the highest weighting of 50% is allocated to socio-economic factors which is a measure of its determination to assist disadvantaged areas in Scotland.</p>

  <p>In carrying out location reviews potential location areas are based on an analysis of key location criteria such as social and economic considerations, business efficiency (including the position of staff), sustainable transport links/accessibility, and property availability/suitability.</p>

  <p>The socio-economic factors which may be considered include employment, under-employment and unemployment levels, economic activity, the Index of Area Deprivation and the level of public sector employment.</p>

  <p>The doctors retainer scheme helps to re-introduce general practitioners back into general practice following a career break. GP retainees are employed by suitable training practices as assistants and can work up to four half day sessions per week. The retainer scheme can last for a period of up to five years following which time the retainee is expected to consider becoming a GP principal.</p>

  <p>There is also the golden hello scheme which aims to attract newly qualified GPs into general practices and also GPs wishing to return to general practice following a career break. The scheme offers a range of incentive payments.</p>

  <p>For other grades of doctors who are in training, they would approach the Postgraduate Dean of Director of Postgraduate General Practice, who would provide career advice and, subject to available funding, these doctors would be placed in supernumeracy placements to regain confidence and then compete with other doctors to enter a training programme of their choice.</p>

  <p>For consultants, they would approach their Postgraduate Dean and, dependant on how long the doctor has been out of practice, would be placed on a programme to re-orientate them back into practice.</p>

  <p>Funding is available under the terms of the doctors retainer scheme which is aimed at re-introducing GPs back into general practice following a career break. Retainees receive a salary from their employing practice who in turn are re-imbursed, currently at the rate of &#163;53.80 per half day. The retainee also receives an annual retainer fee of &#163;300 to help meet the costs of educational courses and subscription to medical journals.</p>

  <p>The golden hello scheme is designed to attract newly qualified GPs into general practice and also GPs returning to general practice by offering a package of incentive payments. Under the terms of the scheme GPs can receive a payment of &#163;5,000 on taking up a new post. Further payments of between &#163;2,500 and &#163;7,500 are also available if the post is in a remote and rural are or a deprived area of Scotland.</p>

  <p>For doctors in training or doctors who are fully qualified, they would normally approach their Postgraduate Dean or Director of Postgraduate General Practice Education who would, subject to available funding through NHS Education for Scotland, arrange training or placements on an individual basis.</p>

  <p>There are no present plans to introduce the Public Concern at Work whistle-blowing toolkit into NHS Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Partnership Information Network (PIN) issued a PIN Guideline prepared by the service for the service in January last year entitled &quot;Dealing with Employee Concerns&quot;.</p>

  <p>This partnership prepared document includes guidance and a model freedom of speech policy. NHSScotland employers are required to meet or exceed the guideline. It is intended to review the PIN Guidelines every two years to ensure they keep pace with recognised good employment practice.</p>

  <p>We have advised Inverclyde Council that the invitation to submit a business case in response to the indicative offer of revenue support we made last year for a public private partnership project of the order of &#163;80 million remains open. The Executive currently supports only one public private partnership model, but is evaluating a variation of that model which is being piloted by Argyll and Bute Council.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no plans to publish a specific strategy for visually or hearing impaired people. It is, however, extending the principles set out in <em>Fair for All</em> across the NHS to ensure that health services recognise and respond sensitively to an individual&#8217;s needs, background and life circumstances. The needs of these specific groups will also be included in an initiative which I launched with the Disability Rights Commission on 3 November.</p>
