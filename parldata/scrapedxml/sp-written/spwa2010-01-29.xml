The findings resulted in a continuation of the programme based on the success identified in formal assessment and evaluation.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="en" xml:lang="en">The main external monitoring processes of Determined to Succeed (the government&rsquo;s Enterprise in Education strategy) are through an annual reporting cycle arrangement for local authorities linked directly to ring-fenced funding commitments and plans. Assessment and evaluation of the strategy is also supplemented through local authority visits and discussions led by Senior Advisers in the National Determined to Succeed team. This consists of standardised reporting and a collation of trends, high points and areas for development in a collated analysis of local authority progress reports. The focus of analysis is directly related to the Determined to Succeed Policy Expectations for Local Authority Delivery 2008-2011.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="en" xml:lang="en">Internally within local authorities quality improvement and quality assurance strategies will also formulate analysis based on progress towards relevant elements within the single outcome agreements. Enterprise in Education Quality Indicators developed by HMIe within the &quot;How good is our school&quot; suite of indictors, facilitate reflection on recognised standards and identification of future priorities. Furthermore, within a class or school department, use of the Determined to Succeed <br /> Self-evaluation tool is a key resource for self-evaluation and future development planning.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="en" xml:lang="en">Other elements of the Determined to Succeed strategy are evaluated in formal research reporting including Work Experience and Virtual Work Experience where research reports have resulted in recommendations for improvement. Other elements of the programme including engagement of work related learning and partnership working with colleges and other training providers has been subject to focussed reports by HMIe such as <em>Working Out</em> and <em>Improving Enterprise in Education.</em></span></p>

  <p><span lang="en" xml:lang="en">It is well recognised that the Determined to Succeed strategy has been a success in implementing enterprise education within the curriculum in all schools and education settings.</span></p>
