  <p>The improvements announced by Lord Sewel on 23 March 1999 came into effect on 31 March and remain part of the scheme. There was a very large surge in applications, which far exceeded the limits of the scheme. Accordingly, following consultations with the industry, I announced on 16 November that applications relating to new measures made available from 31 March 1999 and projects relating to self-standing systems for the storage and disposal of farm waste would be given priority.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive recognises the serious difficulties presently facing the Scottish pig industry and the impact which this is having on employment both on farm and in the processing sector. It has taken a number of measures to strengthen the marketing position of the industry and despite the very tight EU pigs regime and State Aid constraints which severely limit the scope for providing any direct aid is exploring every avenue to assist the sector.</p>

  <p>The Executive has no target percentage for private funding in the higher and further education sectors. As autonomous bodies, the institutions themselves are free to attract private funding as they wish.

  <p>No reductions have been made to the benefits provided under either scheme. Pension recipients received a 3.2% cost of living increase in April 1999.</p>

  <p>Actual expenditure is demand-driven with the trend upwards as the schemes become more mature. The figures for annual budget baselines, which are for payments less contributions received, can and do vary significantly from year to year. The main reasons are changes in the numbers retiring, where the lump sum payable at the point of retirement is a significant factor, changes in contribution levels and bulk transfer payments.</p>

  <p>I am glad to announce that East Ayrshire Council is eligible for a payment of &pound;243,352 under the Bellwin Scheme. The Scheme was triggered on 8 April 1999 following representation from several councils in the central belt and south west of Scotland on costs directly associated with the immediate aftermath of the Boxing Day storms.</p>

  <p>There has been close liaison between the Scottish Executive and East Ayrshire Council on the eligibility of its claim. The Council&#8217;s costs were primarily in the revenue costs of removing fallen trees and safeguarding structures that endangered the public safety and in meeting the uninsured excesses of insurance claims for over 7,000 damaged premises.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for the conclusion of the investigation was passed to the Chief Executive and Accounting Officer of the Scottish Further Education Funding Council on 1 July 1999 when the Council assumed responsibility for the funding of further education colleges. The Chief Executive has still to finalise and present a report on the results of the investigation to the Council, which will then decide on any further action to be taken. The National Audit Office or its successor, Audit Scotland, may subsequently decide to report on this matter to Parliament. As they are wholly independent of the Executive, I cannot say whether either party will decide to publish any report.</p>
