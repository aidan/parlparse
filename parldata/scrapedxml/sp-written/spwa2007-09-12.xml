  <p>There is no separate mechanism for local authorities to apply for specific funding. The Scottish Government provides general financial support for Scotland&rsquo;s local authorities&rsquo; core services, including burial grounds and crematoria, but it is the responsibility of each individual local authority to allocate its total resources, including the locally collected council tax, on the basis of local needs and priorities.</p>

  <p>In 2007-08, the core local government funding provided by the Scottish Government will amount to over &pound;8.7 billion.</p>

  <p>The cost of producing and translating the document is around &pound;35,000 (including the web version, the design, printing and the summary in eight languages and a full Gaelic version). Distribution of the document cost a further &pound;5,000, and the cost of the launch event was &pound;8,000. The total cost of launching the national conversation to date is therefore &pound;48,000.</p>

  <p>The costs of carrying out the conversation will depend on how its structure develops, in light of responses from the people of Scotland as to how they wish to be involved. The work is being carried out within existing resources from the government&rsquo;s constitutional policy and communications teams.</p>

  <p>The white paper invites people to sign up for the national conversation, and indicate how they wish to contribute. The paper also invites people to suggest how the conversation would best be structured to ensure the greatest possible involvement of the people of Scotland.

  <p>The cost of producing and translating the document is around &pound;35,000 (including the web version, the design, printing and the summary in eight languages and a full Gaelic version). Distribution of the document cost a further &pound;5,000, and the cost of the launch event was &pound;8,000. The total cost of launching the national conversation to date is therefore &pound;48,000.</p>

  <p>The costs of carrying out the conversation will depend on how its structure develops, in light of responses from the people of Scotland as to how they wish to be involved. The work is being carried out within existing resources from the government&rsquo;s constitutional policy and communications teams.</p>

  <p>A range of services are available to bereaved families and loved ones, including provision by mainstream social work services, the Ministry of Defence (MoD), and veterans&rsquo; charities and organisations. The Scottish Government will continue to liaise closely with the MoD and Scotland&rsquo;s veterans&rsquo; organisations to look at how best we meet the needs of our veterans&rsquo; community. One way we achieve this is through chairing the Veterans&rsquo; Programme Scotland (VPS) Steering Group which includes representatives from MoD and the major Scottish veterans&rsquo; charities.</p>

  <p>In fully recognising these many needs faced by Scotland&rsquo;s veterans, the Scottish Government welcomes any opportunity to discuss how best they can be met. To this end, Stewart Maxwell, Minister for Communities and Sport, has recently written to Ron Smith, Chairman of Veterans Scotland, offering a meeting with him and his colleagues.</p>

  <p>Dyslexia is a complex learning difficulty affecting individuals in different ways and to varying degrees. Procedures for the identification of dyslexia are, therefore, not uniform across Scotland.</p>

  <p>However, schools and teachers have access to a range of screening tools and assessment packages to aid the early identification of dyslexia. This should ensure that the most appropriate learning and support strategy can be put in place to best meet the needs of each individual child.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what plans it has to reduce the incidence of cancer in West Dunbartonshire to the Scottish average or below and what the cost of any additional measures will be.</p>

  <p>The increasing incidence of cancer across Scotland was predicted in <em>Cancer Scenarios, </em> published by the Scottish Executive in 2001. While incidence is rising, but not as rapidly as predicted in 2001, at the same time the death rate from cancer is going down. This means that more and more people are surviving after cancer. Currently, the indications are that we will meet the 2010 target of a 20 per cent reduction in the cancer mortality rate in the under-75s. Figures show that since 1995 the rate has decreased by 18.1 per cent.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Cancer Strategy, <em>Cancer in Scotland: Action for Change, </em>which is currently being updated, is a wide ranging plan to help control the burden of cancer in Scotland. As well as delivering more than 300 additional doctors, nurses and other health professionals and significant improvements in radiotherapy and other equipment and related services across all NHS boards, the plan was underpinned by a health improvement strategy which has most recently seen the roll-out of Keep Well projects in targeted areas across the country. In addition, when taken together the ban on smoking in enclosed public spaces, information and education on prevention including lifestyle issues; developing smoking cessation services, changing cultural attitudes to alcohol consumption and providing better alternatives for people represent a comprehensive approach aimed at improving health across the board.</p>

  <p>It was announced in February 2007 that West Dunbartonshire will be one of the Community Health Partnerships involved in Wave 2 of the Keep Well Programme. It is proposed that Glasgow and Clyde will be receiving &pound;5 million over a two year period to implement this and West Dunbartonshire will receive a proportion of this allocation. The aim of the Keep Well programme is to increase the rate of health improvement (ages 45 to 64 years) with particular focus on early intervention by enhancing primary care services in deprived communities to deliver anticipatory care. Health checks are therefore initially targeted at people with the highest risk of preventable ill-health.</p>

  <p>As a first step this aim will be achieved through a risk assessment carried out by a health care practitioner at a patient Keep Well Health Check. Based on assessed need a range of NHS and non-NHS treatments, services and supports are provided thereafter. This may include interventions such as drug therapy, healthy eating advice, physical activity classes, smoking cessation support, alcohol interventions, benefits advice and assistance in gaining employment. The outcomes of these interventions such as smoking cessation may help to reduce the incidence of cancer.</p>

  <p>The table, which is available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 43591) shows numbers of discharges with primary diagnoses of: heart disease, angina, myocardial infarction, heart failure or arrhythmia by NHS board of residence for the years ended 31 March 2003 to 31 March 2006.</p>

  <p>Atherosclerosis cannot be shown explicitly because it is often the underlying cause of the above conditions, as well as the cause of other conditions such as peripheral vascular disease and thrombotic strokes, and it may not be mentioned specifically in hospital discharge summaries. Variation in recording of atherosclerosis may result in a misleading indication of the numbers of such hospitalisations.</p>

  <p>The abolition of the graduate endowment will have no impact on Discretionary Funds as they are not directly related.

  <p>Note: *The 2001 act allows local authorities to propose the designation of any part of their area in which the specified criteria are met. In practice, local authorities have taken a number of different approaches to reflect the circumstances in their areas. However, their proposals should aim to identify recognised localities or neighbourhoods, for example a housing letting area, that would be familiar to both the tenant and the landlord.</p>

  <p>Provisions in the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 give ministers the power to introduce a mandatory tenancy deposit scheme in Scotland. A working group of stakeholders representing the interests of private landlords and tenants has agreed that further work should be carried out to develop an evidence base on the scale of the problem of unfairly withheld deposits in order to consider whether a mandatory scheme is needed in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is therefore planning to carry out detailed surveys of both tenants and landlords to gather this evidence. An audit of current good practice is also being undertaken to consider whether further improvements to existing practice, such as training for landlords and advice available to tenants, could be encouraged without the need for a mandatory scheme. In addition, it will be important to consider the impact of recent initiatives to improve standards in the private rented sector, such as the mandatory landlord registration scheme and the forthcoming national voluntary landlord accreditation scheme. Over time, these schemes should help to tackle any landlords or letting agents who are found to have unfairly withheld their tenants&rsquo; deposits.</p>

  <p>Communities Scotland has advised all registered social landlords that the agency would be prepared to provide Homestake funding through a wholly owned non-charitable subsidiary of the registered social landlord if any charitable registered social landlord has concerns about the impact on its charitable status.

  <p>The Scottish Government have not received any recent representations on these issues either from families of service personnel or representative organisations in relation to the needs of service personnel wounded in Iraq or Afghanistan.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government, however, continues to liaise closely with the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and Scotland&rsquo;s veterans organisations. Scottish Government officials chair the Veterans&rsquo; Programme Scotland (VPS) Steering Group which brings together representatives from MoD and the major Scottish veterans&rsquo; charities. The Veterans&rsquo; Programme Scotland is the programme of activities that the MoD plans to undertake in relation to veterans in Scotland which also takes account of differences in Scottish legislation and structures. Ownership of and responsibility for achieving the programme lies with the MoD.</p>

  <p>The role of the steering group is to investigate ways in which the specific welfare, health, housing and employment needs of veterans in Scotland can be met, both within mainstream services and veteran-specific services.</p>

  <p>The Small Claims (Scotland) Amendment Order 2007 was laid in Parliament on 12 September 2007. It raises the small claims limit from &pound;750 to &pound;3,000 and provides that actions for personal injury are excluded from the category of actions which must be brought as a small claim. I recognise that the considerations are often different in personal injury cases where victims need legal support, for example to understand medical reports which are often needed. The small claims court is not suited to help those involved in personal injury litigation. It is in recognition of that fact that such cases will be removed from the small claims procedure.</p>

  <p>The order also amends the amount of expenses which the sheriff may award in a small claim where the value of the claim exceeds &pound;200. The sheriff may now, where the value of the claim is &pound;1,500 or less, award expenses up to &pound;150. Where the value of the claim is greater than &pound;1,500, the sheriff may award expenses up to 10% of the value of the claim. The order does not affect any small claim which was commenced prior to the order coming into force.</p>

  <p>We plan to present The Sheriff Courts (Scotland) Act 1971 (Privative Jurisdiction and Summary Cause) Order 2007 to the Privy Council at its next meeting on 10 October 2007. The order raises the limit of the privative (or exclusive) jurisdiction of the sheriff court and the limit of the summary cause from &pound;1,500 to &pound;5,000. The new limits do not apply to proceedings commenced before the order comes into force. The effect of this is that the ordinary cause rules will apply in cases of a value exceeding &pound;5,000.</p>

  <p>The Orders will come into force on 14 January 2008.</p>

  <p>In a speech to the Scottish Crofting Foundation Annual Conference on 7 September 2007, I was able to confirm that bull hire arrangements will continue into 2008. The hire charges are unchanged from 2007.</p>

  <p>If the current management arrangements are to continue beyond 2008, a significant investment will be needed in new stud facilities to replace those presently available on the farms run by the Crofters Commission on the Scottish Government&rsquo;s behalf. I have therefore asked the Crofters Commission to appraise the investment that would be required to modernise the stud operation facilities at Inverness.</p>

  <p>At the same time, I have asked the Committee of Inquiry on Crofting to provide advice on whether a scheme of the nature of the Crofters Cattle Quality Improvement Scheme might be the best way of spending money to achieve the vision for crofting on which it is reporting to ministers.</p>

  <p>Spend on job matching panels is not audited centrally. NHSScotland is committed to the introduction of Agenda for Change as quickly and efficiently as possible and it is for each NHS board to monitor each part of the process to ensure best value is achieved. In this regard, the Audit Committee Handbook provides guidance to NHS boards on good practice. It makes clear that boards should have internal controls established to give reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded, waste and inefficiency is avoided, that reliable financial information is produced and that value for money is continuously sought.</p>

  <p>This is not something on which work has been undertaken centrally. The Agenda for Change system was agreed in partnership at a UK level between NHS employers, trades unions and professional organisations and the UK health departments. All sides recognise the benefits of the new system and it is for NHS boards and staff-side representatives working in partnership locally to ensure that the implementation process is as quick and efficient as possible without sacrificing the integrity of the system.</p>

  <p>It was the view of the Scottish Pay Reference and Implementation Group (SPRIG), the partnership group which oversaw the introduction of the new system, that an exercise to make available information about overall job evaluation outcomes across Scotland would only have real merit once the implementation process had been concluded.

  <p>Overall capacity in the pre-school sector is not monitored on a national basis. Uptake of pre-school education places is reported annually through the Pre-school and Childcare Statistics. The current high-level of uptake suggests that there are no overall problems with capacity in the sector.</p>

  <p>Planning of pre-school services at a local level is a matter for local authorities, who have a duty to provide every three and four-year-old with a pre-school education place. In order to do this effectively they must plan the provision of pre-school education to ensure that places are available in the areas where they are needed.</p>

  <p>Since 2006 the Scottish Government has been working with the Society for Chief Officers of Trading Standards in Scotland in order to record the level of test purchasing for age restricted goods being undertaken by local authorities in Scotland. The data collected does not specifically include information on the number of warnings issued for underage tobacco sales and it is therefore not possible to give a figure for 2006-07.</p>

  <p>On 23 August 2007, as one of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s manifesto commitments, I convened the Performance Sports Summit with sports stakeholders to discuss Scottish representation on the international sporting stage. The key discussion points taken, as well as the themes emerging in the plenary sessions, will be made available in due course.</p>

  <p>Barnett Formula consequentials are for &quot;public&quot; funding. There are no Barnett Formula consequentials for &quot;private&quot; funding. Since student top-up fees paid in England are &quot;private&quot; additional funding for universities there are no Barnett consequentials allocated to Scotland.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what steps it is taking to expand and build on the youth panels set up through the Big Lottery Fund.</p>

  <p>The youth panels established to take important funding decisions for the Big Lottery Fund&rsquo;s Young People&rsquo;s Fund have been a great success.</p>

  <p>Indeed, the Parliament has already congratulated the Big Lottery Fund on setting up the local panels of young people across Scotland and making real its commitment to involve young people at all stages of the Young People&rsquo;s Fund.</p>

  <p>To ensure this momentum is not lost, Big Lottery Fund officials have been in discussion with Scottish Government officials about the panels. In addition, young people&rsquo;s experience of participation in the Young People&rsquo;s Fund has already been utilised in the distribution of funds attached to the Youth Work Strategy.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will be looking closely at the issue of young people&rsquo;s participation and engagement and will seek to build on the success of the Young People&rsquo;s Fund.</p>
