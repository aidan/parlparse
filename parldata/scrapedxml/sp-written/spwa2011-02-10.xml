  <p>Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) operations were, inevitably, severely impacted by the prolonged adverse weather. Ambulance crews across the country worked tirelessly to respond to incidents. Crews were supported by partners including the Army, Coastguard and volunteers across the country, for example ambulance staff were driven to patients by army drivers in military 4x4 vehicles and treated at home or transferred to appropriate care. This additional support was implemented due to the physical challenges in reaching patients, not due to lack of SAS resource, and this collaborative effort meant that patients continued to be supported.</p>

  <p>SAS actively ensured that 999 calls were clinically monitored and prioritised, utilising paramedic advisors and NHS 24 clinical team leaders within the emergency medical dispatch centres.</p>

  <p>While patient transport services were reduced in some areas, high priority groups such as renal and cancer patients continued to be transported where this was possible. SAS worked in close partnership with territorial NHS boards throughout the period of disruption.</p>

  <p>The service took delivery of 22 new 4x4 vehicles in December 2010 and January 2011 to further enhance their resilience, they also plan to introduce winter tyres across their fleet before next winter.</p>

  <p>There is no guidance that has been produced specifically for milk as it is not possible to specify in contracts &quot;milk from Scotland&quot; or similar. New guidance has been produced, Catering for Change - January 2011, which shows how to make full use of the flexibility available to public bodies to legally include sustainability issues in their food procurement activity.</p>

  <p>Milk is sourced through competitive contracts awarded by public bodies. Milk companies will have full traceability of the source of milk supplied. Wisemans is by some margin the largest supplier and their labelling identifies Scottish milk but not the name of the supplying farm.</p>

  <p>These are endorsed by the recommendations in the Scottish Muscle Network&rsquo;s strategic review of services for people with neuro-muscular disorders. The Minister for Public Health and Sport had a productive meeting, earlier this week, with representatives of the network, to discuss implementation of both pieces of work.</p>

  <p>NHS National Services Scotland (NSS) do not collate and categorise sickness absence figures into those relating to purely &quot;work-related&quot; stress. NSS do however collate sickness absence figures for employees absent for the following reasons - anxiety, stress, depression, other psychological illness. The figures provided below represent the number of NSS employees absent from work due to those reasons:</p>

  <p><table width="25%" border="BORDER" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#CCCCCC">
<tr>
<td width="40%" valign="top">2007-08</td>
<td width="60%" align="right" valign="top">67</td>

<td width="40%" valign="top">2010-11</td>
<td width="60%" align="right" valign="top">(to date) 109</td>
</tr>
</table></p>

  <p>NHS NSS have indicated that the increase in recorded cases is due to improved reason for absence recording rather than an upward trend in actual cases. It is also important to note that the 2007-08 figure relates to stress only.</p>

  <p>Scotland&rsquo;s remaining North Sea oil and gas reserves are estimated to have a potential wholesale value of &pound;1 trillion and act as a significant source of tax revenue for the UK Exchequer. In the next six years alone, the North Sea is forecast to generate &pound;60.5 billion in tax revenue for the UK Exchequer. This compares to the expected &pound;2 billion net cost of all the UK Government&rsquo;s financial sector interventions forecast in the June 2010 Emergency Budget.</p>

  <p>With responsibility for this vast resource, and the opportunity to determine the best approach to financial regulation in Scotland, the Scottish Government would be able to ensure financial stability in the banking system.</p>

  <p>Since the closure of Kinross Visitor Information Centre in 2008, the last such closure in the region, VisitScotland, and Perth and Kinross Council, have continued to review the provision of visitor information services across the region. Both are in agreement that the current provision meets demand within the resources available.</p>

  <p>Current provision of visitor information services in the area is provided through VisitScotland information centres, information points and partnerships. Together these provide a variety of local knowledge and regional publications; as well as various eMedia solutions such as the VisitPerthshire website and the new national iPhone app.</p>
