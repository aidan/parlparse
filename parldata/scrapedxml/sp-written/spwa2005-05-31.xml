  <p>The estimated* number of tonnes and monetary values of fertiliser and lime used as inputs on Scottish farms, for 2004, are shown in the following table. For herbicides and other pesticides, only the values of the utilised inputs are illustrated, as tonnage figures are not known. No data exist for imports of chemical farm inputs.</p>

  <p>Sources: Agricultural Census; SAC; British Survey of Fertiliser Practice.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>*The figures shown in the table are estimates. The Environment and Rural Affairs Department obtains rates of farm chemical usage (on a per hectare basis) and prices from the Scottish Agricultural College (SAC). Usage rates are also obtained from the British Survey of Fertiliser Practice. These rates and prices are then applied to the census areas of agricultural land. Therefore, it must be stressed that the tonnage and value figures outlined are derived using bottom-up calculations. They are, however, consistent with the aggregate agricultural accounts published each year in the Economic Report on Scottish Agriculture (ERSA).</p>

  <p>Concerns about the increased incidence of cancer and the needs of those who suffer from it make cancer one of the top priorities for the Scottish Executive and for NHSScotland. <em>Cancer in Scotland</em> , the Scottish cancer strategy, was put in place to tackle the issues raised across a broad front, through primary prevention, earlier detection and more rapid diagnosis and treatment.</p>

  <p>There are some 120 children diagnosed with cancer each year which accounts for less than 1% of all cancers in Scotland. This figure remained fairly constant from 1975&ndash;99.</p>

  <p>Deaths from cancers in children have decreased such that between 1975 and 1999 five year survival increased from 50% to 76%.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has been working to widen home access to computers through the development of a Home Computer Initiative for all eligible employees in the Scottish public sector. This includes employees of the Scottish Executive, local authorities, health boards, non-departmental public bodies, agencies and other public sector organisations.</p>

  <p>This scheme will make home computers available at a reduced cost and enable users to take up internet access. The scheme, which offers the opportunity to provide lower cost computers without any cost to the employer as a result of a tax exemption, is expected to launch in August 2005. The Scottish Executive encourages employers to consider offering such a scheme to their employees.</p>

  <p>There is an on-going programme of quality improvement for economic statistics within the Executive. For example, there is a continuous development programme in place for the quarterly GDP index, and there are initiatives to further improve exports statistics. Work is underway on a project to harmonise data sources within the Scottish supply-and-use tables, and to enhance analytical capability by redesigning IT systems.</p>

  <p>The Executive is working with the Office for National Statistics to obtain better information on businesses in Scotland, which will have a positive impact on all the economic statistics we produce. The range of information produced from the analysis of business statistics is currently being reviewed, along with the potential for linking various datasets to investigate drivers of productivity.</p>

  <p>There are several planned improvements for Labour Market statistics. The Scottish Executive boost of the Labour Force Survey will provide better more detailed information over time and for local areas. Further analysis of economic inactivity will also take place. New figures on Public Sector employment are soon to be published, and the Executive will be publishing a Scottish-based strategy to take forward work arising from the Atkinson Review.</p>

  <p>An updated economic statistics plan for 2005-06 will soon be available on the Scottish Executive website.</p>

  <p>It will not be the role of the development officer to produce a report as such. The role will rather be one of identifying and disseminating good practice, and encouraging authorities to review and enhance provision. The development officer will communicate his findings from the mapping and auditing stage of the programme in a variety of ways including conferences, seminars and other appropriate engagement with the various stakeholders in this important area. It is expected that this mapping exercise be completed within one year of the officer being in post.</p>

  <p>There is no existing detailed policy on outdoor education in Scotland. It is not a subject in itself, but provides a setting for delivery of some aspects of the curriculum such as personal and social development, environmental studies and the expressive arts. It also sits within the purposes of the 3-18 curriculum from <em>A Curriculum for Excellence</em> and our aspirations for all children and young person to become successful learners, confident individuals, responsible citizens and effective contributors.</p>

  <p>The development programme will inform the development of Scottish Executive policy on outdoor education and enable us to drive progress in this area.</p>

  <p>Officials from the Scottish Executive, Environment and Rural Affairs Department regularly discuss matters of pesticide regulation with their counterparts in the Pesticides Safety Directorate.</p>

  <p>Under the full cost recovery policy operated by the Pesticides Safety Directorate the fee charged for evaluating pesticides is directly related to the costs of the work in handling and evaluating the individual application in question. Under these arrangements the fee rates for biological control agents have already been set lower than for conventional pesticide applications and these fees will be reviewed in the light of the experience gained in evaluating such products in the Directorate&rsquo;s pilot scheme to encourage the development and introduction of alternative control measures.</p>

Section 89(1) and (2) of the 1990 Act place general duties on certain bodies responsible for &quot;relevant land&quot; to clear it of litter so far as is practicable. &quot;Relevant land&quot; includes public open spaces, roads, railways, the grounds of educational institutions, Crown land, and other land which local authorities have designated as litter control areas. In discharging their duties, those bodies must have regard to a code of practice under the 1990 act. The 2004 act gave ministers the power only to supplement the existing code of practice with specific directions to those bodies as to how they perform their litter clearance duties, not to impose duties which were not in the 1990 act and the code of practice.</p>

  <p>Note: 1. Data for Dumfries and Galloway and the Southern General Hospital are not available for 2005. The 2004 data have been used as an estimate of the 2005 numbers.</p>

  <p>Planned admissions, for an operation or for any other reason, can be cancelled due to various unforeseen pressures. Some examples of these are; an influx of emergency admissions, widespread staff sickness, theatre equipment failure, infection in wards.</p>

  <p>On occasions, some patients may be sent home, following admission, when a planned procedure/operation has not been carried out. Some reasons for this include; patient being unfit for treatment due to illness (e.g. chest infection), having omitted to fast before admission, failing to follow pre-admission advice on medication or where theatre time is unavailable due to unexpected complications arising in earlier theatre cases.</p>

  <p>As explained in the answer to S2W-16652, answered 31 May 2005, work on the directory will not be complete until January 2006. However, the data collection exercise has revealed that there are about 1,350 providers responsible for 7,000 services nationally. Within this total, it is estimated that housing support services specifically for older people are delivered by around 200 providers through 2,100 services. The vast majority of these services for older people are accommodation-based, typically amenity, sheltered and extra care housing settings. Of the remaining services 19,092 people, who were homeless or sleeping rough, received housing support during 2003-04.</p>

  <p>Data Source : SMR01</p>

  <p>The rise in median wait recorded between June 1999 and December 2004 is to be expected due to the emphasis on treating those patients who have been waiting longest. The fall in the number of long waiters is demonstrated clearly in table 1. The nine month maximum wait was met at end 2003 and very few patients have breached this since then. The six month maximum wait is to be achieved by end 2005.</p>

  <p>Individual consideration must be given to each plan, programme or strategy before the Responsible Authority can determine whether the bill will apply to it. Whilst emphasising that case by case approach I can make the following general points:</p>

  <p>Plans, programmes and strategies which relate solely to the whole or any part of Scotland and deal with nuclear power stations and associated facilities are not exempted.</p>

  <p>Qualifying plans, programmes and strategies which could (depending on the outcome of the screening procedure) fall within the provisions of the bill, include those prepared for energy which set the framework for future development consent of nuclear power stations and other installations referred to in paragraphs 2(2) and 3 of schedule 1 to the bill.</p>

  <p>Any qualifying plan, programme or strategy which has been determined by a Responsible Authority, after screening, to be likely to have a significant environmental effect, will require to comply fully with part 2 (environmental reports and consultation) and part 3 (post &ndash;adoption procedures) of the bill.</p>

  <p>Within the official publications section, the search facility is currently limited to the publication title only but a new way of indexing publications will allow it to cover metadata fields and content as well.</p>
