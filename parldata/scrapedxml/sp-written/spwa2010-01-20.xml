  <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong></span><span lang="en" xml:lang="en">In 2008, NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS) published the revised and updated cancer standards which were first developed in 2001 and reported on findings in 2002. In line with other reviews of services against standards, NHS QIS allows a period of time before embarking on any assessment. This allows NHS boards the opportunity to introduce the new standards and identify potential areas for improvement in their services as well as start to gather the information on how it is performing against the new standards. This is critical information that has to be submitted to NHS QIS prior to any subsequent review.</span></p>

  <p>The interval between the publication of cancer standards and any subsequent review allows, at both a national and local board level, the amendment of any existing cancer audit data sets (which allow the service to be assessed against the quantitative aspect of the standards). Once any amendment to these data sets have been made, relevant data has to then be collected to enable the service and NHS QIS an opportunity to gain an understanding of current performance against the standards.</p>

  <p>Clinical audit is undertaken by designated audit staff within each managed clinical network. These staff have knowledge of local issues and good links with the relevant clinical leads. It has been demonstrated that the best way to improve clinical standards and care of patients is for the outcomes of the audit process to be reviewed by the clinicians delivering the care, as they are best placed to provide advice and guidance on any changes in practise that may be required. This process is undertaken within the NHS boards&rsquo; local clinical governance framework.</p>

  <p>Clinical audit data is also used for regional and national purposes and where they exist for UK-wide audits. This allows comparisons across and between regions, across NHS Scotland and in some cases, for example, the LUCADA dataset for lung cancer, the UK.</p>

  <p>There are currently no plans to publish a specific annual report on the implementation of <em>Better Cancer Care: An Action Plan</em> . The NHSScotland Chief Executive&rsquo;s Annual Report, last published on 4 December 2009, sets out the key areas of progress on implementing the national programmes of work across NHSScotland, including <em>Better Cancer Care</em> .</p>

  <p>A detailed work plan has been developed by the Scottish Cancer Taskforce to monitor implementation of the commitments set out in <em>Better Cancer Care</em>. The four sub groups, including Chemotherapy Advisory Group, Scottish Radiotherapy Advisory Group, Living with Cancer Group and National Cancer Quality Steering Group, have drawn up individual work plans to take forward specific elements of this workplan.</p>

  <p>Significant progress has already been made in the areas of prevention, screening, early detection of cancer, referral and diagnosis, treatment, living with cancer, improving the quality of cancer care and delivery.</p>

  <p>Updates on the work of the Scottish Cancer Taskforce and its constituent sub groups is published on a regular basis on the Scottish Government website, available at:</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answers to questions S3W-27966 and S3W-27967 on 26 October 2009.</p>

  <p>In addition, the member will wish to be aware that, due to concerns about the size and complexity of the curriculum as a whole, the Curriculum Governing Group asked experienced and senior writers to review the draft experiences and outcomes. During this process, which was led by Learning and Teaching Scotland (LTS), the writers exercised their professional judgement and consulted with a wide range of practitioners in a context of peer review. In addition to track documentation, LTS has documented the process for developing the health and wellbeing part of the curriculum framework together with those who input to the review.</p>

  <p>Safe and active travel has not been removed from the new curriculum framework. The draft outcome and overarching statement were simplified to broaden the basis for interpretation and delivery and to allow active travel to permeate health and wellbeing. The Learning and Teaching Scotland led development team reviewed and redrafted the health and wellbeing experiences and outcomes in collaboration with a wide range of practitioners.</p>

  <p>The final experiences and outcomes for health and wellbeing and accompanying principles and practice were approved by the Curriculum Governing Group on 11 March 2009 and by the Curriculum for Excellence Management Board on 25 March 2009.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to announce today, the publication of Building the Curriculum 5 A Framework for Assessment together with an associated paper on quality assurance and moderation.</p>

  <p>The framework provides guidance to teaching staff on how the new assessment system will raise standards and expectations, promote depth of understanding and improve skills. A copy of the Framework and the associated papers have been placed in Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. numbers 50048, 50049, 50050). The documents are also available on the<em> Curriculum for Excellence</em> website at:<a href="http://www.curriculumforexcellencescotland.gov.uk" target="_blank"> www.curriculumforexcellencescotland.gov.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>The Framework will be accompanied by a strong package of support to help teaching staff implement the new system:</p>

  <p>Learning and Teaching Scotland will be organising events over January and February to promote greater understanding of the framework.</p>

  <p>In the summer term assessment exemplars will be made available through the Curriculum for Excellence website. They will show pupils&rsquo; work assessed by practitioners against standards and expectations in the priority areas of literacy and numeracy across all curriculum areas and health and wellbeing.</p>

  <p>Teaching staff will have access to a new online National Assessment Resource in the autumn.</p>

  <p>In recognition of the additional activity associated with introducing and operating a moderation scheme, as well as meeting the costs of national work, I will transfer resources to local government to help pay for additional local work.</p>

  <p>In addition to the three in-service days which have already been provided to support staff in moving towards full adoption of Curriculum for Excellence in August 2010, I am also providing a further in-service day to support implementation including professional development for the new assessment system.</p>

  <p>The framework takes full account of professional advice from the Curriculum for Excellence Management Board and I will continue to work positively with the management board, local authorities and the education community to deliver improvements in teaching and learning through Curriculum for Excellence.</p>

  <p>Following careful analysis the Scottish Enterprise board recommended at its 4 December 2009 meeting against proceeding with a loan application to the European Investment Bank under the JEREMIE initiative. Their analysis was significantly influenced by the cost and complexity of the arrangements that would have been required to avoid such borrowing counting against the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Departmental Expenditure Limit under the budgeting rules applied by the UK Government.</p>

  <p>This advice was conveyed to the Scottish Government in a letter from the Scottish Enterprise Chairman on 15 December 2009. The Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth wrote to the Chief Secretary to the UK Treasury on 16 December 2009 to express his concern about the significant impact that these budgeting rules have had on our consideration of the JEREMIE model as a mechanism to improve access to finance for Scottish SMEs. No reply to that letter has yet been received.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Investment Bank Ltd has already been established as a subsidiary of Scottish Enterprise and the Scottish Government remains fully committed to taking this initiative forward. We continue to explore what other types of private and public finance can be marshalled to support our commitment to assisting Scottish businesses. However, our efforts have not been aided by the lack of flexibility shown to date by the UK Treasury in respect of potential borrowing from the European Investment Bank under the JEREMIE initiative.</p>

  <p>Opportunities for additional funding are being explored at this time. The government will in due course share further details with the Scottish Parliament.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are expected to put such plans in place, in the light of the guidance in the Better Heart Disease and Stroke Care Action Plan on developing models to support the delivery of stroke thrombolysis. In particular, the action plan asks NHS boards, through their stroke MCNs, to consider appropriate models to facilitate access to thrombolysis for stroke patients, especially in areas with limited medical cover.</p>

  <p>Representatives of the Stroke Managed Clinical Network from each NHS board and the Regional Planning Groups met in October 2009 to discuss the action in the Plan for them, in conjunction with the Scottish Ambulance Service and the Scottish Centre for Telehealth (now part of NHS24), to consider how to deliver optimal care in the hyper-acute phase of stroke, including thrombolysis.</p>

  <p>The NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS) stroke standards stipulate that thrombolysis services should aim to treat more than five stroke patients per 100,000 population and to ensure that the door to needle time is less than one hour in at least 80% of patients treated. The Scottish Stroke Care Audit is now collecting data which will allow for monitoring of performance against this standard.</p>

  <p>There is no definitive list of operations which relate to the specific treatment of fractures.

  <p>On 10 December 2009, the Chairman of the Vale of Leven Hospital Inquiry wrote to me seeking an extension to the duration of the Inquiry which was originally due to report by 1 October 2010.</p>

  <p>Lord MacLean has indicated that, in order to investigate thoroughly and properly all the evidence and, most importantly, the lessons to be learnt from the Vale of Leven Hospital and experience elsewhere, he would propose submitting a report in May 2011.</p>

  <p>Having carefully considered Lord MacLean&rsquo;s request, I have agreed to an extension. The Inquiry will therefore report by 31 May 2011.</p>

  <p>Students enrolled in first degree level courses at Scottish institutions and studying planning as their main course typically study for four years (though a number may study for only three years). Planning includes; urban and rural planning, regional planning, transport planning and planning (undefined).</p>

  <p>In academic year 2005-06 there were 115 entrants to planning courses studying at degree level at Scottish institutions. In 2006-07 there were 100 and in 2007-08 there were 125. Assuming each student studies continuously for four years and successfully completes their qualification, we would estimate that in 2009-10 there will be in the region of 115 graduates, 100 in 2010-11 and 125 in 2011-12. These figures do not include students enrolled on courses where planning is a minor component of their overall qualification.</p>

  <p>The review to which the question refers is being undertaken by the Higher Education Funding Council for England and concerns it&rsquo;s funding for university museums and galleries in England. The Scottish Government is therefore not involved.</p>

  <p><strong>Frank Mulholland: </strong>The following table shows the number of charges of (a) assault and (b) assault to injury where the initial decision taken by the Procurator Fiscal was to deal with the offending behaviour by means of a direct measure.</p>

  <p>The 222 charges relate to a total of 211 persons issued with an offer of a direct measure, out of a total of 3,330 persons offered a direct measure during the same period.</p>

  <p>The figures include only those direct measures that were affected by the provisions in the Criminal Proceedings etc (Reform) (Scotland) Act 2007.</p>

  <p>The use of restorative practices with youth offenders is already well established. To ensure best practice and to increase the opportunities for the further use of restorative practices for young offenders, <em>Preventing Offending by Young People &ndash; a Framework for Action</em> includes a commitment to continue to work to demonstrate the potential benefits that can be achieved by adopting restorative approaches where appropriate. Consequently, the National Development (Champion) Group for Youth Restorative Justice has been set up by the Scottish Government and the Criminal Justice Social Work Development Centre for Scotland to identify potential areas for development and to share areas of best practice with practitioners across Scotland.</p>

  <p>Restorative practice measures are also used by five local authority areas as part of their Diversion from Prosecution Services for adult offenders. These services are used to resolve less serious offences that procurators fiscal have diverted from formal court proceedings.</p>

  <p>Ministers are currently considering the conclusion of a joint research project by Victim Support Scotland and Sacro, which includes a proposal to pilot a new method of providing restorative practices for adults within the criminal justice system.</p>

  <p>The impact of creating a presumption against custodial sentences of six months or less will be that courts should not impose such sentences unless the particular circumstances of the case lead them to believe that no other option would be appropriate. Judicial discretion to sentence shoplifters to jail will remain.</p>

  <p>Of those convicted of shoplifting in 2007-08, 26% received a custodial sentence (Criminal Proceedings in Scottish Courts, 2007-08). The remaining 74% received community sentences, monetary penalties or other disposals.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Prison Service is currently undertaking a comprehensive review of all the purposeful activities undertaken by prisoners in each of the public sector prisons.

  <p>The detail requested concerns a series of individual transactions between local authorities, operators and suppliers and is therefore treated as commercial information. In the period to 18 January 2010 we can however confirm that with the support of the Scottish Salt Group, which was established by Scottish Government, 59 instances of mutual aid have taken place across Scotland resulting in the movement of over 11,000 tonnes of salt. Thus far, the Scottish Salt Group has also identified and allocated additional salt supplies to Scottish local authorities in excess of 2,800 tonnes. This process continues.</p>

  <p>Officials from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland met with Commission officials in February 2009 to discuss proposals to revise the Cross Compliance payment reduction systems as a result of the 2008 audits in England and Wales.</p>

  <p>The Commission made it clear at this meeting that they expected the majority of Cross Compliance breaches to result in a 3% payment reduction otherwise significant disallowance (EC fines) would apply. This approach was further confirmed and clarified in the Commission audit letters to Wales and later to Northern Ireland following their audit in spring 2009.</p>

  <p>At our request the UK raised the issue of Cross Compliance penalties at the Council of Ministers on 16 December 2009 and we will press for meetings to be held with the new Commission to keep our concerns on the agenda.</p>

  <p>The Grand Matches are arranged by the Royal Caledonian Curling Club. As the event organiser, it is for the Club to make decisions about holding the event following discussion with the relevant Police and emergency services. These discussions will include measures to ensure the safety of participants and spectators. In this way the public interest has to be taken into account by the event-organisers. Most event-organisers will also seek to arrange third party liability insurance to protect themselves in the event of action from third parties.</p>

  <p>Ministers have been fully briefed on the circumstances surrounding the Royal Caledonian Curling Club&rsquo;s decision not to go ahead with an event at the Lake of Menteith on 9 and 10 January 2010. The Club is now updating its plans for all three sites with a view to being ready should suitable weather conditions return. EventScotland officials are in contact with the Royal Caledonian Curling Club and are able to provide advice if necessary.</p>

  <p>The remit of SGoRR when activated is to monitor on behalf of Scottish ministers potential or ongoing incidents at a Scotland-wide level, in order to set the Scottish Government&rsquo;s strategic response priorities and ensure that the activity of government is best focussed to support responders and others in dealing with the event. Consideration of the consequences of any such major event, including for individual sectors and groups, is therefore a standing item for meetings and activity in SGoRR. This includes being a standing agenda item for meetings of the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Scottish Government Resilience (CSC SGoR).</p>

  <p>With regard to ministerial attendance at SGoRR, rarely is a Cabinet Secretary unable to attend meetings of CSC SGoR; where they are unable to attend they would normally send a substitute. Information on CSC SGoR membership and meetings can be found at:</p>

  <p>In addition to formal meetings, Scottish ministers have been briefed on the severe weather and its consequences every day from 22 December 2009 to 18 January 2010, including across the Christmas the New Year period.</p>

  <p>Since December 2009, the Scottish Government has been in regular contact with all of Scotland&rsquo;s 32 local authorities concerning severe weather planning. We do not record the number of calls made to or from the Scottish Government Resilience Room.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-30499 on 18 January 2010.

  <p>The data requested is commercial information. With the support of the Scottish Government Resilience Room, neighbouring local authorities and trunk road operators provided mutual aid to re-distribute available salt to Fife Council during the period in question. More recently, the Scottish Salt Cell, which was established by Scottish Government to support our councils and trunk road operating companies in managing salt stocks during the prolonged winter weather, has also secured significant new salt supplies for Fife Council.</p>
