  <p>I am aware that producers who have entered stock into the Livestock Welfare (Disposal) Scheme have experienced delays in their claims being processed and consequently their stock have not been slaughtered as quickly as they hoped. Since this became apparent, my officials have been in contact with the Intervention Board Executive Agency, which operates this scheme on behalf of the Agricultural Departments, to try and resolve any difficulties. They have been given assurances that significant slaughter throughput under this scheme will begin in the week commencing 9 April. The Intervention Board advises me that animals are dealt with in order of welfare priority and according to the availability of suitable slaughter and disposal facilities and it is therefore not possible for them to give precise timescales in the form requested. However, the time between issue of the movement licence and collection of the animals must not exceed 24 hours. The Intervention Board will aim to make payments within 21 days of slaughter.</p>

  <p>The Intervention Board Executive Agency operates the Livestock Welfare (Disposal) Scheme on behalf of the GB Agriculture Departments. They advise me that over 4,000 applications have been received for nearly 1.8 million animals across all of Great Britain. Applications are continuing to be received.

  <p>Separation distances have been put in place around the trial crop to minimise the possibility of cross-pollination with other related species. Oilseed rape can only cross-pollinate with some closely related species, which are in flower at the same time.

  <p>Prior to the release of any GM crop in this country, the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE) undertakes a thorough risk assessment to identify whether the GM crop may cause harmful effects to humans or the environment. This includes consideration of the potential for both direct and indirect impacts on local biodiversity and the wider environment. All current GM crops including the GM oilseed rape being grown in Scotland have been tested in laboratory and glasshouse conditions and in small-scale plots before being given approval to be grown as part of the farm-scale evaluation programme.</p>

  <p>ACRE has concluded that GM crops themselves do not pose a threat to human health or the environment and remain confident that the current GM crops on which they have advised pose no greater risk to health or the environment than non-GM varieties.</p>

  <p>The present regulatory framework at both European and UK level is governed by the European Council Directive 90/220/EEC.

  <p>The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) was formed in 1993 by the Academy of Royal Colleges and Faculties in Scotland. SIGN develops and disseminates multidisciplinary, evidence-based clinical guidelines for the NHS in Scotland. The guidelines, which contain recommendations for effective practice based on current evidence, aim to improve the quality of health care for patients by reducing variation in practice and outcome. The guideline development programme is funded by the Clinical Resource and Audit Group (CRAG) of the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>Membership of SIGN includes all medical specialties, nursing, pharmacy, dentistry, professions allied to medicine, patients, health service managers, social services, and researchers. The work of SIGN is supported by an Executive of 19 staff based at the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh.</p>

  <p>SIGN has a programme of 60 evidence-based clinical guidelines - published, in development or under review - covering a wide range of topics. Its 50th guideline was published in February of this year. Many of the guidelines relate to the NHS priority areas.</p>

  <p>Full background information on SlGN and a list of published guidelines can be found at their website at www.sign.ac.uk.</p>

  <p>Although the Human Genome Project will lead to the sequencing of the human gene complement, it will require a great deal of further research before the actual function, and hence health implication, of each of the genes identified is determined. Research projects of this nature are currently under consideration in Scotland and other parts of the UK. We are therefore not in a position yet to use this knowledge to identify people in the general population who are susceptible to heart disease, cancer and diabetes unless they have one of the already known genetic forms.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, comprehensive clinical and molecular genetic services are available in Scotland to identify at-risk individuals within families with recognised genetic susceptibilities.</p>

  <p>As with any evidence-based organisation, the Health Technology Board for Scotland (HTBS) and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidance Network (SIGN) maintain a high level of awareness of clinical outcomes data. This is broadly derived from four sources: clinical scientific literature, scientific/professional meetings, national professional networks and personal contact.</p>

  <p>In developing standards, the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland (CSBS) draws heavily on the work of SIGN, HTBS and other equivalent organisations.</p>

  <p>I understand that Camden Borough Council has a street population strategy, which aims to minimise the impact of street activity in the borough. This includes reducing rough sleeping by at least two thirds, but also aims to reduce begging, street drinking and street trading. Our approach to rough sleeping in Scotland is to find solutions by involving those who have experience and knowledge of the problems. We are not targeting particular groups, such as beggars - we are addressing the underlying reasons for their situation.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health holds data about cases of methicillin resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA), including MRSA bacteraemias (blood borne infections), and of other bacteraemias detected in laboratory specimens examined in Scottish public health and hospital laboratories. Infections in these groups may have been acquired while the infected person was in hospital or may have been present on admission. It is not at present possible to distinguish and count separately those infections acquired in hospital.</p>

  <p>A sub-group of the Health Department&#8217;s Advisory Group on Infection has been developing plans for a national surveillance system for hospital-acquired infection (HAI), including MRSA, in Scotland. The group is expected to provide recommendations to the department shortly. The sub-group recognises the priority that needs to be attached to infections caused by MRSA. Once their report is received, I will be considering what further steps are needed to introduce surveillance of HAI across Scotland. On present plans, systematic collection throughout Scotland of information on selected infections attributable to MRSA would begin in autumn 2001. Monitoring data would become available approximately a year later.</p>

  <p>There are currently no Scotland-wide arrangements in place for monitoring hospital acquired infection (HAI), including those which become apparent after patients have been discharged from hospital. A Scotland-wide surveillance system for HAI is under active consideration by a sub-group of the Advisory Group on Infection and I will shortly be considering the further steps necessary to introduce such a system.</p>

  <p>There are recognised difficulties in monitoring HAI which becomes apparent after discharge, and there is currently no UK or world-wide consensus on an appropriate approach. Experts from Scotland are taking part in UK-wide discussions about developing methods of post-discharge surveillance of HAIs. The sub-group which is considering HAI surveillance has identified the issue of post-discharge surveillance as a priority and studies to evaluate alternative methods are being developed.</p>

  <p>At present there are no requirements on NHS Trusts to publish such data, although it is open to them to do so. A Scotland-wide surveillance system for hospital-acquired infection (HAI) is under active consideration by a sub-group of the Advisory Group on Infection and I will shortly be considering the further steps necessary to introduce such a system.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive Health Department is also currently considering the inclusion of a measure of the incidence of HAI in NHS hospitals in the new NHS performance assessment framework outlined in <i>Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change</i>.</p>

  <p>General hospital-acquired infection (HAI) would not have been noted as a contributory factor in clinical negligence claims prior to April 2000. However, records of clinical negligence claims where MRSA &#8211; which may have been acquired in hospital &#8211; was stated as a contributory factor are available prior to April 2000.</p>

  <p>No clinical negligence payments have been recorded in respect of incidents in which MRSA is mentioned as a contributory factor.

  <p>There is insufficient data at Scottish level to demonstrate either correlation or lack of correlation between rates of hospital-acquired infection (HAI) and resources applied to infection control by NHS Trusts.</p>

  <p>Preventing and controlling HAI is an important issue for the NHS in Scotland and is a key part of the responsibilities of every NHS Trust. The Scottish Health Plan, <i>Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change,</i> published in December last year, makes clear that every local health care system will be expected to deliver the service standards to be established by the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland on infection control, cleanliness, and other matters. A joint Health Department/ NHS working group is currently reviewing existing guidance and preparing relevant standards. These standards will be applied to NHS Trusts once the work is complete.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive encourages all local authorities to consider innovative forms of service delivery such as the development of &quot;one-stop-shops&quot;.</p>

  <p>It has provided practical encouragement to this kind of innovation through the Modernising Government Fund (MGF). This has awarded &#163;2 million towards the &quot;Wired West Lothian&quot; project, which is one of a series of MGF supported initiatives that promote inter-agency working and the use information and communications technology (ICT) to provide more joined up services to the public.</p>

  <p>MGF projects are scheduled to run until March 2002. All of the projects will be monitored, with regular updates and results published on the Scottish Executive&#8217;s 21st Century Government website. This way all local authorities will benefit from the good practice that results from the projects.</p>

  <p>The Executive has also established the Central Local 21st Century Government Forum, which includes representatives of West Lothian Council. This has been set up to endorse and promote new models of service delivery across local authorities.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Executive has also agreed to consider whether there are unnecessary barriers to the development of service solutions such as one-stop shops within constraints on local authority trading and, if so, how best to deal with them.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to tackling poverty and deprivation wherever it exists across urban and rural Scotland. A range of data is used to assess deprivation, such as proportions of income support recipients, employment data, the deprivation index and indicators in the Social Inclusion Partnership monitoring framework. Our recent annual report on social justice sets out the indicators being used to track progress towards the milestones for delivering social justice in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The current Scottish Deprivation Index, revised in 1998, ranks postcode sectors by combining 1991 Census indicators with more recent non-Census indicators of deprivation. We intend to further revise this index as part of our Neighbourhood Statistics initiative and update it as data becomes available from Census 2001.</p>

  <p>In addition, for rural deprivation, part of the remit of the Rural Poverty and Inclusion Working Group is to ensure that existing indicators are appropriately developed for, and measurable in, rural areas. The group will make recommendations on general data availability for rural areas, including ways of improving monitoring of progress against the social justice milestones for rural areas. We expect the group&#8217;s report soon.</p>

  <p>It is not yet clear what cost implications might arise for residential homes from the implementation of the National Care Standards. However, before making any final decisions on the standards, the Scottish Executive is committed to consulting on the possible cost implications for service providers.</p>

  <p>It is proposed to carry out the cost consultation in two stages. Stage 1 will begin just after Easter and will focus on residential care services and, in particular, costs associated with recommendations on staffing ratios, room sizes and en-suite facilities. Stage 2 of the cost consultation will begin in late summer and will consider the costs associated with implementation of the full set of care standards.</p>

  <p>The Executive has also allocated &#163;1.26 billion to local authorities for social work this year. This represents a 10% increase on last year. It is for local authorities to decide how best to spend these monies in the light of local priorities.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to my answer to his question S1W-12506.</p>

  <p>A preliminary analysis has been completed of the proposed Public/Private Partnership (PPP) for the joint procurement of the M77 Fenwick to Malletsheugh and the Glasgow Southern Orbital. That analysis showed that the proposed PPP would be likely to be a cost-effective method of procurement, and has permitted draft tender documents to be progressed.</p>

  <p>A more refined analysis of the viability of the PPP will be completed before tender documents are issued, and a further check on the viability will be undertaken once tenders have been returned.</p>

  <p>If the PPP remains viable, tenders will be issued later this summer and a contract awarded towards the end of next year. This is the same timescale as I announced following the Strategic Roads Review.</p>

  <p>The information is not available in entirety in the form requested. What is available is set out in the following tables. Neither a mumps and rubella combined vaccination nor single antigen mumps vaccine has been offered by the NHS in Scotland. In response to a measles outbreak in Scotland, there was a schools-based campaign providing measles and rubella combined vaccination in 1994-95 and it was estimated that 90.4% of the target population were vaccinated at that time.</p>

  <p>No information has been collected centrally on single vaccinations that may have been provided by general practitioners privately, using imported vaccines.</p>

  <p>Local voluntary organisations make an important contribution to health improvement and health care services across Scotland. Health boards are best placed to judge, in consultation with local voluntary organisations and other partners, how to use their discretionary powers to provide financial assistance to the voluntary sector. The Scottish Executive would not expect to be involved in these decisions. Overall, health board allocations have increased by an average of 6.5% from 2000-01 to 2001-02.</p>

  <p>It is not appropriate to make an estimate at this stage as neither the investment programme nor the proposed charge increases for the years beyond 2001-02 have been agreed.</p>

  <p>The proposed merger of the three existing water authorities is dependent on the successful passage of the Water Services Bill through Parliament, during which information of this nature will be presented. If the merger is accepted, there will be some transition costs, the exact level of which will be dependent upon decisions which have yet to be made. These are likely to be insignificant in comparison to the reduction in operating and capital costs generated by the rationalisation of the industry.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no estimate for this scenario. The proposals to create a single water authority have as one of their objectives facilitating the optimum efficiency savings for the benefit of all consumers.</p>
