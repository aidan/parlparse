  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-1113 by Malcolm Chisholm on 17 July 2003, whether any NHS boards have procedures in place for introducing new drugs granted UK marketing authorisation into their formularies other than by receiving advice from the Scottish Medicines Consortium and, if so, what each such procedure involves.</p>

  <p>NHS boards determine their prescribing policy on new medicines taking into account local needs and advice from their Area Drug and Therapeutics Committees (ADTCs). The Scottish Medicines Consortium is a consortium of NHS boards. It brings together ADTCs to ensure that NHS boards receive the same advice on the clinical and cost effectiveness of new drugs as soon as practical after the launch of the products involved. This enables the NHS to plan the speedy introduction of beneficial treatment where appropriate.</p>

  <p>Yes. The health department issued guidance to NHS boards on regional planning in March 2002. The guidance included advice on planning and provision of services across NHS board boundaries. A copy can be found at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/sehd/mels/HDL2002_10.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/sehd/mels/HDL2002_10.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p>Other recent guidance to the NHS has emphasised the importance of collaborative planning and provision of services &#8211; for example, guidance dated September 2002 on establishing Managed Clinical Networks (MCNs), which may offer services across more than one board area. The guidance on MCNs can be found at <a href="http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/sehd/mels/HDL2002_69.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/sehd/mels/HDL2002_69.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p>In June 2003 the Executive published a draft bill, the NHS Reform (Scotland) Bill, which proposes that NHS boards should be given a new statutory duty to co-operate with each other, and with the Special Health Boards, to secure and advance the health of the people of Scotland.</p>

  <p>We expect NHS boards to follow national guidance on public engagement and consultation. One of the key principles of effective engagement with individuals and local communities over proposals for service change is that NHS boards are explicit about why change is necessary and what the options and restrictions are for future change. Issues around patient safety are paramount.</p>

  <p>The views of all local stakeholders should be taken into account in coming to a decision at the end of a consultation process.</p>

  <p>The Medical Research Council (MRC) is the main agency through which the UK Government supports medical and clinical research. Collaboration between the UK Health Departments and the MRC is formalised in a concordat designed to develop and maintain an effective partnership for the promotion, funding and management of UK medical research. The MRC spent &#163;2.1 million on multiple sclerosis (MS) research in the UK in 2001-02 with a similar amount spent in 2002-03 (final spend figures for this year are not yet available). The MRC expects to spend in the same region in 2003-04.</p>

  <p>Although the MRC has allocated resources for MS research, the Scottish Executive has placed no restrictions on the further funding of research in this area. The Chief Scientist Office (CSO), within the Scottish Executive Health Department, has responsibility for encouraging and supporting research into health and health care needs in Scotland. The CSO is largely a response mode funder of research and this role is well known and advertised throughout the health care and academic community.</p>

  <p>The CSO is not currently directly funding any research projects into MS. This is due to the fact that no research proposals on MS have been received in recent years. The CSO would be pleased to consider research proposals for innovative MS studies of a sufficiently high standard. These would be subject to the usual peer and committee review.</p>

  <p>No data are held centrally. Local authorities and the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) are responsible for action against fly-tipping. I understand that Scotland has also undertaken surveys on this topic and may be able to provide further data.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Fly-tipping Forum, funded by the Scottish Executive, is gathering information about fly-tipping. The forum is convened by Keep Scotland Beautiful, whose contact details are:</p>
