All conditions would be set out in full in any formal offer of assistance made towards such a project. In order to comply with current European Guidelines on National Regional Aid, grant offers would remain subject to those conditions for a minimum period of five years from the date of first payment of grant.</p>

  <p>The revenue allocation for the Scottish Ambulance Service for 2000-01 included an additional &pound;500,000 to enable it to put an extra 20 emergency ambulance staff into Glasgow. On 2 August, I was pleased to open a new &pound;1.2 million ambulance station at Shieldhall. This station is better positioned for the highest patient demand areas in the west of Glasgow, and should help to provide a more responsive and efficient service to the public.</p>

  <p>There are 605 paramedics in Scotland. There are vacancies in some parts of Scotland, but local managers ensure that paramedics are available on every shift. Earlier this year, the Executive demonstrated its commitment to paramedic training by providing additional funding of &pound;485,000 to train an additional 75 paramedics this year.

  <p>The Department of Health propose to pilot the use of HPV testing for women with borderline or mildly abnormal smears as part of the Cervical Screening Programme at three sites in England. The pilot is due to start in late spring 2001. The UK National Screening Committee will review the evidence from the pilot in due course and will make recommendations on its effectiveness which I will consider.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive will be monitoring progress with the pilot and the findings to see what lessons can be learned for the Cervical Screening Programme in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Research is currently underway, based at Dundee and Aberdeen University Hospitals, which is looking at the management of women with borderline or mildly abnormal smears and HPV testing is an integral part of the study. The study is due to report in 2005.</p>

  <p>There may be a number of reasons for the variation in registration rates from one local authority area to another, for example, variation in recording practices or different registration and deregistration criteria.</p>

  <p>We are working with others to develop a revised system for the collection of child protection information. The new system will require agreed definitions and other data standards.

  <p>The Scottish Executive encourages the National Museums and Galleries to ensure increased public access by including the provision of additional grants specific for that purpose. The National Cultural Strategy shows a key aim to increase public access and states no intention to change statutory free admission to local authority museums and galleries. In addition, the National Cultural Strategy confirmed the Executive&#8217;s intention to provide the sum of &pound;2 million a year to enable the National Museum of Scotland to abolish charges at the Royal Museum and the Museum of Scotland from 1 April 2001. In relation to the non-national museums and galleries, the Scottish Museums Council, funded by the Scottish Executive, is developing a social inclusion strategy which will assist museums to consider ways to increase visits by socially excluded people.</p>

  <p>UK research on <i>The Environmental Costs and Benefits of the Supply of Aggregates</i> was published by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions in July 1999. This surveyed a number of quarries, including two in Scotland, to derive a monetary value that the public placed on the impact of quarrying. There are no plans to undertake further research.</p>

  <p>The Executive would be supportive of any initiatives aimed at reducing the amount of litter and waste, particularly those sponsored by the industries which use packaging themselves.</p>

  <p>Presently, there are two flood prevention schemes submitted by local authorities being considered for confirmation by Scottish Ministers. One is from Perth and Kinross Council estimated to cost &pound;190,000, and the other from Renfrewshire Council estimated to cost &pound;693,000.</p>

  <p>There is no recommended time for the completion of a Fatal Accident Inquiry once a decision has been taken to hold one. The hearing, once commenced, can vary in length according to a number of different factors including the amount of evidence led, the availability of witnesses and legal representatives and the availability of court time.</p>

  <p>Detailed information on the salaries and salary and benefits packages combined for individual human resource directors, medical directors, directors of nursing services, finance directors and chief executives or their equivalents in acute or primary care NHS Trusts in the NHSiS is not held centrally. The remuneration of the chief executive and the highest paid director in a trust is published in individual Trust annual reports for the year concerned.</p>

  <p>The staff mentioned were for the years requested generally paid on general and senior managers terms and conditions, although medical directors may retain their consultant salary and additional payments, such as distinction awards and discretionary points. The pay ranges applicable to general and senior managers for the years 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99 is set out in the tables. The Trust managers&#8217; posts subject to the 1999 Trust reconfiguration have been thoroughly job evaluated and are now subject to scrutiny through the Central Evaluation Committee. The Health Act which came into force on 1 October 1999 contains a clause which enables Ministers to direct Trusts. The new arrangements for Executive Pay announced on 2 May 2000 in MEL (2000) 25 brought these staff under ministerial direction from 1 April 2000.</p>

  <p>Capital grants for land drainage projects have been phased out over the years. Restoration of capital grants for this purpose was not regarded as a priority in the responses to extensive consultations by the Executive in respect of the implementation of the EU Rural Development Regulation in Scotland. Consequently, we have no plans to provide assistance.</p>

  <p>The full-time equivalent of permanent staff employed in the main departments between 1 June 1997 in the Scottish Office and 1 February 2000 in the Scottish Executive are set out in the attached table.</p>

  <p>In the past three years, the definition of the core Scottish Executive (Scottish Office) has changed with movements of responsibilities into and out of the Office/Executive. The figures shown below have been backdated as far as possible for comparison purposes. Therefore, the Scottish Courts Administration and Parole Board staff (135 staff at February 2000) have been included within the core Office/Executive throughout the period, although the actual transfer of staff took place in July 1999.</p>

  <p>I understand that, following the selection of the Holyrood site on 9 January 1998, the new Parliament building project was administered by the Holyrood Project Team (HPT) within The Scottish Office. The HPT appointed a suitably qualified Project Manager, (who was initially appointed as a Project Adviser), who produced a Building User Brief, seeking advice from appropriate Scottish Office Departments and from the Consultative Steering Group as required. The SPCB acquired legal responsibility for the project on 1 June 1999 and received regular briefing from the HPT and the Design Team on a wide range of issues, including budgets. The composition of the original budget estimates is a matter which was investigated by the Auditor General for Scotland in preparing his recent report into the Management of the Holyrood Project.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body has established the Holyrood Progress Group (HPG) in accordance with the resolution passed by Parliament on 5 April 2000. In addition, the responsibilities of the previous Project Sponsor have been split between the recently appointed Project Director and a Financial Controller, and a new post of secretary to the HPG has been established. Both of these initiatives have been commended by the Auditor General for Scotland in his recent report into the management of the Holyrood Project.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer, further to the answers to questions S1W-233 and S1W-5937 by the Presiding Officer on 8 July 1999 and 5 April 2000 respectively, whether individual works packages are each allocated a budget to cover all costs associated with the package, or whether contingency allowances are not allocated to individual works packages and, if there has been a change in procedures, when and why the change took place.</p>

  <p>I understand from the Convener of the Holyrood Progress Group that individual works packages each have a budget allocation to cover all identified costs. The contingency is contained within a global sum from which amounts can be drawn down in the event of unforeseen eventualities, with the approval of the Holyrood Progress Group. No change of procedure has been involved.</p>

  <p>There are two main Parliamentary Pension Schemes and they are affected differently by the abolition of advance corporation tax credit for pension funds.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body has made arrangements to allow the staff of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to be members of the Principle Civil Service Pension Scheme. This is a notional pension scheme and is not affected by the abolition of advance corporation tax credits.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Parliamentary Pension Scheme was established to make pension provision for Members of the Scottish Parliament. This scheme is affected by the abolition of advance corporation tax credits, and the effect is estimated to be an overall reduction of 0.1% of the total value of the fund. The fund was valued at &pound;1.4 million at 31 March 2000. No forecast of the value of the fund at 31 March 2001 is available.</p>
