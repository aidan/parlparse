  <p>There are two types of crop inspection carried out by officials from the Environment and Rural Affairs Department.</p>

  <p>Although not obliged to do so, it is usual practice for inspectors to advise growers before inspecting seed potato, cereal and horticultural crops under Plant Health and Seeds Certification Schemes.</p>

  <p>EU Regulations also require department officials to inspect 5% of arable and forage crops on which assistance has been claimed as part of an IACS Area Aid application. The IACS Regulation requires inspections to be carried out as on-the-spot checks, which should be unannounced. However, advance notice not exceeding 48 hours can be given provided this does not jeopardise the purpose of the inspection.</p>

  <p>The proposed consultation will be on a draft of the service specification to be used when the services currently provided by Caledonian MacBrayne are put out to competitive tender in line with European law. The consultative draft specification will set out proposals on the routes to be covered in the tender, including requirements to be imposed in regard to fares and frequency of service. The proposals will reflect the commitment previously given that fares and levels of service will be protected. We will be consulting widely on the draft service specification in due course and I expect the final service specification will be completed later this year.</p>

  <p>Evidence points to the fact that Scotland&#8217;s cancer record would improve substantially with more rapid diagnosis and earlier treatment, in particular, where surgery is the treatment of choice. Securing faster diagnosis and shorter waiting times are therefore among the highest priorities for the Scottish Executive&#8217;s cancer strategy. Building capacity through enhanced endoscopy capability should particularly impact on gastro-intestinal cancers, which are potentially curable by surgery when detected at an early stage.</p>

  <p>The expected benefits to be derived from the investments planned, including milestones, targets and responsible leads, are included in the published document available on www.scotland.gov.uk or from www.show.scot.nhs.uk. Copies of the plans have been placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>Within the Scottish Executive Health Department, the Chief Scientist Office (CSO) has responsibility for encouraging and supporting research into health services and patient care within the NHS in Scotland and, as such, is the main departmental funder of NHS-related research.</p>

  <p>CSO is currently funding 11 research projects with a total value of &#163;1,261,450 on breast cancer, five of which, with a total value of &#163;499,377, are into the causes of breast cancer. Details of these projects are available from the National Research Register, a copy of which is in the Scottish Parliament Reference Centre (Bib. number 17404).</p>

  <p>Cancer remains a health research priority and as such the CSO would be happy to consider further research proposals into this matter.</p>

  <p>In our project-based approach, we aim to concentrate our efforts on the highest priority services; i.e. those services which have the maximum impact on the maximum number of people and where an improved service would deliver the greatest benefit to the citizen. The Modernising Government Fund has supported joined up working and funded bids which meet the Scottish Executive's key modernising priorities for the public sector.

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to supporting vulnerable families and ensuring that all children receive the best start in life. From 20 December 2001, 16- and 17-year-olds with disabilities have been able to receive direct payments to purchase children&#8217;s services. The Community Care and Health (Scotland) Bill includes a number of provisions which will help to make direct payments more widely available and make it possible for parents of children with disabilities to receive direct payments to purchase services for their child. The Bill also extends the rights of carers to include an assessment of their ability to care and will ensure that carers&#8217; views are taken into account.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is also providing almost &#163;2.2 million per annum to the Family Fund Trust for grants to families with severely disabled children to allow them to continue to care for their child at home.</p>

  <p>The <i>UK Competitive Index 2001</i> shows Scotland retaining its competitive position over the year based on a wide range of indicators. However it is difficult to make an accurate evaluation of an economic consultancy survey compared to official data from the Office for National Statistics.</p>

  <p>Official data shows Scotland performing robustly in terms of regional GDP, with only the East, the South East and London having a higher GDP per head in the UK. The labour market continued to perform strongly in 2001, with the rate of claimant count unemployment at around its lowest for a generation.</p>

  <p>Following checking of payment claims, a total of &#163;9,707,500 was paid to authorities in late September and early October. The timing of credits to individual school accounts is a matter for the local authorities, but should have happened soon after the payments were made.</p>

  <p>The distribution to authorities was made on the basis of an amount per school according to various school roll bands in the primary, secondary and special school sectors. Authorities were advised that they might wish to be guided by that distribution scale in distributing the resources to schools. While it is a condition of grant that all schools will benefit, it is open to authorities to vary these amounts in order better to reflect local priorities and the local implications of such factors as very small schools, recent refurbishment, or other significant recent investments in particular schools or across schools for particular purposes.</p>

  <p>The Scottish labour market is dynamic. The monthly labour market statistics from the Office of National Statistics give net employment changes from quarter to quarter. There are large shifts between employment, unemployment and inactivity each month/quarter. Any attempt to measure job loss figures is likely to be swamped by these large flows.</p>

  <p>The Labour Force Survey (run by the Office of National Statistics) provides data on a quarterly basis for redundancies, although it is a survey of households and individuals, not businesses. The information collected on redundancies relates to whether an individual was made redundant in the three months prior to the survey interview. The data, however, is not sufficiently large to disaggregate reliably below an all-Scotland level.</p>

  <p>Jobs are constantly being created and lost across the country as firms start-up, expand, contract, close or merge. It would be a substantial burden on business - and indeed all employers to require notifications of all job changes.</p>

The Department of Trade and Industry therefore hold information on those proposed redundancies that fall within the scope of the Act.

  <p>The Community Care and Health (Scotland) Bill, introduced on 24 September 2001, Part 2, Section 12 allows NHS bodies and local authorities to work together in different ways by removing some of the legal barriers to joint working which currently exist.</p>

  <p>A consultation paper on the Executive's proposals for a Local Government Bill issued in early December 2001 with a closing date for responses on 6 February 2002. One of the proposals in the Bill is a general power for councils to promote the well-being of their area. This power will remove any constraints on councils from developing a broader and more innovative role. The legislation will introduce a duty on other bodies such as NHS Boards to engage in the Community Planning process. The Bill will be introduced in spring this year.</p>

  <p>The Executive is providing support for two posts based in COSLA which will further enhance local authorities' public health capacity. Funding of &#163;1.5 million over three years has also been made available to support joint funded health improvement posts in every local authority.</p>

  <p>The consistent development of clinical information systems across Scotland is being supported by the work of the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland, ISD and Audit Scotland. During 2001 they held two national meetings to review national databases in order to identify information sources suitable for monitoring the quality of direct patient care. A further meeting is planned with wider participation in spring 2002.</p>

  <p>In addition improving the quality of clinical information was a key strand of the recent CRAG Symposium, <i>Improving Quality of Care for Patients: Sharing Principles and Practice</i>. This showcased examples of good practice in developing consistent information systems to support direct patient care and to bring about improvements in patient management. CRAG has also supported the development of the <i>Strategy Programme for Information &amp; Management </i>which sets out national and local programmes and targets for establishing greater collaboration and consistency of approach to the development of information management and technology (IM&amp;T) across NHS Scotland. As part of this wider work CRAG will support a conference on IM&amp;T systems in April.</p>

  <p>In September 2001, we established 15 new NHS boards to enhance local decision making in NHSScotland. The membership of the new boards &#8211; which now includes elected local councillors, NHS staff and clinicians &#8211; has been specifically designed to provide a better reflection of the communities they serve.</p>

  <p>Putting in place the new, unified local NHS systems has involved more than 100 new non-executive appointments to NHS boards and trusts since January 2001, each of which has been made in line with guidance issued by the Commissioner for Public Appointments. This process has included local and national advertising campaigns, most notably for the Chairpersons of 13 NHS boards and five trusts, which have attracted a wide range of applicants from diverse backgrounds.</p>

  <p>Additionally, <i>Patient Focus and Public Involvement</i>, published in December 2001, requires each new NHS Board to work closely with its community planning partners and voluntary organisations to develop a sustainable framework to support local public involvement.</p>

  <p>A number of initiatives, many of which were announced in <i>Public bodies: Proposals for change </i>(June 2001), are currently under way to ensure that national NHS bodies are fit for purpose and efficiently structured. These include:</p>

  <p>work to establish a new Special Health Board for education, training and lifelong learning for all NHSScotland staff in April 2002;</p>

  <p>an examination of the structure and relationships of all national bodies with an interest in clinical quality, such as the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland and the Health Technology Board for Scotland; and</p>

  <p>Since the publication of <i>Our National Health: a plan for action, a plan for change</i> , a number of steps have been taken to improve communications with and by NHSScotland. For example, ministers meet regularly with NHS Board Chairs, the Chief Executive of NHSScotland holds regular meetings with NHS Chief Executives and senior officials have regular dialogue with key stakeholder groups. The importance of effective two-way communication features highly in these discussions.</p>

  <p>Effective communication with patients and the public is a key theme of the plans outlined in <i>Patient Focus and Public Involvement</i> published in December 2001.</p>

  <p>Additionally, the Health Department has introduced a web-based Weekly Bulletin aimed at alerting the NHS, local authorities and other key stakeholders to publications, guidance and other papers issued by the department. The department has recently appointed a Corporate Communications Manager who will have a key role in working with NHSScotland to develop a structured programme to further improve communications.</p>

  <p><i>Patient Focus and Public Involvement</i> , published in December of last year, reported on steps taken to develop the actions identified in the <i>Involving People</i> section of <i>Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change</i> . It also indicated that NHS boards will be expected to take a pro-active and positive approach to public involvement on issues of potential service change. It stressed that involving the public should not be seen as something that has to be done at the end of a process, but something that is part of an integrated process of communication and discussion; where communities, patients, public and NHS staff have opportunities to influence decision making. The NHS must be able to demonstrate through this inclusive process that it listens to, is supportive of, and takes account of views and suggestions.</p>

  <p>Revised guidance on public involvement in service change will be issued in March.</p>

  <p>The report of a pre-consultation exercise on the effectiveness of the Patients' Charter was published in May 2000. Subsequently, the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland (CSBS) was asked to develop its patient care or "generic" standards. As stated in <i>Patient Focus and Public Involvement, </i> the Scottish Consumer Council (SCC) has now been commissioned to work with the CSBS and local health councils to develop a more comprehensive replacement for the Charter that will incorporate:</p>

  <p>a guide to the NHS;</p>

  <p>standards focusing on patient entitlements, based on the CSBS generic standards;</p>

  <p>the responsibilities of patients using the NHS, and</p>

  <p>information about medical records, legal rights, and the complaints procedure.</p>

  <p>The SCC will involve the public in the development of this package and consider the scope of any further public consultation.</p>

  <p>The public consultation on the recommendations of the Scottish Charity Law Commission&#8217;s Report (Bib. No. 14703) closed on 30 September. An analysis of the responses is almost complete and will be published on the Executive&#8217;s website as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>The membership of the Charity Law Advisory Forum which I announced on 23 October will be published shortly. The Advisory Forum will provide an opportunity for the voluntary sector and key agencies to contribute to the analysis of issues and options for implementation, which will need to be addressed in and beyond the legislative process. This will add value to the recent wider consultations, enabling ministers to decide how precisely to take forward the commission&#8217;s recommendations.</p>

  <p>The Executive does not keep a record of Westminster legislation creating UK or GB offences. Since 1 July 1999, 16 Acts have been passed at Westminster with the consent of the Scottish Parliament in respect of devolved areas. In the same time there have been 28 Acts of the Scottish Parliament. Much, but not all, of this legislation created new offences under Scots law.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive maintains a database of new legislation that allocates codes to the breach of legislative provisions to enable prosecution statistics to be collected. In some instances one code covers a number of separate offences contained within an Act of Parliament. It is not possible therefore to use the database to quantify the number of new offences created since July 1999.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive why original invoices are required by its Environment and Rural Affairs Department for Sheep Annual Premium Scheme audits and whether farmers should be entitled to withhold information, such as vendors&#8217; names and prices, which may be commercially sensitive.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-01-21.S1W-21528.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80155" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0121.htm#20">

  <p>Invoices are required to fulfil the inspection requirements that the department is obliged, by EC Regulation, to undertake. Sheep Annual Premium is paid to producers who maintain the claimed number of eligible animals throughout a 100-day retention period. It is not feasible to undertake all inspections prior to payment so that officials need to take account of any changes in the flock (due to purchases, sales, deaths, etc) between the date of claim and date of inspection. The inspection seeks a reconciliation between the number of animals counted and the number claimed and in order to have confidence in the result, the inspectors need to examine the original documents. This is similar to say an accountant who needs to see original sale or purchase invoices as part of an audit.</p>

  <p>Regarding the second part of the question, farmers are obliged to co-operate with inspections and confirm that they will do so by signing the declaration at the time of claim submission. Again, under EC Regulation, the department is obliged to refuse payment or seek recovery of subsidy paid, if any action by a producer prevents the inspection from being undertaken. However, I hope such actions could be avoided and I would encourage producers with particular concerns to contact their local area offices.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, I must add that officials see a wide-range of information in the course of their normal work that could be considered commercially sensitive. The department&#8217;s published service standards, however, require them to treat such information in confidence and prohibit them from divulging details to third parties.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-7101 by Mr Jim Wallace on 7 June 2000, how many (a) officers and (b) other staff the Scottish Prison Service has been notified currently receive Working Families Tax Credit.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Eligibility for Working Families Tax Credit (WFTC), which is a matter for the Inland Revenue, does not depend solely on income. SPS have been notified of 48 members of staff to receive WFTC, of whom 25 are prison officers.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-19469 by Iain Gray on 26 November 2001, why the Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service did not provide information at that time on the provision of mandate forms under the Data Protection Act in prisons.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mr Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Prison Service keeps its policy and procedures on data protection under review. As part of that process, and following a suggestion from an MP, we decided in December to make data protection mandate forms available in prisons, as well as sending them to all MSPs and MPs. This amendment to our procedures was made after the answer to which the member refers.</p>

  <p>The police, Scottish Courts Services, and the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) will proceed with contracting-out the escorting of prisoners. The range of such escorting will be from police cells and prisons to court, the management of prisoners within court buildings and escorting throughout SPS. There will be a restructuring of the police presence retained in court for public order purposes.</p>

  <p>By contracting-out the escorting of prisoners to a specialist provider, significant benefits will accrue to the criminal justice system. The disruptive impact that providing escorts currently has on the continuity of provision of prison industries and offending programmes will cease. This will enable us to concentrate our efforts on the core task of reducing reoffending. The police will look to return officers, released from court and escort duty, to core policing roles within their communities.</p>

  <p>SPS, as the only national service with the necessary legal powers, will manage the contract. The preparations for contracting-out and the tender negotiations will be undertaken by a Criminal Justice Inter-Agency Group comprising representatives of the police, Scottish Court Services and SPS, with the SPS taking the lead.</p>

  <p>It is expected that the developing and letting of the contracts will be completed in approximately one year and that the contractors will take on escort duties in a phased process during 2003-04.</p>

  <p>No such monitoring is currently undertaken. However, one of the principal objectives of our policy to promote renewable energy is to help Scottish companies to benefit from the increasing opportunities arising from the exploitation of Scotland&#8217;s huge potential in this field. We will continue to work closely with both Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise on this, with the aim of increasing the many hundreds of jobs in Scotland already dependent on the design, installation and maintenance of renewable energy schemes.</p>

  <p>Upon wind-up the two Scottish Transport Group pension fund schemes are liable to taxation which is payable to the Inland Revenue. As I announced in Parliament on 29 November agreement has been reached between the Scottish Executive and UK Government that up to &#163;118 million of any sums remaining should now be paid out to members of the Scottish Transport Group Pension Schemes by means of ex-gratia payments. These are sums, payable as a lump sum rather than as an addition to pensions, which members of the schemes would not have otherwise been due under the rules which govern the pension schemes. Scottish ministers will distribute the ex-gratia payments as soon as possible after the pension schemes&#8217; trustees have discharged their obligation to wind-up the pension schemes. There is no intention that any part of sums paid to the Inland Revenue or HM Treasury, or retained by Scottish ministers to be used in making ex-gratia payments, will be used for a contingency fund against potential legal action.</p>

  <p>Our tourism industry derives considerable benefit from the promotion of our diverse culture. I intend to ensure that the linkages between the tourism and culture sectors are effective so that both derive maximum benefit from the activities of the other. VisitScotland is developing a national product portfolio in which a wide range of cultural activities will feature strongly. This will focus and enhance the marketing effort.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is in regular contact with the UK Government on a wide range of issues. The Executive is currently considering how best to develop a programme of events throughout the year within the wider Scottish Tourism Strategy to raise the profile and understanding of Burns both at home and abroad.</p>
