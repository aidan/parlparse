  <p>The current options available to a farmer to challenge a decision by the Scottish Executive under the Sheep Annual Premium Scheme 1999, or any other agricultural subsidy scheme, include asking for Judicial Review in the Court of Session. Whether Judicial Review provides adequate and full review to comply with the European Convention on Human Rights depends on the applicant&#8217;s complaints and the context. The European Court of Human Rights has accepted that the availability of Judicial Review may well be adequate. In any case the Scottish Executive has undertaken to create a new right of challenge for administrative decisions (currently out for consultation), which would complement any rights to Judicial Review and would be sufficient for the purposes of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether, pursuant to the published letter sent by Commissioner Franz Fischler to Mr Ben Gill, President of the National Farmers&#8217; Union of England and Wales, it will take action under article 87(2)(b) of the Treaty of Rome to ask the European Commission for permission to aid the pig industry in mitigating the additional costs resultant from the BSE crisis.</p>

  <p>Given that BSE controls apply throughout the UK, it is almost certain that the EU would not approve measures for Scotland alone under article 87(2)(b) of the Treaty. The most significant BSE-related cost borne by the pig industry has been the prohibition of porcine MBM in animal feed. Commissioner Fischler, however, in his letter to Ben Gill queried whether the effects of the BSE crisis could continue to be regarded as exceptional circumstances. Nevertheless, the Scottish Executive, in conjunction with other UK Agriculture Departments, will continue to explore whether there are factors which would meet the State Aid requirements, bearing in mind the need to target those most in need, namely the pig farmers.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has regular contact with both Highlands and Islands Enterprise and Scottish Enterprise on the local delivery of business support and other issues. While decisions on support for specific businesses are for the enterprise network, we are keen to improve the quality and consistency of advice available across Scotland, and I hope to announce details of new initiatives soon. In supporting the small business sector it is important to ensure that assistance is tailored to the needs of the business concerned, and that this includes appropriate aftercare arrangements.</p>

  <p>As an example, I understand, the HIE Network operates a structured aftercare programme for all businesses in receipt of Network assistance. This is both to protect the investment of public funds and also to help the continuing development of individual businesses.</p>

  <p>The Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) began a review of the thirty month rule in November 1998. The Committee&#8217;s conclusion, announced on 22 December 1999, was that no change should be made at this time as it may reintroduce an unacceptable level of risk. The Committee also recommended that the existing controls continue to be rigorously enforced, but that it will continue to keep the position under review. This advice has been accepted by the Executive.</p>

  <p>There is no uniform approach to the way in which hospices&#8217; drug costs are met. The degree to which a health board supports the pharmaceutical element of a hospice&#8217;s work is a matter for negotiation between health board and hospice when discussing the terms of their service agreement each year.</p>

  <p>All EU Regulations, which impact on producers, were the subject of detailed scrutiny by the Red Tape Review panel of industry representatives. Their report was handed over on 26 January and I am now considering the recommendations. The Panel investigated the perception that the UK over-interprets EC Regulations and applies them more stringently than other member states but concluded this was not the case. The Panel did have a concern about the proportionality of some penalties imposed by the EU Regulations, especially where they are the result of inadvertent error in completing the forms and about the lack of flexibility in the imposition of those penalties. I share these concerns and intend to pursue them with the EU.</p>

  <p>The Regulations governing EU agricultural subsidies are reviewed regularly by Agricultural Departments in the UK on an individual and collective basis. The need for change is also discussed regularly with the EU and the other member states before revisions are introduced. The Regulations are designed to deter fraudulent activity and serious negligence. We do, however, feel that in some instances the penalties imposed by the EU Regulations appear disproportionate, especially where they are applied following inadvertent errors on the forms. We are having ongoing discussion with the EU on this matter, but whilst we have been able to secure some changes to the Regulations to allow acceptance of some errors, we do not feel that these go far enough. We are continuing to pursue the possibility that further discretion should be given to member states.</p>

  <p>I have invited the football authorities in Scotland and the Scottish Federation of Football Supporters to let me have their views in writing by 11 February on the ideas discussed in the Co-operative Party&#8217;s pamphlet <i>Mutualism &#8211; A Golden Goal?</i> The issue was raised at a meeting Mr Sam Galbraith and I had with these and other bodies on 18 January. At their request, I met Ms Cathy Jamieson MSP, Mike Watson MSP and Mr Joe Hill (Co-operative Party) on 25 January to discuss the issue of supporter involvement in football clubs.</p>

  <p>I have no plans to meet the Aberdeen Football Club Supporters Association or any other group associated with an individual club, but if they or any other bodies or individuals wish to submit views in writing, we would be pleased to consider them.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has considered the legal implications of the Cubie recommendations. It has concluded that, were these recommendations to be implemented, there would be a serious risk of the UK being held to be in breach of EU law, insofar as these recommendations extended to Scottish domiciled students attending institutions in other parts of the UK. The Executive&#8217;s own proposals which have just been announced are accordingly restricted to Scottish and EU students attending institutions in Scotland.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, <a name="QuestionText"> further to the answers to questions S1W-851 and S1W-3472 by Henry McLeish on 5 November 1999 and 11 January 2000 respectively, whether it will lay the Quigley Report before the Parliament and what plans it has for a debate on it.</a></p>

  <p>The Quigley Committee's report which is required to be delivered by April 2000 will be placed in the Scottish Parliament at the same time as it is laid before the Westminster Parliament. The Scottish Executive will consider its response when it has received the report. <br /></p>
