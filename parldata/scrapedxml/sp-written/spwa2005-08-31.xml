  <p>I attended the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Luxembourg on 20 and 21 June 2005 together with Margaret Beckett, Lord Bach and Carwyn Jones.</p>

  <p>On agriculture, the Council reached agreement on a new EU Rural Development Regulation for 2007-2013. The UK welcomed the simpler, more flexible approach promoted in the Regulation and secured a joint Commission and Council Declaration that additional voluntary modulation (the transfer of funds from direct subsidy payments to rural development) will be examined as part of the discussions on the Financial Perspectives for 2007-2013. The article relating to the budget for the Rural Development Regulation made clear that funding levels will be decided in the context of discussions on the Financial Perspectives.</p>

  <p>The Council took note of a progress report on negotiations to update EU rules on avian influenza.</p>

  <p>Over lunch, Commissioner Fischer Boel updated ministers on progress in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) agriculture negotiations. Member states took note and asked to be kept fully informed of the negotiations as they develop. The UK undertook, as incoming President of the Council, to work closely with member states and the Commission to secure the best possible outcome on this important dossier.</p>

  <p>Under Any Other Business, the Council was informed of the outcome of last month&rsquo;s World Animal Health Organisation (Office International des Epizooties) conference and took note of progress on the Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade dossier and, at the request of the Netherlands, on member state collaboration on agricultural research. A number of member states intervened to highlight the problems posed by over-supply of the EU cereals market. Germany presented a paper calling for more action to promote fair trade products.</p>

  <p>On fisheries, the Council failed to reach agreement on the European Fisheries Fund. The main disagreement was over the use of the fund to help subsidise the building of new boats. The UK supported the Commission's position that fishing capacity was already out of line with fish stocks and that new builds should not be subsidised. Discussion on how this portfolio can be taken forward will be held during the UK Presidency.</p>

  <p>It was agreed that further technical discussions should be held on management measures for the Mediterranean Sea, with a view to reaching agreement during the UK Presidency.</p>

  <p>Under any other business, the Commission raised Norway's unilateral decision to close its blue whiting fisheries, following scientific evidence that the Spawning Stock Biomass (SSB) of the stock has dropped by 25% compared to 2004. The Commission took the opportunity to note the member states' positions on this matter with a view to the negotiations to be held on 27 June 2005.</p>

  <p>Finally, the Council took note of the request by the Belgian delegation (10118/05), supported by other member states, concerning the problems caused by increases in fuel prices and their consequences for the fishing industry.</p>

  <p>The Commission took note of member states&rsquo; views. A working party chaired by the Commission and bringing together fishing-industry professionals had concluded its proceedings and the Commission would consider what practical measures could be envisaged.</p>

  <p>At the end of the meeting, Commissioner Fischer Boel and the UK praised the outgoing President of the Council for the significant successes achieved under the Luxembourg Presidency.</p>

  <p>The Health and Safety Executive&rsquo;s reports on the Management of Occupational Stress in the Scottish Ambulance Service Board and the Management of Health and Safety in the Scottish Ambulance Board were received at the same time and relate to the same audit. The Scottish Ambulance Service is on course to implement all of the action points covered in the reports within the prescribed timescales.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how much, in total, the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art has spent on purchasing new acquisitions in each of the last three years; what proportion of these sums has been spent on works purchased, or originating from, artists resident in Scotland, and what criteria are used in deciding on such purchases, particularly with regard to the representation of the work of modern artists resident in Scotland.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-08-31.4.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80030" speakername="Patricia Ferguson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa0831.htm#3">

  <p>I have asked Richard Calvocoressi, Director of the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, to provide the detailed information requested. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>We see it as one of our prime duties to acquire works of modern and contemporary Scottish art. Our criteria are based on quality (i.e. the works we deem are of museum standard) and a desire to represent the broad patterns of styles, as and when they develop.</p>

  <p>A number of monetary bequests and gifts left to the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art are solely meant for the acquisition of Scottish art, so a large proportion of our spend on Scottish art comes from these sources, and not from the annual grant-in-aid.</p>

  <p>You will note that our total spend on Scottish art is something in the region of 14%. There are two matters to bear in mind when considering this statistic: Scottish art is not expensive in global terms, and so we can represent the best of Scottish art without making great expenditure; many of our Scottish acquisitions are in the form of gifts, not purchases.</p>

  <p>The details requested are tabulated in the following:</p>

  <p>I announced recently that a Scottish bowel cancer screening programme for all men and women aged from 50 to 74 will be rolled out from March 2007, with all health boards involved in the programme by 2009. This follows a successful pilot which has been running in Tayside, Grampian and Fife Health Board areas since 2000. As at January 2005 over 330,000 people have been screened for bowel cancer in these three areas.</p>

  <p>All individuals in the screening age range will be invited to complete a test kit at home every two years. Returned kits will be screened at a central laboratory, call/recall and helpline facility, based at Dundee&rsquo;s Kings Cross. Individuals with a non-negative result will then be invited for follow-up investigation. We expect to reduce mortality rates in the target population by 15%, potentially preventing over 150 lives being lost to bowel cancer per year.</p>

  <p>We have already made available &pound;2 million of capital funding to finance the extension of the Dundee laboratory and the development of a new IT system in order to prepare for national rollout of the programme.</p>

  <p>&quot;Bowel cancer&quot; has been interpreted as referring to cancer of the large bowel which is also known as colorectal cancer.</p>

  <p>Table (a) shows the number of people diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 1995 and 2001 by NHS board area. 2001 is the most recent year for which incidence data is complete. Table (b) shows the number of people who died from colorectal cancer between 1998 and 2004 by NHS board area.</p>

  <p>While cancer incidence continues to rise, death rates overall are reducing, as projected in <i>Cancer Scenarios </i>(Scottish Executive 2001, updated 2004). Earlier detection and improved treatments are contributing to these encouraging improvements in survival.</p>

  <p>The UK Colorectal Cancer Screening pilot commenced in April 2000 and included both Scottish and English programmes. Men and women aged from 50 to 69 were invited to complete a home test kit with returned kits being screened at laboratories in England and Scotland. An evaluation report on the UK pilot published in July 2003, (this can be viewed online at <a href="http://www.cancerscreening.nhs.uk/bowel/finalreport.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.cancerscreening.nhs.uk/bowel/finalreport.pdf</a> ) confirmed the potential benefits of bowel cancer screening.</p>

  <p>Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were collated by the Scottish and English teams throughout the pilot to monitor its effectiveness. A selection of the KPIs, such as overall uptake of screening, positivity rate and cancer/adenoma detection rates, will be used to assess results on a UK basis during national rollout of bowel cancer screening in Scotland which commences in March 2007.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-08-31.9.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80057" speakername="Mr Andy Kerr" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa0831.htm#4">

  <p>The Department of Health commissioned a team from Edinburgh, Warwick and Essex Universities to formally evaluate the Cancer Challenge screening pilot which ran in England and Scotland from April 2000 to December 2002. The target UK population was approximately 300,000 over the screening period.</p>

  <p>The following key outcomes are collated from the formal evaluation report submitted to the Department of Health in 2003 and also further statistical analysis of the complete dataset by NHS Information Services Division. <a href="http://www.cancerscreening.nhs.uk/bowel/finalreport.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.cancerscreening.nhs.uk/bowel/finalreport.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p>Screening for bowel cancer with faecal occult blood test (FOBt) kits in the general population is feasible and should be rolled out to a national programme.</p>

  <p>Overall uptake of screening in Scotland was 50.4% for males, 59.5% for females and 55% overall.</p>

  <p>Greater number of early stage cancers detected in the population being screened compared to the population that have not been screened (Dukes A: screened population 22.5%, non-screened population 12.6%).</p>

  <p>UK pilot had a considerable impact on workload in secondary care including increased demand for non-screening colonoscopy services and a substantial impact on pathology services.</p>

  <p>The impact on primary care was modest.</p>

  <p>Systematic review indicates that FOBt screening costs approximately &pound;2,000 per Quality Adjusted Life Year and appears relatively cost effective &ndash; at this level FOBt screening is well within arbitrary &quot;efficiency&quot; thresholds and commensurate with other population based cancer screening programmes.</p>

  <p>The National Curriculum Guidelines 5-14 seek to ensure that the curriculum secures breadth, balance, continuity and progression for all pupils. Responsibility for setting policy and legislation for education in Scotland rests with the Scottish Executive Education Department (SEED). The means of delivery is not prescribed in legislation but rather it is the responsibility of local authorities and schools to determine how to implement legislative requirements to meet local needs and circumstances.</p>

  <p>However, SEED is fully committed to raising levels of attainment in literacy in Scottish schools. SEED has funded many initiatives including Building Bridges in Literacy P6-S2 under which local authorities have developed 36 projects focusing on literacy including writing skills. SEED also provides funding to local authorities to provide staff development in the teaching of writing.</p>

  <p>Inspection evidence demonstrates that writing is valued in Scottish schools. Many education authorities have prioritised the raising of pupils' attainment in writing and have produced structured courses, for example the North Lanarkshire Writing Pack, the South Lanarkshire Writing Pack and New Horizons in Writing from Glasgow City Council. Some of these approaches have been adopted by other education authorities and are well supported by CPD for teachers.</p>

  <p>Scotland&rsquo;s system of National Qualifications also ensures that there are challenging but achievable qualifications in English for candidates of all abilities, from Access 2 to Advanced Higher Level. At all levels these courses develop and extend writing skills, and there are specific creative writing options available in Standard Grade, Intermediate, Higher and Advanced Higher courses.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to give the precise cost of legal aid for &quot;slopping out&quot; cases. These are not recorded as a distinct category of civil legal aid cases.</p>

  <p>Some expenditure will also have been incurred on civil advice and assistance cases relating to &quot;slopping out&quot;, but it is impossible to identify these separately.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Legal Aid Board estimates that as at 31 March 2005 it had paid out &pound;1.17 million on civil legal aid for slopping out cases. It has so far recovered &pound;1.023 million of this expenditure, leaving a net cost of civil legal aid of around &pound;147,000.

  <p>This will be a matter for the newly configured health boards to consider. In general, hospital systems or departmental systems such as laboratory or radiology systems only hold data for patients treated within these settings. Where it is necessary to share information between hospitals, or between hospitals and primary care, a common infrastructure exists which allows data to be shared using the Community Health Index number. NHS boards may wish to consider whether the geographic coverage of current patient information repositories and indexes need to be changed to reflect any changes in patient care patterns. Current NHS IT infrastructure would enable such changes if required and reduce the length and cost of such an exercise which would need to be assessed locally in the light of local circumstances.</p>

  <p>This will be a matter for the newly configured NHS board to consider. Current NHS IT infrastructure would enable such changes if required and reduce the length and cost of such an exercise, the need for which would need to be assessed locally in the light of local circumstances.</p>

  <p>Nearly 60 separate awards with a total value of &pound;1 million were made across Scotland in response to police concerns about security arrangements at places of worship following 11 September 2001. Those security improvements remain in place. Police forces across Scotland continue to concentrate considerable effort and resources, liaising with communities, to allay concerns and to identify intelligence to ensure a proactive response to these issues. All reported racist incidents are treated appropriately by the police regardless of the type or location.</p>

  <p>The Office of Rail Regulation is currently consulting on methodology for disaggregating Network Rail&rsquo;s existing network-wide expenditure and revenue allowances to Scotland which will allow Network Rail to identify and report information separately for Scotland.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the terms of the current ScotRail franchise agreement on staffing levels for stations, including any required under the Fire Precautions (Sub-Surface Railway Stations) Regulations 1989, have been met.</p>

  <p>The ScotRail franchise agreement does not specify staffing levels for stations, though there are other requirements on staffing issues. Staffing requirements at stations form part of the franchisee&rsquo;s Railway Safety Case which is approved and monitored by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Rail Inspectorate, part of the Health and Safety Executive.</p>

  <p>Regulation 10(4) of the Fire Precautions (Sub-Surface Railway Stations) Regulations 1989 (as amended) requires rostering of station employees to ensure that there are at least two persons present on duty in the station premises at all times when members of the public have access to the premises. Enforcement of the regulations rests with fire and rescue authorities or joint fire and rescue boards. Information about compliance with the regulations is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>We will be undertaking a comprehensive programme of monitoring and evaluation of the health, economic and cultural impact of the smoke-free legislation. As part of that programme we will make use of existing datasets which provide detailed information on the employment and turnover of enterprises in the hospitality sector. For example, the labour force survey will give us quarterly updates on employment trends. The annual interdepartmental business register will allow analysis of trends in the number of enterprises and the churn rate of businesses by sector. The annual business survey will allow analysis of profitability. Data will be available on both a quarterly and annual basis and this will allow for analysis of pre-legislation and post-legislation trends in the performance of firms in this sector.</p>
