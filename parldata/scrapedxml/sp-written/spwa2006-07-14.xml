  <p>The Scottish Executive has no plans to amend the bursary regulations to include such children. Executive funds to authorities towards the cost of bursaries cease at the end of this financial year, as bursaries are superseded by the Education Maintenance Allowance.</p>

  <p>The term additional support needs now applies to children and young people who, for whatever reason, require additional support, long or short-term, in order to help them make the most of their school education. Therefore, it is not possible to estimate accurately the number of pupils with additional support needs at any given time.</p>

  <p>However, the 2006 pupil census will collect statistics on the number of pupils with additional support needs who have co-ordinated support plans and/or individualised educational programmes. Information will also continue to be collected on those pupils with a Record of Needs.</p>

  <p>The code of practice was produced to provide guidance to local authorities and other agencies with functions under the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004. The Scottish Executive published 13,000 copies of the code of practice and 10,000 these were distributed to a wide range of professionals including those who work in education, health and social work. The remaining number has been distributed on request. However, it is not known how many of these were provided to parents.</p>

  <p>Parents may access the code of practice on the Scottish Executive website for information and advice on exercising their rights under the act. It can be viewed at:</p>

  <p>However, the Scottish Executive commissioned Enquire, the national advice service for families of children who require additional support for learning, to produce a guide on the provisions of the act specifically for parents. As of 5 July 2006, 11, 670 copies of the parents&rsquo; guide had been issued.</p>

  <p>Enquire also produced a young persons&rsquo; guide to the act. As of 5 July 2006, 17, 399 copies of the young persons&rsquo; guide had been issued.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive carries out an annual teacher workforce planning exercise to ensure at a national level adequate numbers of newly qualified teachers are trained for publicly funded schools. This takes into account factors such as the age profile of the profession; changing pupil numbers; numbers of new entrants to the profession and those leaving due to resignation, retirement etc. In recent years the exercise has been carried out in the context of our commitment to increase teacher numbers to 53,000 by 2007.</p>

  <p>The employment of teachers in teaching posts is a matter for education authorities. In order to meet the national target of 53,000 teachers by 2007, additional funding of &pound;18 million in 2006-07 and &pound;44 million in 2007-08 has been provided for the employment of teachers. Before local authorities receive funding for 2007-08 they will be required to commit to a number of teachers which will in total achieve our target.</p>

  <p>We recently decided that a further &pound;14.5 million of central resources would also be distributed through the National Priorities Action Fund for the employment of additional teachers this year, bringing the total additional resources for 2006-07 to &pound;32.5 million. The aim of the additional funding is to allow authorities to increase the number of teachers they employ in 2006-07 over and above previously planned levels.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>We do know that as at 1 April 2006, there were 79,162 people on the General Teaching Council for Scotland&rsquo;s register, of whom 67,364 had their registration fee deducted from salary. However, having fees deducted from salary does not equate to being employed in Scottish schools - staff in, for example, independent sector schools, further education colleges, universities and local authority directorates might also have fees so deducted and some people employed in schools may choose not to have their fees deducted from salary.</p>

  <p>The recruitment of teachers is a matter for local authorities.</p>

  <p>Overall sufficient teachers have been trained to meet the reduction in class contact time to 22.5 hours in August 2006. There are no interim targets for the delivery of the commitment to reduce class sizes by August 2007, but very good progress continues to be made in training the teachers required to meet our target.</p>

  <p>We are providing additional funds of &pound;18 million to &pound;44 million in 2006 and 2007 for authorities to employ additional teachers. In addition, we will be fully funding around 1,000 probationer teachers each year in 2006 and 2007 who can also be used to meet class contact and class size reductions.</p>

  <p>In addition, we recently decided that a further &pound;14.5 million of central resources would also be distributed through the National Priorities Action Fund for the employment of additional teachers this year over and above previously set employment levels.

  <p>This information is not held centrally. The employment of teachers is a matter for local authorities and recruitment will continue up to and on through the 2006-07 school year.</p>

  <p>Newly trained teachers are entitled to a year&rsquo;s induction and thereafter enter the job market. There is no guarantee of employment, though the number of extra students in teacher education has been set to align with the number of new teachers who need to be employed to achieve the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s commitment to 53,000 teachers by 2007.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that it is normal that not all new teachers obtain permanent posts immediately. The majority of the remainder are in long-term temporary positions (e.g. covering maternity leave) or are doing short-term supply work.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally. The management of teacher absence and the causes of absence are matters for individual local authorities as employers. However, Scottish local authorities are required by law to provide Audit Scotland with sickness absence levels among local government staff, including teachers. This information is not broken down into categories of illness.</p>

  <p>The latest Audit Scotland Corporate Management Performance Indicator for 2004-05 compares the percentage of days lost through sickness absence by teachers with other local government employees. This shows that teachers, at 3.7%, had a lower percentage of days lost than Administrative, Professional, Technical and Clerical staff (5.5%) and Craft and Manual Workers (5.9%).</p>
