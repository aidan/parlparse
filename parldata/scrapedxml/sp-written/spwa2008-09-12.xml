  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of the answers to questions S3W-14677 and S3W-15349 by Shona Robison on 18 July 2008 and Nicola Sturgeon on 14 August 2008 respectively, what increase in fuel would have to take place in order for the expectation outlined in the answer to question S3W-13596 by Shona Robison on 5 June 2008 to be realised.</p>

  <p>These are operational decisions for the Scottish Ambulance Service. The mileage rates were last reviewed in August during which month fuel prices fell. I have been assured by the Scottish Ambulance Service that the current rate remains sufficient to cover these fuel costs. The rates are also calculated on some other factors, such as additional wear and tear on vehicles. I am advised by the ambulance service that, all other factors being equal, these rates will cover fuel price increases of some 40% on current levels.</p>

  <p>The ambulance service continues to review the rates on a monthly basis.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has no immediate plans to reverse the ban on the docking of tails of working dogs but has contributed &pound;10,000 towards a UK case control study, to estimate the risk of tail injury to dogs. This is due to end in the spring of 2009. When the results of the study are known, consideration will be given as to whether the policy on tail docking needs to be reviewed.</p>

  <p>The UK Breeding Bird Survey which undertakes counts in the breeding season in more than 3,000 one kilometre squares in the UK. Currently data exists from 1994 to 2007 and indicates long-term increase in raven numbers in the UK of more than 50%. The Scottish population is believed to have increased by 155% since 1994, though there is uncertainty surrounding this estimate. Independent lines of evidence support increase in numbers and range of ravens in Scotland, although the total population is still relatively small at about 2,500 to 6,000 breeding pairs.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what assessment it has made of raven predation on (a) other bird species and (b) lambs.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-09-12.S3W-15897.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80340" speakername="Richard Lochhead" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa0912.htm#3">

  <p>No direct assessment of the impact of raven predation on lambs has been undertaken by the Scottish Government or Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH). However, in view of the recent interest in raven predation, SNH, in conjunction with RSPB and the Aberdeen Centre for Environmental Sustainability, is carrying out an analysis of upland bird survey data to assess long term trends in particular species of bird and determine whether there is an association between changes in raven numbers and changes in the populations of upland breeding birds (especially breeding waders). The work is due to report by the end of this calendar year, with a final report, early in 2009.</p>

  <p>SNH works closely with Scottish Government officials on raven predation and provides advice on licence applications to take or kill ravens causing serious damage to livestock, as part of an overall scaring regime. The Scottish Government has now made available a two-year licence in response to reported increases in raven attacks on livestock. A farmer holding a two-year licence will be able to deal with the problem as soon as it occurs without having to wait for a fresh application to be considered.</p>

  <p>The concessionary travel budget is a limited budget that is increased year-on-year using a cost escalator based on bus industry running costs rather than the fare increases implemented by each operator. The full impact of any fare increases are not therefore necessarily reflected in the level of reimbursement made in any given financial year.</p>

  <p>Generally the Scottish Government receives advice on the state of fish stocks from the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) and would consider stocks to be at risk when ICES advises so. ICES currently provides no advice on tope stocks.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not believe the 12 tonnes landed by Scottish boats since 2000 represents a significant threat to the health of the tope stock. This situation will be kept under review and will be consider within the wider context of the management of all elasmobranch stocks.</p>

  <p>Under the Flood Prevention (Scotland) Act 1961, local authorities are under a duty to clean, repair or otherwise maintain any watercourse in their area to a due state of efficiency where such action would substantially reduce the likelihood of flooding of non-agricultural land, within or outwith their area. However, this duty does not apply where the watercourse and the land concerned are in the same ownership. Local authorities have a statutory duty under Section 1 of the Roads (Scotland) Act 1984 to maintain local roads.</p>

  <p>The Information Services Division (ISD) of NHS National Services Scotland collects data on Crohn&rsquo;s disease relating to the number of people who are discharged from hospital with a diagnosis of Crohn&rsquo;s disease. As these data do not include people with the condition who are being managed outwith hospital, they cannot shed light on any trends in its incidence.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally. The planning of the workforce, including staff specialising in neurology, is a matter for NHS boards who are responsible for planning services in their area based on need. Services for people with long-term conditions are also for NHS boards to plan and fund from budgets made available by the Scottish Government. People with long-term conditions are supported by a multi-disciplinary and multi-agency team.

  <p>This information is not held centrally. The planning of the workforce, including staff specialising in multiple sclerosis, is a matter for NHS boards who are responsible for planning services in their area based on need. services for people with long-term conditions are also for NHS boards to plan and fund from budgets made available by the Scottish Government. People with long-term conditions are supported by a multi-disciplinary and multi-agency team. This will include specialist nurses, medical staff and allied health professionals to make sure their needs are met.</p>

  <p><em>Better Health, Better Care</em> signalled our intention of carrying out a strategic review of the way in which NHSScotland supports voluntary organisations, in order to explore ways in which to enhance the sustainability of programmes that demonstrate clear benefits to patients and their carers.</p>

  <p>A key way of improving services is by implementing clinical standards. NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS) is working on clinical standards specifically for Motor Neurone Disease as part of its overall work on neurological standards.</p>

  <p>Officials from the Health Directorates had discussions some time ago with the Scottish Motor Neurone Disease Association about developing a Managed Clinical Network for MND at a national level, and we have indicated our willingness to provide support and advice for this work.</p>

  <p>We are also taking a number of steps to help make sure that carers can access the support they need to care effectively and are providing &pound;9 million over the next three years so that NHSScotland can improve carer identification and information and help expand carers&rsquo; centre support. In addition, we will be setting out our priorities in a new Carers&rsquo; Strategy next year, based on a review of progress against the recommendations of the Care 21 Report <em>The Future of Unpaid Care in Scotland</em>.</p>

  <p>NHS Argyll and Clyde and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde were both visited during 2004-05 as part of the Healthcare Associated Infection (HAI) standards peer review programme. The Vale of Leven Hospital was part of NHS Argyll and Clyde Acute Hospitals Trust at this time.</p>

  <p>NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS) standards are considered for revision and updating every three years. The most recent standards were published in March 2008, and future arrangements for performance assessment against the standards are in development. Further information is available on the NHS QIS website at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.nhshealthquality.org/nhsqis/controller?p_service=Content.showandp_applic=CCCandpContentID=4099" target="_blank">http://www.nhshealthquality.org/nhsqis/controller?p_service=Content.showandp_applic=CCCandpContentID=4099</a>.</p>

  <p>The NHS QIS review process is just one of the ways in which we monitor NHS board performance against HAI Targets, and given the importance of hand hygiene compliance, I have requested that Health Protection Scotland (HPS) move from three to two monthly reporting on NHS boards compliance from January 2009. I have also increased the target of 90% compliance by November 2008 to 95% compliance by April 2009.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s industry bluetongue stakeholder group has agreed that any vaccination campaign is best undertaken during the winter vector free period when the climate is less favourable to virus transmission. The precise timings of the vaccination campaign cannot yet be set. Any date will be based on the analysis of emerging information on the disease situation within Great Britain as well veterinary, entomological and meteorological advice which will allow the vector free period to be established.</p>

  <p>The commencement date for any vaccination programme will be agreed in conjunction with stakeholder organisations. The Scottish Government will give stakeholders as much notice of any start date as possible to ensure that the timing of individual herd or flock vaccinations fits in with farm management decisions.</p>

  <p>Special care is required when antipsychotic medication is used in frail elderly people. Doctors should only be using medication of any type after careful consideration of the risks and benefits for the patient. With regard to antipsychotic medication, the standards for integrated care pathways for dementia published by NHS Quality Improvement Scotland contain specific standards about use of medication, monitoring physical health and evaluating benefits of medication (Bib. number 44374).

This will build on developments through the learning disability enhanced service programme, which is being taken forward by 11 NHS boards. The enhanced service involves supporting the overall primary care needs of adults with learning disabilities and taking steps towards regular health assessments.</p>

  <p>NHS boards will work in partnership with local authorities to identify and support people with learning disabilities to access health assessments.</p>
