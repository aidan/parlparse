  <p>The relevant cancer waiting times target that has been set in Scotland covers the whole patient pathway from urgent referral to treatment. The target is that by the end of 2005 the maximum wait from urgent referral to treatment for all cancers will be two months.

  <p>Note: The figures given are estimates based on a sample survey and are therefore subject to sampling variation. As such, small percentage changes are not statistically significant when considered on a year-on-year basis. A pensioner household is defined as either one pensioner living alone or a couple where at least one is a pensioner and the household does not contain any children.</p>

  <p>We fully support the work of the Department of Work and Pensions to increase the take-up of benefits amongst pensioner households in Scotland and we are working with the UK Government to tackle pensioner poverty in a range of ways. We have also established an independent review of local government finance to undertake a thorough and comprehensive review of the local taxation system.</p>

  <p>Long-term planning for the number of GP training places is part of wider workforce planning arrangements. NHS Education for Scotland is allocated funds from the Scottish Executive to provide training for GP registrars (GPRs) and other medical training. The number of funded places for GPRs is currently at 280 following a recent uplift from 250.</p>

  <p>New specialist training programmes for general practice will be introduced as part of the Modernising Medical Careers training reforms. Work is underway across the UK to assess, develop and put these programmes in place and that includes consideration in Scotland of the number and distribution of opportunities that will be made available for the new GP training programme.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what measures are available to provide communities in (a) rural and (b) urban areas with the right to buy (i) land and (ii) properties on a compulsory, or any other, basis.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-07-28.8.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80032" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa0728.htm#5">

  <p>The Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003, Part 3 provides for a crofting community right to buy eligible croft land at any time, subject only to ministerial approval of an application by a crofting community body to use the right to buy (i.e. on a compulsory basis).</p>

  <p>Part 2 of that act allows rural community bodies to register an interest in rural land (defined, for the purposes of the Community Right to Buy, as land other than excluded settlements of over 10,000 population) and the right to buy that land when it comes to be sold. This is a pre-emptive right to buy.</p>

  <p>These rights relate to the acquisition of land and any property or property right that is considered to be part of the land asset such as buildings. There is no right to buy moveable property or most types of tenancy.</p>

  <p>Forestry Commission Scotland&rsquo;s National Forest Land Scheme gives communities the opportunity to buy any part of the national forest estate, even though the land has not come up for sale, so long as they can satisfy the eight criteria of the scheme.</p>

  <p>The National Forest Land Scheme also provides for the commission to sell national forest land for affordable housing to housing associations and trusts, and for &quot;sponsored&quot; land sales, where communities will have the first opportunity to buy surplus national forest land that the commission proposes to sell.</p>

  <p>The scheme builds on the Right to Buy principles enshrined in the Land Reform Act, but goes a step further by enabling communities to initiate discussions where national forest land is not actually up for sale.</p>

  <p>The National Forest Land Scheme Guidance can be found at <a href="http://www.forestry.gov.uk/nfls" target="_blank">www.forestry.gov.uk/nfls</a></p>

  <p>The Transfer of Crofting Estates (Scotland) Act 1997 enables the transfer of Scottish ministers&rsquo; crofting estates to crofting trusts. Any interests in mineral, sporting or other rights relating to these estates may also be transferred. The act allows the disposal of crofting property only to organisations which are considered properly representative of relevant crofting estates and which have the promotion of the interests of the persons residing on the estate as their primary objective. Before agreeing to disposal the Scottish ministers must first consult the Crofters Commission.</p>

  <p>Under the act, financial assistance can be provided by Scottish ministers towards the start up costs of a body to whom crofting property is being transferred and for the legal expenses of the transfer. Any rights of pre-emption are extinguished under the act which allows those affected by this to submit a claim for compensation within a specified period with a right of appeal by the claimant to the Scottish Land Court.</p>

  <p>The definition of rural land used for Community Right to Buy purposes (and the Community Acquisition provisions of the National Forest Land Scheme) means that the areas covered by those schemes extend beyond the Executive&rsquo;s core definition of rural areas. There are however no specific schemes to provide for community purchase of land and property currently excluded by the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003.</p>

During peak times, less clinically urgent calls are prioritised and the service endeavours to achieve call back by a nurse adviser within specified target times - 60 minutes for Priority 1 calls and 120 minutes for Priority 2 calls. The NHS 24 service began rolling out across Scotland in May 2002 and was completed in November 2004.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the average waiting times for accident and emergency cases in hospitals have been in each year since 1995.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-07-28.12.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80057" speakername="Mr Andy Kerr" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa0728.htm#8">

  <p>Between 1994 and 2002, information on waiting times at accident and emergency (A&amp;E) departments was recorded centrally via a series of annual week-long surveys. The survey was reduced to three days duration in 2003 to minimise the workload of busy A&amp;E departments, as many departments completed the survey manually. The surveys specifically measured the waiting times from arrival in A&amp;E to: time to triage; time to be seen by a doctor, and time to completion of treatment.</p>

  <p>The surveys in November 1995, June 1996 and April 2002 were undertaken during a seven-day period specifically identified by the Health Department. The surveys in the years 1997,1999, 2000 and 2001 were undertaken during a four week period identified by the Health Department with each hospital deciding on the specific seven-day period of the survey. No survey was undertaken during 1998. The three-day survey period for 2003 and 2004 were set by the Health Department. Due to changes in the timing and duration of the surveys caution needs to be taken in comparing year on year results.</p>

  <p>The table below provides information on the average number of A&amp;E attendances per survey day, the percentage change in the average A&amp;E attendances per survey day, the median wait from arrival to completion of treatment and the percentage of patients who completed their treatment within four hours from arrival at A&amp;E.</p>

  <p><em>Fair to All, Personal to Each</em> published in December 200four, includes a commitment that from the end of 2007, patients will wait no longer than four hours between arriving at A&amp;E and admission, transfer or discharge. The 2005 survey will record the total patient journey from arrival to admission, transfer or discharge consistent with the four hour commitment, the results of which will be published by ISD Scotland on their website on 25 August 2005.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive keeps procurement mechanisms such as funding competitions under review when considering appropriate delivery arrangements. Currently there is healthy competition in Scotland in the PPP funding market, with several bond providers adding to bank lenders and equity players. The cost of PPP funding has come down since early projects. A separate funding competition organised by the client public sector authority could add considerably to the time and cost involved in the procurement.</p>
