  <p>On-going recruitment of consultants has resulted in two further recent appointments. An additional &#163;2 million ring-fenced investment will see the recruitment of up to 35 more nurses and other clinical support posts, additional and replacement equipment and the commissioning of additional space for chemotherapy at Gartnavel Hospital.</p>

  <p>NHS Greater Glasgow published a comprehensive progress report on Monday 4 March 2002. The published agenda, papers and minutes of the NHS Greater Glasgow Board also document the position at 19 March when the report of the Expert Review Team was considered. Progress is also being made on the preparation of the full business case to support the Phase II West of Scotland Cancer Centre at Gartnavel.</p>

  <p>Both the Childcare Strategy and the <i>Action Plan for the Training and Development of Workers in Early Education, Childcare and Playwork</i> set out the Executive&#146;s commitment to increasing the professional standing of the childcare workforce by supporting their training and development. The action plan has been supported with &#163;4 million over the last two financial years, with a further &#163;9.2 million committed for 2002-04.</p>

  <p>The Executive is also working to provide a greater range of progression routes within the early years sector, and local authorities and other providers have a wide range of options open to them when determining the structure of staffing in pre-school education and childcare. In pre-school education, this flexibility was emphasised by the publication of the <i>Guidance on Teacher Involvement in Pre-School Education</i> in January 2002.</p>

  <p>The National Priorities for Education have established a framework to raise standards of achievement.</p>

  <p>Each local authority must prepare an education improvement plan. Schools - in their school development plans - will set targets for improvement in attainment. They will publish their plans and evaluate their performance. Other measures such as the Early Intervention programme and our literacy and numeracy initiatives will ensure that the attainment of pupils is already significantly improved when they start secondary school.</p>

  <p>The aim is for an initial check on payment claims to be carried out within 30 working days of receipt. If all the requisite documentation is in place 75% of the claimed amount is paid. The balance is paid as soon as a satisfactory physical inspection/survey of the project has been carried out by an Executive surveyor. That payment is normally made within 10 working days of receipt of a satisfactory inspection report. The vast majority of payments have been made in line with these targets. At this stage, a definitive analysis of the data, however, could only be obtained at disproportionate costs.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The Scottish Vacant and Derelict Land Survey includes only that vacant land which is either located within an urban settlement (with a population of 2,000 or more) or which is located within 1 km of such settlements, which would commonly be considered as having the characteristics of urban vacant land. Vacant or derelict sites covering less than 0.1 hectare are excluded.</p>

  <p>2. Not all local authorities have completed the survey every year. Where a local authority did not complete the survey in the previous year, the amount of land brought back into use by that authority refers to the period since the survey was last completed.</p>

  <p>3. Figures may differ slightly from those presented in the Scottish Vacant and Derelict Land Survey statistical bulletins due to data being revised by local authorities.</p>

  <p>We are tackling these issues on a number of fronts, though not exclusively for people over 75.</p>

  <p>Last year we provided new resources, starting with &#163;24 million in 2001-02 and rising to &#163;48 million in 2003-04, to enable local authorities and their partners locally to develop more responsive home care services that would prevent older people being inappropriately admitted to hospital and support them better on discharge.</p>

  <p>In January, we published the report of the Chief Medical Officer's Expert Group on the Healthcare of Older People, entitled <i>Adding Life to Years</i>. We have since set up an implementation group to drive forward its recommendations and to monitor progress.</p>

  <p>On 5 March, we launched our Delayed Discharge Action Plan requiring local partners to deliver specific, targeted reductions in delayed discharges, underpinned by further new resources of &#163;20 million in 2002-03.</p>

  <p>Through the Scottish Road Safety Campaign, the Scottish Executive targets road safety messages at all drivers, including younger drivers.</p>

  <p>The campaign has produced two cinema adverts specifically aimed at young drivers. These will again be screened during 2002-03. The campaign will also be commissioning research to inform the development of a strategy aimed at improving young driver safety.</p>

  <p>Following the publication last year of Scottish Executive research, which found that drug driving was most prevalent amongst younger drivers, the Scottish Road Safety Campaign has developed a TV advert, aimed at raising awareness of police techniques to detect drug driving, which will be launched in May.</p>

  <p>Drink drive publicity over the festive period was targeted at young male drivers, in the light of research which found that they were a key risk group. The publicity featured the &quot;Wheel of Misfortune&quot;, which highlights the consequences of being caught drink driving. Further publicity will be carried out in June.</p>

  <p>Road safety publicity undertaken by the campaign is evaluated to determine its effectiveness.</p>

  <p>Public/Private Partnership schemes like the City of Edinburgh Council schools project are not a form of privatisation. They are long-term contractual arrangements for the provision of assets and related services. In such schemes the public sector specifies the services required and pays for them on the basis of results.
