  <p>I will be launching this strategy later this morning in a document entitled <i>A Forward Strategy for Scottish Agriculture</i> . This document is the result of a process I started in April last year with the publication of a discussion document designed to stimulate debate on the future direction of farming in Scotland. The strategy was drawn up by a steering group whose members were drawn from a wide range of backgrounds covering agriculture, food, consumer, environment and other rural interests.</p>

  <p>The strategy document sets out the steering group&#8217;s vision for a prosperous farming industry based on producing what the consumer wants, playing a major role in sustainable rural development, protecting and enhancing the environment and embracing change and opportunity. It reaffirms the Executive&#8217;s commitment to continue to support the agriculture industry in Scotland and sets out 54 action points to be taken forward in partnership by the Executive, the industry and various other bodies which have a role to play in shaping the future of farming. It also contains case studies giving examples of good practice which have helped individual businesses to prosper.</p>

  <p>A copy of this document is available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>It is for health boards/Primary Care Trusts to set, from their Unified Budget, prescribing budgets for Local Health Care Co-operatives on the basis of the need they identify in the local population. There is no evidence to suggest that differences in prescribing budgets between LHCCs adversely affect the health of patients. GPs have a duty to provide the necessary and appropriate treatment determined by patients&#8217; clinical need.</p>

  <p>The figures quoted in the Audit Scotland Local Health Care Co-operatives Bulletin are not standardised for age/sex distribution of population or adjusted in any other way to reflect local need.</p>

  <p>Local Health Care Co-operatives (LHCCs) are established on a voluntary basis and their size reflects the perceived boundaries of their local community. We do not think there is a &quot;right size&quot;. The guiding principle is whether LHCCs are able to develop and deliver services effectively to meet the needs of their communities.</p>

  <p>The LHCC Best Practice Group Report, published in April this year, highlighted that some LHCCs are more robust than others and that in some areas there is a need for more support from the local health care system for their further development. We will announce shortly proposals for strengthening the role of LHCCs in response to the Best Practice Group Report.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-15595 by Malcolm Chisholm on 11 June 2001, whether it will detail the actual or estimated cost to each local authority of transferring patients from long-stay hospital accommodation to community care and the amount of Revenue Support Grant allocated or planned to be allocated to each local authority for this purpose for each year from 1999 to 2004.</p>

  <p>The cost to local authorities of patients transferring to community care depends on the needs of the individuals concerned, the cost of services provided or purchased by the authority, whether a resource transfer is involved and, if so, how much, the individuals&#8217; contribution including pensions from DSS and other DSS benefits. The allocations of Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE) to local authorities for social work in each of the years 1999-2000 to 2003-04 are &pound;1,101 million, &pound;1,144 million, &pound;1,256 million, &pound;1,317 million and &pound;1,392 million respectively.
