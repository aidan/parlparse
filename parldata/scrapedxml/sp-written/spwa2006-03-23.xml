  <p>The Scottish Executive has allocated &pound;400,000 to the Biodiversity Action Grants Scheme in 2006-07, which is the third round of the scheme. This comprises the initial allocation of &pound;200,000 and a further allocation of &pound;200,000, which was agreed in 2005-06 in response to the volume and quality of applications. Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) are taking over the operation of the scheme in 2006-07 and are allocating a further &pound;100,000 to it.</p>

  <p>A number of the projects funded under the scheme run for more than one year. Forward commitments to these projects mean that a total of &pound;167,000 remains uncommitted in 2006-07.</p>

  <p>Funding for biodiversity grants in 2007-08 will be a matter for SNH within the overall annual grant in aid settlement.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to working to meet the European Union&rsquo;s target to halt the loss of biodiversity by 2010. The Scottish Executive achieves this by setting the policy framework and by funding implementation action largely by other bodies.</p>

  <p>Conserving biodiversity is a core function of Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), and Scottish ministers provide funds to SNH to deliver this function. SNH expects to spend &pound;18.7 million on biodiversity conservation in 2006-07. SNH has a grant programme of over &pound;15 million in 2006-07, with over &pound;2 million of this allocated specifically for grants for biodiversity action.</p>

  <p>A number of other public bodies also fund biodiversity activity. The Forestry Commission Scotland (FCS) expects to spend &pound;7.6 million on biodiversity conservation during 2006-07, including &pound;3.6 million on woodland management and &pound;4 million per annum on planting woodlands of high biodiversity benefit, mostly through the Scottish Forestry Grant Scheme. In addition, the FCS spends a further &pound;5.7 million per year on deer management, mainly in the national forest estate. A substantial part of this will benefit biodiversity.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) also contributes directly to biodiversity conservation through its core function of protecting the natural environment. SEPA has appointed a number of additional staff to support this function and also funds research on biodiversity issues and awards small grants to biodiversity conservation projects.</p>

  <p>Other public bodies, including the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Big Lottery Fund provide funding for biodiversity action.</p>

  <p>In addition, a wide range of public bodies across Scotland are actively engaged in furthering biodiversity conservation, as required by the biodiversity duty in the <i>Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004</i>.</p>

  <p>Our funding has enabled every council to establish a community warden scheme with around 550 now patrolling Scotland&rsquo;s streets. Employment and reporting arrangements for community wardens are a matter for local agencies. We have commissioned an evaluation of the implementation and impact of community warden schemes, which is expected to report by early 2007.</p>

  <p>Through integrated children&rsquo;s services planning, it is for local agencies to determine the services needed in their local area to make sure children get the help they need when they need it.</p>

  <p>It is, therefore, for local authorities to ensure they have sufficient foster and residential places available for vulnerable children. To assist local authorities further, we are providing an additional &pound;12 million funding over two years to enable them to improve recruitment and retention of foster carers, and to increase placement choice.</p>

  <p>We have steadily increased investment across the range of treatments in the last five years: &pound;33.6 million will be allocated to NHS boards for drug and alcohol treatment services in 2006-07. The Executive&rsquo;s Sure Start programme will provide &pound;57 million in 2006-07 to local authorities to enable them to work with health services and other organisations to support our most vulnerable children and families. The Changing Children&rsquo;s Services Fund will provide over &pound;65 million in 2006-07 to support local authorities and their partners to improve the quality and integration of services for children and young people, including those involved in or affected by substance misuse.</p>

  <p>While every effort is made to work within the family setting, the welfare of the child remains paramount. There are local procedures in place to assess whether or not removal would be in the best interests of the child.</p>

  <p>The latest cash estimates of Gross Value Added (GVA or GDP at basic prices) available for Scotland are presented in the Office for National Statistics Regional Accounts. These provide a provisional estimate of GVA at current prices for Scotland in 2004 of &pound;82 billion, an increase from &pound;78.5 billion in 2003; 2004 is the latest year for which figures are available.</p>

  <p>Estimates of GVA at current prices are not available at local authority level, however the Office for National Statistics provides sub-regional estimates to Eurostat based on a geographical framework known as NUTS (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics). The lowest level geography at which GVA estimates are made is NUTS Level 3, but these geographical units do not correspond exactly to local authority areas.</p>

  <p>The latest sub-regional estimates for Scotland from the Regional Accounts are for 2003 and are presented the following table.</p>

  <p>The Executive has taken a decision on the recommendations made by the Scottish Local Authorities Remuneration Committee. Regulations will be published as quickly as possible. A specific date has not been set. Preliminary telephone discussions with HM Revenue and Customs have taken place between officials but any tax and/or National Insurance contributions liability will be determined by the detail of the actual rules that are put in place. Although a scheme already exists for the Welsh Assembly the proposed scheme for councillors in Scotland will need to be considered on its own merits. Further discussion will take place once the regulations are drafted, after which we expect that HM Revenue and Customs will give their opinion on the tax treatment of these payments. We are therefore proceeding on the basis that councillors standing down should receive a severance payment of either &pound;10,000, &pound;15,000 or &pound;20,000 depending upon length of service. If it is decided that these payments should be subject to tax and national insurance, these amounts will be increased by &pound;3,000, &pound;4,500, and &pound;6,000 respectively to ensure that long-serving councillors receive a net payment which adequately recognises long service with no pension entitlement.</p>

  <p>The specific information requested is not available. The recording of Availability Status Codes on in-patient and day case discharge data is not mandatory. It is not therefore possible to identify from the available data whether those patients who waited over six months before treatment held an Availability Status Code.</p>

  <p>Census data, provided by NHS boards to ISD Scotland and published each quarter, shows number of patients waiting over specified periods as at the census date. This census data does identify all patients with an Availability Status Code and it is therefore possible to report on the number of patients with a guarantee and an Availability Status Code waiting over specified periods on that census date.</p>

  <p>As I announced in December 2004, the Availability Status Code system is being abolished and from the end of 2007 we will have a clearer, more transparent system that is fairer to patients.</p>

  <p>The number of patients waiting for angiography or cardiac revascularisation (angioplasty or coronary artery bypass graft) is measured and reported using a quarterly census carried out by Information Services Division of NHS National Services Scotland (ISD Scotland) involving all NHS boards in Scotland. The information is published on the ISD Scotland web site as soon as it is available. Explanatory notes on the website provide details of the source of the information. These notes make clear that the information about patients waiting for cardiac treatment is derived from the same census as that used to provide data about in-patients and day cases generally.</p>

  <p>The physical nature of firefighting, as part of a firefighter&rsquo;s role, has been taken into account in the development of the new firefighters&rsquo; pension scheme together with evidence that supports greater longevity and improvements to risk management and training. The new scheme will provide the flexibility of an early retirement option at age 55 together with ill-health benefits where a member is unfit for all the duties included in their role as a firefighter. In the current pension scheme the retirement age is 55 but members can retire at age 50 with a minimum of 25 years service.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2O-8958 by Tavish Scott on 9 February 2006, whether it will provide the details of any agreement reached with Network Rail in respect of the early double tracking of the Edinburgh to Bathgate line and when such agreement was reached.</p>

  <p>Network Rail are continuing to develop a programme for the early delivery of the double tracking for diesel services east of Bathgate and they have regular discussions with Transport Scotland over this issue.</p>

  <p>As indicated in my statement on 16 March we have reached agreement with Network Rail for the delivery of the early works. The final details of the agreement are still being developed. Once these details are finalised we aim to sign an implementation agreement by the end of 2006.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland has the operational responsibility for this area, and can be contacted for more information if required.</p>

  <p>This information is contained in the survey report <i>Higher and Further Education Students&rsquo; Income, Expenditure and Debt 2004-05</i> , published by the Scottish Executive in November 2005.</p>

  <p>The average debt on graduation of Scottish undergraduate students expecting to graduate in 2004-05 was &pound;7,561 for those studying at a higher education institute, and &pound;2,616 for those studying at a college. A further breakdown by degree category is not available. Full details are contained in Tables 5.20 and 5.21 of the <i>Higher and Further Education Students&rsquo; Income, Expenditure and Debt 2004-05 </i>report, available from the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/llstatistic" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/llstatistic</a>s, see under Publications.</p>

  <p>Incinerators emit pollutants into the environment and some of these pollutants are known or are considered likely to cause or exacerbate the symptoms of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Others, such as dioxins and furans are known or suspected human carcinogens. However, the public health risks associated with these emissions depend on the actual levels of the emissions and the resultant exposures of members of the public, including sensitive groups.</p>

  <p>Waste incinerators are now subject to more stringent emission standards in line with the Waste Incineration Directive, the aim of which is to prevent or to limit as far as practicable negative effects on the environment and the resulting risks to human health from the incineration of waste.</p>

  <p>A <i>Position Statement on Municipal Solid Waste Incineration</i> by the UK Health Protection Agency&rsquo;s Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards concludes that &quot;Incinerators emit pollutants into the environment but provided they comply with modern regulatory requirements, such as the Waste Incineration Directive, they should contribute little to the concentrations of monitored pollutants in ambient air. Epidemiological studies, and risk estimates based on estimated exposures, indicate that the emissions from such incinerators have little effect on health.&quot;</p>

  <p>This advice is consistent with that from the most authoritative expert advisory groups and the view of the Scottish Executive Health Department is that emissions from incinerators operating within current regulatory limits do not pose unacceptable health risks to members of the public generally or to sensitive groups.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive Health Department is not aware of any specific health monitoring currently in place for people living in the vicinity of waste incinerators. This position is in keeping with the view of the Scottish Executive Health Department that emissions from incinerators operating within current regulatory limits do not pose significant health risks to members of the public generally or to sensitive groups.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the ash from waste incinerators poses any health risks in relation to its transportation and placement in landfill sites.</p>

  <p>The UK Health Protection Agency&rsquo;s Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards has produced a <i>Position Statement on Municipal Solid Waste Incineration</i> which concludes that &quot;The incineration process can result in three main sources of emissions, (1) gaseous to the atmosphere, (2) via solid ash residues, and (3) via cooling water. Provided that solid ash residues and cooling water are handled and disposed of appropriately, atmospheric emissions remain the only significant route of exposure to humans.&quot;</p>

  <p>Regulation of the proper handling and disposal of ash and waste from incinerators is a matter for Scottish Environment Protection Agency. We have no evidence of any instance where the handling and disposal of wastes from incinerators in Scotland has failed to meet the current regulatory requirements.</p>
