  <p><em>Fair to All, Personal to Each</em>, published in December 2004, pledged &pound;45 million over three years to negotiate contracts with the independent healthcare sector to enable NHS patients to receive their operations more quickly.

  <p>Table 1 provides the percentage increase in annual average house prices between 2003 and 2004 and between 2004 and 2005 for each of the postcode districts listed. Information is not yet available on average house prices for 2006. The analysis uses information provided by the Land Value Information Unit (LVIU) at Paisley University. LVIU in turn source their data from Registers of Scotland. The analysis excludes all sales with a value of less than &pound;20,000 and over &pound;1 million with the aim of excluding non market sales and non residential commercial sales.</p>

  <p>Table 2 shows the number of transactions in each year included in the analysis. Percentages based on a small number of transactions provide a less reliable indication of underlying changes in values.</p>

  <p>Data on the number of people who have been asked to take a breathalyser test, and the number of those who have failed a breathalyser test are not available centrally.</p>

  <p>The information provided by the police refers to the number of cases recorded where an individual is in charge of a motor vehicle while unfit through drink or drugs, or has failed to provide a specimen for testing. Because there are several different preliminary tests (preliminary breath test, preliminary impairment test, and preliminary drug test), and the police officer involved may administer any one or more of these, the number of such incidents does not relate directly to the number of times that a breathalyser test has been carried out. Furthermore, the data is collected at an aggregate level, so details of individual crimes, such as the gender of the individual, are not available.</p>

  <p>The boards&rsquo; spending on managerial salaries and administration costs are taken from the previous parliamentary answer S2W-25425 and shown together in the following data. This includes expenditure on both administration and management costs.</p>

  <p>The definition of administration expenditure has changed over the period due to changes in accounting guidance and also in the configuration of the health service, particularly the dissolution of NHS trusts. Consequently the figures shown are not entirely comparable over these years. Expenditure on managerial salaries is not held centrally by the Scottish Executive and is therefore not separately analysed. Expenditure by each NHS board for 1995-96 is no longer held centrally so only total NHS expenditure is shown.</p>

  <p>The proportion of the annual budget of (a) each NHS board and (b) the NHS, that was spent on managerial salaries and administration costs is shown in the following table.</p>

  <p>The NHSScotland Resource Allocation Committee (NRAC) was established in March 2005 to improve and refine the Arbuthnott Formula. Members were chosen through the public appointment process and Dr Karen Facey, a self-employed health policy consultant and non-executive Director of Forth Valley NHS Board acts as Chairman. The remit and membership of NRAC was detailed in my answer to question S2W-14556 answered on 21 February 2005. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at: <a href="../../../webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a> .</p>

  <p>Over the summer of 2005, the Committee consulted with a number of NHS boards to assess what issues they have with the current Formula and identify criteria that NHS boards consider a successful Formula could be measured against. To inform the work undertaken by NRAC, the issues were collated into groups and a summary of the issues and an outline of the proposed handling of the evidence was published on the NRAC website (<a href="http://www.nrac.scot.nhs.uk" target="_blank">www.nrac.scot.nhs.uk</a>). Individual responses will not be given to Boards, but issues will be considered as research progresses and new elements of the allocation formula are created.</p>

  <p>Research has been undertaken during the past six months to determine how the Formula could be improved. The areas of research include demography (population measurement and how age/sex cost weights for Care Programmes are assessed); morbidity and life circumstances; and the excess costs of supply (including remoteness). This research is currently being finalised.</p>

  <p>The Committee will issue these research reports on its website in early July, with an overview document summarising the key issues, presenting options and raising questions. Engagement and feedback will be sought mainly with NHSScotland, but also other interested parties including, for example, the Royal Colleges, BMA and COSLA.</p>

  <p>The Committee intends to submit its Report to Ministers in June 2007. Any agreed changes will be taken into account in 2008-09 allocations, at the earliest.</p>

  <p>Funds are allocated to NHS boards on the basis of the formula set out in <em>Fair Shares for All</em> &ndash; the final report of the National Review of Resource Allocation for the NHS in Scotland (the Arbuthnott review) which was published on 7 September 2000. The report is available on the Scottish Executive Internet site at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/10/19142752/27522" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/10/19142752/27522</a></p>

  <p>The formula is based on four main indicators &ndash; the size of each health board population; the profile of each health board population in terms of age and sex; the levels of ill health and life circumstances found in each health board; and the unavoidable excess costs of delivering services in rural and remote areas.</p>

  <p>Within Scotland, four molecular genetics laboratories work together as the Scottish Molecular Genetic Consortium (SMGC) to provide testing for a range of inherited conditions, both relatively common disorders and rare genetic conditions for the Scottish population.</p>

  <p>The SMGC is a member of the UK wide Genetic Testing Network (GTN) and a list of the diseases for which tests are available can be accessed on the GTN website:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.ukgtn.org/gtn/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.ukgtn.org/gtn/index.html</a>.</p>

  <p>The total number of patient reports issued by the SMGC since 2003 is noted in the following table.</p>

The recent review of <em>Genetics in Relation to Healthcare Scotland</em> considered ways in which NHS genetics services could be strengthened to improve all aspects of the service to patients and to cope with increasing demand.

  <p>For those presenting with signs and symptoms a variety of tests may be used to diagnose breast cancer either on their own or in combination. These include physical examination, mammography, ultrasound, needle (core) biopsy, fine needle aspiration, blood tests and excision biopsy.
