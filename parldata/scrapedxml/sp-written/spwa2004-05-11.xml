  <p>No funds have been made available. It is difficult to predict the administrative costs to local authorities arising from the abolition of the feudal system, but it is expected that these can be met from existing resources. As with any other individual or corporate body, it is a matter of choice for the local authority as to what, if any, action it wishes to take. The legislation does not require any action generating unavoidable costs for councils.</p>

  <p>It is unlikely that local authorities will have incurred much expense to date, as the feudal system will not actually be abolished until 28 November 2004. It is currently possible for authorities to register notices in the property registers in order to save certain types of feudal right and authorities have been advised of the best way to ensure that they will retain a say in relation to housing complexes where they still own some of the properties. It is not anticipated that authorities will wish to use a large number of notices, and so the registration costs should not prove to be significant.</p>

  <p>Although the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act received Royal Assent in 2000 it will not take effect until 28 November 2004. Local authorities will have until November to preserve certain special types of right and even after that they will still be able to preserve their rights over housing estates where they retain some properties. After the feudal system is abolished, local authorities will have to modify their practice when selling land to take account of the types of title conditions which will be permitted in future. The process by which authorities may preserve rights over housing estates was simplified following consultation with authorities when the legislation was being considered.</p>

  <p>The Executive wrote to the chief executives and principal legal officers of all Scottish local authorities on 7 May 2003, outlining the main areas of reform and suggesting actions which councils might wish to consider. The Executive will be producing further general guidance on its programme of property law reform later in 2004.</p>

  <p>The Births, Deaths, Marriages and Divorces (Fees) (Scotland) Regulations (SI 1998/643) were reviewed in February 2003 following discussions with the internet site&#8217;s user group, and the Births, Deaths, Marriages and Divorces (Fees) (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 2003 (SSI 2003/89) extended the time available to carry out an internet search session from 24 to 48 hours. There are no plans at present for any further extension. In the longer term, a wider review of the site&#8217;s charging structure is planned, with the aim of achieving discounted and less restricted access for heavy users of the site, or to allow institutions such as libraries to give access to the site through their facilities to users who may not have their own internet access or credit cards.</p>

  <p>GDP growth in Scotland between 1999 and 2003 was 7.2%. The comparable figure for the UK (at basic prices) was 9.0%. The UK growth figure for GDP at market prices is 10.1%.</p>

  <p>GDP for Scotland is measured in basic prices whilst GDP figures for other countries are measured in market prices so they are not strictly comparable. The difference between the two measures is that the basic price measure does not take taxes and subsidies into account.</p>

  <p>Following a competitive tender the Scottish Executive commissioned DTZ Pieda Consulting and the Science, Technology and Policy Research Unit at the University of Sussex to undertake research into business decisions on innovation and research and development.</p>

  <p>The researchers have been asked to explore: the ways in which firms make decisions regarding the development of new products and processes, and the importance of different factors influencing the extent, type and location of activity undertaken in support of product and process development. The study will also explore the reasons why particular firms do not undertake research and development or innovation.</p>

  <p>It is planned to publish the results of this research in the summer of 2004.</p>

  <p>The recently published <em>UK Foresight Report on Future Flooding</em> is supported by a Future Flooding Action Plan to which the Executive contributed. In line with this plan, we will take into account the outcome of the Foresight report in planning our flood risk management research and in the ongoing development of the Executive&#8217;s own National Flooding Framework and associated action plan.</p>

  <p>Output from the National Technical Advisory Group, which we established last year, will be integral to the further development of the Executive&#8217;s Action Plan. The SEPA, SNH, COSLA and other key stakeholders are represented on the National Technical Advisory Group and are making a valuable input to the work of this group and, thereby, to the implementation of the Executive&#8217;s action plan.</p>

  <p>It was a matter for the inquiry to decide whether to ask the First Minister to supplement his written evidence by attending the inquiry in person. As was made clear in their statement of 25 March 2004, they decided not to do so on grounds that all the relevant issues they wished to ask the First Minister about had been answered in his letter to the Inquiry of 23 March.

  <p>It is not possible to anticipate with any accuracy the annual cost to the board of cases presented to the Supreme Court. The number of cases in any year is likely to be small and the costs will vary depending on the needs of each case. However, Scottish ministers do not expect that the costs each year will be greater than that which would have arisen in the House of Lords and Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.</p>

  <p>The power to advance well-being is designed as an enabling measure, giving local authorities the freedom to work in a more innovative and creative way in responding to the needs of their communities.</p>

  <p>The overall intention of the act is to offer trust within a framework: it is for the local authority to decide whether any particular action would be likely to promote or improve the well-being of its area and/or persons in it. Accordingly, local authorities are not required to report to the Scottish Executive on how they have used, or intend to use, the power, and no records will be maintained centrally.</p>

  <p>Guidance on the use of the power was issued by Scottish ministers in April 2004 (<em>The Local Government in Scotland Act 2003: Power to Advance Well-Being Guidance</em>). It may be found on the Executive&#8217;s internet site at the following address www.scotland.gov.uk/library5/localgov/pawbg-00.asp.</p>

  <p>Sections 35 and 36 of the Local Government in Scotland 2003 were fully commenced on 1 April 2004. The commencement of the other sections referred to depend on regulations being laid and approved by the Scottish Parliament.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has undertaken to consult local authority associations and others before laying regulations under the Local Government in Scotland Act 2003 to ensure that they - and any subsequent guidance - are clear, unambiguous, and take practical issues into account. The consultation and feedback processes have been paced to ensure that overload and confusion is avoided.</p>

  <p>Regulations to be laid under section 11 will be published in draft within the next month for consultation.</p>

  <p>Consultation on the content of regulations to be laid under section 40 was undertaken earlier this year and regulations are currently in development.</p>

  <p>Consultation on the content of regulations to be laid under sections 8 and 9 is planned to commence this summer.</p>

  <p>The costs to the Executive are the long-run resource cost of providing student loans to Scottish domiciled students and a proportionate share of the running cost of the Student Loans Company. The most recent estimate for 2003-04 suggests that this average cost is 38.3p in every &#163;1 loaned.</p>

  <p>Prior to the introduction of Stamp Duty Land Tax, there were discussions between the Inland Revenue, the Justice Department and the Law Society of Scotland in relation to the implications for Scottish property transactions. Registers of Scotland were also consulted in respect of the impact Stamp Duty Land Tax would have on the two property Registers (the Land Register of Scotland and the General Register of Sasines). Those discussions resulted in a special arrangement for certain transactions where there may be a risk to the purchaser if the title deed is not submitted quickly for registration in the appropriate property register.</p>

  <p>As part of our work to support the charity sector, draft legislation is currently being prepared to improve the regulatory framework for charities. This will simplify the process of obtaining charitable status; establish a statutory register of charities operating in Scotland, and allow the new regulator to measure the number of charities created under this new process.</p>

  <p>The Executive also commits very substantial funds to the wider voluntary sector. And we continue to support the national network of Councils for Voluntary Service, which has a key role in helping to create new voluntary groups in response to local needs.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive Volunteering Strategy, which aims to embed a robust culture of volunteering in Scotland, is being published today. The centrepiece of the strategy is Project Scotland, the programme proposed by the working group to encourage full-time volunteering by young people. Scottish ministers have approved plans for the creation of a new delivery agency, independent of government, to run the scheme and to source private sector investment. This partnership between public, private and volunteering sectors will be chaired by Julia Ogilvy. The Scottish Executive has allocated &#163;1.9 million/&#163;3.5 million/&#163;3.5 million of new funding over the next three years to take the scheme forward. Both the Scottish Executive Volunteering Strategy (Bib. number 32519) and the working group report (Bib. number 32520) can be accessed at the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre and can also be found at www.scotland.gov.uk/viu.</p>

  <p>The Executive remains fully committed to retaining water supply in the public sector. The Water Services Bill will prohibit third parties from using the public water and sewerage networks, ensuring that Scottish Water remains the sole physical supplier of water and sewerage services to all premises connected to the public networks. This prohibition, together with the prohibition on retail competition to domestic customers and provisions to license retail competition for non-domestic customers will reinforce our commitment to retain Scottish Water in the public sector.</p>
