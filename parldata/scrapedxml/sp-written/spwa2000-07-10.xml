  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what steps it has taken to encourage supermarket retailers in Scotland to sell tomatoes grown in Scotland; whether it will seek a commitment from them that they will stock Scottish tomatoes, and whether it has made an assessment of any job losses if supermarkets do not stock Scottish tomatoes, both in the tomato growing sector and in grading and packaging operations.</p>

  <p>I have met with a number of the major retailers to discuss a range of issues including the sourcing of quality Scottish products. I have obtained a commitment from several major multiples to stock Scottish goods, where they can be produced in sufficient volume. It is not possible to make any estimate of job losses in the industry should supermarkets not stock Scottish tomatoes as this would depend on market conditions elsewhere at the particular time.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to seeing a marked improvement in non-smoking facilities in leisure and hospitality amenities. The Scottish Voluntary Charter on Smoking in Public Places which was recently launched by the Scottish Licensed Trade Association, the Scottish Tourism Forum, the British Hospitality Association and the Brewers &amp; Licensed Retailers Association of Scotland should help ensure this improvement. I will be looking for clear evidence that the Charter is working.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in the light of the House of Commons Select Committee on Health&#8217;s concern that the current Scottish guidance on the use of children in test purchase cases has not been modified, what action it intends to take in response to the committee&#8217;s recommendation about the achievement of a uniformity of approach towards tackling sales of tobacco products to children.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-07-10.12.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80146" speakername="Susan Deacon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa0710.htm#8262">

  <p>There is no action planned at present.</p>

  <p>The particular aspect of the guidance which applies, i.e. in relation to the use of children for test purchasing, is based on policy set by the Crown Office. The Lord Advocate has clearly stated that children should not be used to test purchase tobacco products as part of the local enforcement activity. This is also the view of the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland (ACPOS). Scottish Executive officials are working with local government representatives on measures to improve enforcement of laws relating to underage sales.</p>
