  <p>Sure Start Scotland seeks to give a positive start to very young children&#8217;s lives by providing broad-based support to children and families from deprived areas. The Scottish Executive has allocated a total of &#163;80 million for this from 1999-2004. Information on individual local authority allocations is contained in the funding letters issued by the Scottish Executive, which are available in the Parliament&#8217;s reference centre (SPICe) Bib. no&#8217;s 15104 and 15106.</p>

  <p>We have set out clear guidance on the aims and objectives, and the process for planning and delivering Sure Start Scotland. A ministerial-level conference emphasised the importance we attach to these objectives. Local authorities have provided returns setting out their proposals, indicative outputs and levels of actual and planned expenditure. Officials hold regular discussions with local agencies and have requested interim reports on outputs and expenditure from those (few) local authorities who do not seem to be giving Sure Start Scotland sufficient priority.</p>

  <p>The Executive is setting up a national evaluation of Sure Start Scotland. The first phase, which we expect to commence this month, will focus on mapping the provision of services throughout the country. The second phase will focus on impact and outcomes for children and families. The evaluation should inform good practice in delivering services. We plan to report on the first stage of this exercise by early next year.</p>

  <p>A total of 103,381 three- and four-year-old children were receiving publicly funded pre-school education in the summer term of the last school session. The following table breaks down the places they occupied by type of provision. The figures refer to places, not children, since some children attend more than one centre over the five sessions per week of grant funded education available to them.</p>

  <p>We will shortly be publishing provisional results of the 2001 Pre-school and Day Care Census, analysing the latest information by the different types of provision within the pre-school education sector.</p>

  <p>The council submitted a return to the Scottish Executive Education Department on 11 July which detailed the total spend by most of the schools in its area under different categories. The council has advised that it will forward the finalised information as soon as it becomes available from the remaining schools, probably after the schools re-open for the autumn term.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, chief executive of the Scottish Prison Service, to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Annually, the national Koestler Trust Competition exhibits Scottish prisoner art on a no-fee basis. Any proceeds from sales go, in part, to the provision of art materials and the remainder, either to an appropriate charity or to the prisoner&#8217;s personal cash for use upon release.</p>

  <p>In addition, a Scottish health-related competition (no sales involved) has been run for over two years.</p>

  <p>Information about a range of local competitions and exhibitions agreed by individual establishments over recent years are not collected centrally, but the normal presumption is for the proceeds for sales to be in line with those for the Koestler Competition.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, chief executive of the Scottish Prison Service, to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The SPS consider the particular exhibition referred to might cause considerable public offence. Prisoner art displayed in a &quot;Scene of the Crime&quot; exhibition, to be woven into a &quot;Murder Mystery Tour&quot; by a well known crime writer, might be seen as distasteful at best particularly by victims and their families.</p>

  <p>I recognise the very difficult trading conditions faced by the company. Indeed, the Executive has recently revised the grant agreement with Signum Circuits, leaving a substantial RSA offer in place despite recent redundancies and a downward revision of project numbers.</p>

  <p>The grant offer has always been conditional upon Signum providing the Executive with a charge on its assets, so as to provide some security to protect taxpayers interests. This remains the only obstacle to Signum receiving a first payment and the Executive stands ready to release grant as soon as the company has provided this security.</p>

  <p>The Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC), which came into force on 22 December 2000, will require us to establish environmental objectives for water bodies based on their ecological status. In some circumstances these objectives could require more stringent controls on the discharge of sewage. The Scottish Executive&#8217;s consultation paper <i>Rivers, Lochs, Coasts: The Future for Scotland&#8217;s Waters</i> , explaining the Directive and setting out possible actions for comment, is available from the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. no. 14576).</p>

  <p>The Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive (91/271/EEC) imposes obligations to establish waste water collecting and treatment systems within a specified timescale and to specific standards, depending on the size of the community (&quot;agglomeration&quot;) and the location of the discharge. The remaining future deadline is 31 December 2005. By this date, adequate collecting systems or other appropriate environmental protection must be provided for agglomerations above 2,000 population equivalent. Standard treatment is also to be provided by then for all waste water entering collecting systems at coastal agglomerations of 10,000 population equivalent or above, and at all agglomerations above 2,000 population equivalent discharging to fresh water or estuaries, and anywhere else where a collecting system exists. The directive does, however, allow for storm water overflows.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is currently consulting on designation of 81 coastal waters, to apply the standards set in the Shellfish Waters Directive (79/923/EEC) at those locations. These standards include ceilings for microbiological contamination. Should these waters be designated, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency will be charged with drawing up improvement programmes which, if appropriate, will further control discharge of sewage at those locations. The consultation paper is available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. no. 14764).</p>
