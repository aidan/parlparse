  <p>As agreed by the Parliament, the 2001 Scottish Census forms were not available in Gaelic. However, the Registrar General for Scotland printed 10,000 Gaelic translations of the questions included on the census form to assist Gaelic speakers in completing the census form. The translations were available to anyone on request.</p>

  <p>There is a legal requirement to complete the census form in English. Anyone needing assistance to complete their census form was able to ask their enumerator or contact Gaelic-speaking operators on the Census Helpline.</p>

  <p>The Accounts Commission for Scotland has the overall responsibility for issues concerning the accounts of local authorities in Scotland. The Controller of Audit may decide to make a report to the Accounts Commission on a particular matter arising out of or in connection with the accounts of any local authority, or the Accounts Commission may ask him to produce such reports as it requires. This is a matter for them.</p>

  <p>I understand that the council are considering a range of measures which might be taken to address the deficits they have identified. There are no plans to make additional funds available to Scottish Borders Council.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive very much regrets the job losses resulting from USI&#8217;s decision to downsize its plant at Irvine. Our main concern is to ensure that everything possible is done to assist those affected find alternative employment.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether any adjustments in the levels of revenue support grant for local authorities will be made as a result of the provisions in the Gaming Act (Variation of Fees) (No.2) (Scotland) Order 2001 (SSI 2001/230).</p>

  <p>The intention of the revised levels of fee is to allow local authority licensing boards to achieve full cost recovery for processing gaming licences under the Act. Since there are many more licences for bingo than for casinos, it is unlikely the changes will result in less income for licensing boards. The changes follow the recommendations of the Gaming Board, following a National Audit Office study of the board. The revised fees should more accurately reflect the costs to local authority licensing boards of administering the licensing process.</p>

  <p>The number of higher specialist training posts available in Scotland is regularly adjusted to meet the projected number of new consultants needed to meet known and anticipated turnover and local service developments. The specialist registrar establishment for the surgical specialties was increased in March 2001 from 228 to 253, meaning that the total number of specialist training posts in surgery has risen by almost 11% in the last year.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive which (a) internet service provider and (b) internet exchange it currently uses and, if this internet exchange is not located in Scotland, what plans it has to change to an internet service provider which uses a Scottish exchange, and what the reasons are for its position on this matter.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&#8217;s internet service provider is Cable and Wireless, who support the Government Secure Intranet (GSI). Members of the GSI have access to a range of services including a facility to exchange classified electronic mail securely, secure access to the internet, and directory services. Changing our internet service provider would mean that we could no longer use the GSI and we therefore have no plans at present to make such a change. When procuring services of this nature, the Scottish Executive would not discriminate in favour of providers based in Scotland, or providers using Scottish exchanges, because European law prohibits discrimination on grounds of nationality or location when awarding public contracts.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive which (a) internet service provider and (b) internet exchange is currently used by (i) Scottish Enterprise, (ii) Highlands and Islands Enterprise, (iii) VisitScotland, (iv) each health board and (v) each local authority; whether, if some or all of these bodies do not currently use an internet service provider which uses a Scottish internet exchange, it will encourage them to switch to a provider which uses a Scottish exchange and what the reasons are for its position on this matter.</p>

  <p>Procurement decisions by non-departmental bodies, health boards and local authorities are a matter for the individual bodies concerned. The information requested is not therefore held centrally and could only be obtained at disproportionate cost. It is not possible for the Executive to encourage the bodies listed to switch to an internet service provider which uses a Scottish exchange; it would be unlawful under European law for public bodies to discriminate in favour of providers according to their location, or the location of their sub-contractors.</p>

  <p>The Executive welcomes the establishment of internet exchange facilities in Scotland and hopes that they will prove to be successful. Internet service providers which use an internet exchange based in Scotland, like any other service provider, should have the opportunity to compete, on the basis of value for money, for public sector requirements as and when they are advertised.</p>

  <p>No specific criteria are set for children with special educational needs (SEN) to be included in mainstream. Under section 15 of the Standards in Scotland&#8217;s Schools Etc Act 2000, education authorities will be required to include all pupils with special educational needs in mainstream schools except under certain specified circumstances.</p>

  <p>The needs of all children with SEN are assessed by the relevant education authority to ensure the most appropriate educational provision is made. National circular 4/96 provides advice to education authorities about the statutory arrangements for providing education and undertaking assessments of children and young people with special educational needs.</p>
