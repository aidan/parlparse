  <p>From 2000 to 2006, funding for diversification was provided by the Agricultural and Farm Business Development Schemes (ABDS/FBDS). The information you have requested is not held or readily available specifically for the Kilmarnock and Loudoun area, but a total of 39 FBDS projects were approved in the East Ayrshire local authority area during that period. This resulted in funding of &pound;625,764 being awarded, levering total eligible investment of &pound;1.655 million. Across Scotland as a whole, 1,150 projects were approved, with funding awarded of &pound;21.95 million.</p>

  <p>I was pleased to learn that Ross Finnie shares my concerns about the impact cheap alcohol has on alcohol misuse in Scotland.</p>

  <p>I have already announced the government&rsquo;s intention to crack down on irresponsible promotions in supermarkets and other off-sales premises. We will shortly consult on the detail of these proposals and once we have considered the outcome of the consultation, I shall bring forward regulations which I hope all parties will be able to support</p>

  <p>The class organisation of particular schools is a matter for individual local circumstances. We have signed a concordat with local government which will see year on year progress towards reducing class sizes in primary 1 to primary 3 to a maximum of 18. The concordat recognises that the pace of implementation will vary across authorities depending on local circumstances and needs.</p>

  <p>Re-establish the Scottish Fuel Poverty Forum under an independent chair to advise on options for future policy direction;</p>

  <p>Prioritise the Central Heating Programme waiting list with immediate effect to give priority to the fuel poor, and allow headroom for reform;</p>

  <p>Higher Education (HE) Discretionary Funds</p>

  <p>HE Discretionary Funds are provided to higher and further education institutions and consist of:</p>

  <p>the Higher Education Childcare Fund</p>

  <p>the Undergraduate Discretionary Fund</p>

  <p>the Postgraduate Discretionary Fund</p>

  <p>the new Part-time Fund.</p>

  <p>Allocation of HE Childcare Fund is based on the number of Scottish domiciled undergraduate students and post-graduate teaching degree students (excluding those on courses in professions allied to medicine). Half of the fund is distributed according to the number of mature students at each institution and the other half according to the number of students receiving Lone Parent&rsquo;s Grant.</p>

  <p>Undergraduate Discretionary Fund allocations are also based on two sets of criteria. Half of the fund is allocated based on full-time equivalent (FTE) number of UK undergraduate students at each institution. The other half is allocated based on the number of Scottish domiciled full-time undergraduate students whose household income is at or below the income threshold at which maximum Young Students&rsquo; Bursary is awarded.</p>

  <p>Postgraduate Discretionary Fund allocations are based on the FTE number of UK domiciled postgraduate students (both full and part-time time).</p>

  <p>For session 2008-09 a new Discretionary Fund is being introduced for part-time students only. Allocations for this fund are based on part-time FTEs at each institution. This is similar to the method used for the Undergraduate Discretionary Fund.</p>

  <p>Further Education (FE) Discretionary Funds</p>

  <p>FE Discretionary Funds are provided to FE institutions and are allocated as follows:</p>

  <p>50% by each college&rsquo;s share of FESUMs;</p>

  <p>30% by each college&rsquo;s share of FE students from the 20% most deprived areas (head count) taken from the <em>Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation</em>, and</p>

  <p>20% according to each college&rsquo;s share of FE Students (head count).</p>

  <p>FE activity is measured in SUMs (student units of measurement) as used by the Scottish Funding Council (SFC). Each FE SUM represents FE study as per SCQF measurements up to and including level 6.</p>

  <p>The data used in the allocation of the Discretionary Funds comes from the Student Awards Agency for Scotland, the Higher Education Statistics Agency and the SFC&rsquo;s Further Education Statistics collection.</p>

As I have already advised Parliament, I intend to undertake a review of the local government finance funding formula jointly with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities in time for the next three-year settlement in 2011-12.</p>

  <p>Both the current grants for Scottish students operating system and its replacement student entitlement processing system would have required expenditure and rewriting, adding to the complexity of these systems and the need for additional rigorous testing.</p>

  <p>In relation to administrative functions, in order to run two separate means tests, SAAS would have to develop two separate application forms to ensure that all the correct information on the income assessment was collected for each students.</p>

  <p>There is no way that SAAS can identify potential new students, which would include those returning to study after a break of a year or more, and therefore cannot control the information or applications given out to these students. From a processing point of view, this could lead to an increase in provisional assessments as SAAS await the correct information and the correct application form.</p>

  <p>There is also the added complication of two siblings being assessed using two different means tests. The administration involved in ensuring that different members of one family completed the correct application form, combined with the problem of having to explain why different information is required for each student in the family and why they would be receiving different levels of support, could only lead to complaints.</p>

  <p>There is therefore not only a risk of the wrong payment being made, but an increase in the volume of workload for SAAS, who would also have to reassess such cases. This is a hugely complicated system and any increase in the processing and administration of applications could potentially lead to delays in payments to students.</p>

  <p>Communicating the two different means tests through Information Advice and Guidance would be very complicated as would the management of how and who this is targeted at. There are various ways that students can receive information on student support, but we have no way of knowing that they are receiving the correct information.</p>

  <p>There would also be an impact on the training required within SAAS, as well as significant work on the existing training package for case working staff.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has averted a number of difficulties to parents and students by its decision to not run two systems of means testing for student loans and bursaries concurrently. These include:</p>

  <p>1. By running with one system, we are ensuring that we are no longer discriminating against married couples and civil partners. This is because if we were running two systems we would be taking account of spouse&rsquo;s income in all cases but only partners income in some cases. Having one system ensures that partners&rsquo; income will be treated in the same way as that of a spouse or civil partner. As a result of this, students with partners will be eligible for the same support as students with spouses or civil partners.</p>

  <p>2. Two systems of means-testing would mean that many continuing students would miss out on the initiative of extending the young students&rsquo; bursary to students under 25 with children. The single system ensures that some continuing students will benefit from this change.</p>

  <p>3. In cases where a family has more than one student, this means that the parents will only have to provide one set of information. It also means that both students will be assessed on the same basis and receive the same level of support.</p>

  <p>4. Running with one system ensures that all students are assessed on a level footing and the same income assessment will be applied regardless of level of study.</p>

  <p>5. There is no risk of students and parents completing the incorrect application form. There are various ways that students can receive information on student support but we have no way of knowing that they are receiving the correct information. With one system of means-testing there is only one application form for students and parents. This ensures that students are using, and receiving, the correct information, advice and guidance and the appropriate application form. It is also means that students are better able to identify what funding they can expect. The advice and guidance literature and the website are simpler and easier to understand. This ensures that the correct application form is used and no delays occur as a result of having to re-submit the correct application along with additional documentary evidence.</p>

  <p>6. Students are less likely to experience delays in their application for support. Running two systems of means-testing increases the volume of work for SAAS. While SAAS can take steps to ensure there is minimum impact in the processing and administration of applications, it cannot legislate for students and parents applying under the incorrect means-test. This could potentially lead to delays in payments to students if they were required to re-submit the correct application</p>

  <p>Support for the third sector in Glasgow is primarily a matter for the Council, through the community planning partnership.</p>

  <p>We are working with COSLA, SoLACE and SCVO in a group whose aim is to strengthen the relationship between the third sector and the public sector, locally, in the context of the new relationship between the Scottish Government and local government.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Budget underpins our view that decisions on local delivery are best made at the local level with shared outcomes contributed to by the public, private and third sectors. The removal of ring fencing reduces costs of bureaucracy and allows greater efficiency.</p>
