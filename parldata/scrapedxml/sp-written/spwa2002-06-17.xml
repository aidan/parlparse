  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in relation to the letter from the Minister for Social Justice dated 22 February 2002 regarding Mrs Richardson of Bavelaw, Galashiels, whether it will reconsider its decision and award a retrospective grant under its central heating programme on the basis of the following exceptional circumstances: Mrs Richardson&#146;s boiler was condemned in October 2001, requiring immediate replacement; she was not informed of her eligibility under the central heating programme; she did not become aware of the availability of 100% grants for central heating installation until two weeks after her heating had been installed, and any delay in installing the heating in order for the grant to be approved would have prevented Eaga Partnership (Scotland) from carrying out the work until March 2002 leaving her without heating from October 2001 to March 2002.</p>

  <p>The central heating programme has been widely publicised. That is why more than 12,000 applications have been received over the last year from households in the private sector.</p>

  <p>The programme is targeted at households most at risk from the effects of cold and damp homes: those who lack any form of central heating. If the programme were to be extended to include those who have already installed central heating this would divert funds away from the most vulnerable. There are therefore no plans to offer retrospective grant and there are no plans to reconsider this position, either generally or in individual cases.</p>

  <p>The restriction of Gourock to Dunoon services to one an hour was made by the Secretary of State for Scotland in a House of Commons Parliamentary Question on 12 February 1982, reference Volume 17/56, Column 480. The answer stated that -</p>

  <p>I announced on 12 October 1981 that a passenger service would continue to be provided by Caledonian MacBrayne between Gourock and Dunoon piers. I asked Caledonian MacBrayne to consider how best to provide such a service. In the light of its examination and following discussions with those concerned I now propose that Caledonian MacBrayne should continue to operate an hourly passenger and vehicle service between Gourock and Dunoon. Future subsidy for this service is now intended to be in respect only of carrying foot passengers.</p>

  <p>Fuel poverty is caused by a combination of low incomes, fuel prices and poor home energy efficiency. Those on low incomes are being helped by the Chancellor of the Exchequer&#146;s reforms of the tax and benefit systems, particularly the Working Families Tax Credit and the Minimum Income Guarantee for pensioners. Competition in the provision of domestic fuel, and the activities of the Regulator, exert a downward pressure on fuel prices. In addition, some fuel companies offer fixed rate packages of gas or electricity for low-income households. Poor home energy efficiency is tackled through the Executive&#146;s Warm Deal programme.</p>

  <p>In November 2001 we published the consultation paper <i>Getting Involved in Planning.</i> This sought comments on a range of proposals to improve the effectiveness of existing arrangements for involving the public in the planning process. An independent analysis of the responses will be published in the summer.</p>

  <p>In his speech to Parliament on 30 May, outlining our legislative programme to April 2003, the First Minister indicated that we would be working to develop proposals for a White Paper on Planning to make public involvement more meaningful.</p>

  <p>Data about injury road accidents are collected by the police and reported to the Scottish Executive using the STATS 19 statistical report form. These returns cover only road accidents in which one or more people were injured: they do not cover damage only accidents.</p>

Each accident has been classified according to the severity of the most seriously injured casualty who was involved in it.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that the statistics given in the table are based upon the data which are held in the central statistical database and which were collected by the police at the time of the accident and subsequently reported to the Executive. They may differ from any figures which the local authority would provide now, because they do not take account of any subsequent changes or corrections that the local authority may have made to the statistical information, for use at local level, about the location of each accident, based upon its knowledge of the road and area concerned.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is in regular contact with the UK Government on a wide range of issues, including mobile phones and driving.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive shares with the UK Government responsibility for road safety publicity campaigns in Scotland.

The campaign has no current plans for a publicity campaign on the use of mobile phones by drivers whilst driving.</p>

  <p>In their decision letter following the Public Inquiry, Scottish ministers accepted the reporter&#146;s recommendation to give early consideration to funding the option of extending the link road through to Inchture Interchange. Due to higher priorities on the A90 and elsewhere on the trunk road network it has, to date, not proved possible to accommodate the link road in the current programme.</p>

  <p>We launched a breakfast services grant of &#163;250,000 in November 2001. However, before issuing funding guidelines, we are conducting a review of breakfast services to establish details on numbers of places and providers, where appropriate demand lies and best use of the funds to support the service. The review is being led by Health Education Board for Scotland and will aim to complete during summer 2002.</p>

  <p>In her answer to S1O-4973 on 28 March 2002, Cathy Jamieson indicated other ways that the Executive is supporting the development of breakfast clubs.</p>

  <p>The Corporate Body was responsible for the resources used by the Parliament in supporting the visit to Aberdeen and it will wish to review how the exercise was managed and financed. I anticipate that this will be discussed by the SPCB in September of this year, thus any lessons learned will be considered at that time.</p>

  <p>Consultations on this matter will involve various officials of Aberdeen University, Aberdeen City Council and the Parliament.</p>
