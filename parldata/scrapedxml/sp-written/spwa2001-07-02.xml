  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what progress has been made by its Adult Literacy Team.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2001-07-02.S1W-16672.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80131" speakername="Ms Wendy Alexander" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-01/wa0702.htm#se_Minister">

  <p>I am <strong> </strong> pleased to announce that the Adult Literacy Team&#8217;s report will be published on Monday 2 July on the team&#8217;s website.</p>

  <p>Website address: http://www.scotland.gov.uk/who/elld/alt.asp</p>

  <p>I welcome the report and broadly endorse its conclusions and 21 recommendations, although I wish to give them careful attention before making a full response to each one.</p>

  <p>I have agreed with the team&#8217;s recommendation that &#163;18.5 million of the &#163;22.5 million previously announced for adult literacy over the next three years should be distributed through local authorities to community learning strategy partnerships, where all sectors will be able to access the new resources. I believe that this is the best way to ensure funds reach all those who can assist in meeting the national target set out in the report of helping 80,000 people over the next three years.</p>

  <p>The allocations to local authorities, shown in the table, takes account of the team&#8217;s research on the main factors affecting low literacy and numeracy, so that funding can be targeted where it is most needed.</p>

  <p>Guidance will be issued shortly to local authorities detailing their individual allocations in each of the three years, which will be linked to outcomes agreed with them on behalf of the Community Learning Strategy Partnerships.</p>

  <p>Allocation of resources to local authorities for adult literacy and numeracy (2001-04)</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what changes will be involved for Scotland arising from the abolition of the Intervention Board Executive Agency and the formation of the new payments agency for Common Agriculture Policy payments in England.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2001-07-02.S1W-16741.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80155" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-01/wa0702.htm#2">

  <p>The Intervention Board Executive Agency (IBEA) is designated as a cross-border public authority under sections 88 and 89 of the Scotland Act 1998. It carries out certain CAP related functions, mainly on market management matters, on behalf of Scottish ministers.</p>

  <p>On abolition of IBEA, the functions will revert to Scottish ministers, but provision is being made for the new payments agency - Rural Payments Agency - to carry out these functions on behalf of Scottish ministers under formal agency arrangements.</p>

  <p>These changes require secondary legislative changes both at Westminster and in the Parliament. Scottish Regulations will be laid in September covering these matters.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer given to question S1W-12632 on 23 January this year when I announced a package of provisional proposals which have been submitted to the European Commission and which I believe will provide a robust framework for the continued delivery of high quality lifeline ferry services to the Highlands and Islands.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has remained in close touch with the European Commission and we hope to have the commission&#8217;s views on the proposals shortly.</p>

It is examining how to encourage more dentists into remote, rural and deprived areas.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether there are any restrictions on dental therapists&#8217; place of work, in particular, on moving from a hospital or community dental service to a general practice, under the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978 and the Dental Auxiliaries Regulations 1986 (SI 1986/887); whether it will detail any such restrictions, and what plans it has to remove any such restrictions to increase patient access to appropriate dental care and treatment.</p>

  <p>The Dentists Act 1984 gives power to the General Dental Council (GDC) to make regulations governing dental therapists, among other dental auxiliaries. That power is restricted so that, without an Order in Council, dental therapists cannot undertake the filling of teeth or the extraction of deciduous teeth in general dental practice. In addition, regulations made by the GDC prevent therapists from carrying out other activities in general practice. Whether these restrictions should be altered is a regulatory matter falling within a reserved area. The desirability of lifting or modifying these restrictions, in order to increase patient access while assuring the quality and safety of treatment, is the subject of discussion with the UK Government.</p>

  <p>The maintenance of standards and skills in the area of medical practice is the responsibility of a range of people and groups. The General Medical Council (GMC), which is an independent regulatory body, sets standards of practice for doctors. It is the responsibility of each individual doctor, as a professional practitioner, to keep his or her standards and skills up to the level required by the GMC. NHS employers also have a responsibility to support and manage Continuing Professional Development (CPD) and the introduction of the new appraisal system for consultants will underpin this. The Scottish Executive currently provides substantial financial input to the Scottish Council for Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education (SCPMDE) to enable them to support doctors in undertaking CPD.</p>

  <p>Heroin and methadone are opioids that act in the same way on receptors in the brain. Opioid dependence is a well-established and clearly defined phenomenon. It is characterised by physical and psychological dependence, which becomes more likely as the dose and duration of use increase.</p>

  <p>Users of heroin experience a euphoria, but addicts become tolerant to the pleasurable effects of the drug quite rapidly. Methadone does not produce euphoria.</p>

  <p>Street heroin varies in purity and heroin requires more frequent &quot;hits&quot; than methadone.</p>

  <p>Heroin is generally thought to be more addictive than methadone. However, because methadone is long acting and the withdrawal effects, though less severe, can last much longer, drug users often claim that methadone is &quot;harder to come off&quot; than heroin.</p>

  <p>At present, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is not recommended for routine use in the childhood immunisation programme. However, studies to assess the possible role for pneumococcal immunisation in the UK programme are currently ongoing and the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), an independent expert committee which advises UK Health Departments on vaccination and immunisation issues, will review the evidence once these studies have been completed.</p>

  <p>The small hydro schemes contracted under the SRO had a total capacity of 30.5 MW, and a potential output of about 80 GWhrs annually.

  <p>Scottish Natural Heritage&#8217;s Policy Statement does not constitute guidance to planning authorities but is primarily intended to guide its staff in their role as consultees. Scottish Executive planning policy on this issue is to be found in <i>National Planning Policy Guideline 6: Renewable Energy Developments</i> .</p>

  <p>Those determining development proposals must consider the weight to be attached to all the issues raised, including comments from consultees such as Scottish Natural Heritage. Consents under section 36 of the Electricity Act have deemed planning consent under the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 and are therefore subject to the same considerations.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency and Fisheries Research Services purchase some of their marine gas oil requirements from Esso under the terms of a contract put in place by the Ministry of Defence. Other areas of the Executive occasionally purchase small amounts of fuel oil from, amongst others, Esso.</p>

  <p>Contracts placed by non-departmental public bodies are a matter for the individual body concerned. Information on contracts placed by those bodies is not held centrally.</p>
