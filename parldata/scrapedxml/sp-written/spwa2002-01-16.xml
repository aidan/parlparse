  <p>We seek to promote consistency in the way that police forces record crime through guidelines and audits.</p>

  <p>We issue guidance through the Criminal Statistics Handbook. The guidance is discussed with police representatives through the Scottish Criminal Statistics Committee and is ratified by the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Justice Department Justice Statistics Unit also visits police forces to monitor police recording practice and confirm that the guidance is being followed. In its regular programme of primary inspections, Her Majesty&#146;s Inspectorate of Constabulary also audits processes and procedures used within forces to record crime.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#146;s strategy for developing the National Grid for Learning (NGfL) in Scotland has a range of programmes and projects in place to encourage and co-ordinate innovative and exploratory work on ICT in schools, covering the main themes of training, content and infrastructure.</p>

  <p>We encourage the sharing of innovative practice among the approved training providers for the New Opportunities Fund (NOF) ICT training programme by holding regular co-ordinating meetings between HMIE and the training providers. In addition we have hosted two major conferences to ensure effective links between NOF training initiatives and the rollout of the NGfL. As a result we have established an Innovative Practice Group charged with exploring ways of disseminating good practice.</p>

  <p>Working with Learning and Teaching Scotland, our programme of content and software development includes the co-ordination of innovative activities where schools throughout Scotland and in other countries collaborate in on-line learning.</p>

  <p>We are supporting a number of projects that explore possible future developments in the use of ICT. With Learning and Teaching Scotland we are investigating the requirements for a learning objects repository. We have supported Dundee City Council in a project that will investigate the effective use of laptop computers by teachers and pupils. We are also working with Glasgow City Council to develop innovative approaches to the use of ICT in support of children who cannot attend schools.</p>

  <p>Our ICT innovation awards scheme is specifically designed to co-ordinate and support innovative and exploratory work in the field of ICT across pre-school, primary, secondary and community education. &#163;50,000 has been available for each round of the scheme, offering grants of up to &#163;5000 to support innovative projects.</p>

  <p>This support often helps to draw in money from other partners. Phase two of the scheme is supporting 14 projects, and more information can be found on the internet at <a href="http://www.ngflscotland.gov.uk/innovationawards/">http://www.ngflscotland.gov.uk/innovationawards/</a>.</p>

  <p>There is as yet no consensus with education authorities and others on the handling of intellectual property issues. Learning and Teaching Scotland is working closely with all the local authorities, through the Inter-Authority Collaborative Network, to ensure learning materials produced with public funds are used to best effect across Scotland.</p>

  <p>Learning and Teaching Scotland has used the development of the five to 14 online resource www.ngflscotland.gov.uk/5-14/guidelines to explore copyright, licensing and intellectual property issues with schools and local authorities.</p>

  <p>The schools licence recently announced for the SCRAN database gives schools access to an environment in which they can create and share online materials based on items from SCRAN.</p>

  <p>The planned Scottish Schools Digital Network will provide a focus for the exchange of materials, and the development of the specification for the network will provide a further opportunity to examine intellectual property issues with local authorities.</p>

  <p>I am grateful for the opportunity to correct a minor inaccuracy in the report of the Digital Scotland Task Force, which was repeated in the Executive's response to that report. The agreement reached by the European Council at the Lisbon Summit, and announced by the Prime Minister, Mr Tony Blair was to provide electronic access to the main basic public services by 2003, not to all basic public services as stated in the report of the Digital Scotland Task Force.</p>

  <p>The list of the 20 main basic public services agreed by member states was published as an annex to the communication <i>e-Europe 2002: Impacts and Priorities</i>. Most of that list are reserved matters. We are working on all those which fall within the remit of the Scottish Executive and a number are already available electronically.</p>

  <p>Local authorities through COSLA, have given an undertaking to match the Executive&#146;s commitment to delivering services online by 2005. Each local authority has identified e-advocates at both Senior Officer and Elected Member level who are accountable for the delivery of their Council&#146;s 21 <sup>st</sup> Century Government Strategy.</p>

  <p>Eight of these e-advocates, along with the Chief Executive of COSLA, are represented on the Central/Local 21<sup>st</sup> Century Government Forum which helps to drive the Modernising Government and Information Age Government agendas across all local authorities.</p>

  <p>We now have enabling legislation in place in the Electronic Communications Act 2000 to allow us to amend existing legislation where that does not allow for the use of electronic communications or data storage. Some perceived barriers are not barriers after all but are being considered on a case-by-case basis. For instance, the data protection legislation is not generally a barrier to electronic delivery provided that the requirements of the legislation regarding appropriate consents and storage of information are met.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive continues to work very closely with the Office of the e-Envoy in developing technical and data standards. The Executive has endorsed the e-Government Interoperability Framework and the e-Government Metadata Framework. The Executive is keen to remain in line as far as possible with both UK and International standards. To date an approach of endorsing and promoting standards has been adopted, however, the soon to be published Information Age Government Framework will contain a number of standards and these will be mandated to the extent of the Executive&#146;s authority and which other bodies will be strongly encouraged to adopt.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is not a major service provider, and its main role therefore is to provide encouragement and guidance to service providers. This is being done in a variety of ways; e.g. through working groups, seminars, published guidance, research and the Modernising Government Fund.</p>

  <p>The first electronic service delivery progress report, published in November 2001, shows that more than 60% of the services provided by the Scottish Executive, its agencies and non-departmental public bodies are already available online.</p>

  <p>E-procurement was addressed by point no 24 of the Digital Scotland Taskforce&#146;s report. Since the report&#146;s publication the Executive has been working with the wider Scottish public sector, including health and local government, to develop an e-procurement service which will be available to all Scottish public bodies. In November 2001, following an international competition, the Executive announced the selection of Cap Gemini, Ernst and Young and its partner Elcom, to develop and host the web-based service.</p>

  <p>Pre-implementation work has already commenced in the Executive, Highland Council, West Lothian Council, Highland NHS bodies and Scottish Healthcare Supplies. Pre-implementation work is due to commence shortly in a range of other organisations.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has adopted a multi channelled approach to the delivery of public services and information. It has supported and continues to support a number of pilot projects which are exploring different methods of delivery to ensure further widening of access to services and information. Transcoding of individual data sources is enabling these sources of data to be delivered and accessed through a variety of channels.</p>

  <p>Through its 21<sup>st</sup> Century Government Unit vision statement, the Scottish Executive puts the citizen at the centre of the process in ensuring that he or she is empowered to access information and services in his or her preferred manner.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is also looking at different ways of improving general access to the Internet in Scotland. The Public Internet Access Points Initiative aims to put at least 1,000 extra public internet access points in areas of Scotland where affordable provision is currently poor.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is also running a Digital Communities competition. This initiative will create pilot &quot;digital communities&quot;, by connecting homes to the internet in two disadvantaged areas of Scotland. The objective is to assess how individual access to the internet can transform opportunities for people living in these communities, by developing new ways of accessing learning, work, shopping and leisure.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#146;s 21 <sup>st</sup> Century Government Vision clearly lays out the desirability of exploiting new technology where it delivers improved services. The Executive has sought to encourage debate on new delivery channels and the streamlining of internal processes. The Executive hosted a seminar in October 2001 on call centre technology specifically to share best practice about this citizen focussed service delivery channel. Promoting the e-Government Interoperability Framework is also important in seeking to maximise efficiencies across public bodies.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#146;s &#163;1.5 million Digital Champion programme is providing a network of eight digital &quot;champions&quot; to cover Social Inclusion Partnership (SIP) areas in Scotland. They are working to improve ICT provision in these areas by engaging local people and driving forward local activity. The Digital Champions are building on the <i>Audit of ICT initiatives in SIP areas</i> which was commissioned by the Executive (published June 2000, see http://www.scotland.gov.uk/cru/kd01/red/audit01.htm) by mapping ICT initiatives and facilities in detail in SIP areas, and subsequently developing further initiatives where appropriate.</p>

  <p>The earlier audit identified a total of 90 ICT initiatives within the SIPs and Working for Communities Pathfinders (WfCPs), and a further 60 related initiatives, not directly run or financed by the SIPs or WfCPs, but falling within their areas.</p>

  <p>In addition the Executive has mapped facilities in Scotland which provide public access to the web &#150; and around 700 have been identified so far. Members of the public can find the nearest place to get on the web via the UK online call centre and a clickable map on the web (see www.scotland.gov.uk/digitalscotland/webaccess).</p>

  <p>The Executive&#146;s strategy for digital inclusion "Connecting Scotland's People" set out a range of actions to raise awareness; improve access; develop skills; and involve communities. These include:</p>

  <p>A &#163;5 million initiative which will create over 1,000 points that provide access to the web in a wide range of different types of venue. The focus will be on areas where access is currently poor.</p>

  <p>A &#163;3.5 million initiative to create pilot &quot;digital communities&quot; in two disadvantaged areas by connecting homes to the Internet.</p>

  <p>The &#163;1.5 million Digital Champion programme which is providing a network of eight digital &quot;champions&quot; to cover Social Inclusion Partnership (SIP) areas in Scotland. They are working to improve ICT provision in these areas by engaging local people and driving forward local activity.</p>

  <p>A &#163;1.6 million initiative to develop community ICT facilities in Gorbals and Pollok. They will be aimed at encouraging people from disadvantaged neighbourhoods to take their first steps in experiencing how ICTs and the Internet can have a positive impact on the quality of their lives.</p>

  <p>A number of other initiatives are also promoting ICT in communities. These include:</p>

  <p>The New Opportunities Fund has allocated &#163;23 million through its &quot;Community Access to Lifelong Learning&quot; programme. The money is being used to link every public library to the Internet and to improve access to lifelong learning through the use of information and communications technology across Scotland, with the focus on socially excluded adults and communities.</p>

  <p>&#163;8 million has been made available to the Scottish University for Industry to develop a network of learndirect scotland branded learning centres to enable easier access to ICT learning within communities &#150; 223 learndirect scotland centres have been created so far and the target is to create 300 centres by March 2002.</p>

  <p>&#163;1.5 million has been made available over three years for IT development in the voluntary sector.</p>

  <p>Scottish Executive, in partnership with Scottish Enterprise, has contributed &#163;150,000 to launch the Uplift project. Uplift is providing initial computer training for 60 to 70 people around the country who will in turn be able to pass on their skills to other members of their communities.</p>

  <p>The National Grid for Learning (NGfL) website has a communities channel which has developed a &quot;Guide to Getting Communities Connected&quot;. This provides information to help those who wish to promote the use of ICTs in the community. In addition the Executive is providing &#163;530,000 to the &quot;Connecting Communities&quot; project - an ICT training project for community learning practitioners.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#146;s digital inclusion strategy sets out evidence that the digital divide in Scotland is closely correlated to low income levels. Initiatives under the digital inclusion strategy will therefore be targeted primarily on low income individuals and communities &#150; and clearly this will include many disabled and elderly people. We also aim to put some of the new public internet access points into facilities used by elderly people. In addition, later this year we will take forward a study into how ICT and web access can be improved for disabled people.</p>

  <p>Through the Modernising Government Fund, the Scottish Executive has supported a number of pilot projects which are exploring the different methods of delivery available to provide information and services to Scottish citizens. Projects have involved research into service delivery through iDTV, information kiosks, call centres, one stop shops, e-mail and web sites to give but a few examples. The Scottish Executive is actively involved in encouraging a multi channel access approach, particularly through highlighting examples of best practice to be found across the Scottish public sector and through the promotion of its vision statement. The vision has at its heart, citizen choice, whereby the citizen is empowered to access information and services in his or her preferred manner.</p>

  <p>The Executive encourages public agencies through the regular and consistent promotion of the 21 <sup>st</sup> Century Government Vision, of a Scotland where the delivery of public services and public information are characterised by their citizen focus and by choice of means of access. Further to this a series of working groups and seminars on topics such as Portals, GIS and Call Centres have been held with plans for future events. The 21 <sup>st</sup> Century Government Unit has recently announced a conference 'Transforming Scotland' to be held on 25 January at the Glasgow SECC, which will further promote the citizen focussed approach.</p>

  <p>The Executive is shortly to commission research into how customer views and reactions are currently used both to improve future service delivery and to resolve any immediate service failure. This research scheduled for publication in May 2002 will be published and results promoted across the wider Public Sector.</p>

  <p>Funding of projects through the Modernising Government Fund and the subsequent sharing of best practice in this area will also have a positive effect.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#146;s response to point 56 was that it would set up a dedicated digital inclusion unit to co-ordinate work on digital inclusion. Last year this was done, the Executive created a dedicated digital inclusion unit to take forward its objectives for digital inclusion. As a first step, in discussion with partners in the public, private and voluntary sectors, the digital inclusion team developed the Executive&#146;s Digital Inclusion Strategy <i>Connecting Scotland&#146;s People</i> which was published in September 2001 (see www.scotland.gov.uk/digitalscotland), which sets out the Executive&#146;s framework for developing digital inclusion.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how long it takes to train a local champion in relation to utilising information and communications technologies and how much this training costs.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-01-16.S1W-21284.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80167" speakername="Iain Gray" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0116.htm#2">

  <p>The length of time taken to train a local champion in the effective use of ICTs depends on a number of factors such as the individual&#146;s previous experience. An effective local champion not only has to be confident in the use of ICTs, but also has to be able to realise the potential for ICTs to enhance local activities and learning opportunities.</p>

  <p>The European Computer Driving License (ECDL) is a good indicator of proficiency in the use of ICTs. The study time required will depend on the individual, but typically might be around 40 hours. The fees charged for an ECDL course by a training provider will vary &#150; but might lie between &#163;150 and &#163;250. However, additional training in other skills may also be required.</p>

  <p>A further example of a scheme that trains local champions is the National Grid for Learning&#146;s &quot;Connecting Communities&quot; programme. This course does not aim to deliver core ICT skills but instead aims to equip local champions with the knowledge, skills and understanding to integrate ICT into everyday work.</p>

  <p>Using the freely available NGfL training materials (<a href="http://www.ngflscotland.gov.uk/communities/training/">http://www.ngflscotland.gov.uk/communities/training</a>) the successful trainees are expected to cascade their new skills to up to 10 other local community representatives.</p>

  <p>Apart from some equipment costs and the cost of producing the training materials and making them available on-line, typical basic training costs for a group of 12 participants are:</p>

  <p><table border="BORDER" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="50%">
<tr>
<td width="79%" valign="TOP" height="16">
<p>3 days face-to-face ICT training 
                  </p></td>
<td width="21%" valign="TOP" height="16">
<p align="RIGHT">&#163;1,500 
                  </p></td>

<tr>
<td width="79%" valign="TOP" height="16">
<p>4 days further support 
                  </p></td>
<td width="21%" valign="TOP" height="16">
<p align="RIGHT">&#163;2,000 
                  </p></td>
</tr>
</table></p>

  <p>Some participants will need more support than others to get to the point where these new skills can be effectively and enthusiastically cascaded to other community practitioners but these figures give a reasonable indication of the costs involved.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive launched a broadband strategy last August with the aim of promoting affordable pervasive broadband across Scotland. The strategy includes aggregated public sector procurement which will be taken forward initially in two pathfinder rural areas - the Highlands and Islands and South of Scotland. We aim to invest in broadband capacity for public services in a way that stimulates providers to supply a wider range of services to businesses and consumers in those areas.</p>

  <p>The Executive also recognises the importance of both testing and increasing demand for broadband, in order to encourage wider roll-out of commercial services, including within rural areas. As a first step, we are proposing a programme of network trials and awareness-raising measures under the DTI fund for innovative projects to extend broadband networks.</p>

  <p>The Joint Performance Team is monitoring progress in information and communications technologies.</p>

  <p>The Joint Performance Team was established by the Scottish Executive and comprises representatives of the Scottish Executive and Enterprise Networks. It is developing indicators that will allow the regular benchmarking of Scotland&#146;s progress against international performance in the areas outlined in Smart, Successful Scotland. The monitoring of the Executive&#146;s own electronic service delivery targets also provide useful benchmarking information.</p>

  <p>The indicators suggested in the Joint Performance Team&#146;s measurement framework relevant to monitoring progress in information and communication technologies fall under two categories, more e-business and digital connectivity. Within these categories, the following measures have been adopted.</p>

  <p>Proportion of business and activity transacted through e-business;</p>

  <p>Number of companies trading online;</p>

  <p>Share of businesses using broadband;</p>

  <p>Cost and geographic coverage of broadband;</p>

  <p>Share of population online, and</p>

  <p>Share of population in Social Inclusion Partnerships and other fragile areas with internet access.</p>

  <p>After a public consultation process the Joint Performance Team is due to publish its final indicator set by 28 January.</p>

  <p>Potential tenderers are generally required to submit, with their bid, or application to bid, details of relevant previous experience and references. Before any major contract is awarded, enquiries are made as to the tenderers&#146; ability to perform the contract, including consideration of relevant past performance. Also, performance by the Executive&#146;s contractors is required to be kept under continuous review by contract managers. In respect of works and works related services contracts, the Executive also makes use of information on past performance available through the &quot;Constructionline&quot; database.</p>

  <p>There are a number of grounds on which potential tenderers can be deemed ineligible to bid. These may include, for example, whether or not the tenderer has been convicted of an offence or committed an act of grave misconduct in the course of its business, whether the tenderer is considered to have sufficient economic and financial standing to fulfil the contract and whether the potential tenderer is considered to have the necessary technical capacity and ability to meet the requirements of the particular contract.</p>

  <p>The extent to which potential tenderers&#146; eligibility is tested varies according to the value, importance and complexity of the contract in question.</p>

  <p>In certain contract award procedures, full tenders may be invited only from a short list consisting of those potential tenderers considered best placed to meet the Executive&#146;s requirements. Such short lists generally include at least three potential bidders (to ensure genuine competition). Limiting the number of full tenders in this way is normal commercial practice and helps minimise the burden of tendering costs for both suppliers and the purchaser. The fact that a potential tenderer has not been invited to bid may, in these circumstances, simply reflect the fact that it was not considered to be one of the strongest applicants.</p>

  <p>European law places certain obligations on public purchasers when considering potential tenderers&#146; eligibility to bid or when selecting a short list of bidders. The Treaty of Amsterdam requires that purchasers do not discriminate on grounds of nationality and, in effect, that potential bidders are treated equally. European public procurement directives (Services Directive 92/50/EEC, Supplies Directive, 93/36/EEC and Works Directive, 93/37/EEC as amended) where they apply, place detailed obligations on public purchasers in respect of the exclusion or selection of bidders. The directives place certain limitations on the information which may be sought from potential tenderers and which may be used to exclude (or select) bidders. The directives also require that decisions on eligibility are based on objective criteria.</p>

  <p>The Executive routinely excludes bidders or potential bidders, either because they are not considered capable of fulfilling the requirements of the contract or because, following a selection process, they have not been short-listed to tender. Records of bidders excluded in this way, and the grounds on which the decision was taken, are not held centrally and the information requested could only be obtained at disproportionate cost. Also, details of particular decisions to exclude bidders will, in general, be commercially sensitive, since publication could be expected to have an adverse impact on the bidder&#146;s commercial standing.</p>
