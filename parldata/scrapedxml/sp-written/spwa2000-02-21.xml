  <p>All of the estimated &pound;140 per week contributed towards their care costs by people in residential care in 1998-99 is accounted for by costs other than nursing care costs. The higher contributions made by people in long term nursing care reflect the additional costs of providing such care. 30% of the estimated &pound;200 per week thus is accounted for by nursing care costs.</p>

  <p>Wider national economic performance is likely to be the main determinant of trends in small business creation, and its employment opportunities, and the prospects for the Scottish economy remain good. However, we have a number of specific initiatives in hand to increase the number of start-up businesses assisted by the enterprise network, and to improve the quality and consistency of advice and support for small businesses across Scotland. We will announce details of these improvements shortly.</p>

  <p>West of Scotland Water Authority is currently implementing a major investment programme of extension, modernisation and replacement of its existing waste-water collection and treatment systems. This programme has many elements, including the improvement of combined storm water overflows whose operation has an adverse impact on the aquatic environment. Storm water overflows protect the network from overloading by diverting excess flow in exceptional conditions. A survey has been undertaken of the 1,000-plus storm overflows from the waste-water systems inherited by West of Scotland Water. Approximately 20% of these were found to be unsatisfactory in performance, and the investment programme will address this.</p>

  <p>In all situations where combined storm water overflows are to be installed or improved, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency is consulted to ensure that discharges will not adversely impact the quality of the waters into which the overflows discharge. The Agency then grants, amends or refuses, under the Control of Pollution Act 1974, a formal Consent to Discharge which would define the frequency, extent and quality of any discharges.</p>

  <p>Throughout the United Kingdom, there are estimated to be around 25,000 combined sewer overflows in operation, and all sewerage undertakers are currently implementing similar improvement programmes.</p>

  <p>After consultation with interested parties last year, I have today published the proposals on the regulatory changes required to implement aspects of the Basic Safety Standards Directive 96/29/Euratom concerned with the control of radioactive waste. The proposals involve the minimum of change to the existing regulatory framework under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 (RSA 93) and fulfil the Government&#8217;s commitment that implementation of the Directive would not lead to a weakening of existing controls. Copies of the document, entitled <i>The Proposals for the Radioactive Substances (Basic Safety Standards) (Scotland) Regulations 2000 and the Radioactive Substances (Basic Safety Standards) (Scotland) Direction 2000</i> can now be found in the Library, and on the Scottish Executive website.</p>

  <p>The proposed Regulations made under section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972, will provide controls on the disposal of certain types of old clocks and watches containing radioactive luminising material, which are currently exempt from regulation. The proposed Direction to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency made under section 40 of the Environment Act 1995 will put a number of its existing administrative practices, in discharging its duties under RSA 93, into legally binding obligations.</p>

  <p>The measures parallel those to be taken elsewhere in the United Kingdom to ensure that the Community Basic Safety Standards can be implemented across the United Kingdom by the due date of 13 May 2000.</p>

  <p>Figures for 1998-99 confirm that almost 75% of all written complaints to Trusts are responded to within the 20-day period.</p>

  <p>We constantly urge Trusts to handle complaints as quickly as possible. With the support of the Health Service Commissioner for Scotland, who is independent of both the NHS and the Scottish Executive, training events are held regularly for staff and lay volunteers involved in the NHS complaints procedure. These events also serve to identify areas where changes in the Directions and Guidance issued in 1996 are needed. Revised and simplified guidance to the NHSiS was issued last June, and the Directions upon which the Guidance is drawn are now currently under review.</p>

  <p>A review of the current complaints process is underway, with a UK-wide evaluation which began in January 1999. The researchers are aiming to issue an interim report by March 2000 and a completed report by February 2001. This is intended to be a practical and realistic analysis based as far as possible on the actual experiences of those using and operating the procedure. The report will be used as a tool to further refine the process so that it better meets its original aims and principles.</p>

  <p>S1W-3658 explained the base formula used from 1997-98. With the full agreement of CoSLA, receipts were taken into account in the calculations from 1999-2000. The calculation uses local authorities&#8217; forecasts of receipts to be raised in year to adjust the net allocations upwards, for those councils who have a low level of receipts&#8217; raising capacity, or downwards for those councils who have a high level of receipts&#8217; raising capacity. The new approach increased West Dunbartonshire&#8217;s base allocation from &pound;3.898 million to &pound;4.192 million.</p>

  <p>By agreement with CoSLA, the single allocation formula is used to determine the main part of the non-housing capital allocations for local authorities. The formula has two parts &#8211; a base calculation (explained in the answer to question S1W-3658) which is then adjusted to take account of capital receipts. The formula allocation represents a measure of relative need for non-housing capital spend between councils.</p>

  <p>In addition to the formula allocation, local authorities also receive capital allocations for the HRA programme, New Housing Partnerships, project specific allocations and allocations for government initiatives.</p>

  <p>Scottish Ministers are responsible for determining the total capital allocations for all local authorities in Scotland. As part of the new arrangements introduced by the Public Finance and Accountability Act, the aggregate figure for local authority capital allocations is specified in the Budget Bill which is subject to the approval of the Scottish Parliament.</p>
