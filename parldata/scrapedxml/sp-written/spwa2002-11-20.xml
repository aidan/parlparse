  <p>The Best Value Task Force does not fall within the authority of the Commissioner of Public Appointments and her Code of Practice does not therefore apply in this instance. However, ministers do seek to apply the spirit of the code whenever relevant and I am satisfied that the appointments we have made to the Best Value Task Force are both appropriate and justified.</p>

  <p>Incidence rates of most types of cancer vary between areas of Scotland and are due to differences in exposures to the main risk factors for cancers: tobacco use, alcohol consumption and diet. Occupational, environmental and genetic factors also contribute to variations.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-26333 by Nicol Stephen on 16 September 2002, what minor changes to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) procedures for student sampling and test administration were made to enable the 2000 Programme for International Student Assessment to be run in Scotland.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-11-20.S1W-29533.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80243" speakername="Nicol Stephen" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa1120.htm#4">

  <p>The minor changes are as follows:</p>

  <p>1. The test administrators were not provided with the type of group training specified by the OECD. This was because the tests were administered by a member of school staff rather than by someone appointed by the contractor. The use of school staff was not in breach of OECD procedures. The fact that the test administrators would have been experienced in supervising test situations meant that group training was considered unnecessary given the disruption this would have caused to schools.</p>

  <p>2. The contractor provided the test administrators with a summary of the OECD guidance, which was used to brief the pupils.</p>

  <p>3. The specified procedures state that 35 pupils from each school should sit the tests. As most of the test administrators were school teaching staff it was considered that groups of 30 pupils would be more appropriate for Scotland. Care was taken to ensure that the sampling of students was random and the smaller group did not introduce any bias into our results.</p>

  <p>Our aim is to ensure that all aspects of current OECD regulations are complied with in the 2003 study.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers attend Council meetings as members of the UK delegation. The Concordat on co-ordination of European Union policy issues provides that in appropriate cases the leader of the delegation can agree to Scottish ministers speaking for the UK in Council, and that they do so with the full weight of the UK behind them. Since the detail of exchanges within Councils is confidential, it is not the Executive&#8217;s practice to disclose the part played in Councils by individual members of the UK delegation. It is always my objective to ensure that Scottish interests are fully pursued in relevant Council discussions.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the excess winter mortality figures have been in each year since 1997 to date, broken down by (a) region, (b) age and (c) gender.</p>

  <p>There is no universally accepted definition of excess winter mortality. A number of options were discussed in an Occasional Paper published earlier this year by the General Register Office for Scotland (GROS). The paper, which was entitled <em>The Raised Incidence of Winter Deaths</em> , may be found on the GROS website:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/grosweb/grosweb.nsf/pages/occ7" target="_blank">http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/grosweb/grosweb.nsf/pages/occ7</a>.</p>

  <p>In their routine data for England and Wales, the Office for National Statistics defines excess winter deaths as being the difference between the number of deaths occurring during the four months December to March and the average number of deaths during the preceding four months (August to November) and the following four months (April to July). The following table provides information for Scotland based on this definition.</p>

  <p>We were first made aware of the Competition Commission Appeal Tribunal&#8217;s judgement on 20 September 2002.</p>

  <p>The tribunal&#8217;s judgement in the case of Bettercare Group Ltd and the Director General of Fair Trading stated that the Competition Act 1998 applied in the particular circumstances of that case. The director has decided not to appeal that decision. One implication is that, potentially, local authorities&#8217; commissioning of care services could be subject to the Competition Act, but each case would need to be decided on its particular facts. The judgement did not comment on whether the North and West Belfast Health and Social Services Trust or, in our context, other local authorities, are presently contravening the act. The Office of Fair Trading will now reconsider the issue of the alleged anti-competitive conduct of North and West Belfast Health and Social Services Trust.</p>

  <p>I understand that the European Court is currently considering a similar case and that an outcome is expected by next spring. This may help to clarify whether the act applies to the commissioning functions of public bodies.</p>

  <p>Against this background, no general assessment has been made of the implications of the ruling and we remain in close contact with our counterparts in Northern Ireland and the other UK administrations on this issue.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, we would continue to expect councils to apply Best Value principles when providing or purchasing care services and to operate in full concordance with the spirit and terms of the Competition Act.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&#8217;s aim is to give all children, including those with learning disabilities, the best possible start in life. The Children (Scotland) Act 1995 requires local authorities to provide and publicise a range and level of services appropriate to the needs of children with disabilities in their area. These services can be provided to the child, and in the interests of promoting or safeguarding his/her welfare, to members of the family.</p>

  <p>In addition, there is a range of programmes supported by the Scottish Executive that can offer support to parents of children with learning disabilities. These include the support we provide for very young children and their parents through Sure Start Scotland; the support we provide through Childcare Strategy funding which can be used to meet the out of school care needs of children with learning disabilities. It also includes the support we provide through the Support for Parents programme which helps parents acquire the necessary skills and confidence to support their children.</p>

  <p>The incentive to implement the recommendations of <em>The same as you? </em> is the achievement of better outcomes for people with learning disabilities and their families. Partnership in Practice Agreements for the period 2001-04 show that local agencies are making better use of resources to improve services for people with learning disabilities. We will continue to work in partnership with local agencies to ensure progress towards full implementation of the recommendations.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-11-20.S1W-31295.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80140" speakername="Malcolm Chisholm" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa1120.htm#9">

  <p>Local authority funding for mental health services, and all other community care services, is provided on an unhypothecated basis. It is therefore up to each local authority to determine use of these resources in line with local circumstances. This year, local authorities received &#163;1,385 million for social work, with &#163;1,112 million of that being provided for community care.</p>

  <p>Details of local authority expenditure on community care services for all client groups are provided in the Scottish Executive&#8217;s <em>Community Care Statistics. </em>The most recent version of this relates to 2000-01 and is available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 24284). Estimates for 2001-02 suggest that local authorities spent &#163;47 million on mental health services, with &#163;19 million of this coming from Mental Illness Specific Grant funding, and &#163;28 million from net local authority expenditure (excluding money raised from fees and so forth).</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not provide NHS boards with a separate budget for mental health. Boards determine how much to spend on mental health and on other health care services from the total allocation of funds that they receive each year to cover the costs of hospital and community services as well as the costs of prescribing in the community. The allocation of this total budget between NHS boards is determined by the Arbuthnott formula which was introduced in 2001 following a major review of the methods of allocating funding for health care in Scotland. This allocation formula is updated each year to take account of changing circumstances - for example, changes in the distribution of the population between NHS board areas.</p>

  <p>NHSScotland expenditure on mental health has increased significantly over the last five years. The increases have been as follows:</p>

  <p>This is a matter for the Chief Executive of Scottish Water. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Total debt excluding unearned debt (i.e. the debt associated with annual bills being issued in advance of service usage) for water and wastewater services totalled &#163;284 million with &#163;176 million being owed by household customers and &#163;108 million by commercial customers.

  <p>Changes in charity water reliefs fall into this category. These changes were deemed to have a significant impact on the sector and therefore a &#163;1 million hardship fund has been established.</p>

  <p>Every local authority in Scotland has been asked to produce an audit of youth crime; to identify the number of persistent offenders in their area and to have programmes in place to tackle their offending behaviour. Renfrewshire&#8217;s audit demonstrates significant progress in achieving these three requirements. Between 2000 and 2003, it will have received investment of &#163;581,000 from the Executive to support its youth justice work.</p>

  <p>We have only had one request from a member of staff to participate in local political activity. This was from a Grade 6, in 2001 and was turned down. Our conduct rules do not just restrict staff from working for a party or standing as a candidate in a local election. They also preclude staff from speaking in public on matters on local political controversy and this was the basis on which the Personnel Office ruled against agreeing the request.</p>
