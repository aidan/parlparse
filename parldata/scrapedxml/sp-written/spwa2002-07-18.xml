  <p>The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 introduced a new civil order &#150; the Anti-Social Behaviour Orders (ASBO) &#150; to tackle anti-social behaviour. Local authorities, in consultation with the police, can apply to a sheriff for an ASBO to prohibit an individual over 16 from further anti-social behaviour that causes or is likely to cause alarm or distress. ASBOs can be taken out against any resident regardless of whether he or she is a tenant.</p>

  <p>The Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill makes provision for an interim ASBO to take effect pending the outcome of the substantive application for an order. The interim order will provide more immediate protection from anti-social behaviour from tenants and non-tenants alike.</p>

  <p>HM Customs and Excise work with Scottish police forces, the Scottish Drug Enforcement Agency and the National Criminal Intelligence Service to provide a co-ordinated partnership approach to tackling drug trafficking in Scotland.</p>

  <p>HM Customs&#146; presence on Orkney is entirely an operational matter for that organisation. I understand that Northern Constabulary does not consider that HM Customs&#146; arrangements adversely affect its ability to combat actual drug misuse on Orkney itself. It believes it has an excellent working relationship with the organisation.</p>

  <p>Two separate working groups have been set up to look at the implications and implementation of the Working Time Regulations (WTRs) for NHSScotland. Both are making progress.</p>

  <p>The first group is a partnership working group established by the Scottish Partnership Forum. It is preparing joint guidance (including best practice) for NHSScotland to ensure compliance with the WTRs. It is currently gathering intelligence on the human resource implications, to create an action plan, which could serve as a national framework for implementation of the regulations across the Service.</p>

  <p>The Solutions Group &#150; a Trust Chief Executive led group &#150; is taking forward a national co-ordinated approach to the wider service implications of the regulations. It is identifying practical responses to the working time requirements to help implement projects of potential value as soon as possible. It is also promoting the up-take of good practice and raising awareness of the significance and requirements of the WTRs. The group have recently conducted a survey of trusts to obtain information on the impact of the regulations and the results of this are currently being analysed.</p>

  <p>The Scottish School of Primary Care (SSPC) is concerned with developing research that can be used to support patients, clinicians and managers when they make decisions about health and health care. Much of the school&#146;s work in relation to coronary heart disease (CHD) is focused on tackling health inequalities and the effects of deprivation. This supports the Executive&#146;s social justice agenda, and will be reflected in our national strategy for CHD and stroke.</p>

  <p>The school is undertaking the evaluation of the cardiac services Managed Clinical Network (MCNs) in Dumfries and Galloway, and this will help to roll out these local MCNs across Scotland as a whole.</p>

  <p>In response to concerns raised about the operation of certain provisions relating to Sex Offenders, the Parliament has given its approval to the UK Parliament amending the Police Reform Bill to the Sex Offenders Order system, as provided under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. The amendments are intended to introduce greater flexibility in the application procedures and to enable the mutual recognition of Sex Offenders Orders throughout the UK.</p>

  <p>In Scotland there are two higher education institutions providing pre-registration training which leads to professional qualification with the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists and state registration with the Health Professions Council. These are Strathclyde University and Queen Margaret University College in Edinburgh. The courses include an academic component and clinical placements. The clinical placement component is arranged by NHS trusts throughout Scotland.</p>
