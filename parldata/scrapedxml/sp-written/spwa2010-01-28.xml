  <p>There are several Scotland-wide projects to help improve uptake including distribution of leaflets. For example NHS Fife produced a DVD targeted at women with learning difficulties and this has now been shared with all NHS boards. In addition to national activities all NHS boards undertake local awareness raising in the areas where the mobile units are planning to visit. GP practices also actively engage women when their patient list is to be screened.</p>

  <p>NHS Highland has advised that chemotherapy and radiotherapy services were open throughout the entire period at Raigmore Hospital.</p>

  <p>The only exception was the routine planned closure of the Macmillan outpatient chemotherapy unit and radiotherapy department on Christmas Day and New Year&rsquo;s Day. The board has assured us that these closures are planned well in advance. Staff at the unit discuss treatment plans with the patients and can arrange for anyone still requiring chemotherapy on Christmas Day or New Year&rsquo;s Day, to attend the Oncology/Haematology Ward for their treatment, as the ward is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>

  <p>The statistics provided to the BBC by Strathclyde police indicate that:</p>

  <p>There were 5,638 crimes in 2008-09 in which the word &quot;Buckfast&quot; was mentioned, out of a total of 424,589 recorded crimes and offences. This equates to 1.3% of the total.</p>

  <p>The 448 mentions of &quot;Buckfast&quot; in reports of murders, attempted murders, serious assaults and common assaults in 2008-09, out of a total of 7,483 violent offences. That equates to 6% of the total. Of these 114 involved the use of a Buckfast bottle as a weapon. This equates to 1.5% of the total,</p>

  <p>Following the BBC documentary, DCS John Carnochan QPM, Head of Violence Reduction Unit, has commented that &quot;while we focus on a single brand we neglect the real issue, which is that excessive and harmful use of alcohol - whatever the brand - is crippling Scotland via a whole host of social problems, of which violence is just one. I have no doubt that by reducing access to alcohol we will reduce violence, but this means all alcohol, not one single brand.&quot;</p>

  <p>Scottish Government agrees and that is why we have introduced a package of measures to help reduce alcohol consumption in Scotland as a whole. We are also funding research on alcohol and offenders.</p>

  <p>All works in connection with the Beauly to Denny overhead line must be undertaken in accordance with the original application and with the Environmental Statement (including its Addenda). I do not anticipate that, in seeking to construct the new 400kV line, dismantle the existing 132kV line or comply with the various conditions of consent, the developers will require additional planning consents. However, until the developers come forward with detailed plans which are approved by Scottish ministers, it is not possible to state definitively whether any consents will be required, and if so, their nature.</p>

  <p>If other statutory consents are required by legislation then they will have to be obtained by the developers. This is a normal and common occurrence in the planning and energy consenting process.</p>

  <p>The specific information requested is not available centrally.</p>

  <p>Information, although limited, is available on the number of hospital stays where operation or procedure were not carried out following admission to hospital. The number of cancelled operations or procedures by NHSScotland in 2007-08 and 2008-09 and for the period 1 April to 30 September 2009, the latest available data is provided in the following table.</p>

  <p>It is not possible from centrally held data to identify specific reasons for the cancellations. Operations may be cancelled due a number of reasons such as a particularly high level of emergency admissions, staff sickness, patient is unfit for treatment on admission or the patient has failed to follow pre-admission advice such as fasting before admission.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government established the Scottish Private Rented Sector Strategy Group to provide advice on the development of a professional, high quality private rented sector. The first phase of the group&rsquo;s work ended with the publication of its consultation recommendations report. This makes recommendations to ministers on proposals, relating to landlord registration and other issues, which the Group considers should be the subject of public consultation, with a view to their inclusion in primary legislation. We are currently working on a possible consultation. Decisions on legislation would, of course, be dependent on the outcome of a consultation and the availability of a legislative opportunity.</p>

  <p>The recent adverse weather has meant considerable difficulties accessing and working harvesting sites and in getting supplies from the forest to processing and biomass plants across Scotland, including Ayrshire. Forestry Commission Scotland has been working closely with forest industry representatives over recent weeks to maintain the flow of timber from the forest to the mills.</p>

  <p>Forestry Commission Scotland has put in place measures to maximise the volumes of timber delivered, both on the national forest estate and in the private sector by encouraging harvesting on accessible sites close to public roads to maintain supplies. Forestry Commission Scotland will continue to work with the forest industries to minimise the disruption caused to harvesting and haulage operations and this year&rsquo;s planting programmes.</p>
