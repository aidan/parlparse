  <p>My officials have already made contact with the new child poverty unit and will continue to work closely with them to ensure that the analysis, measures and proposals they put forward properly reflect the needs and circumstances of Scottish children, and the policies and priorities of the Scottish Government.

  <p>It is for local authorities to decide on the level of resources to allocate to meet particular local priorities and needs. By the end of the current Spending Review, core funding to local government will have increased by over &pound;3 billion from 1999-2000. Overall Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE) provision for social work will have increased by almost &pound;984 million over the same period.</p>

  <p>Councils already have considerable flexibility to allocate resources from their aggregate budgets to meet local priorities, including child protection. Future funding for local government is being considered as part of the Spending Review.</p>

  <p>Schools operating at high occupancy levels are most likely to be affected. As with any issue affecting the provision of school places it is for the local authorities to consider the position at individual schools in the light of local circumstances. We have already allocated an additional &pound;40 million of Schools Fund grant linked specifically to the capital implications of reducing class sizes in primary 1 to primary 3. This has been distributed to authorities largely on the basis of the number of schools with high occupancy levels. Future funding is under discussion with local authorities.</p>

  <p>Just as individual projects have been varied in their methodology and have different ultimate objectives, so the lessons which are beginning to emerge have demonstrated elements unique to individual project target groups. Most of these lessons are positive. The evidence demonstrates that the new models being used by Pathfinder hosts to inform future cultural policy development and delivery are clearly having the desired effect of engaging local communities, particularly marginalised groups, and engaging Community Planning Partnerships.</p>

  <p>Our 13 pilot projects which are championing new models to inform future cultural policy development and delivery are also exploring the vital links between cultural delivery and community planning. Evidence from these is starting to emerge. For example, in the case of Fife, work on their project has progressed to the extent that Fife has now created a skilled &quot;Cultural Partnerships&quot; team to take this forward. It is anticipated that this will help to ensure creative approaches to the application of local democratic decision-making and community planning to the effective delivery of cultural provision.</p>

Furthermore, as indicated in the reply to the answer to question S3W-5752, on 6 November 2007 <strong>, </strong> we are starting to see evidence that the new models being used by our 13 pilot projects to inform future cultural policy development and delivery are clearly having the required effect of engaging local communities including hard to reach client groups.

  <p>The Scottish Government is confident that frameworks, including inspection regimes, are in place to help ensure that the welfare of children with drug abusing parents is protected. Where relevant, inspection regimes consider the role of assessing parental capacity and where weaknesses are found, appropriate recommendations to agencies are made.</p>

  <p>Examining the quality of local authority assessment and case management processes is an integral part of the Social Work Inspection Agency&rsquo;s (SWIA) performance inspections. In 2007, the SWIA also conducted the first multi-agency inspection of substance misuse services, alongside NHS Quality Improvement Scotland and the Care Commission. This covered the level of assessment of parental capacity carried out by the relevant agencies. Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education&rsquo;s inspections of child protection services also consider whether children with drug abusing parents are protected and that the relevant agencies communicate effectively with each other.The <em>Getting Our Priorities Right</em> guidance for working with children and families with substance misuse states that parents with problem substance use should be assessed where their personal difficulties affect their parenting and care of children. The guidance notes that such assessments will vary in complexity, relative to the actual or potential impact on the child.</p>

  <p>Source (1973, 1979): Input-Output Tables for Scotland.Source (1990, 2000): Regional Accounts.Notes:1. The valuation of GDP prior to 1990 shows GDP at factor cost; in accordance with the European System of National Accounts, GDP at basic prices (also referred to as gross value added) is now used. The principal difference between the two valuations is that GDP at factor cost does not include net taxes (less subsidies) on production.2. Input-output tables are annual snap shot estimates whose data sources and methodologies change each year. As a result, they are not designed to be compared across years.3. Prior to 2001, input-output tables were not constrained to regional accounts estimates.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is alert to the possibility that the cap on tuition fees for English universities may be removed. It has assessed a range of information, including an internal report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies commissioned during the previous administration. This report examines the competitiveness of Scottish universities and was delivered during the current administration.</p>

  <p>Any review of the cap in England will of course be important to Scottish higher education institutions and the Scottish Government. It is not a foregone conclusion that the cap will be removed or fees increased.

  <p>The Sewel Convention provides that the United Kingdom Government will not normally legislate with regard to devolved matters in Scotland without the consent of the Scottish Parliament. This is an important part of the devolution settlement, signifying respect for the role of the Scottish Parliament.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to considering proposals for Legislative Consent Motions on a case-by-case basis, and believes that the Sewel Convention will remain a key part of the current constitutional arrangements as long as the United Kingdom Parliament retains its current powers.Within the United Kingdom Government&rsquo;s new legislative programme announced today, the government has identified and agreed a number of specific opportunities to legislate for the benefit of Scotland on matters that are within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament and on matters which relate to the executive competence of Scottish ministers.The bills are:Health and Social Care: to include Scotland in improvements and changes to the UK regulatory regime for the health care professions.Climate Change: to provide a statutory UK framework for actions to mitigate climate change by reducing emissions, including setting a statutory target for the reduction of carbon emissions.Dormant Bank and Building Societies Accounts: To allow access to funds in dormant accounts to invest back into society in Scotland, and confer additional functions on Scottish ministers to make orders directing the distribution of these funds.The Scottish Government will be bringing forward memorandums and Legislative Consent Motions for these Bills in line with the requirements of Standing Orders over the next few weeks. It will be for the Scottish Parliament then to determine whether to give or withhold consent.Further proposals to legislate for Scotland via a Legislative Consent Motion may well develop in relation to other Bills announced today by the United Kingdom Government, as their content is finalised. We will continue to work with the United Kingdom Government and will bring to the attention of the Parliament any such proposals as soon as they are identified.</p>

  <p>In a July 2003 response to a letter from Dumfries and Galloway Council the former Scottish Executive set out, in general terms, the operation of the legislation on school closures and the circumstances in which the consent of ministers is required. The response made clear that the Executive could not comment on the specific situation of the two Roman Catholic schools in Dumfries which had prompted the council&rsquo;s enquiry.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-4248 by Fiona Hyslop on 25 September 2007, whether any of these reports referred to the existence of a &quot;so-called hit list&quot; of school closures approved by the City of Edinburgh Council Executive prior to May 2007 and, if so, which reports these were and when they were published.</p>

  <p>Press reports, although not using the precise term &quot;so-called hit list&quot;, suggested that the possibility of school closures was under consideration by the then City of Edinburgh Council administration and mentioned certain specific schools.</p>

  <p>The Chartered Teacher project is open to all teachers at the top of the main grade salary scale who have maintained a CPD Portfolio. There are two routes available to teachers: the programme route (a twelve module masters degree), and the accreditation route (involving the submission of a portfolio-based claim against the Standard for Chartered Teacher). Candidates are expected to meet the costs of which ever route they undertake. Six salary increments are available, one on completion of every two modules or all six on completion of the accreditation route.</p>
