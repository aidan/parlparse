  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how it plans to statistically evaluate the effectiveness of (a) its antisocial behaviour strategy and (b) the Antisocial Behaviour (Scotland) Act 2004 if it does not collect data centrally on the number of times the measures in the act have been used.</p>

  <p>Local partners have in place their own robust performance management systems to assess the impact of their efforts to reduce antisocial behaviour (ASB). In addition, there are national partner-led approaches such as the Scottish Policing Performance Framework, which collates information on ASB from all police forces.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government focuses its attention on achieving national outcomes rather than monitoring the use of measures within the Act. The effort to achieve these outcomes is captured in the Single Outcome Agreements (SOAs) prepared by the 32 Community Planning Partnerships (CPPs) in Scotland. Action to reduce ASB is well represented in SOAs.</p>

  <p>In publishing <em>Promoting Positive Outcomes</em>, the new antisocial behaviour framework, the Scottish Government committed to provide an annual report to parliament on progress towards implementation. We are collaborating with partners to develop a new voluntary performance framework, aimed at supporting the work of CPPs to achieve national outcomes. Progress on this will be included in the first annual report which is due in the autumn.</p>

  <p>The position of the Scottish Government on new thermal power stations was stated in the previous answer to question S3W-28764 on 9 November 2009.</p>

  <p>Any new thermal power station application will be subject to statutory consultation under section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989, when specialist advice from the Planning Authorities, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, the Health and Safety Executive, Scottish Natural Heritage and other interested parties will be considered as part of the overall decision making process.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers will then consider all material issues before determining each application in accordance with the relevant environmental and planning obligations.</p>

  <p>In respect of existing coal fuelled power stations, a rolling review of the technical and economic viability of carbon capture and storage (CCS) will be undertaken with the aim of taking a final view on retro-fitting by 2018.</p>

  <p>Officials are also working closely with regulators and DECC officials to assess the effectiveness of existing legislative regimes for the efficient processing of thermal applications and to ensure the careful and thorough consideration of the capture, transport and storage elements of the application.</p>

  <p>As stated in the answer to question S3W-28764 on 9 November 2009, any new coal-fired station in Scotland would need to demonstrate carbon capture and storage on at least 300 megawatts of its net capacity from day one of operation and to retro-fit for those stations by no later than 2025. As the technology develops, we expect new coal stations built by 2020, to be 100% fitted with carbon capture and storage.</p>

  <p>Work towards finalising the priorities and objectives for a revised Fire and Rescue Framework are closely related to ongoing discussions between national and local government on the implications of forthcoming funding adjustments in the public sector. Given the statutory role of the framework, it is important that any new burdens are balanced and achievable and it would be inappropriate to place additional burdens on the Fire and Rescue Services without knowing the future allocation of funding they will receive. Delivery of a revised framework will therefore follow the Spending Review process later this year.</p>

The total support for capital for Angus Council over the period 2008-11 is &pound;46.680 million, which includes &pound;21.576 million of General Capital Grant and &pound;22.428 million of supported borrowing. It is the responsibility of Angus Council to allocate the total financial resources available to it on the basis of local needs and priorities having first fulfilled its statutory obligations and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities including the Scottish Government&rsquo;s key strategic objectives.</p>

  <p>The Cabinet Secretary is being kept fully informed by the NHS board about developments in relation to the CHCPs in Glasgow City. It is ultimately a matter for the NHS board and Council to agree on the arrangements for delivering health and social care services across the City. The implications from the decision to move to a NHS CHP have been set out in papers to the NHS board and further detailed proposals for the practical application of the changes have still be developed and discussed by the NHS board at its next meeting in June 2010.</p>

Detailed financial management of NHS budgets (including under and over spends within CHCPs) is a matter for NHS boards.

  <p>CHCPs, together with the NHS board, are delivering evidence-based interventions likely to improve people&rsquo;s health in disadvantaged communities. These include a range of prevention and early intervention activities, such as the Keep Well programme of anticipatory health checks. Keep Well in Greater Glasgow and Clyde now extends across five CHCPs, and has provided nearly 20,000 health checks to those aged 45 to 64 living in the 15% most deprived areas according to the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation.</p>

  <p>We are keen to support the development of relationships at a local level between the third sector, local authorities, community planning partnerships (of which NHS boards are a statutory member) and other local partnerships so that the sector may play a significant role in the delivery of local services and the single outcome agreements.</p>

  <p>To this end we are supporting the development of third sector interfaces for each local authority area, such as Voluntary Action North Lanarkshire (VANL). The Chair of VANL sits on the North Lanarkshire Community Health Partnership and VANL is represented on the NHS Lanarkshire Public Partnership Forum. The interface is also currently participating in discussions with NHS Lanarkshire and North Lanarkshire Council regarding efficiencies and potential cost savings so as to minimise any potential impact within the voluntary and community sector.</p>

  <p>In addition, NHS Lanarkshire and North Lanarkshire Council work closely with the third sector on a number of other issues, including:</p>

  <p>Joint funding for the delivery of frontline services and services that underpin national and local priorities;</p>

  <p>Joint Partnership Agreements, and</p>

  <p>Promotion of the local voluntary sector.</p>

We are aware of the work being undertaken by the Highlands and Islands Council to explore a range of delivery models including the single public authority model.

  <p>All local authorities are expected to be good corporate parents to the young people in their care and when leaving care. As part of the leaving care process, all young people must be provided with a Pathway Plan which identifies their housing and other needs and the actions required to meet these. It is a matter for local authorities as corporate parents to make decisions in the best interests of their looked after young people and care leavers and they must do so in consultation with them, considering the full range of housing options available.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Government has established the Cross Sector Supported Accommodation Working Group which will provide recommendations to Government on the provision of supported accommodation for those at risk of homelessness including care leavers across Scotland by February 2011.</p>

  <p>I have asked Willie Pretswell, Interim Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service, to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>At present the Scottish Prison Service has no plans to increase the number of health care staff across the prison estate. Individual Prison Governors can amend their complement of health care staff to address changes in local service need and the Nurse Training and Learning Strategy provides an annual review of clinical staff training requirements. Nationally, health care staffing resources may change should service re-design occur post NHS integration in the autumn of 2011.</p>

  <p>SPS is fortunate to employ and contract health care staff and services that are committed and professional. Staffing and vacancy levels are currently both very satisfactory.</p>

  <p>It is the responsibility of all contractors to ensure that they comply with all relevant legislation when bidding for public contracts.
