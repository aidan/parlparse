  <p>CNORIS was introduced through Regulations in April 2000 and was set up to help its members with the rising cost of meeting rising clinical negligence claims.

  <p>The inconsistency of ministerial powers of direction over non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs) with charitable status was highlighted by the 2001 McFadden Report.</p>

  <p>Consequently, Scottish ministers agreed that the position of charitable NDPBs would be subject to scrutiny as part of their quinquennial reviews which would allow a decision to be taken as to their continuation as a charity.</p>

  <p>The factors that account for differences in forecasts each year include actual income from non-domestic rates in the past proving to be higher than forecast, mainly due to higher than forecast buoyancy and lower than projected losses on appeals.</p>

  <p>Buoyancy is the increase in rateable value due to new properties and improvements to existing properties (less any reduction due to, for example, properties being demolished).</p>

  <p>Over the three years to 2005-06 the Executive is investing &pound;24 million in active schools across Scotland. This investment is designed to increase the number and range of opportunities for children and young people to become more active in and around the school day. The programme aims to establish links between schools and local sports clubs, which will offer children and young people clear pathways should they wish to continue sport beyond the school day. Over &pound;5.5 million will be invested in active schools by the Executive and local authorities within the west of Scotland parliamentary area.</p>

  <p>Other opportunities are being made available through the New Opportunities for PE and Sport (NOPES) programme. &pound;36.3 million is committed across Scotland to activities programmes. Each of Scotland&rsquo;s 32 local authority areas received an allocation of funding available for the programme and the local authorities were expected to co-ordinate plans for their area with local key partners across the voluntary and private sector. The seven local authority areas covered by the west of Scotland parliamentary area have between them almost &pound;5.5 million of NOPES funding to complement other planned activity.</p>
