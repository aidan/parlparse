  <p>As required by the Scotland Act, the Executive will observe its EU obligations and intends to introduce shortly legislation that will ban the use of fishmeal in ruminant feeds as of 1 August this year. However, the Executive will continue to press for the return of fishmeal in ruminant rations as soon as the potential for cross-contamination to occur can be discounted by a suitable testing protocol, which the EU is committed to pursuing.</p>

  <p>The seminar was organised by the Scottish Fuel Cell Consortium, although the Executive assisted the organisers by offering its conference facilities for the event, and by the Scottish Energy Efficiency Office posting details of the seminar on its website (www.energy-efficiency.org). Unfortunately the seminar was cancelled, but details of the rescheduled event are on the website and Hydro-Gen are welcome to attend.</p>

  <p>The Leadership Advisory Panel has been a very successful exercise for modest outlay. The costs of publication of the LAP report can be broken down as follows:</p>

  <p>The report was simply published rather than launched so no other significant costs were incurred at the time of publication. Copies were sent to all councillors in Scotland to help encourage debate and discussion about the different models adopted given the evolutionary nature of the process. In addition, its availability on the web avoids the need for subsequent print runs.</p>

  <p>The cost of establishing and maintaining LAP from August 1999 until April 2001 can be broken down as follows.</p>

  <p>Secretariat support was provided by the Scottish Executive. The staff involved in supporting the panel did so as part of a wider range of duties so it is not possible to calculate their costs concerned with LAP business alone.</p>

  <p>All businesses occupying properties with a rateable value of &#163;10,000 or less benefit from a 2p reduction in the poundage this year. In addition, the rural rate relief scheme provides 50% mandatory relief for any sole general store (selling food and household goods) and/or post office in settlements of under 3,000 population in a designated rural area and with a rateable value of less than &#163;6,000. Local authorities have discretionary powers to top this up to 100%. Local authorities also have discretion to grant up to 100% rate relief for any other business in such settlements that they consider important to the community. This discretionary element is for subjects with a maximum rateable value of &#163;12,000.</p>

  <p>For businesses suffering financial hardship, local authorities can grant up to 100% relief from rates. For the period 1 April to 31 December 2001, for businesses affected by the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak, 95% of the cost of this relief is funded by the Scottish Executive for properties with a rateable value of &#163;12,000 or less in rural areas (&#163;50,000 in Dumfries and Galloway and Scottish Borders). For other businesses, the Scottish Executive pays 75% of the cost.</p>

  <p>Design changes were made to the MSP block windows as a consequence of the Value Engineering exercise carried out in late 1999. The Convener of the Holyrood Progress Group has confirmed that there were no consequential time delays and the changes have resulted in cost savings of around &#163;100,000.</p>
