  <p>No. Barnett consequentials only arise as a result of increases in provision for comparable spending areas in Whitehall Departments. HM Treasury maintains that these circumstances do not apply in this case, although discussions are continuing.</p>

  <p>International comparable data on higher education expenditure on research and development (HERD) are only available for the 30 OECD countries. The latest available figures relate to 2005.</p>

  <p>Scottish HERD in 2005 was &pound;688,000, which was 0.7% of GDP and second only to Sweden in terms of percentage of GDP. With only 30 countries having comparable data, very small changes in expenditure could lead to major annual shifts between deciles. However, this places Scotland&rsquo;s HERD as a percentage of GDP in the top decile of OECD countries.</p>

  <p>The interim report of the Joint Futures Thinking Taskforce on Universities recognises there are a number of factors which contribute to keeping universities nationally and internationally competitive. While public resource is one, this includes not just funding from the Scottish Government but also, for example, grants from Research Councils. In addition, many of our institutions attract funding from private sources. This dual support model was highlighted as a strength in the interim report. In the future, the proposed Tripartite Advisory Group will play a key role in advising the Scottish Government on public resources.</p>

  <p>As stated in the International Development Policy launched on 7 May and defined more clearly in section 1.2 of the guidance to our new policy, launched on 26 June, we will not predefine sectors or specific policy areas to address in delivering the Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) Development Programme which comprises the four countries of Zambia, Tanzania, Rwanda and the Darfur region of Sudan. The Sub-Saharan Africa Development Programme will operate through a block grant system.</p>

  <p>The use of block grants will devolve greater responsibility to the organisation/consortium in Scotland for the identification and delivery of a programme that reflects the priorities of relevant in-country development policies. We will therefore be looking to established organisations in Scotland to deliver strategic programmes in those countries through the block grant system and after appropriate in-country discussions.</p>

  <p>The police recorded crime statistics collected centrally are based on an aggregate return at local authority level, and do not distinguish the circumstances of the crime, such as the occupation of the victim.</p>

  <p>Following the introduction of the Emergency Workers (Scotland) Act 2005, a new crime code (Minor Assault of an Emergency Worker) was created. However, the figures cannot be broken down by category of worker.</p>

  <p>Police recorded crime statistics for the period 1 April 2007 to 31 March 2008 are due to be published in September 2008.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has no plans to carry out a survey of arrangements for providing school meals. We are providing local authorities with record levels of funding and allowing them to retain any efficiency savings. It is the responsibility of local authorities to ensure that appropriate arrangements are in place to deliver a school lunch service that meets local needs.</p>

  <p>With regard to the nutritional content of school meals, under the Schools (Health Promotion and Nutrition) (Scotland) Act 2007 (the Act)<em>,</em> local authorities must ensure that the food and drink provided in schools complies with <em>The Nutritional Requirements for Food and Drink in Schools (Scotland) Regulations 2008. </em>These regulations were approved by Parliament on the 25 June 2008 and came into force on 4 August 2008.</p>

  <p>HM Inspectorate of Education will be involved in monitoring the implementation of the Act through their programme of inspections. Inspections will build on the activities that inspection teams undertook to evaluate aspects of health promotion and the implementation of <em>Hungry for Success</em>. They will focus particularly on the impact of actions taken by schools and local authorities to improve food provision in schools and the uptake of food provided. Self-evaluation by schools and local authorities will continue to be important in measuring impact, identifying effective practice and securing continuous improvement.</p>

Income thresholds for academic year 2009-10 are yet to be determined.</p>

  <p>Source: Student Awards Agency for Scotland (2006-07 data), Scottish Government analysis (2007-08, 2008-09 data).</p>

  <p>Note: Student numbers have been rounded to the nearest five.</p>

  <p>Some students on relatively high incomes i.e. above the standard thresholds remain in the table because they are receiving the non-means tested Disabled Student&rsquo;s Allowance or due to some special circumstances (e.g. study abroad) which means that they receive support where in most cases a student would not.</p>

  <p>Income thresholds for means tested loans depend on many individual circumstances including location of study, duration of course, whether a student is in their final year and when they entered higher education. The above calculations take account of the income thresholds that apply to the majority of students, i.e. Scottish students living at home or elsewhere who are on standard degree courses (30 weeks) and are not in their final year. Constant student numbers are assumed i.e. the same students applied in 2007-08 and only their incomes and the thresholds for means tested loans changed.</p>

  <p>The latest year for which data are available for students receiving some form of support is for 2006-07. Similarly, 2006-07 is the latest year for which data are available for average earnings.</p>

  <p>Students on the Nursing and Midwifery Bursary Scheme are not included in the table.</p>
