  <p>The report of the Expert Group on Acute Maternity Services, published in 2002, recognised that risk assessment is an essential part of maternity care. Women, and their babies, who, due to their lifestyle or other factors, including alcohol use, are assessed as having a higher risk of developing complications during pregnancy and post-natally should be referred for the appropriate level of care.</p>

  <p>No guidelines have been issued to deal specifically with the implementation of measures to combat foetal alcohol syndrome.</p>

  <p><em>A Framework for Maternity Services in Scotland,</em> published February 2001, recognised that all women of reproductive age should be empowered and encouraged to be as healthy as possible. NHS boards were given clear action points and recommendations to address the health promotion needs of women of reproductive age.</p>

  <p>NHS board strategies have been audited against the principles laid out in <em>A Framework for Maternity Services in Scotland.</em> As part of this audit, <em></em>NHS boards were asked to provide information about how health promotion and education are being taken forward locally with particular reference to alcohol and pregnancy. The results show that all NHS boards are taking measures to raise awareness of the dangers of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. These measures include issuing to all new mothers the NHS Health Scotland publication <em>Ready Steady Baby</em>, which contains a section on alcohol.</p>

  <p>MEL(1999)67 was issued to the NHS in September 1999 and enclosed a Good Practice Guide on Access to Services <em>Equality for disabled people in the NHS in Scotland</em> as well as a training video produced by the Department of Health in England about the needs of deaf and hard-of-hearing people using NHS services. The good practice guide detailed the various needs of deaf and hard-of-hearing people and stressed the importance of responding appropriately and sensitively to their requirements.</p>

  <p>The Health Department is currently developing an Equality and Diversity Strategy for the NHS and deaf awareness will be central to this. The voluntary sector will be key stakeholders in the development and implementation of this process and I will ensure that the Royal National Institute for the Deaf and the Scottish Council on Deafness are involved.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Department has entered into a partnership with the Disability Rights Commission Scotland to look at the requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act on the NHS. This partnership will support and advise NHS boards in developing a disability strategy which will highlight accessibility issues as part of the approach to delivering patient-centred and responsive services.</p>

  <p>Through the development of an integrated equality and diversity strategy as part of their wider patient focus and public involvement work, the Scottish Executive Health Department will ensure that the views and needs of deaf and hard-of-hearing people are addressed in an effective way to involve them in decisions about their own care and the design, development and review of the services they use. The strategy is being developed in partnership with individuals from all excluded groups, including deaf people, and will be used to remind and encourage NHS boards of their responsibilities to meet the needs of disabled people, including statutory responsibilities.</p>

  <p>The Health Department maintains an ongoing dialogue with the organisations which represent the views of deaf and deafblind people and there have already been a number of awareness-raising events to highlight some of the issues faced by people who are disabled.</p>

  <p>The Health Department are also developing a strategic partnership with the Disability Rights Commission to ensure that they are able to advise NHS boards on the changes that will need to take place to fully address the needs of disabled people, both in terms of compliance with the requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and other steps that can be taken to respond to individual needs.</p>

  <p>At the last meeting of the Audiology Advisory group in January, there was an agreement to establish a patient issues sub-group. The sub-group includes representation from the National Deaf Children&#8217;s Society, the Royal National Institute for the Deaf and the Scottish Council on Deafness, as well as health service staff and planners, and local authority social work departments.</p>

  <p>The group will provide the Audiology Advisory group with proposals for the development of patient and public-focussed activities based on the priorities identified within the Public Health Institute Scotland <em>Needs Assessment Report on NHS Audiology Services in Scotland</em>.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-1504 by Malcolm Chisholm on 12 August 2003, what guidance is given to NHS boards regarding charging for car parking at hospitals.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2004-04-28.23.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80018" speakername="Malcolm Chisholm" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-04/wa0428.htm#10">

  <p>Following the review of car parking arrangements across NHS sites in Scotland and certain lessons learned recently in the introduction of car park charging at hospital sites, the guidance issued in 2000 has been updated.</p>

  <p>The revised guidance which will apply to all future car parking schemes has been issued to NHSScotland by way of a Health Department Letter today. This guidance applies both where car parking facilities are being provided and/or managed by NHS boards and by private sector providers.</p>

  <p>Car park charging should not be introduced as a means of generating income but charging may be justified if it is to:</p>

  <p>cover any significant costs in providing parking facilities (e.g. capital charges, maintenance costs, administration costs, security costs, security lighting, CCTV);</p>

  <p>cover the cost of providing new or improved parking facilities or making existing facilities more secure, and</p>

  <p>better manage car parking facilities by discouraging unauthorised users (e.g. fly-parkers) but in so doing, measures taken to discourage unauthorised users must not be detrimental to the car parking arrangements for staff, patients and visitors.</p>

  <p>Where charges are made, NHS boards should adhere to the following principles:</p>

  <p>NHS boards must be able to demonstrate the level of income generated from car parking and how it has been utilised;</p>

  <p>before introducing or substantially revising car park charges, NHS boards must consult with staff, the public and any relevant bodies or organisations;</p>

  <p>sufficient car parking space and concessionary car parking rates should be available to staff and consideration should be given to providing concessions to certain categories of patient (e.g. patients attending regularly for dialysis or radiotherapy), and</p>

  <p>a reasonable proportion of parking spaces should be set aside for disabled parking. In determining disabled parking spaces, the needs of disabled persons should be fully considered (e.g. wide spaces, no kerbs or steps, preferably under cover, and located at different entrances to the NHS facility).</p>

  <p>Where fly parking is a particular problem, in discouraging unauthorised users, NHS boards should investigate ways to control such parking, other than introducing excessive daily charges for all car-park users. Such options may be:</p>

  <p>to check at manual barriers the validity of parkers between, say 7 am and 10 am (e.g. staff id, appointment card, details of the patient they are visiting); or</p>

  <p>to limit the availability of car parking space by keeping certain car parks closed until 10 am and, say, designating car parks &quot;staff only&quot; and &quot;out-patients/day-patients only&quot;, and</p>

  <p>where there is no option but to discourage or control the level of unauthorised parking by charging excessive daily rates, arrangements must be put in place to ensure that patients and visitors who are legitimately parked in the car park all day are given a concessionary rate.</p>

  <p>In all cases charges should reflect a reasonable balance between the perceived needs of staff, patients and visitors, the cost of car parking generally in the area, and the costs of maintaining car parking facilities. Widespread charging of excessive rates to staff, patients or visitors cannot be justified.</p>
