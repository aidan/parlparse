  <p>The BSE Inquiry Report has been published today at Westminster. The remit of the Inquiry was to establish and review the history of the emergence and identification of BSE and New Variant CJD and to reach conclusions on the adequacy of the response, taking into account the state of knowledge at the time. The report is concerned primarily with actions and events in Whitehall departments, and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has today made an oral statement to the House of Commons.</p>

  <p>On behalf of the Scottish Executive, I welcome the Inquiry&#8217;s measured examination of the events between 1986-96 which led to this crisis. These events were of the utmost seriousness, not least to those individuals and families who have suffered. The adverse effects on the Scottish beef industry, and on the livelihoods of those who depend upon it, are also obvious.</p>

  <p>I would like to express thanks to Lord Phillips and all those who devoted so much of their time to the complicated and highly demanding task of completing the report.</p>

  <p>Some of the key general conclusions of the Inquiry are set out in the following quotations from the executive summary:</p>

  <p>&quot;At the heart of the BSE story lie questions of how to handle hazard &#8211; a known hazard to cattle and an unknown hazard to humans. The Government took measures to address both hazards. They were sensible measures, but they were not always timely nor adequately implemented and enforced.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;The rigour with which policy measures were implemented for the protection of human health was affected by the belief of many prior to early 1996 that BSE was not a potential threat to human life.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;The Government was anxious to act in the best interests of human and animal health. To this end they sought and followed the advice of independent scientific experts &#8211; sometimes when decisions could have been reached more swiftly and satisfactorily within Government.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;The Government did not lie to the public about BSE. It believed that the risks posed by BSE to humans were remote. The Government was preoccupied with preventing an alarmist over-reaction to BSE because it believed that the risk was remote. It is now clear that this campaign of reassurance was a mistake.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Cases of a new variant of CJD were identified by the CJD Surveillance Unit and the conclusion that they were probably linked to BSE was reached as early as was reasonably possible. The link between BSE and Variant CJD is now clearly established, though the manner of infection is not clear.&quot;</p>

  <p>With reference to events and actions in Scotland, the Inquiry finds that the then Scottish Office could have been more proactive in dealing with the challenge of BSE. Communication links between the Health and Agriculture Departments and Whitehall could have been more effective. It is important however to note that, in the Inquiry&#8217;s words:</p>

  <p>&quot;There were no special features of the disease that would have justified a separate set of policies here&hellip;&quot;</p>

  <p>and:</p>

  <p>&quot;The people of Scotland were not served any less well than the rest of the UK.&quot;</p>

  <p>Since 1996 significant changes have occurred. Constitutional change and the devolution of animal health, human health and food safety have established crucial mechanisms within Scotland for scrutinising the actions of the Executive and holding it to account for policy development in the relevant areas. All UK authorities recognise that disease, animal or human, does not respect geographical boundaries and that there are significant benefits from working in a cohesive way within a common EU framework.</p>

  <p>The newly established Food Standards Agency is, for example, set up on an UK-wide basis yet has a distinctive Scottish presence, and is paid for and accountable to the Scottish Parliament for its actions in Scotland. It is also equipped to approach food safety matters in a multi-disciplinary way and has direct oversight of the Meat Hygiene Service in Scotland.</p>

  <p>New linkages have been established between Health and Rural Affairs Departments in the Scottish Executive to ensure that the Executive&#8217;s commitment to joined up government is met. There is also a firm commitment to good communication and a shared understanding of policy direction between the Executive and Whitehall, leaving room to develop distinctive Scottish solutions where these are necessary and are compatible with EU requirements.</p>

  <p>Given the complexity and length of the report it would be premature at this stage to comment in detail on the Inquiry&#8217;s findings. The report will need careful study and time will be required to digest it fully. It has today been laid in the Scottish Parliament and copies of the key findings and a summary volume have been made available to SPICe and to all members of the Health and Rural Affairs Committees.</p>

  <p>To date 85 definite or probable cases of variant CJD have been reported in the UK. 80 people have died, including 13 in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The care of patients suffering from vCJD and support for their families must therefore be our first concern. The Inquiry said that the victims of vCJD and their families have special needs, which require to be addressed. We are taking steps to do so. A new national fund will be set up, to help ensure all patients receive consistent high quality care. The fund will be held by the national co-ordinator at the CJD Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh, who will be assisted by a new support team and a national network of experts available to support local services. There will also be strengthened guidance for local health and social care professionals.</p>

  <p>Variant CJD is a fatal illness with devastating effects on patients and families. Thus, in addition to the enhanced care package, appropriate support will also be provided for those who are suffering from vCJD, for those who care for them, and for the families of those who have already died. Financial arrangements to benefit sufferers from vCJD and their families across the UK will therefore be put in place, taking account of particular needs in individual cases.</p>

  <p>The preferred option is to establish a compensation scheme resulting in a special Trust Fund. There are a number of other possible options, and there will be consultations with the families affected to identify the best way forward.</p>

  <p>It will be important to learn lessons from the report. The Executive will take all necessary action to ensure that this is done and will keep Parliament fully informed.</p>

  <p>Local authorities will be expected to make their own assessment of the impact of the climate change levy on their costs and to take whatever mitigation measures they consider appropriate. The levy is intended to encourage organisations in both the public and private sector to become more energy efficient. It would be counter-productive therefore to meet local authority costs through the local government finance settlement. However, there will be an opportunity for CoSLA to discuss this as part of the local government finance settlement consultations if they wish.</p>

  <p>The Chancellor announced in July 1998 that, other than in exceptional circumstances, in future all underspends on Departmental Expenditure Limits (DEL) would be reclaimable under End Year Flexibility. I attach two tables setting out total unspent balances, retained balances and net underspend prior to the change in July 1998; and a further table setting out the same information after the change. Since the Chancellor&#8217;s change, the net underspend in the main comprises Annually Managed Expenditure (AME). That is expenditure which is managed annually because it cannot reasonably be subject to firm multi-year limits. Expenditure in AME is generally less predictable and controllable than expenditure in DEL.</p>

  <p>NHS Trusts which overspent in 1999-2000 have been asked to produce financial plans, which demonstrate how recurring financial balance will be achieved and which will also recover cumulative overspends. Maintaining sound finances is a prerequisite of delivering effective health care which the substantial additional resources for the NHS in Scotland, this year and in the next three years, are designed to facilitate.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive Health Department has not commissioned any studies into the use of private finance in the NHSiS since June 1999. However, Public/Private Partnerships within the NHS in Scotland are subject to robust guidance and rules which have been developed in the light of experience in Scotland and the rest of the UK.</p>

  <p>There have been no discussions between the Executive and Forces about this matter.

  <p>The available information is given in the table below.</p>

  <p>The size of the prison population is the product of a number of factors including the level of crime, levels of reporting and detection, and decisions on prosecution and sentencing. As far as sentencing is concerned, we are committed to ensuring that the courts have a wide range of sentencing options available so that sentencers can make a non-custodial decision where they consider it is appropriate to do so in the circumstances of the particular case.</p>

  <p>We are working with local authorities to improve the quality and effectiveness of community disposals with the aim of increasing the confidence of sentencers and the public in such disposals. (The use of probation and community service orders has almost doubled over the past 10 years).</p>

  <p>We have funded the national roll-out of Supervised Attendance Orders for fine defaulters and are considering extension of the current pilot diversion from prosecution schemes.</p>

  <p>New community disposals being piloted include Drug Treatment and Testing Orders for drug misusers who commit crime on a frequent basis to fund their drug addiction.</p>

  <p>We are also piloting Restriction of Liberty Orders (electronic tagging) and are reviewing options for wider use of electronic monitoring.</p>

  <p>Since 1991-92, when the arrangements for 100% funding of criminal justice social work services were fully introduced, the funding for community disposals has risen from &pound;16.5 million to &pound;42.8 million, an increase of 159%.</p>

  <p>In 1998-99 the Scottish Arts Council (SAC) allocated &pound;111,077 (equivalent to &pound;0.43 per head of adult population) of Voted Funds to organisations based in North Lanarkshire out of its total grant from the Scottish Office of &pound;27,184,000 (equivalent to &pound;6.62 per head of adult population in Scotland)). In addition organisations based in North Lanarkshire received &pound;148,646 (equivalent to &pound;0.57 per head of adult population) of total Scottish Arts Council Lottery funding in Scotland in 1998-99 of &pound;22,844,985 (equivalent to &pound;5.56 per head of adult population in Scotland).</p>

  <p>In both cases a number of other organisations supported by SAC will have been active in North Lanarkshire in that period, although not based there. Fuller details of SAC funding of the different art forms are to be found in the SAC Annual Report and Accounts for 1998-99, which have been laid before Parliament.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive aims to pay all valid invoices within 30 days of receipt, or within other agreed contractual terms. At the end of the 1999-2000 financial year the Executive, including its executive agencies and associated departments, held unpaid invoices totalling &pound;21.6 million. Of these, it is estimated that invoices which were overdue amounted to less than &pound;10,000 of the overall total.</p>

  <p>In its annual guidance letter to the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council, in February this year, we encouraged the promotion of better commercialisation and the continuation of funding streams to support this. We are precluded by legislation from directing funding to specific institutions or subject areas.</p>

  <p>The architects advised Project Management in August 1999 that the gross area of the building was 4,000m <sup>2</sup> greater than had been advised previously. An explanation was requested for this, and initial indicators were that the area was largely in plant, circulation, toilets and other ancillary areas. Before a full investigation was completed, however, the SPCB asked the architects to undertake a feasibility study to provide accommodation for additional staff required to cope with expanding workloads across the Parliament. As a result the design was fundamentally revised. The final Stage D design, which incorporates the results of the feasibility study, was endorsed by the SPCB and HPG in June.</p>
