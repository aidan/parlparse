  <p>This report was produced by the Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care (the Care Commission) which became the independent regulator of care homes, including those for children, from 1 April 2002. The Care Commission regulates services by inspecting them against associated legislation and the relevant national care standards.

  <p>(a) The concept of free personal and nursing care only applies to those who would normally pay for, or towards, such care in community settings. After a care needs assessment by the social work department in the area where the person lives, eligible people assessed as requiring personal care at home are not charged for that care. A payment of either &#163;145 or &#163;210 is provided towards the care costs of eligible people living in a care home. The medical practice where a person is registered has no relevance here, and</p>

  <p>(b) Unified budget allocations, which include prescribing costs, take into account the number of patients registered with GP practices in the area of the health board concerned, irrespective of the patient&#39;s country of residence.</p>

  <p>Equal opportunities runs through community planning. Under the community planning legislation (section 59 of the Local Government in Scotland Act), Scottish ministers, local authorities and all other bodies participating in community planning should do so in a manner which encourages equal opportunities and the observance of equal opportunities.</p>

  <p>The statutory community planning guidance highlights this duty and the importance of mainstreaming equal opportunities in community planning. Detailed guidance on how to mainstream equalities is being prepared by the Scottish Equalities Co-ordinating Group. The guidance specifically suggests that community planning partnerships consult and co-operate with equalities groups, including lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender organisations.</p>

  <p>It would not have been appropriate to issue a consultation paper on the closure of Peebles Sheriff Court and the transfer of business to another court, while discussions were continuing on the potential to deliver court services from another building in Peebles.</p>

  <p>The detailed discussions between the Scottish Court Service and the Scottish Borders Council on the use of council buildings at Rosetta Road for court hearings has resulted in an outline agreement which will be submitted to elected members for their approval.</p>

  <p>If the council&#39;s approval is given it will no longer be necessary to transfer the court business from Peebles and the consultation process previously envisaged would no longer be required.

  <p>The Scottish Court Service has been involved in detailed discussions with the Scottish Borders Council on the use of the council premises at Rosetta Road, Peebles, for court hearings. Consideration had to be given on how best to accommodate the needs of the court within an important historic building, as well as the wider implications for the delivery of council services in Peebles. Outline agreement has now been reached between officials on a way forward. Should this agreement receive the approval of the council&#39;s elected members, the necessary planning consents will be sought and works instructed with the intention of returning hearings of the Sheriff Court and District Court to Peebles at an early stage.</p>

  <p>For the majority of these guidelines only one print run is carried out. If there is strong interest in a guideline an additional print run is undertaken.</p>

  <p>SIGN budgets for each of the last four years are shown above. The cost of involving self-employed practitioners (general medical and dental practitioners) and practice nurses are met by the SIGN budget. The costs associated with NHSScotland employees are currently met by their employing NHS boards.</p>

  <p>SIGN guidelines and quick reference guides are distributed free of charge to NHSScotland employees. In addition, all SIGN guidelines are available to download free of charge from their website (<a href="http://www.sign.ac.uk/">www.sign.ac.uk</a>).</p>

  <p>The effectiveness of SIGN guidelines is generally monitored through clinical audit at local level. A report on the implementation of SIGN guidelines was published by Clinical Recourse and Audit Group (CRAG) in 2002 (available from <a href="http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/crag/" target="_blank">http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/crag/</a>).</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer given to question S1W-34889 on 31 March 2003. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&#39;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="/webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a> ..</p>

  <p>This answer provided figures for cases of drink-driving for the year April 2001 to March 2002, but it did not include figures relating to the Glasgow area due to upgrading work to the computer system within the Glasgow office. Updated figures have now been obtained, which include data from Glasgow. In the year April 2001 to March 2002, a total of 10,796 charges were reported to the procurator fiscal in Glasgow and 97.4% were prosecuted. A decision not to prosecute was taken in only 1.7% of cases.</p>

  <p>The balance of 0.9% is accounted for by cases which were transferred to another court jurisdiction or where the procurator fiscal was able to include the charge along with another case against the same accused person.</p>

  <p>Information on contact orders by non-resident fathers is located within the individual court records where the orders were sought. Easily accessible, in-depth national information on contact orders (and, more broadly, civil actions) is not available centrally. Only top-line information is collated and published annually in the form of Civil Judicial Statistics.</p>

  <p>However, the Executive is currently setting up a project to review the practical use of statistical data collected and published in the form of Civil Judicial Statistics. This is with a view to ensuring that what is collected is of practical use in shaping and informing the performance of the civil justice system in Scotland. This will include consideration of contact order data.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, the Executive is planning to conduct research to examine contact applications in a sample of Scottish courts. This is primarily to address the recommendations of the National Group to Address Violence Against Women. This research will focus upon fathers applying for contact orders where there have been allegations of domestic violence. It will generate a &quot;snapshot&quot; of information at the time of research. Although the research will generate evidence to help assess how best to monitor contact orders, plans to collect on-going national data centrally will fall primarily within the remit of the Civil Judicial Statistics Review.</p>

  <p>It is very important to make sure that the additional pressures that winter brings to health and social care services do not disrupt care for patients and clients. The NHS and its planning partners are now preparing for this winter with plans developed upon the experience of previous winters. Health boards are only too well aware of the pressures that winter can bring and there is no complacency in their approach to preparations.</p>

  <p>Plans will include extra staff, more beds, increased critical care capacity, additional nursing home places, and continued co-ordinated action on delayed discharge. This is supported by significant extra investment with health spending set to increase on average by more than &#163;630 million each year from 2003-04 to 2005-06 and &#163;30 million allocated specifically to address delayed discharges from hospitals. This year Glasgow will receive an increase of 7.4% (&#163;52.655 million) over their 2002-03 allocation with a further &#163;5.543 million to address delayed discharges .</p>

It should be noted, however, that this may not include the total expenditure undertaken by these agencies as they may have placed some advertisements independently.

  <p>Any such pattern is formed by the scheduling of campaigns. The actual recorded payments are, however, determined by the date of receipt and payment of invoices.</p>

  <p>The scheduling of a number of the Executive&#39;s campaigns are influenced by seasonal factors. For example, in 2002-03 the drink-drive, domestic abuse, fire safety, and alcohol misuse campaigns were scheduled for the winter period to coincide with proven higher incidences of related behaviour, accidents and risk.</p>

  <p>The flu campaign was scheduled from mid-September to November, which is the recognised &quot;window&quot; for immunisation of the elderly and at risk groups before the winter period of potential flu occurrence.</p>

  <p>Planned expenditure for the last quarter of 2002-03 was reduced by over 25% (written answer S1W-31578 on 7 February 2002 refers - all answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&#39;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="/webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a>.), in line with the First Minister&#39;s decision of August 2002 to reduce advertising expenditure.

  <p>A review paper published in <em>Biologicals</em> in 1999, stated that &quot;with the exception of five component vaccine, acellular vaccines are less efficacious than a good whole cell vaccine&quot;. A letter from the Chief Medical Officer in November 2001 referred to this review paper and its relevance to the Executive&#39;s preference for diphtheria, tetanus and wholecell pertussis (DTwP) vaccine over diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine, for primary immunisation. This letter can be accessed at <a href="http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/sehd/publications/CMO(2001)16.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/sehd/publications/CMO(2001)16.pdf</a> .</p>

  <p>At its meeting on 1 November 2002, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) considered research evidence showing a gradual increase in the number of cases of Hib disease since 1999. As a result of these deliberations, the committee recommended that children between six months and four years of age should receive another dose of Hib vaccine. At this meeting, reasons for the possible increase in Hib infections were also discussed. An open minute of the meeting can be found at <a href="http://www.doh.gov.uk/jcvi/mins01nov02.htm" target="_blank">http://www.doh.gov.uk/jcvi/mins01nov02.htm</a>.</p>

  <p>Following this recommendation, the Executive initiated a catch-up campaign to offer all children, aged between six months and four years at 1 April 2003 a booster dose of Hib vaccine.</p>
