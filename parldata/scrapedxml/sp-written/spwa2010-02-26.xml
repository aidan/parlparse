  <p>The Empowering Youth: Future Leaders project is being funded through the Race, Religion and Refugee Integration (RRRI) Funding Stream 2008-11. The project aims to work with young Muslims aged between 18 and 25 years old and a core group of 40 young people are directly benefiting from the programme. As with all of the RRRI Funding Stream projects, independent monitoring and evaluation is carried out by the Voluntary Action Fund. Grant conditions, including financial monitoring, are attached to all funding provided by the Scottish Government.

  <p>This is a matter for Fife Council which has powers under the Flood Prevention (Scotland) Act 1961 to mitigate the flooding of non-agricultural land in its area. We will be bringing Part 4 of the Flood Risk Management (Scotland) Act 2009 into effect later this year.

  <p>I have asked Willie Pretswell, Interim Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service, to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Prisoner Listener Scheme is a Samaritan Scotland delivered service and is normally available in all of Scottish Prisons. Currently, the only exception is HM YOI Polmont where the service has been suspended. Discussions are ongoing between HM YOI Polmont and the local branch of Samaritans to establish what can be done to reintroduce the Listener Scheme at this establishment.</p>

  <p>The number of listeners within each establishment varies depending on prisoner movement, the number of prisoners offering their time and willing to be trained as listeners, and the capacity of the local Samaritan branch to support the service. Consequently, listener numbers at each establishment are not fixed and tend to fluctuate due to the above factors. We are currently consulting Samaritan partners to confirm the number of active listeners at each prison and will provide the this information by 5 March 2010.</p>

  <p>I have asked Willie Pretswell, Interim Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service, to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Rule 37 of <em>The Prisons and Young Offenders Institutions (Scotland) Rules 2006</em> relates specifically to the duty of the medical officer to bring to the attention of the establishment governor certain healthcare matters that may impact on the prisoner&rsquo;s management, wellbeing and where appropriate advise clinical recommendations for addressing such matters.</p>

  <p>The rule does not impose cellular confinement on grounds of mental health, nor does it relate specifically to this type of illness. Therefore additional input from a Psychiatrist is rarely required, unless he or she is the medical officer notifying the governor of the health matter that needs to be addressed.</p>

  <p>Prisoners who are managed under Rule 37 have a care plan in place which outlines appropriate support and interventions required for that individuals care according to their healthcare requirements. Each case will be discussed at a Multi Disciplinary Mental Health Team meeting and where appropriate they will be seen by a qualified psychiatrist whose input will be incorporated into individual care plans where mental health issues require this.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the Water Industry (Scotland) Act 2002 (Direction in the Interests of National Security) Order 2002 provides ministers with express powers to revoke a direction made using that legislation and, if not, what other legal powers could be used to remove unnecessary security measures.</p>

  <p>There is no express provision to the contrary, so the power under this Order to make a direction to revoke an existing direction is implicit. However, the power to give a direction under this 2002 Order is exercisable by Scottish ministers concurrently with the Secretary of State and only after consultation with the Secretary of State.</p>
