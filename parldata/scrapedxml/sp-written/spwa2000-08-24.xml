  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has been in consultation with Her Majesty&#8217;s Government in connection with the proposed EC Directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment and what representations it has made on (a) whether any such Directive should come into force in Scotland and (b) whether retailers or local authorities should handle the retrieval of such goods.</p>

  <p>We recently issued a consultation paper which was prepared jointly with the Department of Trade and Industry, on the European Commission&#8217;s proposals for Directives on waste electrical and electronic equipment. We shall consult industry, local authorities, SEPA and other interested parties in order to assess the possible impact and benefits of the proposals in Scotland. Comments on the proposals will be taken into account during negotiations on the Directives.</p>

  <p>We support the objectives of the Commission&#8217;s proposals, namely the prevention, reuse, recycling and recovery of waste electrical equipment to reduce the disposal of waste and the restrictions on the use of hazardous substances in electrical equipment. These objectives also form part of the National Waste Strategy: Scotland. When agreement is reached on the final form of the Directives, and they are adopted, they will be brought into force in all areas of the Community - including Scotland.</p>

  <p>Under the Commission&#8217;s proposals, member states would have to ensure that systems are set up to allow the final holders and distributors to return waste equipment from private households. Producers would have to provide for the collection of equipment from holders other than private households. The proposal does not stipulate which bodies must handle the retrieval of such goods. This is an issue which we would need to address before implementing the final Directive.</p>

  <p>Victim Support Scotland is funded by the Scottish Executive to provide emotional and practical help to victims of crime, including violent crime. In serious crimes of violence that support often extends to the family of the victim. In addition, the Support After Murder Project, co-ordinated by Victim Support Scotland, brings together the work of the main voluntary organisations, Cruse, PETAL (People Experiencing Trauma and Loss), and Victim Support Scotland, all of which offer support to people bereaved by murder. Families of victims also, of course, have access to health services which can provide counselling and other support where that is required.</p>

  <p>The assistance and support depends on the nature of the assault and the needs of the individual officer. Support available may include incident debriefing, welfare services, a free Employee Assistance Programme which provides a 24 hour counselling service to staff and families. Line managers maintain contact with staff if the assault results in their absence from work and, if necessary, a planned return to work programme following occupational health advice is put in place.</p>
