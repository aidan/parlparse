  <p>The Scottish Government has provided the Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) with a revenue allocation of &pound;183.4 million for 2008-09, an increase of 3.15% over the equivalent 2007-08 allocation. Decisions on funding levels for 2009-10 and 2010-11 have yet to be made.</p>

  <p>The SAS is allocated capital resources based on their approved financial plans. They have been given a capital allocation of &pound;15.180 million for 2008-09 and notified of indicative capital allocations of &pound;13.200 million and &pound;12.350 million for 2009-10 and 2010-11 respectively. Funding for vehicles and equipment programmes over &pound;5 million (such as defibrillators) are allocated in addition to basic allocations following approval of required business cases by the Capital Investment Group.</p>

  <p>It is for the SAS to decide how best this money should be used to obtain the maximum benefits for patients all over Scotland, as well as ensuring value for money.</p>

  <p>Ministerial responsibility for architecture remains with me. In February, a new Directorate for the Built Environment was established, drawing together the Architecture Policy Unit, Building Standards and Planning. This change was one of the proposals contained within the First Minister&rsquo;s statement on 30 January 2008 on simplifying public services to deliver more effective government, and allows us to develop and strengthen the clear synergies and linkages between various elements of built environment policy work streams within a clear organisational framework. Ministerial responsibility for building standards and the land use planning system remains with Stewart Stevenson.</p>

  <p>My officials wrote to the Scottish Football Association (SFA) prior to the debate noted in the question. Officials asked the SFA about their views about possible changes to the legislation governing &quot;listed&quot; events and their broadcast on terrestrial television, with particular regard to matches involving the national football team. A response was received from the SFA shortly before the debate, which I have since seen. In their response, the SFA, while welcoming the widespread public interest in the Scotland team, also noted the importance to the SFA of the monies received through the sale of television rights.</p>

  <p>Since the debate on 9 January I have also written to the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport to highlight the concerns in Scotland around the issues raised in the debate, and to encourage the UK Government to begin a review of the list of events provided for under the Broadcasting Act 1996. I await a reply.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to supporting all children especially those at risk and ensuring that those who need help get a timely and proportionate response. Relevant information-sharing across agencies and prompt intervention are key components in achieving that outcome. Through the implementation of the <em>Getting it right for every child </em> (GIRFEC) agenda, we are promoting improved culture, systems and practice to facilitate better inter-agency working across all dimensions. The HM Inspectorate of Education-led joint inspection of child protection services in Scotland specifically monitors how well service providers share information and intervene to protect children at risk. We have been reviewing the inspection reports produced thus far; the annual reports from child protection committees in relation to agencies&rsquo; sharing of information and prompt intervention, and experience from the GIRFEC pathfinders. There is a need to straddle inter-agency and inter-disciplinary assumptions, principles and practices on risk and what this implies for appropriate levels of information-sharing and intervention. In going forward, we need to engage extensively with stakeholders and professionals and that process will start shortly.</p>

  <p>Implementation of <em>Getting it right for every child</em> is continuing through testing the core components, principles and values in pathfinding activity and in partnership with agencies. The issues raised in the consultation, published in October 2007, are being examined where relevant as part of that process. The Scottish Government is facilitating a learning community network to assist key partners with their understanding and implementation of <em>Getting it right for every child</em> . This will include developing improved culture, systems and practice to facilitate information sharing where this is necessary.</p>

  <p>I look forward with optimism to the impact that Creative Scotland can have. I believe it will be a new, energetic force in our national life that should enable and support others to take risks. I have encouraged the Scottish Arts Council and Scottish Screen, and their transition team, to develop approaches to Creative Scotland with this attitude in mind. I have been encouraged by their response to this challenge. In this connection, it may be useful to consider a statement of intent published recently by the Creative Scotland transition project, which may be viewed at:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will issue its consultation paper on the energy performance of buildings as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is in liaison with a range of stakeholders in the development of policy on the energy performance of buildings. Examples of this include the consultation on the Energy Efficiency and Microgeneration Strategy for Scotland and, more recently, the process of stakeholder engagement linked to the production of the Sullivan Report.</p>

  <p>We signalled our intention to consult on the role for standards for existing non-domestic buildings and housing stock in the consultation on proposals for a Scottish Climate Change Bill launched on 29 January. Prior to its launch the Scottish Government had discussions with several important stakeholders.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers have yet to approve the specific content of the planned consultation on the energy performance of buildings. However, its is intended that most of its contents will be developed from these prior consultations. The consultation paper currently under development will provide an opportunity for further input from a wide range of stakeholders once it is issued. We will seek to ensure that the wide range of bodies with an interest have an equal opportunity to contribute and make their views known. Stakeholders will be free to indicate their views on any matter relevant to the subject matter of the consultation.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government provides guidance on its consultation process which, in regard to the pre-consultation stage, makes clear that notification of all consultations should be published on its website at least six weeks prior to the launch date to alert the public in good time. In accordance with this guidance, the intention to consult on measures to improve the energy performance of existing buildings was registered on 30 January. The guidance indicates that, depending on the nature of the exercise, officials might find it useful to seek advice from external organisations early in the process, although there is no requirement to do so. Given the extensive pre-existing consultation in this subject area, for example, linked to the Sullivan Report, and the link to the proposed Climate Change Bill, which was also subject to a process of pre-consultation engagement, it was not considered appropriate or timely for an additional pre-consultation exercise.</p>

  <p>The examination and assessment of the impact of introduction of the road equivalent tariff approach is the principal reason why we are carrying out a pilot. While the desk-based study has been very informative only a live pilot can determine what the impact of a road equivalent tariff scheme will be, not just on the pilot routes but elsewhere in the Clyde and Hebrides and Northern Isles networks. That assessment will be comprehensive and consider usage and revenue impacts as well as economic and social impacts.</p>

  <p>The pilot scheme will be closely monitored to capture all the information we need to take decisions on future fares levels across the entire Scottish ferry network.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the reasons are for its proposed charging system for pedestrians on ferries to the Western Isles, which is to be based on the road equivalent tariff and which involves basing ferry fares on the cost of travelling an equivalent distance by road, but which would charge passengers &pound;2.10 to travel one mile and &pound;2.20 to travel two miles.</p>

  <p>To establish a rate for passengers the consultants for the road equivalent tariff (RET) study considered passenger fares on comparable bus and train journeys in Scotland. In addition, they considered worldwide experience of RET. In provinces in Canada where RET is used, passenger fares are based on a percentage of the car rate. The consultants have suggested that a core rate of &pound;2 plus 10p per mile represents a cost comparable to bus and rail travel and a fair percentage of the car rate.</p>

  <p>Using a core rate maintains a link to the actual cost of providing and maintaining vessels and harbours. It is important that any scheme is affordable, not just for the pilot exercise but for any future roll-out.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the reasons are for its proposed charging system for commercial vehicles on ferries to the Western Isles, which is to be based on the road equivalent tariff and which involves basing ferry fares on the cost of travelling an equivalent distance by road, but which would charge 10-metre long commercial vehicles &pound;201.80 to travel one mile and &pound;203.60 to travel two miles.</p>

  <p>To establish a fair rate for commercial vehicles the consultants for the road equivalent tariff (RET) study considered Road Haulage Association and Freight Transport Association rates. The suggested rate reflects a cost of &pound;1.80 per mile for a 10-metre vehicle which is broadly comparable with the data provided by those organisations.</p>

  <p>The current fare structure for commercial vehicles on the Clyde and Hebrides ferry service network is based on the length of the vehicle. It is clear that there is a strong correlation between the length and weight of the vehicle and the cost per mile of running that vehicle. The consultants recommended that the fare per mile for a commercial vehicle continues to reflect the length of the vehicle carried and also reflect the running cost of the vehicle. The new fare will therefore be a rate per metre per mile.</p>

  <p>Using a core rate of &pound;20 maintains a link to the actual cost of providing and maintaining vessels and harbours. It is important that any scheme is affordable, not just for the pilot exercise but for any future roll-out.</p>

  <p>Consequently, the road equivalent tariff rate for a 10-metre commercial vehicle to travel one mile would be &pound;21.80 and to travel two miles &pound;23.60, not &pound;201.80 and &pound;203.60 as suggested in the member&rsquo;s question.</p>

  <p>The RET rate represents a significant saving for commercial vehicles using the pilot routes.</p>

  <p>To establish an appropriate rate for cars the consultants for the road equivalent tariff (RET) study considered Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and the AA and RAC current figures on the cost of car travel. The current HMRC rates for car travel have been in place for some time now. The 60p per mile rate suggested by the consultants is broadly comparable with the cost of running an average family car as identified by both the AA and RAC.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government (SG) IT division has technical utility software which can be used to recover deleted data in certain circumstances. There are also commercial companies who specialise in the recovery of data.</p>

  <p>SG networked PCs are configured to store data on network drives and not on the PC itself so that in the event of failure or loss, data is not lost but is still available on the network. Data on the network is backed up (copies taken and stored in a secure location) on a nightly basis.</p>

  <p>In the case of laptops, our mode of operation is designed to ensure that as much data as possible is held on the office network storage as well as on the laptop. That ensures that the data is still accessible even if the laptop is lost or stolen. In the event of loss, the only data which would be unavailable would be any that had been created exclusively on the laptop and there would therefore be minimum loss. Staff are encouraged to synchronise their laptops regularly with the office network to ensure that such material is copied on to the network storage for safe keeping.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government (SG) is currently reviewing its data handling arrangements in line with a similar UK exercise. A working group under the Director-General Justice is directing this review in which the data handling processes at all public sector bodies in Scotland are being reviewed to ensure they meet the required standards.</p>

  <p>When the review is complete, guidance will be revised if appropriate and issued to SG staff and agencies. An action plan will be produced to ensure any deficiencies identified are addressed.</p>

  <p>Pending the review, reminders have been issued to all SG staff of the processes which exist to protect data both at rest and in transit and of their responsibilities to ensure these are complied with.</p>

  <p>School libraries and librarians play a valuable role in supporting learning in schools. We recognise the contribution school librarians can make in a number of ways to the delivery of the Curriculum for Excellence. For example, as part of Curriculum for Excellence, Learning and Teaching Scotland have recently released for engagement the experiences and outcomes for literacy in English and Gaelic and we hope this will reinvigorate our approach to literacy and language in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will encourage the roll out of DAB digital radio to the Western Isles, although the further extension of such services is in the first place a commercial matter for operators.</p>

  <p>The government will be involved with the UK Government in the Digital Radio Working Group established by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. This group has been established to consider:</p>

  <p>What conditions would need to be achieved before digital platforms could become the predominant means of delivering radio?</p>

  <p>What are the current barriers to the growth of digital radio?</p>

  <p>What are the possible remedies to those barriers?</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is contributing to the work of the group and will ensure that the interests of the Western Isles and other rural and island communities are considered. The group is due to report later in 2008.</p>

  <p>I would also clarify that, in the Western Isles, digital radio will be available via digital television after the 2010 digital television switchover. It will not automatically be available on a DAB radio set at that date.</p>

  <p>We are currently considering the issue of the water services charges exemption scheme as part of our 2010-14 Principles of Charging consultation.</p>

  <p>An analysis of that consultation, which closed on 29 February, will be published in due course.</p>
