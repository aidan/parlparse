  <p>The Scottish Government has arrangements in place for closely monitoring sickness absence to ensure that actions are taken to help reduce the overall absence rates among employees. This includes a dedicated absence management team who provide support for managers, back to work interviews when absences occur and a rolling programme of health and wellbeing events. An employee assistance programme is also available to all employees which offers advice on mental health and other health and wellbeing issues.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is concentrating on ensuring that all our supplier invoices are paid within 10 days. Latest performance shows that over 95% of invoices are paid within that target, and the Scottish business sector has noted the positive contribution that this has made to company liquidity in Scotland over the past year.</p>

  <p>We will continue to keep under review the target period for paying invoices.</p>

  <p>I have previously highlighted our approach to the prioritisation of the projects in the Strategic Transport Projects Review.</p>

  <p>Our priorities are:</p>

  <p>Firstly, the Forth Replacement Crossing. The Bill has been brought before the Parliament.</p>

  <p>Secondly, the Edinburgh to Glasgow Improvements Programme is being taken forward for delivery. The first phase of this programme, new hourly fast services between Glasgow and Edinburgh have been introduced. In addition, outline design for the new station at Gogar is progressing well, and it is planned that the station will be completed to coincide with the opening of the Edinburgh tram network.</p>

  <p>Finally, Network Rail are working hard on the development of our plans for the Highland main line and the Aberdeen to Inverness line.</p>

  <p>In terms of the remaining 25 projects, we are working with partners and stakeholders to take forward the development and design of these projects.</p>

  <p>Employment is reserved to the UK Government through the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). The previous UK Government introduced the Young Persons&rsquo; Guarantee (YPG) as a targeted response to the recession&rsquo;s impact on young people. Through this, the majority of young people in Scotland (18 to 24 and over six months unemployed) currently have the option of either some form of vocational training or a subsidised job.</p>

  <p>The YPG offer will end in March 2011. However, young people in Scotland who are over the age of 18 will continue to have access to Training for Work at the three months stage of unemployment. Training for Work is the Scottish Government&rsquo;s vocational training programme for unemployed adults.</p>

  <p>Information on wind farm applications being considered by Scottish Ministers is available by local authority areas.</p>

  <p>Applications for onshore wind farms in excess of 50 megawatts (MW) are considered by Scottish Ministers under Section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989. Currently two section 36 wind farm applications are under consideration. One is located in the South Ayrshire local authority area and the other in East Ayrshire.</p>

  <p>Wind farm applications below 50 MW are initially considered by the planning authorities but such applications may be referred to Scottish Ministers for consideration under either the notification or appeals procedures. There are currently no notified applications being considered but there is one appealed application with the Directorate for Planning and Environmental Appeals for a development in the East Ayrshire local authority area.</p>
