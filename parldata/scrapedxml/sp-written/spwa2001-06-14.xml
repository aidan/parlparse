  <p>There are no plans for the First Minister to make a ministerial statement regarding his meeting in Brussels on 28 May with the leaders of other regional governments involved in the initiative co-ordinated by Flanders. The seven partners are co-operating to ensure that the views of constitutional regions will influence the substance of the developing debate on the Future of Europe. The Executive has already noted in Parliament its involvement in the Flanders Initiative. Our involvement demonstrates our commitment to working to promote mutually beneficial links between Scotland and Europe.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-15596 by Mr Jim Wallace on 17 May 2001, whether it met the Scottish Legal Aid Board (SLAB) to discuss the proposed allocations to the Legal Aid Fund for financial years 2002-03 and 2003-04 set out in table 1.0 of <i>The Scottish Budget</i> prior to the publication of these figures; if so, when this meeting took place and what SLAB&#8217;s position was with regard to the published figures.</p>

  <p>The Executive is in regular contact with the Scottish Legal Aid Board to discuss expenditure from the Legal Aid Fund. However, decisions on future provision for legal aid within the overall budget of the Scottish Executive lie with Scottish Ministers. As I explained in my answer on 17 May (question S1W-15596) the Legal Aid Fund is not cash limited. Scottish Ministers are legally obliged to provide sufficient funding to allow the Scottish Legal Aid Board to pay the cost of legal aid in every case that qualifies under the terms of the scheme.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to modernising government for Scotland. The modernisation programme is designed to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the Executive. It focuses on key developments in leadership, business planning, performance management, diversity and attracting and developing talent.</p>

  <p>A key element of the programme is a new objective based Pay and Performance Management System. The system will ensure there are clear links between personal objectives and the Executive&#8217;s higher level objectives. Every individual will be accountable for achieving their objectives. The new system will complement the Executive&#8217;s business planning process which is closely aligned with the budget process. Work is also going on to streamline Executive wide processes using IT, such as correspondence handling and records management.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Ministers are accountable to Parliament for the use of all the resources that are allocated to them.</p>

  <p><u>Instructions To Planning Authorities Relating To Allocation Of Planning Applications Among Categories:</u></p>

  <p>1. Householder development</p>

  <p>Include all applications for development in the curtilage of a residential property which are not a change of use, for example: extensions, alterations, garages, swimming pools, walls, fences, driveways and porches. Exclude applications to change the number of dwellings in a building.</p>

  <p>2. Minerals</p>

  <p>Include surface mineral workings, surface installations for underground workings, mineral handling installations, brick and tile works, pipelines, conveyors, etc (NLUC classifications mi01a, mi01b, mi01d, ma06a, tr05b).</p>

  <p>3. Dwellings</p>

  <p>Include only developments within class 9 of the T+CP (Use Classes)(Scotland) Order 1997. Omit householder development (included in 1), hotels, hostels, caravan sites etc.(included in 5). Distinguish between major and minor classed as major. Where no number is given, a site area (see below) of 0.5 hectare or more can be used to distinguish major from minor.</p>

  <p>4. Business and industry</p>

  <p>Include developments in Use Classes 2 and 4 to 6 (including wholesale distribution). Distinguish between major and minor applications in rows a and b, classing as major if the floorspace to be built is 1000 sq. metres or more, or if the site area is 1 hectare or more.</p>

  <p><i>Floorspace</i></p>

  <p>area proposed in the application (i.e.: with basement car parks, rooftop plant rooms, caretaker&#8217;s flats etc included).</p>

  <p><i>Site area</i></p>

  <p>shown in the submitted plan. Land owned by the applicant but not directly involved should be excluded; exclude also the area of any adjoining or intervening roads.</p>

  <p>5. All other development</p>

  <p>Include all developments and uses not already covered, unless they fall into one of the special categories of application to be shown in rows 6 to 9. Distinguish between major and minor applications as above.</p>

  <p>Choosing between categories 1-5</p>

  <p>Changes of use should be allocated within rows 2 to 5 according to the end use, or principal end use, of the proposed change. Thus an application to convert a warehouse into 12 flats - where the work would be permitted development but for the fact that a change of use was involved- should be classed as &quot;dwellings: major&quot;. Mixed use applications should be allocated by the principal use of the development. Normally, this will be the use which accounts for most floorspace. If there is any doubt, as for example in a multi-storey development where the split between one type of use and another is roughly equal, the ground floor use should be taken as the principal one. A proposed development should be classed by its own principal use and not by that of the complex of which it may form part. Also, a decision should be reckoned as major or minor according to the actual application being decided. Thus the grant of outline permission for housing on a site should be classed as &quot;Dwellings, major&quot;, while the later approval of details for five houses on part of the site should be classed as &quot;Dwellings, minor&quot;.</p>

  <p>6. Listed building and conservation area consents</p>

  <p>Decisions on applications for listed building consent to extend, alter or demolish, and any other consents under listed buildings and conservation areas legislation.</p>

  <p>7. Advertisements</p>

  <p>Applications for consent to display advertisements under regulation 5 of the T&amp;CP (Control of Advertisements) (Scotland) Regulations 1984.</p>

  <p>8. Hazardous substances consents Include applications for consent under regulation 5 of the T&amp;CP (Hazardous Substances)(Scotland) Regulations 1993.</p>

  <p>9. Other consents and certificates</p>

  <p>Include applications for established use certificates, applications for certificates of lawfulness of existing use or development or of proposed use or development, applications for certificates of appropriate alternative development, notifications of proposed development by Government departments, and notifications on overhead electricity lines [for both these notifications, the date of decision is the date the planning authority sent its views and comments to the notifier]. Include also applications for prior approval by Coal Authority or licensed operator under Classes 60+62 of the GPDO. EXCLUDE any notifications and directions under GDPO Parts 6+7 relating to agricultural &amp; forestry development; these should not form part of any totals here but should be entered in Table 7.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, chief executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS), to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>SPS developed a new prisoner education policy which was implemented on 1 April 2000 through commercial contracts with a number of providers of education services to all SPS prisons. SPS aims this year to provide at least 250,000 prisoner learning hours.</p>

  <p>A new SPS Director of Rehabilitation and Care, who took up post on 1 May is reviewing the range of programmes currently available. This year the SPS aims to deliver 700 programmes to address offending behaviour of which 50% are accredited. These include cognitive skills, problem-solving skills training, anger management, drug relapse prevention and sex offender programmes.</p>

  <p>The Executive received representations from the Saltire Society on this subject at the end of April this year. No other correspondence has been received over the past 12 months, but three written questions received replies during that period (S1W-6312, Irene McGugan - 9 May 2000, S1W-6362, Nick Johnston - 10 May 2000, S1W-6886, Irene McGugan - 23 May 2000).</p>

  <p>The replies to these questions made clear that the Executive had no intention of specifying in legislation, or otherwise, the proportions and colours of the national flag for Scotland.<strong><i> </i></strong>The Executive believes that the dignity of the Saltire is best maintained by continuing high standards of production on the part of flag-makers. Statutory regulation would be inappropriate and enforcement impracticable; the colour and condition of flags flown outside for example is inevitably affected by exposure to weather and sunlight.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive ensures that flags flown from its buildings and those of its agencies and associated departments are produced to a high standard and observe the necessary heraldic conventions.</p>

  <p>The Food Standards Agency has advised that direct responsibility for the safety of food served in Scottish schools rests with the environmental health department of each local authority.

  <p>It is the policy of the Food Standards Agency to ensure that the public is informed quickly and effectively whenever it is aware that there is a risk of unsafe food entering the food chain.</p>

  <p>Recent identification of the illegal use of meat designated for pet food in foods for human consumption, led to comprehensive product recalls, advertisements being placed in national newspapers and the issuing of statements to the media. The agency in Scotland has no evidence to suggest that any of the products concerned were used in school meals.</p>

  <p>This resource for teachers contains some materials which may be suitable for use at the right stages of primary school. However, since the pack is designed to assist and inform teachers, and cover the differing educational needs of children at various ages, it follows that much of its content will not be appropriate for use with nine-year-old children. It is for individual schools and authorities to decide whether to use this pack, or some of the elements of it or indeed another resource altogether, but whatever resource they use, they must take into account the statutory guidance, age, understanding, stage of development and needs of their pupils. In addition, parents will, of course, be consulted about programmes of sex education in schools. This consultation, and the professionalism of teachers, will ensure that inappropriate materials are not used in Scottish classrooms.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Advisory Panel for Outdoor Education was involved in proposals developed in early 2000 for a teaching qualification on outdoor education. Decisions on those proposals were deferred pending the outcome of the discussions on the McCrone report. I intend to reconsider the proposals alongside the review of initial teacher education.</p>

  <p>The agreement, <i>A Teaching Profession for the 21<sup>st</sup> Century</i> , <i> </i> reached in February this year paves the way for a far reaching framework of modernisation which puts teachers at the heart of education.</p>

  <p>Today I was pleased to launch the first ever national recruitment campaign in Scotland. The first stage of this two-stage campaign is aimed at raising the profile and standing of teachers in our communities. The second phase will be aimed at encouraging talented people to choose teaching as a profession. The campaign is unique both in its national coverage and also in the strength of support it has received from parents, teacher organisations, employers and all those in the profession. It will undoubtedly increase the numbers of Scotland&#8217;s brightest and best entering the teaching profession and I am grateful to all those who have worked with us in putting the first steps in place.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what effect the draft European Transport Regulation may have on the competitive tendering position of the Glasgow Underground and whether it will make representations to Her Majesty&#8217;s Government on this matter.</p>

  <p>In autumn 2000 the European Commission published a proposal for a Regulation on action by member states concerning public service requirements and the award of public service contracts in passenger transport by rail, road and inland waterway. This contains a number of key objectives, including the aim to update current regulations &quot;to promote the best deal for the public by introducing controlled competition for public transport operation and opening up the markets between member states.&quot; As drafted, Glasgow Underground, along with light rail operations throughout Europe, would be covered by this Regulation and would need to be put to competitive tender at regular intervals.</p>

  <p>The draft Regulation is currently being discussed by member states and will be considered at the EU Transport Council in June, which I will attend. The Scottish Executive is in regular contact with the United Kingdom Government on a wide range of issues, including EC Regulations.</p>
