  <p>The Scottish Executive has not carried out any specific research on the effects on the economy of a reduction in average disposable income. The median weekly household income (allowing for housing costs) in Scotland has actually been rising in real terms &ndash; from &pound;237 in 1996-97 to &pound;306 in 2003-04.</p>

  <p>However, we do calculate and monitor a wide variety of economic indicators, including gross value added and gross disposable household income, which are used to monitor the past and current performance of the economy in Scotland. Further details are available at the following site:</p>

  <p>The police in Scotland have the authority to seek and execute search warrants in connection with their function to investigate crime. A warrant may be obtained authorising the search of a place or premises for a wide variety of material, including personal data, for the purposes of investigation, detection and prosecution of crime relating to reserved and devolved areas. Although criminal investigation and procedure (including procedures for obtaining warrants) are devolved, there are a number of statutory powers for the police to obtain search warrants in relation to reserved matters, for example, firearms and misuse of drugs offences.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has not earmarked specific financial support for the promotion of the Scottish music industry. Its support for the industry is provided through funding made available to its principal cultural and economic development agencies i.e. the Scottish Arts Council, Scottish Enterprise and Highland and Islands Enterprise. In addition, support for the international business needs of the music industry is provided through Scottish Development International. The levels of investment and support provided by these bodies to the music industry, and the purposes for which they are provided - including promotional activities - is a matter for the bodies themselves.</p>

I will write to the member providing the statistics for 2004 which will not be available until <em>Key 2004 Road Accident Statistics</em> has been published on Monday 13 June.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that the statistics given below are based upon the data which are held in the central statistical database and which were collected by the police at the time of the accident and subsequently reported to the Executive. They may differ from any figures which the local authorities would provide now, because they do not take account of any subsequent changes or corrections that local authorities may have made to the statistical information, for use at local level, about the location of each accident, based upon their knowledge of the roads and areas concerned.</p>

  <p>Injury road accidents occurring on the A71, and the associated numbers of fatalities and seriously-injured casualties, as reported in the <em>STATS 19</em> statistical returns.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to the second supplementary question to question S2O-6969 by Lewis Macdonald on 2 June 2005, how it defines strategic network costs and local network costs in relation to the costs of upgrading and expansion.</p>

  <p>As I said in my answer of 2 June, this information was covered by my statement to Parliament on 9 January 2005, and it was detailed in the accompanying documents.</p>

  <p>The information defining strategic network costs is given in footnote 11 of <em>Investing In Water Services: Objectives for 2006-2014</em>, a copy of which has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 35491).</p>

  <p>Information defining local network costs is given in paragraphs 45 to 49 of <em>The Principles To Be Applied In Charging For Public Water And Sewerage Services In Scotland 2006-2010</em>, a copy of which has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 35492).</p>
