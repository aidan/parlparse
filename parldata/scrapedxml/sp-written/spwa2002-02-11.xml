  <p>2. The above figures relate to routine appointments and self/GP referral appointments.</p>

  <p>3. Routine appointments relate to women who have been invited, by the Scottish Breast Screening Programme, to attend a standard appointment. This usually occurs once every three years. Self/GP referral appointments relate to women who have referred themselves or been referred for screening by their GP.</p>

  <p>It is not the case that Communities Scotland will no longer recognise UNISON. That union may continue to represent members of staff on a personal basis. As the new agency does not have independent collective bargaining status and therefore has no delegated responsibility for dealing with pay and related matters, these matters will be dealt with under the Executive&#8217;s existing single table bargaining arrangements with its three recognised unions.</p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise are, in liaison with Highland and Islands Enterprise and other partners, taking forward a number of activities aimed at taking advantage of commercial e-learning opportunities. Action within the broad area of e-learning includes promotion, development of supply capabilities and stimulating demand.

  <p>I refer the member to the answer given to question S1W-19144 on 14 November 2001. In addition, as part of the Scottish Economic Statistics Programme, the Executive is continuing to improve its understanding of the knowledge economy, innovation and research and development activity. Amongst other initiatives, the Executive is working on the development of a Knowledge Based Industries Index to measure growth in the Scottish knowledge economy, and recently published the results of a survey on Intellectual Property Commercialisation in Scottish Higher Education Institutions.</p>

  <p>The Executive is also working with Scottish Enterprise to commission from the Office of National Statistics further analysis of business research and development expenditure in Scotland. This will hopefully provide a more detailed and rigorous explanation of the reasons underlying Scotland's record in research and development expenditure.</p>

  <p>1999 is the latest year for which figures on government and higher education expenditure on research and development have been published. Figures for business expenditure have been published for both 1999 and 2000. In 1999, expenditure on research and development by government accounted for 0.3% of GDP and expenditure by higher education institutions accounted for 0.6% of GDP.

  <p>As at 31 January 2002, there were 30 patients in the State Hospital who had been waiting for more than three months since clinical agreement was reached between the referring and the prospective receiving clinical teams that they could be safely treated and cared for by a local service.</p>

  <p>Nearly half of these patients are residents of and therefore the responsibility of Greater Glasgow NHS Board. The remainder come from five other NHS boards and from Northern Ireland. To identify the small numbers for these, health boards risk compromising patient confidentiality.</p>

  <p>The Executive made clear in 1999 its policy expectations for the creation of local safe services and accommodation for mentally disordered offenders. Different NHS boards are at different stages in developing the services in line with the policy. In October 2001, the Chief Executive of NHSScotland reminded the NHS boards of the need to make progress in developing local forensic psychiatric accommodation, services and support. Last month, Greater Glasgow NHS Board announced its plans for the development of local services for the area. Further announcements are expected in due course.</p>

  <p>The preliminary date for the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) to issue guidance to the NHS on the clinical and cost effectiveness of trastuzumab (Herceptin) is March 2002. As with all NICE appraisals consultees have the right to appeal against these recommendations. If an appeal is lodged the timelines may be extended in order to consider the appeal. Details of the schedule are published on the institute's website at nice.org.uk.</p>

  <p>The Health Technology Board for Scotland (HTBS) will consult with experts to determine if there are any important differences to be considered in Scotland. HTBS will then issue authoritative guidance for NHSScotland in the form of an HTBS Comment, six to 10 weeks after NICE publishes its guidance.</p>

  <p>Contractors are not excluded from applying for contracts with the Scottish Executive but may be excluded at an early stage of the selection process. A short-list of firms to be invited to tender is compiled on the basis of an assessment of their suitability (for example, whether or not they have been convicted of any offences), their economic and financial standing and their technical capacity. The aim is to select suitable firms that, at the time, are considered best placed to carry out the required work. An assessment of technical capacity will usually include consideration of past performance including references provided by other clients.</p>

  <p>A National Standard on infection control has been set. The Clinical Standards Board for Scotland (CSBS) will report in March, on progress by the NHS against the standard. Over the following six months, the CSBS will visit all NHS boards and trusts to ensure that progress is followed up and will produce a further report later this year.</p>

  <p>A new National Standard for hospital cleaning services has also been made available to the NHS and the CSBS is working with Audit Scotland to ensure compliance with this standard.</p>

  <p>I would expect Lanarkshire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust to formally consult with the Local Health Council and to seek the views and thoughts of parents and children who have had long-term contact with the paediatricians at Monklands Hospital.</p>

  <p>I understand from the trust that the decision to temporarily transfer in-patient paediatric services over the winter period was taken on the grounds of patient safety. The trust advertised the proposed transfer in local newspapers, through GP Practices and in Monklands Hospital. I also understand that a public meeting was held on 12 December in Airdrie, where the public were invited to raise concerns and to clarify arrangements, including the reimbursement of any extra costs incurred in travelling to Wishaw.</p>

  <p>The trust has confirmed that in-patient paediatric services will return to Monklands General Hospital at the beginning of April.</p>

  <p>The Accounts Commission for Scotland, which is independent of ministers, is responsible for securing the audit of local authorities and for monitoring and investigating stewardship of public funds by local authorities. The commission has undertaken an investigation of the deficit in the education budget of Borders Council and has published its findings. These highlighted a number of high level failings in governance, and drew a number of general concerns to the attention of all Scottish councils. The commission now requires Borders Council to take appropriate remedial action and has asked the Controller of Audit to monitor the council&#8217;s progress and to make a further report on the council&#8217;s position after the financial year ending 31 March 2003.</p>

  <p>NHS trusts are generally expected to employ permanent nursing staff. There will, however, be occasions when this is not possible or practical. At such times, appropriately trained agency nurses are employed to ensure and maintain the delivery of quality patient care services.</p>

  <p>Decisions about the employment of agency nurses and the relationship with patient care are matters for consideration at local level, taking into account Audit Scotland Guidance on the employment of bank and agency nurses. Last September my department sought and received confirmation from NHS trusts that they were complying with the guidance. A further letter will shortly issue to the service reminding trusts of this requirement.</p>

  <p>This is a matter for West of Scotland Water, and I have asked the Chief Executive to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Different criteria than those used to select the scheme design options were used to identify the Potential Development Areas (PDA&#8217;s). This is because each PDA is the subject of more than one scheme option.</p>

  <p>At the first Value Management workshop the performance of scheme options based on PDA 13 were poorer than those short-listed for PDA&#8217;s 12, 8 &amp; 3. In addition, for the same generic conjunctive-use option, it is some &#163;9.5 million more expensive than the chosen scheme. There were two main drawbacks to PDA 13P:</p>

  <p>in order to gain access to the site for construction traffic, many narrow lanes would need to be upgraded. This would clearly have had an impact on the rural nature of the surrounding area, and</p>

  <p>considerable lengths of additional pipes would be required to be laid to enable the transfer of raw water to, and treated water from, the site.</p>

  <p>PDA 15 lies adjacent to Balmore Water Treatment Works. The generic option for this area assumed that all available development potential within the Balmore works itself would be utilised with the remaining treatment capacity being constructed on PDA 15. Capital costs for this option were at least &#163;10 million more expensive than for the other PDAs. Further drawbacks of this option include:</p>

  <p>additional costs associated with considerable interruption to the existing plant at Balmore;</p>

  <p>the low elevations of Balmore and PDA 15 would have mean significantly more pumping than short-listed options with consequentially higher CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and OPEX/whole life costs, and</p>

  <p>considerable extra lengths of multiple pipelines.</p>

  <p>The final scheme option, which uses parts of PDA&#8217;s 3 &amp; 8, has not been directly compared with PDA&#8217;s 13 &amp; 15, as the final option had not been developed at the time of the initial Value Management workshop. However, the final option performed better in relation to all the criteria than those options based solely at either PDA 3 or PDA 8.</p>

  <p>A full explanation of the Scheme Selection Process may be found in Annex D of the Environmental Statement which is part of the Planning Application for the Katrine Water Project.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer how many responses were received following the survey of MSPs and their staff in respect of the operation of the Parliament travel contract by Carlson Wagonlit; what comments were made in their responses and, in particular, whether they were favourable, and what action is now proposed in light of the response to the survey.</p>

  <p>Only eight responses were received following the survey of MSPs, their staff and Parliament staff. Four of the responses were favourable, but this level of response cannot be considered to be a representative sample. Comments were made regarding the delivery and prices of tickets, invoice details and telephone contact with Carlson Wagonlit. A second telephone number for Carlson Wagonlit has now been provided and the Parliament is considering other enhancements to the service.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer how many visits have been made to the Parliament by (a) overseas governments and (b) parliamentary delegations from overseas since July 1999 and whether any such visit included a meeting with a minister.</p>

  <p>Since July 1999, 20 visits have been made to the Parliament by overseas governments and 95 visits have been made by overseas parliamentarians or delegations of parliamentarians. These figures do not include visits involving only officials nor visits from representatives of other United Kingdom institutions.</p>

  <p>A number of visits to the Parliament have included a meeting with a minister.</p>

  <p>On some occasions the Parliament arranges a meeting or hospitality involving ministers together with members from across the parties. In the case of some visits to the Parliament there is a specific request for a meeting with a minister. Parliamentary staff liaise with Executive officials over arrangements to ensure a co-ordinated programme. Parliamentary staff also facilitate requests for meetings between visitors and representatives of non-Executive parties.</p>

  <p>In many cases visitors make their own separate arrangements for meetings directly with the Executive or with party offices, outwith the Parliament visit programme.</p>

  <p>The Parliament has received two visits from members of the United Kingdom Permanent Representation to the European Union. On both occasions the visit was by the serving Permanent Representative. Sir Stephen Wall visited on 8 June 2000 and Sir Nigel Sheinwald visited on 29 March 2001.</p>
