  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, the Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The original estimate was based on a figure of 140,000 eligible dwellings that could benefit under the central heating programme. This number was estimated from information contained in the 1996 House Condition Survey. From information that became available after the launch of the programme from local authorities, housing associations and from work undertaken on the 2002 House Condition Survey we now estimate that a total of around 70,000 eligible dwellings could benefit from the programme.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, the Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The &#163;350 million figure was an estimate of the possible cost of delivering the programme made at its launch in 2001 on the basis of a possible 140,000 eligible households. More up to date data has revised the number of eligible households to 70,000. The Executive&#8217;s commitment is to ensure that the central heating programme remains on track to deliver, to every eligible applicant who wants it and comes forward:</p>

  <p>Full central heating and insulation for every homeowner and private renter over 60 who had no central heating, or a central heating system that is broken beyond reasonable repair, by 2006 &#8211; as promised.</p>

  <p>Full central heating and insulation in housing associations and other social registered landlord properties during 2004 &#8211; as promised.</p>

  <p>Full central heating and related insulation installed in every council home in Scotland by April 2004 &#8211; as promised.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive recognises the importance of people with diabetes being reviewed in order to monitor the management and progression of their condition. It is a matter for NHS boards to put services in place to provide patients with the necessary health monitoring.

  <p>Any job losses are deeply regrettable and we are doing everything possible to help those people affected find alternative employment as quickly as possible. Following the announcement I met Sandy Crombie, Group Chief Executive of Standard Life, and offered the Executive&#8217;s help to those staff affected.

It is anticipated that the consultation will take place in the second half of this year with the intention being to lay draft implementing regulations in the Scottish Parliament thereafter.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has not funded any research into the effects of noise on any category of animal and has had no request to fund such research.</p>

  <p>There has been a considerable amount of research conducted elsewhere on the effects of noise on wild and agricultural animals and also some on zoo animals and kennelled dogs over the last ten years, both nationally and internationally. Research results have been published and are publicly available in a variety of scientific journals. However, we have no information on any research specifically investigating &quot;health&quot; effects except where animals have been used to investigate human disorders.</p>

  <p>No organisations have approached the Scottish Executive indicating any interest in establishing new ferry routes. If they were to do so, we would consider with them what support we might be able to offer.

  <p>The local authority estimates of the number of children and elderly people in fuel poor households in the local authority areas of Glasgow City, City of Edinburgh and Aberdeen, and for Scotland as a whole, are taken from the 2002 Scottish House Condition Survey (SHCS) as given in the table below.</p>

  <p>Information is not available from the SHCS for Stirling and Inverness because the survey is only designed to report at local authority level rather than areas within local authorities. The closest equivalent are the estimates for the Stirling and Highland local authorities which are as given below.</p>

  <p>The 1996 SHCS did not provide data at local authority level. However, as can be seen below, the national estimates for the number of children and elderly people living in a fuel poor household have dropped dramatically.</p>

  <p><table width="100%" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">

</table></p>

  <p>In this case we have been able to provide actual numbers of children and adults aged over 60 living in fuel poor households. Normally we report on the number of fuel poor households.</p>

  <p>Fuel poverty as a whole has dropped from 738,000 households in 1996 to 286,000 households in 2002.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to reply. Her response is as follows.</p>

  <p>The Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 invites local authorities to submit a local housing strategy to Scottish ministers and to provide a copy to anyone else on request. There is no formal requirement for local authorities to &quot;publish&quot; a local housing strategy.</p>

  <p>To date, nine local authorities have submitted a local housing strategy to Communities Scotland for assessment. Eight of these have been assessed:</p>

  <p>City of Edinburgh Council, East Lothian Council, Glasgow City Council, Highland Council, Midlothian Council, North Lanarkshire Council, South Ayrshire Council and West Lothian Council. The remaining strategy was received recently and is awaiting assessment. All local authorities require to have submitted their local housing strategy by 30 April 2004.</p>

  <p>The issue of empty houses has been dealt with differently in each of the strategies assessed to date.</p>

  <p>Evaluation of the impact of See Me is an integral element of the campaign. The public&#8217;s awareness of the campaign has been measured by regular omnibus surveys. The results to date are as follows:</p>

  <p>In December 2002, 29% of those surveyed showed spontaneous, unprompted recall of the campaign. By March 2003, this figure had reached 45% after further advertising. In September 2003, the figure settled back to 29% (six months after the end of the first phase of advertising). However, the figure rose again in November 2003 to 41%, following the launch of the second phase of the campaign with new campaign materials and advertising.</p>

  <p>I am delighted to announce that we have met our partnership commitment to increase the apprenticeship programme to 30,000 by 2006. There are now over 31,000 MAs in training which is an outstanding achievement and illustrates the popularity of the programme with both participants and employers.</p>

  <p>Our focus for the programme going forward will be on strengthening quality and increasing completion rates, while recognising that many who do not complete have used their MA as a stepping stone to other employment, further or higher education.</p>

  <p>Information on the number of patients waiting for an out-patient consultation is not collected centrally at present. Work is underway across the NHS to record the number of patients referred to each consultant-led out-patient service and the related waiting times for patients.</p>

  <p>As part of its out-patients programme, the Centre for Change and Innovation will be launching a national redesign of out-patient orthopaedic services later this month. This project will focus on improving queue management, patient booking systems, referral management services and the extended role of nurses and allied health professionals in the outpatient setting.</p>

  <p>The programme has already invested &#163;240,000 in NHS Argyll and Clyde to implement a patient focussed booking initiative.</p>

  <p>A <em>Draft Guide to the Production and Provision of Information about Health and Healthcare Interventions</em> was consulted upon earlier in the year and has been welcomed as a useful guide for the health service.

  <p>The Executive has no such powers at present. We have agreed with DTI ministers that the powers to grant these consents in the renewable energy zones will be executively devolved to the Scottish ministers. We are also in discussion with Her Majesty&#8217;s Government about future arrangements in respect of other provisions in the Energy Bill concerned with renewable energy installations in these waters, including public rights of navigation, the creation of safety zones and powers to ensure that plans for the decommissioning of these installations are approved at the time of consent.</p>

  <p>This number of advisory visits represents approximately 65% of residential care services registered by the Care Commission in Scotland. Brigades will be continuing these visits, which have been welcomed by staff and residents, until all care premises have been covered. In some 80% of the visits, recommendations have been made about improvements in fire safety. These were generally of a minor nature. The Care Commission has only moved to formal enforcement action in one case. However, for all visits which have resulted in recommendations being made, the Care Commission has asked the providers of the service for action plans with timescales and is seeking the advice of brigades on these plans where necessary. The information sought on ownership details is not held centrally.</p>

The estimated out-turn spend for 2003-04 is &#163;4.1 million. The increase in spend is principally as a result of; M&amp;C taking over lead responsibility for the development and operation of the corporate website, payment of the corporate Newspaper Licensing Agency fee and an increase in the costs of some of the external services purchased by M&amp;C, e.g. press cuttings and media monitoring.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is not aware of any challenges to its procurement decisions under the World Trade Organization&#8217;s Government Procurement Agreement (GPA). The GPA contains provisions similar to the European Union&#8217;s Procurement Directives and provides equivalent rights to suppliers based outside the EU in GPA signatory states.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has robust systems in place that are designed to minimise the possibility of fraud and, when necessary, to highlight that fraud may have occurred. In the last four years while there have been detailed examinations of potential financial irregularity, no Scottish Executive employees have been investigated, suspended and dismissed for fraud.</p>

  <p>The costs to the Executive are the long-run resource cost of providing student loans to Scottish domiciled students and a proportionate share of the running cost of the Student Loans Company. The most recent estimate for 2003-04 suggests that this average cost is 38.3p in every &#163;1 loaned. The student loans cash budget for 2003-04 was &#163;224 million, which gives an estimated resource cost of &#163;86 million.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&#8217;s share of the running costs budget of the Student Loans Company is &#163;5.178 million for 2003-04.</p>
