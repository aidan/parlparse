  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The SPS operates a system of induction and sentence management for prisoners. This, together with the health checks carried out on admission, aims to identify prisoners with serious problems as a result of, for example, autism. Education staff working in prisons draw up individual learning plans for and with prisoners. A diagnosis of autism would result in particular care being taken to engage the learner appropriately.</p>

  <p>As I said in reply to question S1W-20055, contact with the institutions of the European Union on the Bathing Waters Directive (76/160/EEC) is particularly frequent. These contacts are by letter, telephone, fax and e-mail as well as in face-to-face meetings. The last meeting of a Scottish Executive official with officials of the European Commission on the directive was on 12 November. On this occasion the Scottish Executive official was attending a workshop hosted by the European Commission&#146;s Directorate General for the Environment, to consider the economic cost-benefit appraisal of possible measures in the proposed revision of the directive. The workshop brought together a number of consultants and technical experts from the UK and from France and the Netherlands.</p>

  <p>The Minister for Finance and Public Services and I have reviewed the Local Outcome Agreements (LOAs) submitted by the 12 local authorities selected to benefit from the Better Neighbourhood Services Fund (BNSF).</p>

  <p>Uppermost in our minds was the Executive&#146;s commitment to improving the delivery of public services to the people of Scotland. We were also guided by the principles underpinning the BNSF: the need for local authorities to deliver clear and demonstrable outcomes for people in deprived neighbourhoods or deprived social groups and the need to involve these people in defining and monitoring these outcomes.</p>

  <p>The following LOAs have been approved and first year funding confirmed:</p>

  <p>Glasgow City Council&#146;s LOA covered plans for use of the BNSF for the first year of the fund only. A further LOA covering the second and third years is required to be submitted and approved by 1 July 2002.</p>

  <p>Two local authorities submitted LOAs which fell short of fully meeting the requirements of the fund - Inverclyde and Dumfries and Galloway &#150; but, after consideration, we agreed to provide first year funding (&#163;2 million and &#163;0.6 million respectively), on condition that revised LOAs were approved by 1 April 2002.</p>

  <p>We were unable to confirm the allocations for North Ayrshire (&#163;1.5 million), Argyll and Bute (&#163;0.6 million), and Eilean Siar (&#163;0.3 million), because the LOAs they submitted do not yet meet the requirements of the fund. However, the door remains open to these authorities; we will be prepared to provide funding from next year, if satisfactory LOAs are produced and approved by 1 July 2002.</p>

  <p>Confirmation of funding to all 12 local authorities for the further two years of the fund will be dependent on satisfactory progress being made against the outcome targets for each pathfinder.</p>

  <p>The population in the UK is resident, although winter numbers may be enhanced by variable numbers of birds originating from the large north-west European population.</p>

  <p>Limited evidence suggests an increase in the population up to at least the late 1980s, apart from in Shetland, where marked declines in the population have occurred (from a maximum of 16,500 in 1977 to an estimated 5,700 in 2001).</p>

  <p>Significant resources have been committed to this implementation including a total of &#163;12 million for a Refuge Development Programme and &#163;6 million over four years for the Domestic Abuse Service Development Fund.</p>

  <p>On 6 December we launched a new phase of our awareness raising campaign. Targeted at 16 to 25-year-olds, its aim is to reach new audiences through the use of different media, such as beermats, outdoor posters, convenience advertising and a website.</p>

  <p>The effect on the number of fuel poor households will be monitored. I understand that the recent announcement by Ofgem is intended to introduce greater competition in the provision of domestic electricity in Scotland. As such it is welcomed. Our policy of taking households out of fuel poverty, as far as reasonable and practicable, remains unchanged.</p>

  <p>Following the announcement by the Department for Employment and Skills (DfES) on 23 November to suspend the Individual Learning Account (ILA) scheme in England, the Executive undertook a further review of the scheme in Scotland. Since then, extra validation checks have been implemented by Scottish Enterprise for all current claims, as a precautionary measure to protect public funds.</p>

  <p>Both the review and the validation exercise have highlighted a number of actions which need to be taken urgently to address some of the deficiencies in the system. I have therefore decided to close the Individual Learning Account scheme with immediate effect. Consideration is being given to what future arrangements might be put in place to support individual learning.</p>

  <p>I will be writing to all MSPs with more information shortly, and every ILA holder and Learning Provider will also be written to individually.</p>

  <p>The access provisions of the Bill will not only provide the public with greater confidence to visit the Scottish countryside, but result in more opportunity for them to do so by the creation of new paths. There is growing interest in outdoor recreation on the part of both Scots themselves and visitors from elsewhere. The legislation will help encourage greater participation in outdoor pursuits, creating opportunities for rural communities and bringing benefits to rural economies.</p>

  <p>The community right to buy will benefit rural communities by providing greater opportunities for them to determine their own future. It will enable them to register an interest in, and subsequently purchase, land with which they can demonstrate a connection. This will provide rural communities with a right to buy when the land which is subject to the registered interest comes to be sold. If the community decides to proceed, it will have six months to raise the necessary funding to make ownership of the land a reality. This will give rural communities much more time to organise funding than at present, where they may have only a few weeks to do so.</p>

  <p>The crofting community right to buy will enable crofting communities to acquire the land on which they live and work, and by doing so give them control over the land and the ability to develop their communities. More than that, it decisively changes the balance of power between the community and the landowner, and will ensure that landowners pay proper regard to the needs of these communities.</p>

  <p>The conclusions reached by the Rural Development Committee recorded in these paragraphs in the Stage 1 Report relate to the use of terriers underground and the activities of the Scottish Hill Packs. The Executive neither propose to implement a policy nor introduce measures to give effect to those conclusions. The Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Bill has undergone amendment at Stage 2 to cater for pest control exceptions, reflecting the views of the committee.

  <p>No. The Scottish Executive's timetable for the payment process to begin is dependent upon the formal wind-up of the Scottish Transport Group pension schemes by the trustees.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for day to day oversight of the deployment of these funds falls to the grant recipient for Edinburgh SIPs, the City of Edinburgh Council. They advise us that no private companies were formed using SIP funds, and it therefore follows that no such companies have gone into liquidation.</p>

  <p>NESTRANS, the regional transport partnership, has developed its &quot;Modern Transport System&quot; a strategy which involves measures to help ease traffic flow in and around the city and to provide a better system of public transport. One such measure is the new Park &amp; Ride service from Kingswells, which opened in September, and is now used by around 2,500 people every week. The Scottish Executive will work with the partnership and its constituent local authorities to identify the other measures necessary to deliver the road traffic reduction targets outlined in their transport strategies.</p>

  <p>The new requirement that ozone-depleting substances in the foam insulation of fridges have to be recovered during disposal is proving a complicated problem for the UK and other EC countries. The Executive has been working closely with other Government Departments to prepare technical standards for both storage and treatment of fridges. We are now working with local authorities to assess the costs involved. Last week I announced that I would make additional funding available to authorities for this financial year to assist with the cost of storage.</p>

  <p>My reply to question S1O-4233 on 6 December 2001, confirmed that the Executive will provide additional funding to Scottish local authorities for the remainder of this financial year and that I would announce the allocations once firmer costs had been identified. That is still the position, but I hope to have more information shortly.</p>

  <p>I confirmed on 6 December in response to question S1O-4233 on 6 December 2001, that financial assistance would be available for local authorities. With a view to ensuring that our estimates of their needs are as accurate as possible we wrote to them on the same day asking them for feedback on the prices they have been quoted. We are also taking cognisance of prices being quoted by the waste management industry.</p>
