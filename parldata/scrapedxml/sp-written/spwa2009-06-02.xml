  <p>A warning letter for non-payment of a fiscal penalty is normally issued when payment first falls into arrears. Enforcement action will take account of the degree of contact that has taken place with the offender, the previous payment history of the offender and the most appropriate way to bring payments up to date.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has established the Serious Organised Crime Taskforce, which I chair, to tackle the threats posed by organised criminals. The taskforce, which includes members from all the relevant law enforcement agencies published its Serious Organised Crime Strategy &ndash; <em>Letting our Communities Flourish</em> on 2 June 2009. Copies will be available from the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 48213).</p>

  <p>As part of this strategy we are increasing funding to the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency by around &pound;4 million over two years. This extra funding will help create a Scottish Intelligence Coordination Unit which, amongst other things, will provide advice to local authorities, health boards and other public sector agencies to make sure they have all the information they need in order to avoid awarding major contracts to organisations with links to organised crime.</p>

The Framework was fully integrated into the Spending Review 2007 and was articulated in the Spending Review 2007 document. It provides clarity for outcomes-focused government, aligning all government action and spending decisions behind a single unifying purpose. Essentially, it ensures that our spending decisions, and those of our partners, support the achievement of our shared ambitions. Scotland Performs is still developing and the picture it offers will build and become more sophisticated over time, enabling people to see and judge for themselves the progress we are making.</p>

  <p>The Scotland Performs website brings together many different results from dozens of sources, all of which have differing requirements in terms of processing, quality assurance and publication. The data on Scotland Performs is at any time the most up-to-date there is available. Though some gaps and time lags have been unavoidable due to the move to focus on outcomes and the need to identify new performance measures to best support that, the position is improving all the time. In the past six months alone, 24 updates have been made to the website, some of them making data available for the very first time.</p>

  <p>The data on Scotland Performs is produced under Official Statistics Standards, which are set out in the Code of Practice for Official Statistics. This requires that data is published as soon as is practicably possible, whilst assuring the high standards of quality of Official Statistics. Statisticians within government are always striving to minimise data lag and, where these cannot be reduced further, to consider provisional or proxy sources to help give earlier information.</p>

  <p>The Accounts Commission audits local authorities as part of the performance audit of how local authorities discharge their best value and community planning duties</p>

  <p>However the independent Crerar Review of regulation, audit, inspection and complaints handling of public services in Scotland identified over 50 bodies which could reasonably be considered as having a role in the scrutiny of all public services, which would include local authorities and their community planning partners.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government update to Parliament on 23 June 2008 included a list of those bodies which we considered to have either a significant impact on public services via scrutiny or where scrutiny was clearly their primary function. This list does not include other public bodies, e.g. Scottish National Heritage or the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, whose activities will also have a tangential impact on local authority activities:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2008/06/23153230" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2008/06/23153230</a>.</p>

  <p>Prior to this though, in March 2008, the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth had already asked the Accounts Commission to work with the relevant bodies that scrutinise local authorities and local authority services to find ways of introducing a more proportionate approach through better planning and scheduling of service inspections.</p>

  <p>Through this work the Accounts Commission has already co-ordinated a scheduled 25% reduction for all current scrutiny body contact with councils in 2009, when compared to 2007 levels. Further details are available on the Accounts Commission website at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.audit-scotland.gov.uk/scrutiny/" target="_blank">http://www.audit-scotland.gov.uk/scrutiny/</a>.</p>

  <p>However, to ensure this continuous improvement, the Public Services Reform (Scotland) Bill introduced into Parliament on 29 May 2009 includes, for the first time, a duty on listed bodies scrutinising services provided by or on behalf of local government to co-operate, in order to ensure more proportionate and co-ordinated scrutiny.</p>

  <p>We are working together with the Equality and Budget Advisory Group on how the budget processes can take equality issues into account. We are continuing to raise awareness about the need to mainstream equality both into policies and budgets, seeking to improve the information on equality issues in the government&rsquo;s budget, and looking into possible ways of reporting on progress of equality proofing the budget. To support successful delivery on our purpose and outcomes and to meet our public sector equality duties, we expect policies and activities to be subject to the equality impact assessment process.</p>

  <p>During the debate on the economy on 30 April 2009, the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth confirmed that a carbon assessment of expenditure would be published with the 2010-11 budget proposals, making it available for parliamentary scrutiny at the same time. This intention was reflected in motion S3M-4004 passed at the end of that debate, and work is currently on-going to deliver that assessment. Some policy areas such as transport already include carbon as part of their appraisal of proposals, and we are continuing to develop an assessment method which can be applied more widely across government at the level of plans, policies and projects.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to providing the best possible care for children and young people in Scotland. The best setting for the provision of care is dependent on the needs of the individual through consultation with the health professionals and their multi-agency partners responsible for the provision of their care. Local authorities, NHS boards and other agencies should co-ordinate their efforts to ensure a safe and timely discharge from hospital once treatment has been completed</p>

  <p>The National Managed Clinical Network - <em>Exceptional Healthcare Needs</em>, developed as part of the National Delivery Plan for specialist services for children in Scotland, will assist in facilitating earlier discharge for children with complex needs, as appropriate.</p>

  <p>Information on the amount of expenditure spent by NHS boards on the use of the independent healthcare sector is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has made clear that its policy is to invest in the NHS in Scotland and to build sustainable services for the benefit of all NHS patients. However, NHS boards can use the independent sector to help meet short-term pressures and to provide capacity from time-to-time where that is necessary to treat patients quickly. This will always be at the margins.</p>

  <p>In 2007-08 the Scottish Prison Service recorded 82 receptions of a prisoner for fine default where the main crime or offence was the handling of offensive weapons, from a total of 3,160 fine defaulter receptions overall. In the same year there were 927 people found guilty of handling an offensive weapon who received a fine.</p>

  <p>Although these figures both cover the 2007-08 financial year, they do not refer to the same individuals, and therefore it is not possible to calculate the proportion of people who receive a fine for handling an offensive weapon who, as a result of not paying that fine, went on to spend time in prison.</p>

  <p>There were 4,041 persons proceeded against in Scottish courts for handling an offensive weapon in 2007-08. This relates to 3,874 individuals, as some people have been proceeded against on more than one occasion.</p>

  <p>Information about whether or nor individuals had a criminal record at the time of prosecution is not held centrally. However, the following table shows the number of these individuals who had a previous charge proved in court at least once in the previous 10 years. The previous charge has been identified as having a date of sentence which is earlier than the date of sentence for the latest charge of handling an offensive weapon.</p>

  <p>The source of this information is the Scottish Government Court Proceedings database, which is derived from data held on the Criminal History System. Prosecution in court is only one of a range of possible options for dealing with an individual who has been charged with an offence. Other actions include the use of fiscal warnings, diversion to social work, fixed penalty notices and fiscal fines. However, these alternatives to court prosecution are not currently held on the Scottish Government Court Proceedings database and are not included in the following data provided.</p>

  <p>Government agencies and directorates form constituent parts of the Scottish administration. They are financed from the Scottish block and are bound by the same requirements of propriety and regularity, and the general financial and accounting principles and guidance applicable to the whole Scottish Government. Agency chief executives and directors general are designated Accountable Officers as defined by the Public Finance and Accountability (Scotland) Act 2000. Agency chief executives are appointed by ministers, and agencies and directorates are both staffed by civil servants. The key distinction of an agency is its operational independence, as agencies are established by the Scottish ministers to execute specific, often specialist, functions.</p>

  <p>The Public Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2006 contain minimum timescales for procurement processes for certain high value contracts. For all other procurement processes, the timescales will vary according to the value, scale and complexity of the requirement. It is for individual public bodies to decide what is appropriate on a case-by-case basis, bearing in mind the need to allow bidders a reasonable time to submit tenders.

  <p>The railway line speed is limited between Alloa and Kincardine due to the alignment of the railway, which was constructed within the limits of the existing dismantled railway to reduce land take, and mine workings.</p>

  <p>At Alloa, Clackmannan and Kincardine the line speed is restricted by curvature to 40 mph.</p>

  <p>At Kilbachie the line speed was reduced to 30 mph as part of the mitigation due to mining impacts.</p>

  <p>As the section of line between Alloa and Kincardine is only used by freight it is not practicable to give short sections of higher speed between these locations hence a constant 30 mph line speed has been adopted.</p>

  <p>The final cost for the Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine project will not be known until the final account has been agreed. The current estimate for the cost to the Scottish Government, for the construction of the Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine railway project, is in line with previous estimates of circa &pound;85 million.</p>

  <p>It was always the intention that freight trains would run on this line as the business case presented to Parliament provided for both a passenger line to Alloa and freight line to Kincardine.</p>

  <p>The line provides a direct route for freight trains supplying Longannet power station from Ayrshire with coal and removing the need to travel between Glasgow and Edinburgh and the Forth Rail Bridge hence the project envisaged that freight would transfer upon completion.</p>

  <p>The creation of a double junction and new UP passenger loop at Stirling railway station will facilitate journey time savings of up to five minutes for a number of Alloa to Glasgow trains. The new facilities will increase the flexibility of the route, assisting in the punctual working of passenger and freight trains offering small, but widespread benefits, across a wide area of central Scotland.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how much of the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions since May 2007 can be attributed to wind farms.</p>

  <p>Information is not available in the format requested. We estimate however that in the calendar year 2007, the electricity generated by wind and wave power in Scotland had the potential to displace around 1.1 million tonnes of CO <sub>2</sub> when compared with an equivalent amount of fossil fuel generated electricity.</p>

  <p>This estimate is based on the electricity generated by wind and wave in Scotland in 2007, to which we have applied the Department for Food, Environment and Rural Affairs (Defra) recommended calculation for carbon dioxide savings &ndash; 0.43kg of carbon dioxide per kilowatt hour of electricity produced.</p>

  <p>As there is considerably more wind capacity operating than wave, it can be assumed that the vast majority of these emissions savings are from wind farms.</p>

  <p>The Defra guidelines which explain the reasoning for the calculation used can be found on the following website <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/business/reporting/conversion-factors.htm" target="_blank">http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/business/reporting/conversion-factors.htm</a>.</p>
