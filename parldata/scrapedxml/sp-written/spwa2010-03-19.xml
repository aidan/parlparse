  <p>NQSG&rsquo;s role in providing the Scottish Government with advice on the development of National Qualifications has been subsumed within (a) the expanded role, remit and membership of the Curriculum for Excellence Management Board and its sub-group: the Qualifications Governing Group and (b) the governance processes established by the Scottish Qualifications Authority for the development of the new qualifications. A separate Stakeholder Group also provides advice to the Scottish Government on issues related to Curriculum for Excellence. These groups are covering the interests of NQSG members. Consequently, the group has not met since 18 February 2009 and the current Cabinet Secretary has not therefore met with it.</p>

  <p>There is no formal data available on sporran manufacturers and sporran hire outlets. There is a wide range of retail outlets for sporrans including kilt hire and sale shops, tourist shops and on-line trading. On the manufacturing side, there are some larger producers of sporrans, but this is very much an artisan industry with many sole traders.</p>

  <p>The cost of the Scottish Government catering service is largely funded through charges paid by Scottish Government staff. A small level of financial support is paid to assist with the cost of the labour involved in the provision of the catering service. This assistance is not used to support the purchase of food produce.</p>

  <p>As indicated in question S3W-31932 in the financial year 2008-09 the total catering sales were &pound;2,074,726 of which &pound;211,330 was in respect of the purchase of fair trade and ethically traded product, or 10.2% of the total sales. Estimated figures for spend so far in the current year suggests that spend on these products continues to increase.</p>

  <p>On 3 February 2010 the Scottish Parliament approved the Scottish Budget 2010-11, which included the cancellation of the branch line element of the Glasgow Airport Rail Link (GARL) project. As such this means that the land, previously acquired under compulsory purchase powers, for the branch line element of GARL is now deemed to be surplus to requirements.</p>

  <p>In accordance with our statutory obligations under the Glasgow Airport Rail Link Act (2007), Section 44 &ndash; Application of Crichel Downs Rules, where land is deemed to be surplus to the authorised undertaker&rsquo;s requirements for the provision of the authorised works then the Crichel Downs Rules must be applied. This statutory requirement was welcomed by the Glasgow Airport Rail Link Bill Committee during its consideration of the bill in 2006.</p>

  <p>All infrastructure projects assessed by Transport Scotland are conducted in line with Scottish Transport Appraisal Guidance (STAG). This ensures consistency across projects as the same methodology is used to identify measure and record all costs, benefits and wider impacts.</p>

  <p>STAG recommends all costs and benefits are expressed in real as opposed to nominal terms. As such inflation does not apply where prices are forecast to remain constant in real terms. Where prices are expected to increase in real terms, guidance is provided in STAG as to the growth rates to apply over time. STAG also provides relevant discount rates to use.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland are aware of the public transport interchange proposals which form part of British Airport Authority&rsquo;s Air Surface Access Strategy and we continue to liaise with them on an updated strategy. This strategy would have been expected to compliment the branch line section of the Glasgow Airport Rail Link (GARL) but would not have altered the underlying airport passenger growth assumptions on which benefits forecasts were based.</p>

  <p>The national housing trust model anticipates that funding would be split 65% public and 35% private sector. Public funding is expected to be secured through the Public Works Loan Board (PWLB) utilising the prudential borrowing powers of participating local authorities to fund sites in their area. The 35% private investment will be risk capital private funding from developers and other site owners and would likely be split 5% loan note and 30% equity investment. A Scottish Government guarantee would be provided to each participating local authority in relation to the re-payment of the PWLB loan.</p>

  <p>The national housing trust (NHT) scheme aims to provide affordable good quality homes for rent by tenants on low to moderate incomes who would struggle to afford private renting or to buy a home, but are unlikely to be able to access social rented housing in the near future. Properties would be let on renewable short assured tenancy agreements because the scheme has been designed to last between five and ten years in order to attract private sector investment whilst securing high value for taxpayer&rsquo;s money. Prospective tenants would be made aware that the NHT scheme was not offering a permanent home, but a viable alternative to waiting potentially years for a social rented home.</p>

  <p>Community Service teams across Scotland are increasingly introducing projects for low level offenders to carry out unpaid work to repay their dues that are more meaningful and relevant to local communities. A recent example of this is the excellent work undertaken by offenders on community service across Scotland clearing snow from schools, hospitals and care homes for the elderly etc.</p>

  <p>In addition to help ensure that the work done reflects local needs, the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Bill, currently going through stage 2, further strengthens the unpaid work element of the new Community Payback Order by introducing a formal requirement to consult communities on the type of work to be undertaken by offenders. Furthermore, the Scottish Government is working in collaboration with partner agencies in order to identify and share best practice across Scotland through initiatives such as the Scottish Community Service Awards which will be held on 24 May 2010 in Glasgow.</p>

  <p>No changes have yet been made to the accreditation standards for installers of microgeneration equipment in Scotland. The Scottish Government recently received proposals for changes to the accreditation requirements from the industry led working group. We are currently considering these. We are committed to reach a solution that will satisfy microgeneration installers but not exclude Scottish consumers from forthcoming UK-wide clean energy cash back schemes.</p>
