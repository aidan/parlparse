  <p>Project funding of &pound;80,000 is being made available in 2011 to veterans&rsquo; organisations through the Scottish Veterans&rsquo; Fund. This level of funding is unchanged from previous years. More generally, the Scottish Government does not provide core funding to veterans&rsquo; organisations. Charities of this type should and do secure resources through collections, bequests, commercial activity and other forms of fund raising.</p>

  <p>Combat Stress is the leading charity in its field and the Scottish Government continues to provide &pound;1.2 million per year for the provision of specialist mental health services at its Hollybush House facility in Ayr. A further &pound;200,000 per year continues to be made available to support Combat Stress&rsquo; community outreach programme.</p>

  <p>The delivery of the Literacy Action Plan will take place within existing policy frameworks, including the Early Years Framework, Curriculum for Excellence, and the Adult Literacies Strategic Guidance. Delivery will build on the resource and infrastructure already in place to support these frameworks.</p>

  <p>We are also working with Learning and Teaching Scotland, the Scottish Qualifications Authority, and HM Inspectorate of Education, as well as partners in health, justice, social work and culture, to ensure their current and future work supports the action plan.</p>

  <p>Highland Council is responsible for the delivery of education in its area. The employment and deployment of their staff in the delivery of that duty is a matter for the local authority.

  <p>Information on audiology services is collected on an aggregated form. Consequently, it is not possible to provide the information requested. However, information on the median wait for first appointment with a specialist is provided in the following table.</p>

  <p>Waiting time information for audiology services is relatively new data and is currently still under development. As the information collection system is fairly new there are data quality issues around this information and figures should be treated with caution. ISD is working with all NHS boards to improve data quality.</p>

  <p>In primary care, costs will relate to the cost of the remedy, which can be cheaper than the cost of orthodox drugs. Practitioners have also noted a reduction in side effects and dependency risks in some cases. In secondary care in Scotland, homoeopathy is only employed within a broader integrative care approach, with surveys showing both enhanced wellbeing and symptom reduction across a broad range of long term conditions, and a resultant reduction in NHS costs through reduced GP and hospital visits and repeat prescriptions.</p>

  <p>Homoeopathy can contribute to the Scottish Government&rsquo;s integrative approach to patient care. We recognise that complementary or alternative therapies, including homoeopathy, may offer relief to some people suffering from a wide variety of conditions. Insights from the individualised homoeopathic approach have contributed to the work of the Centre for Integrative Care in Glasgow, which has also learned from the earlier work of the Glasgow Homoeopathic Hospital. The emergence of integrative principles has in turn helped contribute to the current emphasis in our quality strategy on person centred care, and on enabling partnerships with patients through empathetic consultations.</p>

  <p>My understanding is that NHS Lothian has not taken a final decision about the future of local homoeopathic services. I have made it clear that I fully expect the board to engage with all local stakeholders as it further develops its plans. I have been advised that NHS Lothian is due to embark on a period of public consultation on this issue before it makes any final recommendation on the future of the service.</p>

  <p>I would hope that the board, as part of its consultation, would take account of the information provided in these answers about the value of homoeopathy as an aspect of our approach to integrative care.</p>

  <p>In areas which operate a common housing register there is no longer any duplication across housing lists and this therefore provides a more accurate measure of housing demand within that area.</p>

  <p>However as not all areas currently have a common housing register there is still likely to be an element of double counting when looking at numbers on housing lists for Scotland as a whole.</p>

  <p>In order to maintain accurate and up to date lists, social housing providers are required to regularly review their lists to ensure that they include only those who still require a social house.</p>

  <p>The latest official figures show that there are around 285,300 dwellings owned and managed by local authorities that are considered to be normal letting stock. It is expected that all the households currently occupying these dwellings have either preserved rights, modernised rights or are serving the five year qualifying period leading to modernised right to buy eligibility. The breakdown of data for these categories is currently not held centrally. The Scottish Government is however working with local authorities to explore the possibility of collecting this breakdown and improving the information in this area.</p>

  <p>In addition to local authority tenants, registered social landlords (RSLs) have reported to the Scottish Housing Regulator that, as at 31 March 2010, 150,600 of their 265,400 tenancies qualify for either preserved or modernised right to buy. This figure can be broken down to show that 68,800 have preserved rights and 81,800 have modernised rights. The remainder are either exempt or are serving the qualifying period leading to modernised right to buy eligibility.</p>

  <p>The proportion of council or RSL tenants that have secure tenancies is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government launched a consultation on the future of Scottish policing on 10 February 2011 in order to widen the debate and build consensus about how we can maintain our excellent police service in the face of unprecedented cuts from Westminster. No decisions have been taken and we will continue to engage with all key stakeholders, including police authorities, and the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, as we consider how our police service should respond to the challenges of the 21st century.</p>

  <p>I meet regularly with chief constables and conveners of police boards to discuss a range of matters. I chair the Scottish Policing Board which is attended by chief constables and conveners. In April 2010, the Chief Executive of the Scottish Police Services Authority (SPSA) gave a presentation to the Policing Board which covered the forensics modernisation programme. He also has regular meetings with the Convener of the SPSA.I gave careful consideration to the written submissions received from all eight forces and the two police boards that responded to the SPSA options paper published in July 2010, prior to a decision being made.</p>

  <p>The qualifications in the Scottish-Islamic Foundation&rsquo;s accounts did not highlight any issues in relation to the use of Scottish Government funding. Therefore the qualifications were not sufficient grounds to seek the return of all funding granted by the Scottish Government.</p>

  <p>Students are exempt from paying council tax in Scotland, where they met the following criteria: aged either under or over 20 and are enrolled at a prescribed educational establishment for the purpose of undertaking a specified course of education which they are normally required to attend for at least 24 weeks in each academic year and which requires on average at least 21 hours of study, tuition or work experience in each of those weeks.</p>

  <p>Further guidance on how council tax applies to students in Scotland can be found at the following web address: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library3/localgov/ctst-00.asp" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library3/localgov/ctst-00.asp</a>.</p>
