  <p>The Scottish Government does not provide any funding, emergency or otherwise, to women asylum seekers, fleeing domestic abuse, who have no recourse to public funds, as immigration and benefit issues are reserved to Westminster. This is a matter which I have raised with Home Office ministers, most recently with Vernon Coaker MP, in June this year.</p>

  <p>The Home Office has now announced plans to introduce a new scheme which will bring about four significant changes to the system for women on spousal visas who have experienced domestic abuse and have no recourse to public funds. These changes are:</p>

  <p>that victims may be eligible to receive a contribution to housing costs;</p>

  <p>applications for indefinite leave will be processed by the UK Border Agency in 20 working days;</p>

  <p>guidance will be produced to support organisations, and</p>

  <p>the &pound;750 application fee will be waived under the destitution rule.</p>

  <p>The Home Office met with government officials from across the UK on 13 August 2008 to discuss no recourse to public funds for women experiencing domestic abuse and who are on a spousal visa. At the meeting, an agreed way forward was suggested for implementation in these four areas and it is hoped that these changes will be in place by autumn this year.</p>

  <p>Scottish Government officials are currently considering how best to take this forward in Scotland and how to address this issue in the violence against women framework that is being developed. A short life working group has been established by the Violence Against Women team in the Equality Unit to examine possible options, with Scottish Women&rsquo;s Aid, COSLA, Shakti Women&rsquo;s Aid and Hemat Gryffe Women&rsquo;s Aid among the members. The Scottish Government will also be liaising with the COSLA Strategic Migration Partnership (CSMP) on how to progress work on this issue. The CSMP are currently preparing guidance for Scottish local authorities.</p>

  <p>The Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing announced on 22 May that she was prioritising the new applications of the central heating programme (CHP) with immediate effect to give priority to the fuel poor and allow headroom for reform of the Programme. This decision was supported by Lindsay Scott of Help the Aged who said &quot;the universal scheme was unsustainable. With rising energy costs it is more important than ever that it is targeted at those who are in fuel poverty.&quot;</p>

  <p>Households currently having their applications processed under the priority arrangements announced by the Cabinet Secretary are:</p>

  <p>those over 60 who have no central heating system;</p>

  <p>those aged 60 to 79 with a systems that has broken down, who are in receipt of the guaranteed element of Pension Credit, and</p>

  <p>over 80s with a systems that has broken down.</p>

  <p>The actual and average number of applications to the programme from January 2007 until August 2008 are shown in the following table.</p>

  <p>1. The expenditure for 2007-08 is an estimate as the accruals process has still to be finalised.</p>

  <p>2. The original budget allocation for the central heating programme in 2007-08 was &pound;40.6 million. Around &pound;8 million in additional resources was provided to meet the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing&rsquo;s &quot;Winter Waiting Time Initiative&quot; and install the highest number of systems ever installed in the private sector in any one year.</p>

  <p>In the public sector the programme ended for local authorities in March 2004 and, therefore, no installations were undertaken by local authorities in 2004-05. The information covering 2003-04 is shown in the following table.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is planning on the basis that the Public Services Reform Bill will be introduced to the Parliament in early 2009, and will complete its parliamentary passage towards the end of 2009. It will be for the Parliament to determine the timing of the parliamentary stages but, on the assumption that the bill will receive Royal Assent by the end of 2009, we expect to be in a position to commence the provisions of the bill from February 2010 onwards.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government liaises regularly on the Acceptance in Lieu scheme with the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council, the UK Government&rsquo;s advisers on museum and gallery matters, which acts on behalf of the Department of Culture, Media and Sport. The Acceptance in Lieu scheme enables an estate to satisfy more inheritance tax than by selling items on the open market, and at the same time allows the nation to acquire important works of art.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government may also discuss private treaty sales with the Department of Culture, Media and Sport. These enable items which have been granted conditional exemption from inheritance tax to be purchased by a public museum or gallery in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland at a price which is beneficial to both public purchaser and private vendor.</p>

  <p>Decisions on the works of art that are to be loaned and displayed on view in the National Galleries of Scotland are an operational matter for the National Galleries. There are hundreds of loans in operation at any one time, and it is for the National Galleries to determine what artworks it wishes to take on loan and to negotiate with the owners.</p>

  <p>Decisions on whether to extend a loan or to purchase an object are also entirely a matter for the National Galleries. Scottish ministers have no locus to direct the National Galleries in these matters.</p>

  <p>We have made it clear that we see the OECD report as a seminal document for Scottish education. In the debate on the review in Parliament on 16 January this year I said that the report will continue to be a catalyst for change as it challenges all of us, including this government, about educational thinking.</p>

  <p>The report does not in fact state that the largest educational attainment gap in Scotland exists at P4 and P5. The report discusses the need to reduce the achievement gap that the authors state opens up about P5 and continues to widen during junior secondary school.</p>

  <p>In my day of discussion with the OECD Education Policy Committee they agreed that this government&rsquo;s attention to and focus on the early years and early intervention in nursery and P1 to P3 will help build better foundations and resilience to prevent that gap from opening in the first place.</p>

  <p>The Fire (Scotland) Act 2005 enabled a new safety regime to be introduced for all premises in Scotland, with the exception of private dwellings, based upon risk assessment and fire prevention and mitigation measures. The regime was also designed to be better understood and administered by businesses and relevant enforcement agencies. The new fire safety regime was implemented by the Fire Safety (Scotland) Regulations 2006 which came into force in October 2006. As in normal practice, the Fire Safety (Scotland) Regulations 2006 were informed by a regulatory impact assessment which assessed the cost and benefits of different implementation options on the various sectors affected, including the small businesses such as bead and breakfast establishments. Regulatory impact assessment 2003/56 is available at:</p>

  <p>The Fire (Scotland) Act 2005 came into force in April 2005. Supporting regulations for part 3 of the act, The Fire Safety (Scotland) Regulations 2006, came into force in October 2006 and guidance has been developed and issued progressively culminating with the publication of <em>Practical Fire safety Guidance for Healthcare Premises</em> in January 2008. As this is new legislation which is currently bedding in, no review of the Act has been undertaken and we have no plans to commission one at this time. However, under section 40 of the act, Scottish ministers are required to prepare a Fire and Rescue Framework for Scotland and keep the document under review. In my answer to S3W-7926 on 18 December 2007, I confirmed that we are working with the fire and rescue authorities and the unions to review the existing framework. This work is progressing well and will in due course set out agreed priorities and objectives for fire and rescue authorities in a manner consistent with the government&rsquo;s new partnership with local government.</p>

  <p>For years 2006-07 and 2007-08, the 48 hour access requirements were laid down in the specifications of a Directed Enhanced Service (DES) for NHS boards as part of the nationally negotiated GP contract arrangements. The requirements of the DES were monitored by all health boards on a quarterly basis which required practices to formally declare that they met the requirements of the DES.</p>

  <p>In addition to monitoring the requirements of the DES, health boards can deploy a variety of methods to support the monitoring process such as local GP contract reviews, Quality and Outcome Framework Review visits which often include a review of practices ability to meet the 48 hour access requirements, and the pre-payment verification process.</p>

  <p>Where there is evidence indicating that a practice had not met the requirements of the DES, the health board should visit the practice to offer support and guidance to re-establish appropriate 48 hour access for patients.</p>

  <p>From 1 April 2008, measurement and reward for delivery of 48 hour access will be based on a new annual GP Access Survey. Crucially this will mean that future payment to practices will be determined by patient views, rather than the previous self-reporting arrangements.</p>

  <p>The projected increase in total Scottish housing debt is not an entirely new development. In 2007-08 and 2008-09 total housing debt in Scotland was reduced due to the exclusion of debt within Argyll and Bute, Eilean Siar and Inverclyde. Had the debt from these local authorities not been written off there would have been year on year increases in total Scottish housing debt in each of the last two financial years, 2007-08 and 2008-09.</p>

  <p>The Local Authority Housing Income and Expenditure statistics publication is based on information provided to the Scottish Government by local authorities. The information given for March 2009 is the position which Local authorities expect to reach based on their 2008-09 plans. From this expected expenditure it is estimated that the overall level of housing debt in local authority areas in Scotland will increase by &pound;92.9 million to &pound;1,934.9 million. This would be the first increase in overall housing debt for over a decade.</p>

  <p>Closer inspection of the projected debt also shows that the largest expected increase totalling &pound;85.9 million are in four council areas - Midlothian, Aberdeen, East Lothian and Edinburgh. In the case of Aberdeen, Midlothian and East Lothian, the councils have recently built council housing, are building council housing or have plans to build new council housing in the coming year on the strength of low levels of housing debt. This is in line with Scottish Government policy to encourage new council house building where councils have both a proven excess housing demand and prudential borrowing capacity.</p>

  <p>The individual level of housing debt in a local authority is a matter for the local authority itself, operating within the prudential borrowing regime. Local authorities will plan their borrowings on the basis of the need to spend to improve or add to their housing stock set against their ability to service any additional debt incurred using their expected stream of net rentals or to fund such expenditure from capital receipts.</p>

  <p>Yes the Scottish Government can confirm that, based on figures provided by the local authority, it is estimated that the housing debt in Edinburgh City Council will be &pound;14,517 per house in March 2009.</p>

  <p>In Control is an organisation, independent of central government, which some local authorities are funding to promote personalised support for adults, including those with a learning disability. It is, therefore, not for central government to recommend but for local authorities to decide whether the product is something which helps them to meet the needs of those they serve. The Scottish Government has reissued national guidance on self-directed support which In Control has adopted in part.</p>
