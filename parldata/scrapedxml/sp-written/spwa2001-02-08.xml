  <p>The Scottish Executive is today launching an inclusive consultation process which will last until 30 June and lead to the production by the end of this year of a comprehensive plan for action on alcohol misuse. This will emphasise the partnership nature of policy development on alcohol misuse and help us to shape a shared action plan to provide a framework for action at national and local level. A copy of the consultation document is available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. no. 11112).</p>

  <p>As to the national service network for autistic spectrum disorders, I refer the member to the answer I gave to question S1O-2810 on 18 January ( <i>Official</i> <i>Report,</i> Vol.10, Col. 420).</p>

  <p>The procurement process for the Scottish Centre for Learning Disabilities leading to the award of grant is well under way but many of the areas relating to the location, staffing and operational aspects of the new centre are still uncertain and subject to clarification and negotiation with applicants. Due to confidentiality constraints, further details cannot be made public at this stage. The Executive expects to award the grant soon for commencement on 1 April 2001.</p>

  <p>The non-housing programme capital allocation to local authorities provides resources for various capital work projects, including flood prevention schemes.</p>

  <p>In addition, subject to completing the statutory process under the Flood Prevention (Scotland) Act 1961, supplementary allocation may be available for the construction of major flood prevention schemes (FPS). Recently, flood prevention schemes have been confirmed for Bridge of Earn, Moredun, Paisley, River Kelvin, Collier Street, Johnston and Weem Village.</p>

  <p>Following requests by councils, supplementary allocations have been provided recently to:</p>

  <p>Perth and Kinross Council for Bridge of Earn FPS (&#163;0.75 million);</p>

  <p>Renfrewshire Council for Moredun, Paisley FPS (&#163;1 million), and</p>

  <p>The single allocation which local authorities receive in support of their non-housing capital programme includes provision for, among other things, expenditure on flood prevention. Separately, following flooding in recent years, resources for this programme have been enhanced to cater for major flood prevention schemes. In response to requests from councils who had experienced severe flooding in their areas, additional funding was issued to councils to support the development of flood prevention measures as shown in the table:</p>

  <p>On matters of food safety the Scottish Executive is advised by the Food Standards Agency. After close examination of current research, the agency advises that levels of dioxins in farmed salmon are unlikely to harm human health, where salmon is consumed as part of a healthy, balanced diet. The independent expert Committee on Toxicity (COT) is currently conducting a review of dioxins, at the request of the Food Standards Agency, in order to establish guidance on safe tolerable exposure levels to these chemicals. The agency has asked the COT to consider any new evidence which becomes available as part of its review.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is determined to improve access to primary care services. Section 4 of <i>Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change</i> sets out our commitment to ensure that patients in every part of Scotland can get access to an appropriate member of the primary care team in no more than 48 hours.</p>

  <p>The development of Personal Medical Services (PMS) will allow Trusts and primary care teams to agree local contracts to meet the specific needs of the local population and deliver clear improvements in quality. PMS will also enable PCTs to employ salaried GPs to fill gaps in current service provision and enhance existing services, particularly in deprived and remote and rural areas.</p>

  <p>The development of NHS 24, which will provide the public of Scotland with 24-hour access to advice and information, will ensure that patients are provided with direct access to the appropriate health or care service in one phone call. NHS 24 will build links with GPs and their out-of-hours services, as well as other NHS services, to ensure that a fully integrated system is put in place.</p>

  <p>Section 8 of the <i>Scottish Health Plan</i> also gives details of our intention to ensure a greater focus on quality by simplifying and streamlining the current GP contract.</p>

  <p>The Executive received a funding consequential of &#163;3.5 million as a result of money being allocated in England for the support of pilots of Government General Practitioners (GGPs) and Internet Learning &amp; Access Points (ILAPs). All funding consequentials contribute to a block allocation to the Executive which was part of the Strategic Spending Review. The outcome of this process was that specific funding was not allocated for support of the Post Office network in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Executive, whilst recognising the importance of the Post Office in providing services across Scotland, particularly in remoter rural areas and deprived urban areas, took a different approach to that adopted in England and one of the successful bids for funding from the Modernising Government Fund, announced by the Minister for Finance and Local Government on 18 December, was the Digital Highland project which includes piloting ways of delivering services through the Post Office network in the Highlands, including GGP and ILAP elements.</p>

  <p>The aim of the study, which involved two million individuals, was to identify over the period 1982 to 1996 serious adverse events causally related to MMR vaccination. One conclusion of the study was that &quot;No cases of autism were associated with MMR vaccination during this 14-year follow-up.&quot; Preliminary impressions are that this is a scientifically rigorous piece of work.</p>

  <p>Disciplinary action is a matter for the NHS employer. However, all NHSScotland employers are required to adopt the values and principles of the <i>Dignity at Work: Eliminating Bullying and Harassment in the Workforce</i> guidance, which I launched last month at the Scottish Partnership Conference. The guidance applies to all NHSScotland staff and has been developed through the Scottish Partnership Forum, which represents all NHSScotland staff groups. The performance of NHSScotland in complying with this guidance will be assessed through the new Staff Governance Standard announced in <i>Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change</i> .</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive Health Department has not set any efficiency target for the National Health Service in Scotland. Health boards may set targets for their local Trusts and any adverse effects would be for local management to consider and address.</p>

  <p>However, <i>Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change</i>, published on 14 December, sets out a range of measures that will be taken to simplify the funding system to ensure resources are managed in as an efficient and effective way as possible.

  <p>There are no plans to revise existing policies. Structure plans are only expected to show broad search areas where opencasting may be acceptable.

  <p>The Scottish Executive reviews on a continuous basis the environmental performance of its buildings with a view to making improvements where possible. The Executive is currently reviewing its Statement, made in 1998, which sets out environmental objectives for the management of our buildings. Since 1999 we have introduced a range of environmental management improvements.</p>

  <p>The contract with Tactica Solutions is for the provision of a managed service for the design, print and publication of documents. The Scottish Executive does not have the resources or skills required to manage the sub-contractors. Tactica Solutions was awarded the business following open competition and its profit margins are an internal company matter.</p>

  <p>The contract between Tactica Solutions and the Scottish Executive requires Tactica to provide a complete service. It is the responsibility of Tactica to determine the role of its sub-contractors to meet the variations in both the nature and volume of demands placed by the Scottish Executive. Accordingly, the information requested is not held by the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive expects all Social Inclusion Partnerships to allocate funds in accordance with the terms and conditions of grant. These are currently being revised. Once the revisions are complete a copy will be placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre. Other than the requirement to comply with the terms and conditions of grant, it is for partnerships to decide how to allocate resources from the Social Inclusion Partnership Fund, including those arising as a result of slippage on other projects.</p>

  <p>The early intervention funding is specifically for the development and training of staff working with pupils with special educational needs in the early years. Local authorities receive a pro-rata share of the &#163;1 million based on pupil numbers.</p>

  <p>A wide variety of training requirements is addressed including training in early years behaviour difficulties; training for nursery support staff; ICT for special schools; attendance at early years language seminars; target setting and Individualised Educational Programme courses; training in working with families of autistic children, and accreditation such as the Certificate in Dyslexia.</p>

  <p>Companies are supported by a very wide variety of programmes from the Scottish Executive, the Scottish Enterprise Networks and other public sector bodies. Scottish Enterprise Borders received an additional &#163;2.3 million in the current year to help meet the challenges the area is facing, the third year of increased funding. The LEC estimates that this has helped it to provide some &#163;700,000 to textile companies in the Borders since 6 June 2000. In addition, a Faraday award of &#163;1.2 million has been awarded by the DTI to the Technitex project, a collaborative project across the UK led by Heriot Watt at Galashiels. The total value of support is dependent on the extent to which companies and other bodies involved in the industry come forward with eligible projects and proposals.</p>

  <p>The National War Museum of Scotland which was recently opened at Edinburgh Castle is a tribute to all soldiers who sacrificed their lives during the conflict of all wars.

  <p>The EC Water Framework Directive (2000/060/EC) came into force on the 22 December 2000. The Directive has a wide scope and requires fundamental changes in the way we manage our natural water resources in Scotland. For that reason we propose to transpose its provisions into law by means of primary legislation in this Parliament. As with all legislative commitments this will be subject to finding space in the legislative timetable. We hope to introduce the Bill in 2002.</p>

  <p>We intend to take an open approach to the implementation of the Directive with thorough consultation at every stage. As a first step, I have published a leaflet today that outlines the main provisions of the Directive and invites comments from anyone with an interest. The next stage will be a comprehensive consultation paper that will issue later this year.</p>

  <p>In the case of premises such as charity shops, offices and depots whose relief from water charges began to be phased out from 1 April 2000, the impact of increased charges and withdrawal is set out in the following table:</p>

  <p>The charges are being phased out over five years, and the costs above represent the impact of the first stage of withdrawal, which is 20% of total reliefs for the organisations concerned.</p>
