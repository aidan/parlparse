  <p>Employment Policy is reserved to the UK Government which, therefore takes the lead on the funding and delivery of the New Deal throughout Great Britain, although in close consultation with its partners, including the Scottish Executive. Many partner organisations at local level also provide New Deal Services under contract or provide funds and other resources, including training funds to enhance the quality of New Deal in their areas.</p>

  <p>A Scottish survey of individuals entering New Deal is being carried out to boost the sample of a GB wide survey and enable fuller analysis at a Scottish level.</p>

  <p>The results of the first stage of the Scottish quantitative survey will be available early next year. This will give information on individual characteristics, previous work history and New Deal experience: what clients have done in New Deal, their feelings about New Deal and their destinations after New Deal.</p>

  <p>The GB survey is now proceeding to the second Stage. This will consist of follow up interviews to explore experience of New Deal, labour market outcomes, job search, attitudes, and changes in employability.</p>

  <p>A decision will be made as to whether the Scottish survey will proceed to stage two depending on the outcome of the first stage work.</p>

  <p>Adjustments are already made to the distribution of Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE) allowances for a number of council services to acknowledge the additional costs of serving rural and remote communities. These adjustments were the subject of an extensive review last year, which confirmed these additional costs and recommended a number of alternative adjustments to improve the distribution. We have agreed with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities that these changes should be implemented from next year.</p>

  <p>The distribution of the GAE allowances between councils is kept under annual review through regular consultation between the Scottish Executive and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities.</p>

  <p>Holding replies have been issued on 956 occasions, which represents 42% of 2,271 written questions tabled to date.</p>

  <p>The A71 is a local rather than a trunk road and as such any development plans are entirely a matter for the local authorities concerned. <br /></p>
