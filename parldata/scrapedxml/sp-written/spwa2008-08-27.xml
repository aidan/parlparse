  <p>The funding for hospital and community health services and GP prescribing is determined by the Arbuthnott formula. This formula is designed to take account of any unavoidable excess costs of supplying services to a board&rsquo;s population, including the Distant Islands Allowance. Under Arbuthnott and the revised NHSScotland Resource Allocation Committee formula, the island NHS boards receive higher cost adjustments than any of the mainland boards, reflecting their unique position and costs pressures.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how funding is calculated for island NHS boards and what additional costs are envisaged in (a) 2008-09, (b) 2009-10 and (c) 2010-11.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-08-27.S3W-15344.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80396" speakername="Nicola Sturgeon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa0827.htm#3">

  <p>The funding for hospital and community health services and GP prescribing is allocated to the 14 mainland and island NHS Boards via the Arbuthnott formula. The formula determines the share of funding received by each board based on the relative need for health care services of their population, adjusted for the unavoidable excess costs of supplying services to them.</p>

  <p>For hospital services, the Arbuthnott formula includes an adjustment based on the relationship between the costs of delivering services and an indictor of remoteness. The costs are based on the ratio between a board&rsquo;s actual expenditure and what their expected expenditure would be if they delivered services at the national average cost. The remoteness indicator is based on the number of road kilometres per 1,000 people. For community health services, the adjustment is based on a combination of a model that simulates travel times and costs in different geographical areas and the costs of providing services in remote general practices. Due to their relatively small size, the island boards receive a uniform remoteness adjustment.</p>

  <p>The Arbuthnott formula has recently been reviewed by the NHSScotland Resource Allocation Committee (NRAC) and their revised formula will operate from 2009-10. The revised excess costs adjustment for hospital services takes account of the difference between delivering a given service at national average costs and the actual local cost. NRAC took account of concerns raised by rural NHS boards by including two separate categories for island towns and island rural areas in their costs adjustment. This will help to ensure that the particular issues related to delivering services on islands are fully recognised. The island categories receive the highest cost adjustment of any category of residence used in the proposed formula. The community services adjustment was updated to reflect up to date data.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that these figures show numbers of children attending pre-school centres with a GTCS registered teacher, not simply numbers of children who receive education from a teacher.
