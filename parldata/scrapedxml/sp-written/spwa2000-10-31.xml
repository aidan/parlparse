  <p>Based on the assessed needs of their resident populations, and the services required to meet those needs, it is a matter for health boards and NHS Trusts to put in place appropriate arrangements to ensure delivery of the best care possible for patients.</p>

  <p>It is expected that the UK review of the scheme will be completed by June 2001. The review involves a series of discussion groups with delegates from a wide range of national and local organisations and disabled people. The findings from all the discussions - those in Scotland took place on 23, 24 and 26 October - will form the basis of a consultation document which will be widely circulated. Responses to this will form the basis for recommendations on the future shape of the scheme.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to setting national maximum waiting times in the three national clinical priorities of cancer, heart disease and mental health. The Mental Health and Well Being Support Group is currently working closely with the Health Service in Scotland on the development of waiting times targets for mental health. These will embrace eating disorders.</p>

  <p>The targets will be included in the Scottish Health Plan, which will be published later this year.</p>
