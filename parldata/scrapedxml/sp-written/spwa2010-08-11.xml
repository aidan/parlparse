  <p>SNH has advised that the part of the site which was denotified in 2009 did not contribute to the special interest for which the site had been notified. There was therefore no justification for seeking to compensate for the effect of the denotification.</p>

  <p>SNH and Transport Scotland have considered the options for compensatory measures to balance the loss which would be represented by the use of part of the site for the B981 realignment proposed in connection with the new Forth Crossing. The extent of the land on the St Margaret&rsquo;s Marsh SSSI which would be lost as a result of this scheme comprises 0.7ha of reedbed (a notified SSSI feature) and 3.1ha of rough grassland and scrub (which is not a notified feature of the SSSI); the reduction of notified habitat therefore represents a small proportion of the total area of the site contributing to the special interest for which it was notified. The saltmarsh habitat (which is the most ecologically significant component of the SSSI) would not be affected.</p>

  <p>Compensatory measures would normally constitute either the provision of new habitat elsewhere or improved management of the existing habitats on the SSSI. SNH has assessed the current condition of both the reedbed and saltmarsh habitats as being &quot;unfavourable&quot;, mainly as a result of restricted ingress of seawater to the site coupled with suspected nutrient enrichment. The preferred option, representing the best approach to sustaining the long term functionality of the notified habitats, is therefore for compensatory measures to take the form of a management plan for the SSSI.</p>

  <p>The <em>National Forest Estate Strategic Plan </em> (published in 2009) states that the area of broadleaves on the national forest estate will be increased from the current level of 8% to around 20% of woodland cover. While this will mean a reduction in the relative area of productive conifer crop, improved planting stock and silviculture will be used to maximise production of quality timber. It is expected that private owners&rsquo; decisions on species choice will, within the overall context of sustainable forest management principles, reflect their individual management objectives. Production forecasts will continue to be published to assist the wood processing industries in making investment decisions based on reliable information about future timber supplies. The next conifer production forecast is due for publication towards the end of 2011.</p>

  <p>We recognise the importance of sustaining a predictable and stable supply of good quality timber to encourage continued investment in Scotland&rsquo;s timber processing industries. To help achieve this, the Scotland Rural Development Programme offers grants for productive conifers; these grants encourage the use of genetically improved planting material. In addition, Forestry Commission Scotland is currently developing a pilot scheme to lease land from farmers for creating new productive woodlands.</p>

  <p>We continue to improve the Rural Priorities payments process and our aim is to pay the vast majority of the 2010 annual recurrent claims by the end of March 2011. This is in line with the payments target for the long-established Less Favoured Area Support Scheme, which is another element of the SRDP.</p>

  <p>It is the responsibility of local authorities, through their development plans, to specify locations for residual waste treatment facilities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s role is limited to the approval of strategic development plans, taking decisions on planning applications being appealed and determining planning applications called in by Scottish ministers.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) has responsibility for ensuring that waste treatment facilities comply with all relevant environmental legislation. Permits issued by SEPA list the conditions under which the facilities must operate, including the categories and quantities of waste permitted to be incinerated, emission limits for a range of air pollutants, combustion temperatures and sampling arrangements. SEPA checks compliance with permits through planned programmes of inspections and by reviewing the monitoring and other data submitted by operators. SEPA will take appropriate enforcement action against any breach of permit conditions.</p>

  <p>Residual waste treated in energy from waste facilities must comply with the strict emission limit values set out in the EU Waste Incineration Directive, designed to protect human health and the environment. The Directive specifies air emission limits for a range of pollutants, including particulates. While the Directive does not prescribe emission limit values for specific particulate sizes, it does prescribe the total particulate releases that are permitted. These are:</p>

  <p>- daily average values not to exceed 10 milligrams per cubic metre, and</p>

  <p>- half-hourly average values not to exceed 30 milligrams per cubic metre or 97% of the half-hourly average values over a year not to exceed 10 milligrams per cubic metre.</p>

  <p>Operators have responsibility for monitoring particulate levels from residual waste treatment facilities, in compliance with the conditions set out in permits issued by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA). Particulate emissions are measured on a continuous basis. SEPA examines this data and periodically audits operators&rsquo; sampling and monitoring procedures to ensure they comply with all permit conditions. This includes unannounced visits or &quot;spot checks&quot; at facilities and independent testing of emissions.</p>
