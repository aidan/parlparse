  <p>Research into the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee (DTP) is on-going and the Scottish Executive is working closely with the Department of Transport to define and take forward these areas of research. Meanwhile, the Scottish Executive has already introduced legislation under section 73 of the Transport (Scotland) Act 2001 to give power to police, traffic wardens and parking attendants to inspect blue badges. This will be brought into force early in 2004 following the issue of guidance to local authorities and blue badge holders.</p>

  <p>The industrial sites included in the pollution emissions register recently published by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) are already tightly regulated by SEPA. All sites are regulated under the Pollution Prevention and Control (Scotland) Regulations 2000 and the requirements of that regime mean that installations will have demonstrated, or will need to demonstrate, that they are using the best available techniques to prevent or minimise pollution.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive will encourage SEPA to develop the pollution emission register as quickly as practicable and in particular to improve the online search facilities and expand the scope of the information included. Improving public access to environmental information will highlight the progress of measures being taken to reduce industrial pollution in Scotland. The answer given to question S1W-33969 on 13 February 2003 sets out how SEPA plans to develop its online register. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&#146;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="/webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a>.</p>

  <p>The level of grant available in Scotland for short-rotation coppice (SRC) in the new Scottish Forestry Grants Scheme (SFGS) is &#163;600 per hectare, but on land set aside as part of the Arable Area Payment Scheme, the SFGS grant is &#163;400 per hectare.</p>

  <p>Within the Arable Area Payment Scheme, payments for set aside land can include the production of SRC. The currently payment levels are &#163;205.80 per hectare for Less Favoured Areas and &#163;223.97 per hectare for Non Less Favoured Areas.</p>

  <p>The Forestry Commission grant level for SRC in England is identical to Scotland. However, in England there is also a scheme called the Energy Crop Scheme (ECS) which offers &#163;1,600 per hectare for SRC on ex-livestock land and &#163;1,000 per hectare on all other land types. This scheme is operated by the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and is part of the wider England Rural Development Programme.</p>

  <p>Grants for short rotation coppicing are contained within the Scottish Forestry Grants Scheme, which was launched in February 2003 and supports priorities contained in the Scottish Forestry Strategy. The scheme was developed in association with a wide stakeholder group which felt that, while energy crops and wood fuel were potential areas for future development, in view of the many competing priorities for the forestry grant budget, the short rotation coppice grant rates should not increase.</p>

  <p>Payments for set aside land, which can include production of short rotation coppice, are also contained within the Arable Area Payment Scheme. There are no changes to the rules covering this scheme this year.</p>

  <p>The Executive's <em>A Framework for Higher Education in Scotland</em> makes clear our commitment to widening access to higher education in Scotland, as part of our broader commitment to promoting lifelong learning. In 2003-04 the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council is allocating over &#163;11 million for a variety of initiatives designed to widen access and &#163;2 million to support the development of links between further and higher education and encourage articulation between the sectors. This is alongside reforms to student support made during the last Parliament, and our plans to roll-out Educational Maintenance Allowances nationwide, to encourage young people from low income backgrounds to stay in education.</p>

  <p>Procurators fiscal make decisions on proceedings on the basis of reports received from the police, which contain a summary of the evidence including the contents of any video evidence. It will not always be practicable to view a video prior to taking a decision to prosecute, although it would be open to the procurator fiscal to do so in the event that the report suggested that it would be useful to do so. In this case the police report contained an accurate description of the contents of the video, although the depute in court accepted pleas without viewing the tape. Procurators fiscal have been reminded that it is best practice to view video evidence before negotiating pleas.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to announce that I am today publishing a white paper setting out wide-ranging proposals for the reform of the High Court of Justiciary. This follows up the review of practices and procedure in the High Court which we asked Lord Bonomy to carry out, and on which he reported to the Executive in December 2002. It represents the next step in our strategy for the systematic modernisation of justice in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Lord Bonomy made a number of very practical suggestions for a more efficient High Court which better serves the interests of justice. He identified the culture of delays and adjournments as particularly unhelpful to victims, witnesses and jurors, and sought to ensure greater certainty about how and when cases would proceed, and greater sensitivity in how they were handled.</p>

  <p>We have consulted extensively on Lord Bonomy's proposals, and the white paper published today draws heavily on them. It will pave the way for a bill to be introduced in the autumn for reform of the High Court. This will be complemented by wider changes to the organisation and support of the High Court to deliver more effective handling of the most serious crime.</p>

  <p>Over the next few days we will circulate copies of the white paper to a wide range of stakeholders in the criminal justice system, including all those who commented on Lord Bonomy&#146;s report.</p>

  <p>SIGN guideline 71 makes clear that NHS trusts are responsible for implementing such guidelines as part of their general clinical governance responsibilities. It also makes clear that SIGN guidelines are not intended to serve as standards of medical care.</p>

  <p>It is therefore for NHS bodies to assess how to apply the components of the guideline, including those relating to DEXA scanning services, to meet the needs of patients in the areas they serve.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what options there are for people opposed to the erection of mobile telephone masts when such masts have received planning permission from the relevant local authority, in particular in the case of residents opposed to the siting of such masts in Commercial Road, Leven.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2003-06-19.S2W-749.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80092" speakername="Mrs Mary Mulligan" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-03/wa0619.htm#19">

  <p>Planning authorities have powers to withdraw planning permission. However, where they themselves have only recently granted the permission, they are unlikely to believe they have grounds for removing it. Residents with continuing concerns may approach the operator to request that the mast be relocated or, where there are grounds to suggest that there were irregularities in the decision to grant permission, it would also be open for them to seek a judicial review.</p>

  <p>At present no mechanism is available for third parties to appeal to the Scottish ministers against a decision on a planning application. However, on 28 March 2003 the Executive launched the white paper <em>Your Place Your Plan</em> containing measures for strengthening and enhancing public involvement in the planning system. In the paper, we announced an intention to issue a consultation paper on the subject of third party rights of appeal against planning decisions. This commitment to consult has been reiterated in our Partnership Agreement. An announcement about the consultation will be made shortly.</p>

  <p>Information about the conditions of assets and the scheduling of repair work is an operational matter for Scottish Water. I have asked Jon Hargreaves, Chief Executive of Scottish Water to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Based on Scottish Water&#146;s assessment of their assets as of June 2002, it is estimated that 62% of the length of the water pipe network is in need of replacement or repair. The 2003 review is currently being carried out and more updated information will be available later this year. Between 2002 and 2006, Scottish Water is replacing in excess of 3,000 kilometres of water mains.</p>

  <p>This is an operational matter for Scottish Water. I have asked Jon Hargreaves, Chief Executive of Scottish Water to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Scottish Water is currently implementing a programme to develop a better understanding of the impact and scale of leakage on the water network, but based on our assessment in June 2002 it is estimated that the leakage rate is about 80,000 million gallons per annum.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether there have been any reports of ill health affecting any police or emergency service personnel using terrestrial trunked radio communications equipment.</p>

  <p>I understand that there is an on-going legal action by three members of Lancashire Constabulary against their Chief Constable over alleged hearing damage caused by "spiking" (a phenomenon where the equipment emits a very loud blast of sound). I am not, however, aware of any other reports where ill health affecting police or emergency service personnel has been correctly linked to the use of terrestrial trunked radio communications equipment.</p>

  <p>Part 1 of the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 establishes rights of responsible access to land and inland water. Those exercising access rights will be required to comply with legislation providing for the protection and conservation of wildlife. In addition, the Scottish Outdoor Access Code will provide guidance on the responsible exercise of access rights in respect of the protection of the natural heritage.</p>

  <p>The code, a draft of which is currently the subject of consultation by Scottish Natural Heritage, requires the approval of ministers and the Parliament.</p>
