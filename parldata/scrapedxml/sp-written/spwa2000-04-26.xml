  <p>Cancer is one of three clinical priorities for the NHS in Scotland.</p>

  <p>A great deal of work is already underway to meet the aims set out in <i>Towards a Healthier Scotland</i> and <i>Designed to Care. </i>This includes targeted health promotion programmes, earlier detection via existing screening programmes and a pilot colorectal cancer screening programme. Real improvements in care, centred on patients&#8217; needs will be brought about by a variety of means, led by the Scottish Cancer Group, including:</p>

  <p>the establishment of managed clinical networks of care underpinned by;</p>

  <p>robust quality assurance/prospective audit systems;</p>

  <p>the development and subsequent assessment of clinical standards for cancer services by the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland;</p>

  <p>new ways of targeting waiting times to speed up diagnosis and treatment.</p>

  <p>On top of the record funding of &pound;5.2 billion in 2000-01 and &pound;5.5 billion in 2001-02 already committed by the Scottish Executive to health in Scotland, as announced in the Scottish Parliament on 30 March, a further &pound;173 million will be added to the Health Budget in 2000-01, with further major increases each year up to 2003-04. &pound;12.5 million has already been committed to fund new linear accelerators for radiotherapy treatment. Approximately &pound;1 billion is provided across the UK to support cancer research. The Scottish Executive funds targeted to research and clinical effectiveness programmes currently amount to &pound;6.2 million. Starting in 2001 for three years, the New Opportunities Fund cancer initiative will provide &pound;17.5 million additional resource for innovative programmes across Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is determined to face the challenges posed by cancer. We have pledged to tackle the root causes of ill health and work over the next 10 years to promote healthier living and reduce mortality from cancer by 20%.</p>

  <p>Specific initiatives designed to address these pledges and the Scottish Executive&#8217;s approach to public health generally are set out in the White Paper, <i>Towards a Healthier Scotland</i>, a copy of which has been placed in SPICe.</p>

  <p>This is a challenging and wide ranging programme including:</p>

  <p>additional investment of &pound;1 million to aid smoking cessation programmes;</p>

  <p>promoting healthier lifestyles and diet including the appointment of a Scottish Diet Co-ordinator;</p>

  <p>establishment of Healthy Living Centres via the New Opportunities Funding initiative (&pound;34.5 million);</p>

  <p><i>The Cancer Challenge</i> &#8211; a pilot programme to test the feasibility of a national screening programme for earlier detection of colorectal cancer;</p>

  <p>a formalised cancer genetics programme for breast, colorectal and ovarian cancer to provide advice and counselling for individuals who may be at increased risk based on their family history.</p>

  <p>The substantial additional investment in public health and health promotion, announced in the Scottish Parliament on 22 March, will further strengthen our efforts to help reduce the incidence of cancer in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Cancer is one of the top clinical priorities for the NHS in Scotland.</p>

  <p>One aspect of this strategic priority is to improve information about cancer and its treatment within the NHS in Scotland. Therefore, since 1 January 1997 the Scottish Cancer Registry has recorded details of all patients registered since that time who receive radiotherapy treatment within six months of diagnosis (see note below), and the mean and median time in weeks between diagnosis and the start of this treatment. These data for 1997 are set out in the table attached.</p>

  <p>These data must be interpreted with caution.</p>

  <p>The date of diagnosis is taken to be the date of first consultation at, or admission to, hospital for the cancer in question.</p>

  <p>No distinction can be made between curative and palliative treatment.</p>

  <p>Assumptions cannot be made about the apparent variations in the interval between the (assumed) date of diagnosis and date of first radiotherapy treatment, as this may reflect a variety of planned treatment decisions and circumstances, including sequencing of different modalities of treatment and the first manifestation of metastatic disease requiring radiotherapy, which can be many weeks after first diagnosis.</p>

  <p>Cancer registration data are collected retrospectively and 1997 is the most recent completed year currently available.</p>

  <p>The reduction of waiting times for cancer investigation and treatment is a high priority within the Scottish Cancer Group&#8217;s work programme.</p>

  <p>Number of cancer patients receiving radiation treatment within six months of diagnosis<sup>1</sup>, the mean and median time (in weeks) between diagnosis and start of this treatment, by health board of residence, 1997<sup>2</sup></p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will publish the number of surgeons and oncologists specialising in lung cancer for each health board.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-04-26.6.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80146" speakername="Susan Deacon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa0426.htm#2759">

  <p>Centrally collected data includes numbers of surgeons and oncologists employed in the NHS in Scotland. Recognised specialist/specialty functions are identified, for example, urological surgery, plastic surgery, ear/nose and throat surgery. Tumour specific interests are not in themselves a separate and distinct specialty and this information is not therefore available.</p>

  <p>Some surgeons do seek to sub-specialise or have a special interest in disease-specific areas but, in general, surgical treatment of lung cancer is undertaken by cardiothoracic and/or general surgeons.</p>

  <p>Similarly, some oncologists may have a special interest in specific tumour types but, in general, provide oncology services for all patients with cancer regardless of tumour type.</p>

  <p>Table 1 attached shows the number of consultants in cardiothoracic surgery and general surgery, by health board and by whole time equivalent (WTE) posts and numbers of staff at 30 September 1999.</p>

  <p>The numbers of consultant clinical and medical oncologists employed at each of the Trusts containing the five specialist cancer centres in Scotland were previously provided in response to question S1W-2232 on 29 November 1999.</p>

  <p>The main alternative means of treating dentally-anxious patients is sedation. The Scottish Council for Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education runs courses on sedation for general dental practitioners. The number of courses provided depends on demand and there are no indications at present that demand exceeds supply. The Scottish Executive is continuing to monitor the situation.</p>

  <p>1. The definition of &quot;new&quot; is (a) the person is attending the particular service for the first time ever or (b) the person has attended before but not within the previous six months.</p>

  <p>2. Provisional data for the first nine months of 1999-2000.</p>

  <p>Information available from Drug Action Teams (DATs) suggest that 32% have specialist services targeted at young people in their areas. In addition, some services are available within mainstream adult services.</p>

  <p>The NHS in Scotland is committed to ensuring that the highest quality of care is provided to all patients. It is important that patients with chronic conditions such as epilepsy, who may be on long-term drug treatment, are regularly reviewed. The frequency of such reviews is a matter for the clinical judgement of the relevant consultant. Existing national clinical guidelines published by Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network in 1997 on <i>The Diagnosis and Management of Epilepsy in Adults</i> are scheduled for review this year.</p>

  <p>Treatment with Rilutek should only be initiated by specialist physicians experienced in the management of motor neurone disease and patients' eligibility for this treatment depends on the clinical judgement of the medical practitioners' concerned.</p>

  <p>It is for each health board to determine its prescribing policy on drugs, including Rilutek, taking into account advice from local drug and therapeutic committees. When the Health Technology Board for Scotland, established on 1 April begins work this summer, health boards will have access to a single focus of advice on the clinical and cost-effectiveness of health technologies, including drugs.</p>

  <p>Neither the Scottish Executive nor the Department of Trade and Industry anticipate any changes to health services as a result of current World Trade Organisation (WTO) discussions, either under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) or under the Government Procurement Agreement (GPA). GATS does not apply to services provided by central or local governments nor to services provided in the exercise of government authority. Similarly, the GPA does not apply to contracts for the procurement of health services. The Scottish Executive has not, therefore, considered it necessary to make any representations to the Department of Trade and Industry on this subject.</p>

  <p>Abuse of vulnerable adults can take a variety of forms, but are generally of a psychiatric or psychological nature, whether in relation to the victim or to the abuser.</p>

  <p>Psychiatry and psychology form a strong element in the training of general practitioners and a significant proportion of them have specific training in psychiatry. However, it is in the nature of general practice that doctors develop expertise in caring for vulnerable adults and other groups with special needs as part of their continuing professional development (CPD). The responsibility lies with individual doctors to seek training in specific areas as dictated by their personal learning needs and by the health needs of their patients. The Scottish Council for Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education (SCPMDE) provides assistance and guidance for CPD via the regional Postgraduate Directors of General Practice Education and each GP receives an annual Postgraduate Education Allowance to support an agreed amount of training.</p>

  <p>*Deaths in Scotland for the years to 1999 were coded to the World Health Organisation's International Classification of Diseases Ninth Revision (ICD9). The Tenth Revision (ICD10) is being used for deaths registered since 1 January 2000.</p>

  <p>For every death, a doctor has to complete a medical certificate of cause-of-death. The &quot;informant&quot; (the person, generally a relative of the deceased, who has the duty of giving information to the local registrar of births, deaths and marriages to enable the death to be formally registered) hands over this medical certificate to the registrar who transcribes the cause-of-death details on to the register entry. Local registrars generally capture register-entry information electronically (now 96%) and send it to the Registrar General in Edinburgh, who compiles Scotland&#8217;s cause-of-death statistics. Cause-of-death figures for 1998 and earlier years are available on the website of the General Register Office for Scotland, http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk. The Registrar General makes an annual report each summer to the Parliament for the preceding calendar year, including cause-of-death information. The Registrar General sent a paper copy of his most recent (1998) Annual Report to each MSP last summer, after it was published on 27 July 1999.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Needs Assessment Programme (SNAP) has established a working group to assess the total needs of people with multiple sclerosis. The group is expected to report in May and their report will include a chapter on epidemiology.</p>

  <p>Only certain patients with a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis are likely to benefit from the use of beta interferon and patients' eligibility for this treatment depends on the clinical judgement of the clinicians concerned. Because of the variable and unpredictable natural history of multiple sclerosis, a register which identified individuals who may benefit from beta interferon treatment would not be feasible.</p>

  <p>A calculation was made in 1989-90 of the costs incurred on an all-Scotland basis for the care of those overseas visitors referred here for specific treatment or who fall ill while here on a visit. A similar calculation was carried out for Scottish residents treated abroad.

  <p>This information is not available in the form requested. Malnutrition can mean both over-nourishment and under-nourishment. The 1995 Scottish Health Survey showed that, while only 6.9% of Scots in the 16-64 age group were classed as underweight, 51.4% were classed as either overweight or obese. A healthy and balanced diet combined with physical activity helps people to maintain appropriate body weight. The Scottish Executive is pursuing a range of initiatives to encourage and support people to make the lifestyle changes necessary to improve health.</p>

  <p>Research on malnutrition in hospitals has been carried out over a number of years. It has had to take account of the complex effect of illness on nutritional status and distinguish between malnutrition caused by lack of nutritious food and that caused by the metabolic response to illness and injury. In the wider context, the Scottish Executive Health Department has issued guidance on core nutritional standards and has asked that they be applied in nursing homes and in all NHS care facilities. The Clinical Resources and Audit Group is at present funding an audit of the nutrition of elderly people and nutritional aspects of their care both in NHS and non-NHS settings. The audit report is expected in the summer.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Diet Action Plan provides the comprehensive framework within which we are tackling Scotland&#8217;s poor diet. Healthy eating initiatives aimed at schoolchildren, older people and the community as a whole are all in place. Working with the Health Education Board for Scotland, we have developed high profile health education campaigns and joint projects.</p>

  <p>We have identified low-income communities &#8211; which, overall, experience the poorest health &#8211; for particular attention. The Scottish Community Diet Project is among the many initiatives aimed at these communities. With the help of Scottish Executive funding of &pound;0.5 million, the project is now beginning to make a major and positive impact on the diet and health of some of the most vulnerable people in our society. It recently received the Derek Cooper award for outstanding work in improving food in Britain.</p>

  <p>It is important to recognise that improvements can only be achieved if we tackle the poor life circumstances that underlie much of Scotland&#8217;s poor dietary and nutritional status. We are committed to doing that.</p>

  <p>Improving the diet and nutritional status of the Scottish population is a key element of the Executive&#8217;s public health strategy. The White Paper, <i>Towards a Healthier Scotland</i> , sets out that strategy, which was endorsed by the Scottish Parliament last September.</p>

  <p>The White Paper identified diet as one of five lifestyle behaviours for priority action and confirmed the continued implementation of the Scottish Diet Action Plan, <i>Eating for Health</i>, as the appropriate way forward to bring about essential dietary improvement. Currently, I am exploring with relevant interests how best to give further impetus to this work.</p>

  <p>There are no guidelines specifically targeted at malnutrition in the community. In 1999, the Scottish Executive Health Department set out an action plan for nursing homes requiring them to assess the nutritional status of residents and provide for dietary needs in line with UK Department of Health Dietary Reference Values.

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to providing opportunities to allow prisoners to take responsibility for their offending behaviour and take steps to reduce the risk of re-offending following release. Under current sentence management arrangements, most prisoners convicted of serious sexual offences spend a large part of their sentences in Peterhead Prison. The Scottish Prison Service has developed a variety of intervention programmes aimed at addressing offending behaviour. It is introducing this month, at Peterhead, STOP 2000, an accredited programme - developed by HM Prison Service in England and Wales - that is designed specifically for sex offenders. The assessment process for STOP 2000 identifies those prisoners in most need and targets those who present the greatest risk of re-offending. It is proposed to introduce the programme at HMP Edinburgh and HMP Barlinnie later this year. <strong> </strong> The adoption of the programme by the Scottish Prison Service will allow a UK-wide approach to be taken to dealing with sex offenders while they are in custody.</p>

  <p>So far as the early release of such prisoners is concerned, a long-term prisoner (that is one sentenced to four years or more) may be granted early release on licence if this is recommended by the Parole Board once he or she has completed one-half of his or her sentence. In it&#8217;s review of a long-term prisoner&#8217;s case, the board&#8217;s function is primarily to assess the risk that the prisoner would present to public safety if released early on parole. In making its assessment, it takes into account a variety of factors including the nature of the offence, the prisoner&#8217;s conduct and response in custody and his or her home circumstances. The board and Scottish Ministers, in those cases in which the latter exercise discretion over release, consider very carefully reports on the steps that a prisoner has taken to address his or her offending behaviour and whether their participation in, and response to, offence-related programmes suggests a reduction in risk.</p>

The bulk of these applications have been dealt with but we have yet to reach a final decision on 71. In addition, we have had a further 26 Regional Selective Assistance applications this year.

  <p>Normally a decision is reached on most RSA applications within 40 working days of receipt and this doesn&#8217;t differ significantly by area. However, given the exceptionally large number of applications received prior to the expiry of the previous Assisted Areas map, the Scottish Executive has been unable to maintain the usual application processing times.</p>

  <p>The Health Technology Board for Scotland will be a single source of evidence-based advice on the clinical and cost-effectiveness of treatments and drugs. It will work closely with the NHS and patient representatives to ensure that effective innovations move quickly into mainstream practice, so ensuring that all the people of Scotland have access to the most effective treatment available.</p>

  <p>I announced to Parliament on 13 April that the Europa Building, in Glasgow&#8217;s Argyle Street, has been chosen as the location for the Scottish UfI&#8217;s headquarters. Scottish UfI Ltd, which expects to recruit around 25 staff in all, is likely to occupy the building from the end of May.</p>

  <p>The Scottish UfI will act as a broker, not a provider of learning. It will stimulate the demand for learning and for providers that will mean rising to the challenge of providing learning where, when and in the format it is needed. The link to the proposed new higher education institution UHI, when it is established, will be the same as with any other higher education institution wishing to supply learning. Scottish UfI Ltd is already actively engaged in building strong partnerships with education and training providers and is collaborating with the University of the Highlands and Islands Project, sharing what works and what does not, where access to more advanced learning opportunities and qualifications is concerned.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not available centrally.</p>

  <p>It is for health boards and NHS Trusts to plan and deliver services which meet the need of their local population. In doing so, they take account of the effectiveness of different healthcare interventions, including laser treatment.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is, of course, taking forward a range of measures to reduce the levels of smoking by people in Scotland. These include health education and promotion activities such as Smokeline, targeted help for groups such as pregnant women and targeted smoking cessation services and nicotine replacement therapy, which is available free of charge to those least able to afford it.</p>

  <p>The Executive does not propose to make such representations.

  <p>Water and sewerage charges, in common with other utility charges, cover the provision of specific services. They are not taxes and it would not be appropriate to treat them as such by introducing rebates for them. I have, however, asked my officials to consider if we can improve on the protection that the current charging arrangements provide for many of those with the least ability to pay. <br /></p>
