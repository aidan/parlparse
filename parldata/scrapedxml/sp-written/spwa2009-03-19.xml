  <p>Together with a wide range of partners from the public, private and third sector, we are building a legacy plan from the 2014 Commonwealth Games - and other major events - which aims to benefit individuals, groups, clubs, communities and organisations across the country.</p>

  <p>We have already published the interim Games Legacy Plan, on 18 December last year. Our next step is to launch the Games Legacy Plan in the summer. With health as the unifying theme, the Plan will set the direction of travel across a range of areas covering health, sport, business, skills and employment, education, culture, volunteering, the environment, and tourism and international profile.</p>

  <p>Under the concordat, local government have undertaken to reduce class sizes as quickly as possible and to deliver year-on-year progress towards meeting the class size target.

  <p>There have been a number of meetings between representatives of the Scottish Government and/or Transport Scotland with the Confederation of Passenger Transport UK over the last 12 Months, where the issue of the reimbursement of concessionary fares would have been discussed. Most of these have been in the context of the on-going review of the Scotland Wide Free Bus Travel Scheme for Older and Disabled People. It would be premature to consider releasing any records from these meetings prior to the conclusion of the review report, as this could be seen to be prejudicial to its outcome.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answers to questions S3W-11032 and S3W-11033 by Michael Russell on 16 April 2008, whether it considers that the Scottish Environment Protection Agency&rsquo;s (SEPA) decision to approve the Aviemore resort hotels master plan without a satisfactory flood risk assessment on 4 December 2007 complied with its requirement to adhere to statutory guidance on sustainable development and ensure that its actions enforced high environmental standards and, if so, what the reasons are for the Scottish Government&rsquo;s position on this matter; which part of the guidance it considers SEPA to have complied with, and in what other instances SEPA or it has supported such an action as sustainable.</p>

  <p>The decision by SEPA to withdraw its objection to the master plan on 4 December 2007 was an operational matter for SEPA. I understand that SEPA is satisfied that the decision was appropriate in the circumstances of the case, and ensured that the environment and human health were adequately protected. SEPA&rsquo;s approach was entirely consistent with section 3 of the statutory guidance given to the agency on sustainable development.</p>

  <p>In Scotland the greatest burden of tuberculosis (TB) is borne by Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS Board with around half of all reported cases, but in any one year individual NHS boards can have marked variation in numbers of TB cases. These local variations in case numbers over short time periods continue to prove a challenge for TB control programmes for NHS boards in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Healthcare Environment Inspectorate will concentrate their activities on NHS acute hospitals. The Care Commission inspects care homes against the relevant legislation and the National Care Standards. There is a statutory requirement on care home providers to &quot;have appropriate procedures for the control of infection and the management of clinical waste&quot;. The commission will expect care homes to demonstrate that they have an appropriate policy on infection control. This may be the Scottish Government&rsquo;s <em>Infection Control in Adult Care Homes</em> published in 2005. The National Care Standards also require that there are systems in place to control the spread of infection.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises that the economic downturn has had a significant impact on housing supply and is taking a range of actions in response.</p>

  <p>As part of that, we are making a record investment of &pound;644 million for affordable housing next financial year to support the approval of at least 6,500 new and improved properties. In our first year of office more public sector houses were started than at any time since 1997 and we will act to make sure this trend continues.</p>

  <p>The European Union published <em>A New Framework Strategy for Multilingualism</em> in November 2005 and an Education Council <em>Resolution on a European Strategy for Multilingualism</em> in November 2008. Both recognise that multilingualism strengthens the life chances of European citizens by building bridges to other people and opening access to other countries and cultures.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is determined to promote a knowledge and understanding about the world and Scotland&rsquo;s place in it among our young people through Curriculum for Excellence. For example, we are encouraging lifelong learning of modern languages as a central part of the new curriculum, including the new Scottish Language Baccalaureate being introduced later this year. And we are also investing record levels of funding in local government so that education authorities can respond appropriately to their own needs and priorities, including providing for pupils for whom English is an additional language. As Scotland moves forward as an increasingly multilingual society we will continue to take account of the European Union&rsquo;s efforts to promote multilingualism through the Open Method of Co-ordination.</p>

  <p>We are encouraging the learning of modern languages in primary and secondary schools through Curriculum for Excellence, which aims to raise the bar of modern languages learning and teaching in Scotland. Draft experiences and outcomes for modern languages were published for engagement and trialling in schools in October 2008 with the final version due to be published in April 2009.</p>

  <p>In addition, the new Scottish Language Baccalaureate will be an important element within the wider Curriculum for Excellence programme to promote modern languages, particularly in secondary schools. The award aims to encourage more of our young people to continue to study language courses through to the later stages of secondary school. This will raise the status of the final years of Secondary school and assist our young people in making the transition from school to higher and further education and employment. The Scottish Government is working with the Scottish Qualifications Authority and the Scottish Centre for Information on Language Teaching and Research on engagement with stakeholders regarding the awards, which will commence in the next school year.</p>

  <p>Additionally, we have just completed the launch of eight Confucius Classroom Hubs, involving 13 local authorities across the country, which are promoting the learning of Chinese language and culture.</p>

  <p>Immersion teaching of modern languages is one amongst many ways of teaching languages. Curriculum for Excellence encourages cross-cutting and interdisciplinary approaches to make learning and teaching more interesting, relevant and engaging. Local authorities and schools can use the various models of immersion and partial immersion teaching of modern languages as part of such approaches, building on areas of current good practice.</p>

  <p>Licensing boards have been made aware of the Adult Entertainment Working Group report. It is for them to choose which of the recommendations to apply in light of local circumstances. Such an approach does not limit what the local licensing board may wish to do and allows a tougher regime to be pursued if this is considered appropriate.</p>

  <p>Later this year, the Government will take the opportunity to remind Licensing Boards of the range of possible conditions when we update the statutory guidance under the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005.</p>

  <p>In line with the Adult Entertainment Working Group recommendation that the Scottish Executive should develop a co-ordinated strategic approach to the issue of gender based exploitation, a cross-government group has been formed to ensure a cohesive approach in addressing gender-based violence both within the government and in our work with the National Group on Violence against Women, local government and other public bodies.</p>

  <p>We are presently in the transition from the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976 regime to the new regime of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005 which comes into force on 1 September 2009. This means any new premises will at present be operating under the 1976 act.</p>

  <p>We do not intend to amend the 2005 act with regards to adult entertainment. It already enables local licensing boards to limit, through their policy statements, the number and location of premises offering adult entertainment after 1 September. It also enables local boards to apply relevant conditions and for anyone to make representations against such a licence application. Once licences are granted, anyone can call for a hearing to review the operation of the licence.</p>

Boards are required by the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005 to establish and maintain a Statement of Licensing Policy, which must be published.

  <p>We do not hold this information, but physical education is an integral part of all school inspections. HM Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) has been gathering data on the two hour target since October 2006 and inspecting physical education in every school it has inspected since session 2008-09. In every inspection, inspectors discuss the school&rsquo;s provision for physical education and sample some learning and teaching. Over time, HMIE will build up insight into actual progress and therefore be in a position to report on this.</p>

  <p>We are currently in the process of agreeing SOAs for 2009-10 with all 32 Community Planning Partnerships (CPPs) but it would not be appropriate at this stage of the process to comment on specific areas of focus within individual agreements for each council.

  <p>We are using the concordat with local government to take forward delivery of Scottish Government policies including the development and delivery of Curriculum for Excellence within which the two hours PE target is embedded.</p>

  <p>I expect the final version of the Curriculum for Excellence experiences and outcomes to be published on 2 April 2009. This will allow time for schools to begin introducing the new curriculum from August this year with full implementation by August 2010.</p>

  <p>Ultimately local authorities are responsible for delivery but there are already examples of local authorities which are making excellent progress. The Scottish Government is working with the Association of Directors of Education Scotland, local authorities and Learning and Teaching Scotland to promote good practice on this and other aspects of the new curriculum.</p>

  <p>Consideration of physical education is an integral part of inspections of all early years establishments, primary and secondary schools. Each inspection of a nursery focuses on children&rsquo;s experiences in physical development and movement. Inspectors discuss the opportunities provided for physical development and movement and observe and evaluate those that take place during the inspection.</p>

  <p>In each inspection of primary and secondary schools, inspectors sample some learning and teaching and discuss with senior staff the quality of learning experiences in physical education and progress towards the two hour target. This evidence is supported by comments and observations during the inspection. Inspectors use all of this evidence to make a professional judgement on the quality of physical education and on progress towards the target.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS), to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>All long-term prisoners are managed through an enhanced version of the SPS Integrated Case Management (ICM) process. ICM is a collaborative, multi-agency approach for managing offenders which is focused on addressing needs in prison and managing identified risks.</p>

  <p>Initially, prisoners are assessed during a Core Screen process to identify needs and risks. An action plan is developed to address as many of these as possible during the period in prison. Outstanding needs and management of risk is included in a Community Integration Plan (CIP).</p>

  <p>The enhanced ICM process includes annual case conferences to review progress and a final pre-release case conference. These are attended by prison staff, prison and community based social work and other relevant community based support service providers. The aim of the pre-release case conference is to ensure appropriate arrangements are in place through the CIP to support the offender&rsquo;s community reintegration and to address any outstanding needs (such as appropriate accommodation, benefits, continuation of treatment) and to ensure effective information sharing with support providers and supervision agencies.</p>

  <p>Paramount is the management of the offender&rsquo;s level of risk. This may include Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) or information exchange to support statutory supervision requirements.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Biomass Heat Scheme does not support projects which would use treated waste wood as this is subject to tighter regulations and is out with the State Aid rules for the Scheme. However, the Scottish Biomass Heat Scheme can support projects using clean wood produced from timber processing activities which has not entered the waste stream. In fact, applications have been received for such projects and these will be considered by the Advisory Panel for the Scottish Biomass Heat Scheme which meets in April.</p>

  <p>Scottish Government has a commitment to monitor the performance of local authorities across Scotland. That is why we have developed single outcome agreements with all 32 local authorities.</p>

  <p>In addition, detailed monitoring of service provision at a local level is the responsibility of each local authority.</p>
