  <p>The consultation for the white paper <em>The Future Development of Air Transport in the UK</em> has been extended to 30 June 2003. Many key stakeholders have yet to formally respond. Officials of the Executive and Department for Transport are currently following up issues raised in the responses that have been received by conducting a series of bilateral meetings.</p>

  <p>I have listened to the representations of the Barra community and its elected representatives. I fully appreciate their concerns that a review completed by 30 September 2003 will not be able to assess fully, and in depth, all issues relating to air transport provision, including its impact on other transport modes. I have decided, therefore, that the contract for the Barra to Glasgow air service should be brought into line with the Scottish Executive&#146;s other supported air services and that the service will be secured until 31 March 2006. The review will be undertaken in conjunction with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar and Highlands and Islands Airports Ltd. There will be a new contract from 1 April 2004 to 31 March 2006 and this will be the subject of a further tendering exercise.</p>

  <p>The UK Government, through the Department for Work and Pensions, is responsible for social security benefits and campaigns to maximise uptake of benefits. Under our Carers Strategy, the Scottish Executive is committed to improving the information available to carers both at national and local level. Later this month we will be launching publicity material to raise carer awareness and to ensure carers can access sources of information and support, including information on financial assistance. At local level, council social work departments and the NHS will be involved in implementing Carer Information Strategies. These strategies will be introduced over the coming months under the Community Care and Health (Scotland) Act 2002 and will seek to ensure that carers are made aware of the wide range of support available to them.</p>

  <p>Combating drug misuse, and associated crime, is a police priority. Over the next three years, funding for the Scottish Police Service will increase significantly, with grant aided expenditure for Grampian Police up by &#163;16.7 million (or 23%) to &#163;89.1 million compared with 2002-03. And funding for the Scottish Drug Enforcement Agency, which has a base in the north east and which works closely with Scottish Police Forces and other UK Law enforcement agencies, has also increased. This has led to significant increases over the past few years in drug seizures. And we have set even tougher national targets for the future.</p>

  <p>The work of law enforcement agencies will be backed by a range of other measures. These include, for example, Drug Treatment and Testing Orders, which aim to reduce acquisitive crimes committed to fund drug misuse as well as the level of drug misuse itself. These orders have been available to courts in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire since December 2001.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#146;s objective for all of Scotland is sustainable improvement in economic performance. <em>A Smart, Successful Scotland </em> sets out strategic direction to the Enterprise Networks and focuses on three key challenges for raising productivity: growing businesses, global connections and learning and skills.</p>

  <p>In following this direction, Scottish Enterprise Borders takes account of local needs and opportunities. Provision of information on programmes and projects is an operational matter for Scottish Enterprise.

  <p>I have today published, for consultation, the draft Invitation to Tender (ITT) which includes the service specification for the Gourock to Dunoon ferry service currently operated by Caledonian MacBrayne. This sets out our proposals for tendering. I have also published an accompanying consultation document <em>Proposals for Tendering Gourock to Dunoon Ferry Services</em> which explains the principles set out in the service specification and seeks views on options.</p>

  <p>As for the draft Invitation to Tender in respect of the main Clyde and Hebrides contract, at the heart of these proposals is the Executive&#146;s commitment to protecting existing levels of fares and service whilst complying with EU rules.</p>

  <p>The service specification is in line with the proposals announced on 29 January which keep open the possibility of a vehicle service. The consultation period will close on 30 May 2003. I hope to see responses from all those with an interest.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, I will be publishing a Prior Information Notice in the <em>Official Journal of the European Commission</em>. This is not part of the formal tendering process but will alert operators to proposals and ensure that they can take part in the consultative process too. I will consider responses to the consultation in making decisions about the final Invitation to Tender.</p>

  <p>I can today announce the publication of the outcome of the second phase of the review of higher education in Scotland: <em>A Framework for Higher Education in Scotland. Higher Education Review: Phase 2</em> . This paper brings together the conclusions of an 18-month programme of wide-ranging consultation and discussion on the future of higher education in Scotland.</p>

  <p>This paper sets out: a framework for the relationships between government and higher education; the Executive's priorities for teaching and learning, research and knowledge transfer, and governance and management over the next decade, and actions to be taken to address these. Its publication follows that of <em>Life Through Learning - Learning Through Life: The Lifelong Learning Strategy for Scotland</em> on 11 February 2003.</p>

  <p>The Executive will work with the funding councils, higher education institutions and others with an interest in higher education to take forward this work.</p>

  <p>Copies of the paper have been placed in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to continuing the existing principle of protecting subsistence levels of income from arrestment. It recognises that there can be practical difficulties in achieving this when benefits are paid direct into a bank account, and it consulted on possible ways to tackle this issue in the consultation document <em>Enforcement of Civil </em> Obligations in Scotland in April 2002. An independent analysis of the responses was published in November 2002. Both these documents are available on the Scottish Executive website at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/consultations/justice/CivOb-00.asp" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/consultations/justice/CivOb-00.asp</a>. and</p>

  <p>Views were divided on the question, and the Executive is now working to find a practical solution. It is intended to come forward with proposals in due course: but decisions on the way forward will be for the future administration following the elections in May 2003.</p>

  <p>The drafting of the Scottish Outdoor Access Code is a matter for Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH). Section 10 of the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 places a duty on Scottish Natural Heritage to draw up the Scottish Outdoor Access Code. We understand that a draft code will be issued for consultation by SNH on 26 March 2003.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has not issued guidance to local authorities in relation to the implementation of new promoted post structures.</p>

  <p>The new promoted post structure is detailed in the agreement <em>A Teaching Profession for the 21st Century</em> which was negotiated on a tripartite basis with representatives from local authorities, teacher organisations and the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>The agreement provides local authorities with the flexibility to determine staffing structures which best suit their local requirements.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2003-03-20.38.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80252" speakername="Mr Jim Wallace" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-03/wa0320.htm#28">

  <p>The Consultation Paper on the proposed Tenements (Scotland) Bill is published today. The bill is based upon the recommendations of the Scottish Law Commission in their 1998 <em>Report on the Law of the Tenement</em> (Scot Law Com No 162). The draft bill included in the paper is an updated version of the commission&#146;s draft bill. It has been revised to take account of the provisions of the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 and the Title Conditions (Scotland) Bill which passed Stage 3 on 26 February.</p>

  <p>I would like to thank the Scottish Law Commission for all their exhaustive and meticulous work in reviewing the current law of tenements and in proposing modernising reforms.</p>

  <p>The bill will modernise and re-state the law of the tenement in modern statutory language. It sets out a framework for the management and maintenance of tenements which should make it easier for owners in a tenement to reach agreement on matters of mutual interest and concern and to ensure that their homes are well maintained.</p>

  <p>Any decision on the introduction of the Tenements Bill will be for the incoming administration after the election.</p>

  <p>Copies of the Consultation Paper will be sent to the relevant Parliamentary Committees and will be available in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre. Further copies will be available from Deirdre Duffy, Scottish Executive Justice Department, 2nd floor West Rear, St Andrews House, Regent Road, Edinburgh, EH1 3DG.</p>

  <p>A 12-week consultation period will follow, with the closing date for responses being Friday, 13 June 2003.</p>

  <p>Despite heightened international tension, Scotland remains a safe destination. There is no need for potential visitors from the rest of the UK or abroad to be concerned about visiting Scotland.</p>

  <p>But VisitScotland has contingency plans, and has formed a joint action group with the tourism industry to look at what additional action should be taken to promote Scottish tourism, should this prove necessary.</p>

  <p>There has been no change to the estimate of cost as last reported to the Finance Committee. Costs are kept under constant review by the Cost Consultant and by Project Management and reports are made on a fortnightly basis to the Holyrood Progress Group (HPG). In addition, reports are made to the SPCB on a monthly basis and to the Finance Committee quarterly. The next report is due to be made to the HPG on 26 March and to the SPCB during April. There is at present no reason for these reports to be made public, in line with practice to date.</p>
