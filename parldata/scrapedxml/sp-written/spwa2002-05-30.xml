  <p>The Executive's <em>Plan for Action on alcohol problems</em> , which was published on 18 January, acknowledges that there are gaps in current alcohol support and treatment services across Scotland. It requires Alcohol Action Teams to assess local needs and develop local strategies by April 2003, ensuring that account is taken of the particular difficulties in providing confidential and accessible services in rural areas. The Executive is developing a framework for alcohol problems services which will assist local areas to assess needs, identify gaps and develop strategies for services accordingly.Text of answer</p>

  <p>The Executive's <em>Plan for Action on alcohol problems</em> which was published on 18 January 2002, sets out that alcohol problems services should be sensitive to the needs of particular groups, including women. The Executive has recently consulted on a framework for alcohol problems support and treatment services and has consulted with groups who have a specific interest in women with alcohol problems.</p>

  <p>The Health Education Board for Scotland, Alcohol Focus Scotland and the National Association of Alcohol Action Teams held a seminar on women and alcohol in April at which I spoke. One outcome from the seminar was a commitment to establishing a women and alcohol network. The network will provide a vehicle for the development and dissemination of good practice in working with women, including the development of gender-sensitive approaches.</p>

  <p>Yes, an offerer has three choices when bequesting works of art in lieu of inheritance tax.</p>

  <p>Firstly, they may make allocation to a specific institution a condition of the offer. This would be binding on the minister at the time of acceptance of the offer.</p>

  <p>Secondly, the offer can be made with a wish that an item go to a specific institution. While indicating where the offerer would like to see the object go this is not binding on the minister and alternative premises may be chosen if a strong case is made.</p>

  <p>Thirdly, an offer may be made without wish or condition. In such a case the minister is free to choose the most suitable location for the object, based on the expert advice of the Acceptance in Lieu of Tax Panel.</p>

  <p>The National Galleries of Scotland has a statutory duty to care for, preserve and add to the objects in their collections and to secure that the objects are exhibited to the public.</p>

  <p>Free entry to the National Galleries ensures that the national collection is accessible to all.</p>

  <p>In addition to the main galleries in Edinburgh, the National Galleries also have out-stations around Scotland &#8211; Duff House in Banff and Paxton House in the Borders &#8211; both of which hold significant works from the national collection.</p>

  <p>Responding to the need to make the national collections more widely accessible and visible to the public, the National Galleries of Scotland are participating in the development of a scheme to increase lending to smaller museums and galleries around Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has commissioned a Review of Initial Teacher Education and this will report later in the year. The review includes consideration of training matters relating to special educational needs, incorporating autistic spectrum disorder.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Executive is developing a new framework for teachers' Continuous Professional Development which will include specific reference to special educational needs and will reflect the presumption of mainstreaming.</p>

  <p>There is already a wide range of training available specifically on autistic spectrum disorder for all staff and the Executive&#8217;s Innovation Grants Programme also supports initiatives on raising awareness of the disorder.</p>

  <p>As the First Minister announced this morning, we will bring forward a draft Nature Conservation Bill by March 2003. That draft bill &#8211; including important measures dealing with wildlife crime - will then be available to be taken forward and introduced by the incoming administration, following next year&#8217;s elections.</p>

  <p>I was appalled by the recent thefts, and by other recent incidents including the apparent poisoning of a sea eagle. Such acts are utterly unacceptable. That is why I am delighted that the Deputy First Minister was also able to announce this morning that we will accelerate our proposals on custodial sentences and a new power of arrest ahead of the main bill.</p>

  <p>These important initiatives, which will significantly strengthen the hand of the police and the courts in dealing with wildlife crime, will be introduced in the form of amendments to the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill.</p>

  <p>Breast cancer in men is relatively rare, occurring most often in individuals with a family history of female breast cancer. Genetic counselling and advice is available through cancer genetics services provided through Regional Genetics Centres. Referral is normally arranged either through an individual&#8217;s general practitioner or specialist consultant responsible for treatment and care following diagnosis.</p>

  <p>Similarly to women with breast or other types of cancer, the support of the multi-disciplinary team involved in their treatment and care is available to men with breast cancer. Counselling services for people with cancer offer advice and support individualised to meet the particular needs of the patients referred to them.</p>

  <p>Sources: incidence data provided by ISD Scotland; mortality data provided by General Register Office Scotland (GROS).</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Breast cancer in males is rare in Scotland with an average of around 15 cases diagnosed per year. Incidence has remained fairly constant over the last 20 years.</p>

  <p>2. The estimates are not broken down to NHS health board level because of the very small numbers. To minimise the risk of any inadvertent breach of confidentiality, it is the policy of ISD to avoid publishing tables with small numbers of cases in any cell which might conceivably be used, along with other information, to identify an individual.</p>

  <p>3. Rates are not presented, again because small numbers of cases are subject to random fluctuation from year to year giving rise to very unstable estimates of risk.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive why staff from its Environment and Rural Affairs Department in Inverurie have not yet met my constituent Mr J Hardie as advised in the letter of 27 February 2002 to me from the Minister for Environment and Rural Development and what actions it will take to address my constituent&#8217;s concerns without any further delay.</p>

  <p>The issues raised concern the deterioration in vegetation cover on environmentally sensitive land but the cause was not immediately obvious. Detailed investigations were, therefore, required. Officials undertook a site visit on 5-6 February and have made other inquiries since then. Their investigations have been completed only recently and a report is being prepared for the responsible Assistant Chief Agricultural Officer. That outcome, and any ensuing action, is a matter between the department and the managers of the land in question. There are issues of confidentiality to consider. Nevertheless, I have asked officials to acknowledge Mr Hardie&#8217;s contribution to this matter and to let him know as much of the outcome as the limits of confidentiality will allow.</p>

  <p>The draft report of an independent study of the method of allocating funds to police forces was submitted late last year to a working group, involving the Executive, COSLA and the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland.

  <p>The Scottish Executive regards action to tackle smoking among young people, including students, as a key priority. A range of smoking prevention and cessation measures targeted at young people is being pursued by NHS boards and the Health Education Board for Scotland (HEBS). HEBS has also been specifically provided with &#163;3.4 million over four years from the Health Improvement Fund to target young people. Activity includes setting up, in association with ASH Scotland, eight pilot smoking cessation schemes for young people. One of the pilots is based in a further education setting.</p>

  <p>To further improve our knowledge of what works in relation to young people, the Scottish Executive's Chief Scientist Office is funding an 18-month research project entitled <em>An Exploration of Smoking Behaviour, Dependence and Attitudes Towards Cessation in the Mid to Late Teens. </em>The study is based at the University of Edinburgh and will begin reporting towards the end of 2002.</p>

  <p>Comprehensive information for each NHS board is not held centrally. Following the launch of <em>Smoking Kills</em> in December 1998, &#163;1 million a year for three years (1999-2000 to 2001-02) was allocated to NHS boards for smoking cessation services and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). This was in addition to the estimated &#163;1 million a year already being spent by boards.</p>

  <p>Smoking cessation has also been identified as a priority for investment from the &#163;26 million Health Improvement Fund (HIF). Information supplied by NHS boards about HIF expenditure indicates that over &#163;750,000 was allocated in 2000-01 to smoking cessation initiatives.</p>

  <p>Figures are not available centrally for the work by NHS Board Health Promotion Departments to reduce the incidence of smoking through the promotion of healthier lifestyles. Initiatives include: taking part in national and local awareness campaigns; smoking cessation support groups, and mobile units which take the message about healthy lifestyles to the communities that will benefit most.</p>

  <p>We are committed to equality for women. The Scottish Executive&#8217;s Equality Strategy sets out how we are delivering on that commitment and improving consultation is fundamental to that strategy. Equality for women is at the heart of the Executive&#8217;s priorities on health, education, transport, crime and jobs. Our consultation exercises play a key role in identifying equality issues and making sure that the voices of women are heard in the policy-making process.</p>
