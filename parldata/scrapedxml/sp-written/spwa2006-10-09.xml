  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what view it would take of instances of pensioners with concessionary travel cards being required to go to the back of bus queues until all paying passengers have boarded.</p>

  <p>Under no circumstances should concessionary travel scheme passengers be discriminated against in relation to fare paying passengers. However, some operators of long distance services operate a pre-booking system, and Cardholders are advised to pre-book their seats wherever this facility exists.</p>

  <p>This Scottish Government is providing substantial funding &ndash; up to &pound;159m this year &ndash; to pay for the Scotland-wide Free Bus Scheme for Older and Disabled People. The reimbursement rate payable to bus operators takes account of both revenue forgone and additional costs which an operator might incur, including costs to provide additional capacity. The rate was agreed with the Confederation of Passenger Transport.</p>

  <p>Over the past year, research has been undertaken to determine how the Arbuthnott Formula could be improved and refined. This research was finalised at the end of May, and the NHSScotland Resource Allocation Committee (NRAC) issued the research reports on its website ( <a href="http://www.nrac.scot.nhs.uk" target="_blank">www.nrac.scot.nhs.uk</a> ) on 3 July 2006, with an overview document summarising the key issues, presenting options and raising questions. Feedback was sought by Friday 29 September 2006. The Committee is currently considering the consultation responses and its further work and will be submitting its recommendations to Ministers in June 2007.</p>

  <p>No decision on the Parliamentary handling of NRAC&rsquo;s recommendations will be made until after the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations have been submitted to Ministers.</p>

  <p>The Inverness Southern Distributor Road is a local road and the responsibility of Highland Council.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no plans at present to review the trunk road network.</p>

  <p>The possibility of investment on the Inverness Southern Distributor Road, as a regionally significant link, is a matter for Highland Council to discuss with HITRANS in the context of the regional transport strategy.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive support HITRANS through a capital allocation of &pound;3.53 million in the current financial year (2006-07).</p>
