  <p>There are no specific provisions under the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000, as amended, in respect of inappropriate prescribing. Rather, the act sets out a framework for regulating intervention in the affairs of adults who lack, or may lack, capacity. In the case of medical treatment, part 5 of the act provides a statutory framework for regulating the actions of registered medical practitioners, and others acting with their authority, in providing medical treatment to adults who lack capacity.</p>

  <p>We will shortly be asking Parliament to approve the draft Census (Scotland) Order which will set out the proposed 2011 census questions. In line with <em>Scotland&rsquo;s Census 2011: A Government Statement</em> , laid before Parliament in December 2008 (Bib. number 47152), we will be recommending that the census asks the same two questions as the last census about an individual&rsquo;s health (health over the last 12 months and long-term illness, health problem or disability which limits daily activities or work). We will also be recommending a new question about whether an individual has a long-term health condition (such as deafness) and a question about the total income of the household (but not individual incomes).</p>

  <p>Information relating to general health provides a good indication of the demand for health services, while also contributing to the monitoring of delivery of health care and the assessment of progress towards better population health. It is also an important variable in analyses of deprivation. The question on long-term health problems or disabilities provides the only measure of disability in small areas and contributes to policy development on improving healthy life expectancy. It also helps allocate resources for the care of elderly people. The new question on health conditions will enable more specific policy and service planning and provision than has been previously been possible in relation not only to health services but also to social justice and housing. It will potentially be used in the development and monitoring of policies for tackling inequality and social exclusion, as well as in analyses of the effect of different conditions on the likelihood of economic activity. It also has potential for use in matching reported conditions with take up of services. Household income information will provide a measure of deprivation and affluence for small geographic areas. This in turn will provide a useful indication of living standards and allow identification of areas of poverty. Such data will inform decisions about resource allocation and service delivery as well as identifying areas in need of investment. Analysis of income data alongside other census information will allow better understanding of the characteristics of people with differing levels of income. It may also provide a more detailed insight into the need for affordable housing, the relationship between disability and poverty, the reasons for differences in financial welfare across Scotland and the links between take up of benefits and social inclusion.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-29731 by Alex Neil on 18 December 2009, what action was taken in 2009 to publicise the Energy Assistance Package and invite applications and how such action varied across local authority areas.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-01-26.S3W-30288.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80370" speakername="Alex Neil" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa0126.htm#6">

  <p>The Energy Savings Trust, which administers the Package, promoted the EAP both at national and local level and provides regular reports on marketing and community liaison activities. These reports do not analyse activity by local authority, but give examples of local organisations contacted.</p>

  <p>Examples are given for the third quarter of 2009 of both national campaigns and the type of work that is undertaken at local level by the Energy Savings Scotland advice centres (ESSacs).</p>

  <p>- A national television campaign ran from 18 September to 11 December, which was targeted at 73.5% of the TV viewing audience. It is estimated that the ad would be seen up to 12 times. This was reinforced with a national direct mailing campaign in October covering 106,000 households assessed as having a high probability of being eligible for stages 3 and 4 of the EAP.</p>

  <p>- Each ESSac made phone calls to households who had previously contacted them for energy savings advice, to invite them to contact the Energy Assistance Package.</p>

  <p>- Community Liaison Officers in the ESSacs undertook many different EAP marketing activities in 2009 including:</p>

  <p>-presentations to stakeholder groups working with our target beneficiaries;</p>

  <p>-exhibition stands at relevant conferences and events;</p>

  <p>-leaflets sent to contacts within key stakeholder organisations, and</p>

  <p>-letters sent to nurseries within schools.</p>

  <p>- They also undertook national liaison activities, including MSP/MP constituency visits, presentations to national stakeholder groups, updates to service delivery partners, briefing with a national carer network to secure training for their information workers and leafleting across their members, and attendance at relevant national conferences where information was issued to delegates and led to further dissemination of information about EAP.</p>

  <p>It is also possible to identify some activities specific to Shetland:</p>

  <p>- A direct mailing was sent in late September to around 900 households in Shetland South Mainland, co-branded with the Shetland Amenity Trust. The letter invited people to complete a Home Energy Check questionnaire and promoted the EAP.</p>

  <p>- On 23 October, an EAP advertisement was included in The Shetland Times&rsquo; four-page feature on Energy Saving Week.</p>

  <p>- The Highlands and Islands Energy Savings Scotland advice centre (ESSac) has a dedicated Outreach Engagement Officer in Shetland. The ESSac has undertaken a range of activities to promote the EAP in Shetland:</p>

  <p>-community advice surgeries;</p>

  <p>-presentations to community councils;</p>

  <p>-posters and leaflets in doctor&rsquo;s surgeries throughout Shetland;</p>

  <p>-discussions with key organisations in the area, including the local authority, insulation and heating system installers, and</p>

  <p>-meetings with organisations that deal with the families with young children and older households (for example, a meeting with the Association of Pre-School Play led to an editorial piece in their Shetland-wide pre-school nursery newsletter).</p>

  <p>The data in the following table are taken from the Scottish Government Court Proceedings Database and are based on individuals with a charge proved for shoplifting. Information about whether or not individuals had a criminal record at the time of prosecution is not held centrally. However, the table shows the number of these individuals who had a previous charge proved in court for any offence, at least once, in the previous 10 years. The previous charge has been identified as having a date of sentence which is earlier than the date of sentence for the latest charge of shoplifting.</p>

  <p>In 2007-08, 5,133 individuals had a charge proved in court for shoplifting. Of the 5,133 individuals convicted for shoplifting in 2007-08, 3,353 individuals (65 per cent) had another charge proved for shoplifting, in the previous 10 years.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Where main offence.</p>

  <p>2. Based on local authority of the index shoplifting offence in 2007-08.</p>

  <p>3. Including the index 2007-08 shoplifting offence.</p>

  <p>This analysis has been completed for the most recent year of data only, by examining the frequency of shoplifting convictions for those convicted of shoplifting in 2007-08. The ability to match data using the personal identifiers available in the dataset diminishes when using the older data, so it is not possible to produce equivalent results for previous years on a consistent basis.</p>

  <p>In addition, the data in the Scottish Government Court Proceedings database are derived from data held on the Criminal History System. Prosecution in court is only one of a range of possible options for dealing with an individual who has been charged with an offence. Other actions include the use of fiscal warnings, diversion to social work, fixed penalty notices and fiscal fines. However, these alternatives to court prosecution are not currently held on the Scottish Government Court Proceedings database and are not included in the data provided.</p>

  <p>Some national trend data are presented in the Scottish Government Reconvictions Statistical Bulletins, though it should be noted that this is a different type of analysis to that described above, based upon reconvictions in the two years following the index shoplifting convictions. This information is summarised in the following table. It has been taken from the reconvictions bulletins published on the Scottish Government website.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to tackling organised crime in all its forms. In order to support business we are providing funds for the Scottish Business Crime Centre, which is a partnership between business, police and government to raise awareness of crime and help business to combat it.</p>

  <p>Their work includes effective anti-shoplifting initiatives such as Retail Radio Links which improves the quality of communications and co-operation between retailers; a production of <em>Targeting Retail in Scotland - A Training Booklet for Staff</em> which is a retail crime prevention booklet, and working closely with Retailers Against Crime (RAC) which circulates information to over 600 stores, including police intelligence offices, throughout the UK.</p>

  <p>The data in the following table are taken from the Scottish Government Court Proceedings Database and are based on individuals with a charge proved for shoplifting. Information about whether or not individuals had a criminal record at the time of prosecution is not held centrally. However, the table shows the number of these individuals who had a previous charge proved in court for any offence, at least once, in the previous 10 years. The previous charge has been identified as having a date of sentence which is earlier than the date of sentence for the latest charge of shoplifting.</p>

  <p>The data in the Scottish Government Court Proceedings database are derived from data held on the Criminal History System. Prosecution in court is only one of a range of possible options for dealing with an individual who has been charged with an offence. Other actions include the use of fiscal warnings, diversion to social work, fixed penalty notices and fiscal fines. However, these alternatives to court prosecution are not currently held on the Scottish Government Court Proceedings database and are not included in the data provided.</p>

  <p>In 2007-08, 5,133 individuals had a charge proved in court for shoplifting.</p>

  <p>Of the 5,133 individuals convicted for shoplifting in 2007-08, 3,353 individuals had another charge proved for shoplifting, in the previous 10 years.</p>

  <p>Of the 5,133 individuals convicted for shoplifting in 2007-08, 4,650 individuals had another charge proved for any offence, in the previous 10 years. The breakdown of their most recent offence is presented in the table below.</p>

  <p>Persons convicted for shoplifting<sup>1</sup> in 2007-08, who had a previous conviction for another offence between 1997-98 and 2007-08, by type of offence of most recent offence (before the index shoplifting offence in 2007-08):</p>

  <p>HDL(2007)21, <em>Strengthening the Role of Managed Clinical Networks</em> , indicates that local MCNs are now expected to seek accreditation from their NHS board, rather than NHS Quality Improvement Scotland, at an appropriate stage in their development. This approach is intended to integrate the MCNs with NHS boards&rsquo; service planning function.</p>

  <p>Prior to the start of the arrangements set out in HDL(2007)21, the diabetes MCNs in NHS Lothian and NHS Tayside had received NHS QIS accreditation.</p>

  <p>The 2008 survey is clear that each NHS board needs to explore what is happening to the 10% of people for whom key diabetes measures were not recorded. In order to explore this, NHS Lothian conducted a follow-up audit of two diabetes clinics and found a variety of reasons for non-recording, including: patients not having diabetes; patients preferring not to attend; patients not realising they had diabetes; incorrect data entries, and patients changing clinics. The Diabetes Survey Group considers that these findings offer some reassurance that, for the most part, the care of this group of patients was not suboptimal.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Diabetes Survey 2009 will include an update on the performance of health services in obtaining and recording key diabetes information when it is published in March this year.</p>

  <p>The GP curriculum includes genetics in primary care, such as recessive single gene disorders e.g. haemochromatosis and haemoglobinopathies (thalassaemia). Doctors who are training to be GPs need to demonstrate their knowledge and skills in this area and show that they are competent to manage the primary contact with patients and deal with unselected problems. GPs are also supported by health boards, post graduate deaneries, NHS Education for Scotland and others to undertake continuing professional development to acquire up-to-date knowledge and skills to address the needs of their patients. Scottish Government Officials have offered to attend the next meeting of the Haemochromatosis Society in Scotland to discuss raising awareness of the condition&rsquo;s symptoms and providing patients with self help advice.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has committed to an evidence based approach to screening and is given expert, independent advice on screening programmes by the UK National Screening Committee (UK NSC). The UK NSC sets out the criteria to assess screening programmes; the introduction of proposed new population screening programmes; the modification and withdrawal of existing programmes, and the quality and management of such programmes.</p>

  <p>The UK NSC currently advises that a national screening programme for Haemochromatosis should not be introduced. However, this advice is currently under review. Consequently at this point we have no plans to introduce a pilot screening programme for haemochromatosis.</p>

  <p>Information is not held centrally on the number of people who have haemochromatosis.</p>

  <p>The Difficult Decisions Short Life Working Group was an NHS Board group and there has been no direct involvement of ministers or Scottish Government policy officials. The remit of the group was to develop a framework that NHS boards can use when making difficult decisions, both in planning at a population level and when making decisions about individual patients.</p>

  <p>Ms Jackie Sansbury, Director of Strategic Planning, NHS Lothian</p>

  <p>Secretariat<strong>:</strong> Dr Graham Mackenzie, Consultant in Public Health, NHS Lothian</p>

  <p>The workplan was to:</p>

  <p>build on discussions and conclusions from the &quot;Difficult Decisions&quot; national workshop (22 February 2008);</p>

  <p>consider the published literature on making difficult decisions in NHS boards;</p>

  <p>survey difficult decision making in planning and for individual patients across NHS boards and regional planning groups in Scotland;</p>

  <p>All health boards have indicated that vaccination has been offered to all those in the initial priority groups and a mop up exercise will continue to take place to the end of January, to ensure that everyone in the initial priority groups has been invited for vaccination and has the opportunity to accept that offer.</p>

  <p>Whilst we know that people have been invited, data is not collected on how many people do not turn up or refuse vaccination.</p>

  <p>As at 17 January, the estimated overall uptake rate for the clinical at-risk groups was 49.1%.</p>

  <p>The second phase of the vaccination programme, for children over six months and under five years of age, has commenced and will continue over the next few weeks. We anticipate most of the second phase to be completed by mid February, with some mop up activity to the end of February.</p>

  <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: Under section 17A, Scottish Ministers may by regulations prescribe classes or descriptions of licensable marine activity which will be subject to pre-application consultation. This is a new provision introduced to the bill during stage 2 and as yet exact details of the marine activities which would fall within the scope of the provision have not been determined. There will be a full consultation process on any relevant regulations but it is likely that minor, small scale projects or repairs would fall outwith the scope of the provision.</strong></p>

  <p>Section 27 of the Marine (Scotland) Bill allows the marine licence and the Section 36 consent to be considered together. This will allow for a streamlined decision making process. If a project has received a section 36 Electricity Act consent it will still require the relevant marine licence for certain parts of the project to proceed. As such, it is only right that the applicant should have the right to appeal in the unlikely event that a marine licence is refused. In such cases appeal is likely to be to the sheriff court.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has been working with NHS boards to review local processes and is preparing guidance for NHS boards which sets out the policy framework with regard to the introduction and availability of new medicines in the NHS in Scotland. A key requirement within the guidance is the need for NHS boards to have written policies describing the systems and processes for the managed entry of new medicines and that these should be publicly available.

  <p>Prescribing information derived from prescriptions dispensed in the community by community pharmacists and dispensing doctors is available at <a href="http://www.isdscotland.org/prescribing" target="_blank">www.isdscotland.org/prescribing</a> . These data can be used for monitoring trends and utilisation. Detailed prescribing information is available to NHS boards through PRISMS &ndash; the Prescribing Information SysteM for Scotland which is a web-based information system on all prescriptions dispensed in the community over the previous five years. NHS boards have prescribing advisors who monitor the use of medicines by GP practices using PRISMS information and who can provide expert interpretation of the data and assess the clinical appropriateness of prescribing.</p>

  <p>Variations in prescribing practice across Scotland can be influenced by a number of different local factors, for example, population size, patient demographics and deprivation and it is therefore important not to draw definitive conclusions from national data alone.</p>

  <p>In 2006, the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) commissioned the National Medicines Utilisation Unit (NMUU) to explore how SMC has impacted on and engaged with its key stakeholders and to examine how SMC advice has shaped medicines use across NHSScotland. This work was completed in September 2008 and a summary and full reports can be accessed at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scottishmedicines.org.uk/smc/3865.21.26.html" target="_blank">http://www.scottishmedicines.org.uk/smc/3865.21.26.html</a>.</p>

  <p>In response to the findings, the SMC made the following recommendations in relation to improving knowledge on the use of medicines within NHSScotland:</p>

  <p>SMC will consolidate existing work with agencies such as the Information Services Division and NHS National Services Scotland to explore the feasibility and benefit of routinely monitoring the uptake of SMC advice and the publication of this information regularly to interested stakeholders. This will use the information to NHSScotland on the prescribing and use of medicines in secondary care available through the Hospital Medicines Utilisation Database.</p>

  <p>SMC will continue to work with ISD to develop systems to assess uptake of new medicines. A priority may be those medicines included in the SMC horizon scanning report <em>Forward Look</em> subsequently accepted by SMC. Again, this work will use the information to NHSScotland on the prescribing and use of medicines in secondary care available through the Hospital Medicines Utilisation Database.</p>

  <p>SMC is currently collaborating with ISD to take these recommendations forward. Discussions are also taking place regarding further work to evaluate the impact of SMC advice.</p>

  <p>In addition, in relation to the framework being put in place for the assessment of patient access schemes (PAS), consideration is being given to processes to support monitoring of uptake of these medicines.</p>

  <p>The standardisation of the Drug Dictionary for Scotland will allow the Hospital Medicines Utilisation Database to show comparisons across NHS Scotland both in terms of the costs and volumes of medicines. Where possible, the Drug Dictionary for Scotland is standardised in line with the UK dictionary of medicines and devices (dm+d) and is also mapped to the World Health Organization Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system to facilitate international comparison.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, with reference to the letter to the Public Petitions Committee from the Deputy Director of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Healthcare Policy Strategy Directorate on 27 July 2009, how it will (a) continue to ensure that guidance to NHS boards is being implemented and (b) manage boards that do not implement the guidance in a timely fashion.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government expects NHS boards and clinicians to take full account of Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) and NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS) recommendations in the planning and provision of NHS services. Where there is evidence that an SMC or NHS QIS accepted medicine (or its equivalent) is not being made available, or there are undue delays in reaching such decisions, these will continue to be addressed directly with the NHS board concerned in order that appropriate action is taken where necessary.</p>

  <p>The decisions of individual clinicians in relation to patient care are a matter of professional judgement in line with clinical need. However, all NHS staff operate within the management framework of their employing organisations.</p>

  <p>NHS Ayrshire and Arran have advised that the delay in completing the new community hospital in Girvan has been due to a number of unforeseen technical problems that arose during the construction phase, including a key supplier of structural materials being unable to fulfil their contractual obligations and subsequently going into administration. This required a new supplier to be identified. The recent severe weather has also resulted in a further short delay.</p>

  <p>The Better Together Patient Experience Programme is currently undertaking a national survey (launched in January 2010) which includes a question on hospital food. This information will provide the basis for boards to consider whether more detailed research is required locally on the issues. Most NHS boards already conduct local patient experience or patient satisfaction surveys but it is not possible to confirm the detail of these.</p>

  <p>The Better Together Patient Experience Inpatient Survey is one of the ways that NHSScotland will gain a better understanding of inpatients&rsquo; experiences. The information collected will be pivotal in helping improve and shape the way care and services are delivered in hospitals across Scotland. This survey will be sent to approximately 64,000 randomly selected inpatients who have had at least one overnight stay within the 14 territorial NHS boards or the Golden Jubilee National Hospital.</p>

  <p>I have asked Willie Pretswell, Interim Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service, to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>This information is not available. However as of 15 January 2010, the number of prisoners currently in custody, who reported being ex-service personnel on admission, and who have been referred to the Enhanced Addiction Casework Service for either a drug or alcohol problem, is 41.</p>

  <p>Officials have been liaising closely with both Network Rail and Glasgow City Council to ensure that continued access to Glasgow Central for all passengers is maintained both during and following completion of these works.</p>

  <p>(a) disabled access &ndash; Step free access points to the station are available in Gordon Street, close to the Union Street corner and Hope Street, opposite Waterloo Street. Passenger drop off can take place in areas designated as loading bays in Union Street and Waterloo Street, in both cases a short walk to these step free entrances. An additional disabled access point exists further down Hope Street, close to the Argyle Street corner. This access provides lift connectivity to both the high level and low level stations and is adjacent to a further loading bay in which passenger drop off can be effected.</p>

  <p>(b) drop-off and pick up passenger points - As described above, drop off can be achieved in designated loading bays positioned in Union Street, Waterloo Street and Hope Street. Passenger pick up can also be undertaken at these locations but general traffic restrictions will prevent vehicles waiting in these loading bays.</p>

  <p>(c) short term parking at Glasgow Central station - in order to carry out the platform work required to provide the much needed capacity enhancement at Glasgow Central Station the short stay car park and pick up / set down facilities within the station closed permanently on 27 September 2009. Commercial car parking facilities in Oswald Street and other locations adjacent to the station also remain available. The NCP Oswald Street car park has step-free access directly onto Platform 15.</p>

  <p>Scottish Ministers have made strong representations to Lord Adonis, Secretary of State for Transport, emphasising that we will not accept an overall diminution of services or compromise on journey times for cross border services.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government wishes to continue to see East Coast services running between Glasgow and London Kings Cross. Cross border rail links make a key contribution to Scotland&rsquo;s economic prosperity.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland modelling suggests that the removal of services between Glasgow Central and destinations on the East Coast Main Line could generate reductions in the economic welfare of passengers equivalent to approximately &pound;300 million. This value is measured in discounted 2002 prices over a 60-year appraisal period, as is standard in transport appraisal. These welfare disbenefits, measured primarily in terms of increases in time spent travelling, accrue across key passenger flows on the East Coast Main Line between Glasgow and London.</p>

  <p>While no social impact assessments have been carried out the economic analysis shows that key passenger flows across the East Coast Main Line would be affected. This reflects the concerns of many people who have written to Scottish Ministers requesting that the East Coast service continues, with particular regard to services calling at Motherwell.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s policy on water and sewerage charges for the 2010-15 period was set out in its Principles of Charging Statement which was published on 27 October 2009.</p>

  <p>The Statement sets out the Scottish Government&rsquo;s policy of charge caps that are affordable and do not rise above inflation across the period. It explicitly requires the bandings for household water and sewerage charges to replicate council tax bandings, with reductions on water and sewerage charges also mirroring the discounts that apply to council tax. It also provides for those in receipt of council tax benefit to receive up to 25% discount on their charges if they receive no other reduction or discount.</p>

  <p>These measures to secure the affordability of water for low income households in Scotland can be compared positively to the rest of Great Britain where average household charges are greater than in Scotland, where charges are increasing at a greater rate over the next five years, where there is no mirroring of council tax reductions and where those on council tax benefit are not eligible for a discount.</p>

  <p>The full details of the statement can be viewed at:</p>

  <p>The allocation of places in initial teacher education to individual institutions is a matter for the Scottish Funding Council. Decisions on intakes in 2010 have yet to be finalised and the Funding Council will announce details in their annual grant announcement in March. However, ministers have made clear their views that due to unacceptable levels of teacher unemployment intakes should be cut. We are in discussions with universities as to how the impact of reductions in intakes can be managed.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many bus monitoring officer posts there have been in the Traffic Commissioner for Scotland area in each year since their inception and how many such posts were funded by the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency.</p>

  <p>The post of Bus Compliance Officer (BCO) was created within the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) in 1999. The role of BCOs is to monitor bus services to ensure that they are operating in line with their service registrations. BCOs provide reports to the Traffic Commissioner who decides on what action should be taken. The following table outlines the number of posts there have been in the Scottish Traffic Area. Since 1999 VOSA have funded two BCO posts in Scotland. The remaining posts are funded by the Scottish Government. BCOs operate throughout Scotland.</p>

  <p>In addition, Strathclyde Partnership for Transport (SPT) created a specific bus warden role in 2008 in order to improve bus services in the SPT area. SPT bus wardens provide reports to the Traffic Commissioner when they see non-compliant operations. SPT bus wardens only operate within the SPT area.</p>

  <p>The operators, Cairngorm Mountain Ski Centre, closed the centre in the interests of public safety due to a two day blizzard which resulted in 15ft snow drifts and parts of the funicular railway track also being buried under drifting snow. This was an entirely appropriate decision in view of the extreme weather conditions at the time.</p>

  <p>Any decision to close access roads would be a matter for between Transport Scotland, Highland Council and Northern Constabulary.</p>
