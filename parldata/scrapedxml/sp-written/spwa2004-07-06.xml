  <p>The arrangements for private sector housing grants were modified in October 2003 to target grants according to applicants' resources. For some priority categories, including adaptations to houses to suit the needs of disabled people, any grant made by the local authority must be a minimum of 50% of eligible costs. In addition, Social Work departments can still provide additional &quot;top-up&quot; funding where they see fit.</p>

  <p>We do not expect there to be any significant disadvantage to disabled people in Scotland as a result of these arrangements and we have no plans to discontinue them.</p>

  <p>Statistics on housing improvement grants since the introduction in October 2003 of targeting according to the applicant's resources are not yet available. Statistics on grants for the year to April 2004 are due to be published in August 2004 but are unlikely to provide a good indication of the impact of the new system because of the short period between the implementation of legislative changes and the end of the reporting year. Statistics being collected with effect from April 2004 will relate specifically to the new arrangements. We will be monitoring the impact of the new arrangements on the basis of these sets of statistics.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive's<strong> </strong>housing investment programme is the main way used to encourage low cost home ownership development. It provides funding for such developments in disadvantaged communities to replace or improve poor quality housing and also in areas where demand exceeds supply or where market prices are beyond the reach of local or average incomes.</p>

  <p>The Education Department's budget covers programme expenditure only. Its administration costs are funded through the Executive's Administration Budget and so it would be misleading to provide percentage figures. The Education Department's expenditure on administration costs since 1999-2000 is as follows:</p>

  <p>HM Inspectorate of Education became an executive agency on 1 April 2001, when its administration costs were transferred to the Education programme budget. Restructuring of Departmental functions in the Scottish Executive over the period also affects some of the year on year comparisons.</p>

  <p>For information the Education Department's programme budget since 2000-01 is shown as follows:</p>

  <p>VisitScotland.com is proving to be a great means of increasing the number of visitors to Scotland and will continue to be so. The board and shareholder structure of eTourism Ltd (known as visitscotland.com) will not be affected by the introduction of the new tourism network. The detailed arrangements for the transfer of assets and liabilities is being considered by the project team delivering the new tourism network. However, we expect that shares held by current area tourist boards will transfer to the new network boards in the same way as other area tourist board assets. There will be no compensation payable for transfers of shares within the new network.</p>
