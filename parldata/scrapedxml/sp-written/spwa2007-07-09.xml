  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what plans it has to invest in ambulance services in Lanarkshire in the next four years and, in particular, how much will be spent on ambulance services, what this money will be spent on and what criteria it will use to determine how services have been improved over this period.</p>

  <p>It is for the Scottish Ambulance Service to determine how and where to invest the resources it receives from the Scottish Government - &pound;177.8 million in 2007-08 - in providing emergency and non-emergency patient transport services for the people of Scotland and to ensure value for money. The ambulance service may also receive additional resources from a territorial NHS board where there is agreement that such investment is required as a consequence of re-configuration of hospital services within the local area.</p>

  <p>For 2007-08 the Scottish Ambulance Service has budgeted &pound;11.4 million in support of services to the area of NHS Lanarkshire with &pound;7.8 million going to the emergency service and &pound;1.9 million to patient transport. The balance will be spent on items such as fuel costs, vehicle maintenance, accommodation costs, heating, equipment, drugs and consumables. The Lanarkshire area benefited from targeted investment in 2006-07 with an extra 43 staff (a mix of paramedics, technicians and ambulance care assistants) being taken on bringing the total whole-time equivalent establishment to 356.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government monitors the performance of the ambulance service&rsquo;s emergency and patient transport services on a regular basis. The Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing will be discussing the ambulance service&rsquo;s performance and how it plans to continue to improve its services to patients as part of its annual review on 15 August.</p>

  <p>Our policy is to promote approaches for deaf and hard of hearing people to have unhindered access to mainstream and specialist mental health services. We recognise the need for service improvement and keep all arrangements under review.</p>

  <p>We are funding relevant training organisations to develop a training pack on awareness for social care staff and have published guidance on <i>Disability Discrimination Compliance: Access to Mainstream and Specialist Services for those with sensory loss and a mental health problem</i> a copy of which can be found in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 38922).</p>

  <p>In June this year we co funded an event with the Royal College of Psychiatrists on sharing good practice and further advancing training and access issues among mainstream staff and for those working in mental health services with an interest in the mental health needs of deaf and hard of hearing people.</p>

  <p>Specialist in-patient and outreach services for deaf people continue from the John Denmark Unit, Manchester. All referrals for inpatient care are fully funded by the NHS National Specialist Division. We again keep these arrangements under review in the context of service need.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what resources are available to ensure that high-quality information and support is easily available to all those affected by lung disease at all stages of the disease and what opportunities exist for such people to be more involved in local NHS service development.</p>

  <p>We recognise that the provision of high-quality information is essential to our aim of making people living with long-term conditions equal partners in their own care. NHS boards should have information on the services that are available in their area, along with information on the condition and the relevant services through national organisations such as NHS 24. The format of such information has to take account of legislation and the communication needs of people living with the condition, their carers and the public. There is also an essential role for voluntary sector organisations such as the British Lung Foundation Scotland in the provision of information.</p>

  <p>CHPs are ideally placed to provide up-to-date information to people with long-term conditions such as lung disease and health care professionals regarding their condition and the services available in their localities.</p>

  <p>Each Community Health Partnership has a Public Partnership Forum and people from local groups such as the British Lung Foundation&rsquo;s &quot;Breathe Easy&quot; Groups can play an important role within these fora in relation to the organisation and development of services in their locality.</p>

  <p>We have supported the development in different parts of the country of Managed Clinical Networks (MCNs) for respiratory conditions, and it is one of the core principles of MCN development that people with the relevant condition, or representatives of the voluntary organisations which speak on their behalf, should be involved in the operation of the networks so that they can play a key role in the development of services.</p>

  <p>NHS boards&rsquo; patient and public involvement fora are also a useful way of influencing strategy at NHS board level.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is determined to continue to do what is right for Scotland. We have already adopted our own approach where it has been in Scotland&rsquo;s best interest to do so, for example by stepping aside from using the on-line Medical Training Application Service (MTAS) when it became clear that it could not provide the improved functionality we required to support our process. We will not hesitate to adapt future selection and recruitment processes if that best serves Scottish interests and ensures that we continue to attract the best possible candidates for our NHS. Our approach has been to work in partnership with the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges in Scotland, NHSScotland and the BMA. We will continue to do so in developing and reviewing future arrangements, including those I announced on 27 June designed to ensure continuity of employment for any doctors who have been unable to secure continued training posts this year.</p>

  <p>Whilst pressured area designations which suspend the right to buy for some tenants are granted by the Scottish ministers, they are implemented by local authorities. The Scottish Government maintains an overview of all designations in place but it is for local authorities to manage the application of designations in their local areas.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government monitors right to buy sales on an on-going basis, and will look in particular at sales from 30 September 2007, when tenants affected by designations begin to be eligible to buy, in order to observe the impact of pressured area designations on sales.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive collects information on numbers of applicants on housing lists, but this does not include details of individual household circumstances as collecting such a level of detail would place an excessive burden on social landlords. As part of its regulation and inspection role, Communities Scotland looks at whether or not a local authority or registered social landlord gives reasonable preference to overcrowded households through its allocation policy, but does not collect this information routinely.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive collects snapshot information on the number of households in temporary accommodation at the end of each quarter through the HL2 return. This relates to households which have been placed in temporary accommodation by a local authority under the Homeless Persons legislation, and includes households for whom the local authority&rsquo;s decision and final action is still pending, as well as households which were secured such accommodation as a final action.</p>

  <p>The following table gives the number of households in temporary accommodation on the 31 March 1996 through to 31 March 2006. The table is broken down by whether the local authority is wholly or partly in the South of Scotland region. Data for 31 March 2007 will be published in autumn 2007.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government places great importance on creating a wealthier and fairer Scotland. We therefore value the contribution being made by the current network of urban regeneration companies (URCs) across Scotland to achieve the long-term, lasting transformation of the areas which they cover. We are keen to maintain an informal network across the URCs pathfinders as a way of promoting the exchange of experience and best practice. Over the period 2004-08, the URCs will have received funding of &pound;66 million from the Scottish Government and decisions on future funding will be taken in the context of the forthcoming spending review.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has been working with Irvine Bay Urban Regeneration Company (URC) and local partners, including North Ayrshire Council, Communities Scotland and Scottish Enterprise Ayrshire, to assist in the development of comprehensive regeneration proposals for the Irvine Bay area of North Ayrshire. Irvine Bay URC submitted a revised business plan to the Scottish Government at the end of June for consideration. Decisions on any future investment will be taken in light of that business plan in the context of the forthcoming spending review.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Community and Householder Renewables Initiative provides grant funding for the installation of domestic micro-hydro schemes. Householders can obtain a grant of 30% of the installed cost, up to a maximum of &pound;4,000.</p>

  <p>Householders in Scotland are also eligible for funding under the UK Government&rsquo;s Low Carbon Buildings Programme. A maximum grant of &pound;1,000 per kW of installed capacity is available for micro-hydro, subject to an overall maximum of &pound;2,500 or 30% of the relevant eligible costs, whichever is the lower.</p>
