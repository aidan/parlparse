  <p>On 25 June, the States of Guernsey hosted the fourteenth Summit meeting of the British-Irish Council, attended by ministers from all eight member administrations. The summit began with a very useful discussion on the global financial situation and on the measures being taken by members to best position their economies for recovery.</p>

  <p>The main theme of the summit was Marine Renewable Energy, the workstream for which is led by Scotland. The council discussed the ongoing activity of the workstream as well as looking towards areas for future co-operation and growth in this sector. This included the continued exchange of best practice on marine environment and research issues and the identification of key opportunities for ongoing collaboration across administrations. The council also agreed the importance of involving the European Commission in future discussions.</p>

  <p>Given the importance of the significant wave and tidal resources of BIC member administrations and the opportunities for the growth and competitiveness of this sector, it was apt that the council&rsquo;s discussions came only a day after the States of Guernsey and the Scottish Government hosted a conference, held on Guernsey.</p>

  <p>The seminar involved a number of key players from the Scottish wave and tidal sector sharing their experiences and lessons learned with developers and industry representatives from across the Channel Islands as well as members of the marine energy sub-group.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to say that the council also agreed that the standing secretariat of the council should be located in Scotland. We are delighted that we will host this new base for co-ordinating and planning the future work of the council, and are committed to working with all member administrations to ensure its successful and early establishment.</p>

  <p>As with previous summits, the meeting received progress reports and agreed a plan for future work on the other subjects currently being taken forward by council members. These are drugs misuse; demography; digital inclusion; the environment; energy, both grid infrastructure and marine renewables; collaborative spatial planning; early years; indigenous, minority and lesser-used languages; transport, and social inclusion.</p>

  <p>I am placing a copy of the Official Communiqu&eacute; that was issued by the British-Irish Council after the meeting in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre. (Bib. number 51233).</p>

  <p>I am pleased to announce today that a new Challenge Fund will deliver support for rural broadband solutions through the LEADER network in Scotland.</p>

  <p>This will deliver one million euros of much needed support for broadband projects in rural areas and help towards economic recovery.</p>

  <p>The new investment that will be delivered through the LEADER network will support small-scale, community driven projects in rural areas and is aimed at improving coverage and bringing faster broadband to rural communities.</p>

  <p>This means that communities will have the opportunity to define their own broadband needs and develop a project which meets these needs. The LEADER Local Action Groups, with technical assistance, will then assess the merits of the applications for that area and bid for funding to the Challenge Fund.</p>

  <p>Local Action Groups will be invited to bid to the Challenge Fund by 24 September 2010. The deadline set for submission of applications to Local Action.</p>

  <p>Groups will be for them to determine locally, but we are keen to move this forward.</p>

  <p>This process will streamline applications and allow bids to be made to the Challenge Fund in late September so that the funding can be delivered at a time of economic need.</p>

  <p>I recognise that there are different broadband support needs and solutions across Scotland and believe that the Local Action Group network across Scotland is best placed to assess these local needs.</p>

  <p>This will deliver support from the SRDP in a way that is flexible but also focused and I am delighted to be able to announce a way forward for Rural Communities and broadband.</p>

  <p>The interim Process Evaluation of the Drug Treatment and Testing Order II (DTTO II) Pilot in the Lothian and Borders Community Justice Authority has been published today on the Scottish Government website.</p>

  <p>The evaluation provides indicative evidence of the positive role that DTTO IIs can play in helping offenders, in particular women, to achieve a reduction in drug misuse, greater stability in living arrangements and move towards entry into employment, education and training.</p>

  <p>That is why I have decided to extend funding in the pilot area until the end of March 2012. Continued funding will provide an opportunity to build on the pilot&rsquo;s success by collecting longer term monitoring data for a larger sample of clients. Some of the data collected will contribute to a wider review which we are undertaking on the effectiveness of interventions for offenders with drug problems in the criminal justice system. That review will conclude early next year.</p>

  <p>Proposals under the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Bill introduce a new Community Payback Order (CPO). This will provide sentencers with a menu of options including a drug treatment requirement. We will promote use of the CPO with a drug treatment requirement for women offenders who have drug-related offending issues.</p>

  <p>The accelerated capital programme is a central element in the Government&rsquo;s Economic Recovery Plan, helping to support over 5000 jobs in the Scottish Economy. In 2009-10, &pound;292.5 million of capital spending was accelerated from this year&rsquo;s Budget.</p>

  <p>In 2009-10, &pound;292.5 of capital spending was delivered through the accelerated capital programme, representing 100% of planned spend.</p>

  <p>As part of the programme:</p>

  <p>local authorities invested &pound;90 million to accelerate a range of capital spending programmes across 32 local authorities;</p>

  <p>the Scottish Government invested &pound;24.5 million to deliver road improvements and enhanced park-and-ride facilities to cut congestion;</p>

  <p>&pound;18.6 million was provided for infrastructure improvements for colleges and universities, and</p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise accelerated &pound;30 million of investment in key projects to deliver wider benefits to the Scottish economy.</p>

  <p>Dronedarone (Multaq), used in the treatment of atrial fibrillation, has been scheduled for review by the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) on 3 August 2010. The SMC advice is expected to be available on 13 September 2010. As a licensed drug, dronedarone can be prescribed if it is considered to be the best treatment for an individual patient. However, we would expect clinicians to await SMC advice before making dronedarone routinely available on the NHS in Scotland. If clinicians wish to pursue the use of a medicine before the SMC advice is available they should do so via their local systems as explained in the guidance document CEL 17 (2010). This guidance on the introduction and availability of newly licensed medicines in the NHS in Scotland was issued by the Scottish Government on 17 May 2010 and can be accessed at:</p>

  <p>The report of the Independent Review of the Government Response to the 2009 H1N1 Pandemic will be published today.</p>

  <p>The review was jointly commissioned, and the chair appointed, by all four UK Health Ministers in March 2010. Dame Deirdre Hine chaired the review.</p>

  <p>The four UK Health Ministers set up this Independent Review with a remit to review the appropriateness and effectiveness of the UK strategy for responding domestically to the swine flu pandemic, and make recommendations for any future influenza pandemic.</p>

  <p>I would like to thank Dame Deidre Hine and her team for their work and I welcome her report and recommendations. I will take these into consideration when reviewing our future pandemic plans in the Scottish Framework For Responding To An Influenza Pandemic.</p>

  <p>The new seal licence system to be introduced under the provisions of the Marine (Scotland) Act 2010 is based on applications received from fisheries or fish farms. Such applications may be submitted either by individual fisheries or fish farms or by a group. It is therefore not possible at this early stage to anticipate how many applications are likely to be received and require processing.</p>

  <p>The information is presented in the following table. It is important to note the context for the changes in bed numbers: increasingly, for both children and adults, clinical care and treatment is provided on a day care basis. This reduces the need for a stay in hospital which is better for patients and, in particular, children. Indeed, between 2006-07 and 2009-10, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde report that day case attendances at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children (excluding psychiatry) increased from 8,191 to 10,246: a rise of 25.1%. As such, the move towards increased usage of day care at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow has led to a reduced need for inpatient beds.</p>

  <p>The responsibility for ensuring that pre-employment checks are undertaken on all staff working in NHSScotland is for the employing NHS board.
