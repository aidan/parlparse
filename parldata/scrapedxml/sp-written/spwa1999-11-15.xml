  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will detail (a) the amount of nuclear waste stored in Scotland on a monthly basis over the last three years, (b) the locations of such waste and (c) the procedures for monitoring the storage of the waste, including the nature and frequency of checks as part of the monitoring procedures.</p>

  <p>The storage of nuclear waste is covered by the nuclear site licences granted by the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII). This reflects the NII&#8217;s function of administering nuclear site licences and regulating nuclear waste management and safety on nuclear licensed sites, which are reserved matters. Storage of nuclear waste at Ministry of Defence sites is also a reserved matter.</p>

  <p>I understand, that the information sought is not available centrally in the form requested. Nuclear licensees themselves are responsible for monitoring and maintaining detailed records of the amount and location of nuclear waste.</p>

  <p>Advice on best practice in dealing with telecommunications development is being developed. It will recommend that authorities keep a register of masts and other structures on which telecommunications apparatus could be attached.

  <p>In order to effect a change of use from a quarry to a landfill site requires an application for planning permission from the local council. A waste management licence would also then need to be obtained from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency to operate a landfill at the site. There are no centrally held records of which former quarries in Scotland have become landfills.</p>

We plan to increase the Warm Deal budget to &pound;13 million in 2000-01 and to &pound;14.5 million in 2001-02. Over the three years, with &pound;38 million available, we expect to install insulation packages in more than 75,000 homes, providing warmer homes which are cheaper to heat for elderly and low-income households whose need is greatest.</p>

  <p>Adequate supplies of polysacharine vaccine for Scottish needs were achieved. Vaccine supplies for use in Scotland are initially delivered to the national holding centre in Cumbernauld and from there distributed to local holding centres with onward delivery to GPs and student health services. The Scottish Executive Meningococcal Vaccine Implementation Group appointed a subgroup to oversee vaccine distribution. This subgroup, acting in conjunction with Health Board Immunisation Co-ordinators and Trust Chief Pharmacists, helped to achieve equitable and appropriate vaccine distribution.</p>

  <p>We have no plans to do so. A Policy and Financial Management Review of the STB undertaken in 1998 found that all of the Board&#8217;s current functions are necessary. These functions can be summarised as consumer and trade marketing, the development of the Area Tourist Board network and increasing the competitiveness of the industry. They are carried out in support of the objective that has been set for the Board, which is to help maximise the economic benefit of tourism to Scotland. Currently, over 60% of the Board&#8217;s programme expenditure is incurred on consumer and trade marketing.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what share of the current roads budget is allocated for new road building or improvement, as opposed to repairs, and what share of this is accounted for by PFI schemes.</p>

  <p>Planned expenditure on motorways and trunk roads in the current year is &pound;163 million. Of this, &pound;93 million is capital expenditure (&pound;23 million for construction and improvement and &pound;70 million for structural repairs and other grants and expenditure). Current expenditure is &pound;70 million with &pound;38 million allocated to routine and winter maintenance and &pound;32 million to &quot;other current expenditure&quot;. The annual payments in respect of PFI schemes (A74(M), DBFO and Skye Bridge) will amount to approximately &pound;24.35 million during the current year. These are classified as current expenditure and are met from &quot;other current expenditure&quot;.</p>

  <p>At present, under the existing legislation &#8211; section 93 of the Transport Act 1985 &#8211; it is solely for local authorities to determine their concessionary travel arrangements for pensioners. The Scottish Executive is carefully considering appropriate ways in which to encourage the improvement and integration of such schemes, including concessions for rail travel, for pensioners and those with special needs.</p>

  <p>No specific steps have been taken by the Parliament to develop &quot;twinning&quot; or other links with emerging nations. I understand that the Procedures Committee will be considering how matters relating to Parliamentary liaison should be handled within the Parliament, with a view to identifying an appropriate mechanism. I am therefore passing your question to the Procedures Committee so that they may take it into account in their deliberations. <br /></p>
