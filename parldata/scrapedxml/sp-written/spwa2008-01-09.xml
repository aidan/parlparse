  <p>The <em>Better Health, Better Care</em> Action Plan, published on 12 December 2007, highlighted the Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment to improve availability of primary care services. As part of the package of planned improvements in this area, we will establish five pilot projects in our biggest health board areas (Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, Lothian and Tayside) to provide walk-in access to a range of primary care services through community pharmacies.</p>

  <p>The focus in the first instance is to locate pilot sites in or around major commuter points and shopping areas within these health board areas. Lanark is not included as part of the pilot project but the pilot projects will inform future roll-out of such an approach. The pilot sites will be subject to on-going evaluation to determine how best community pharmacy walk-in service models could be applied in other areas; the sustainability of community pharmacy walk-in services, and any future development of walk-in services.</p>

  <p>It is important to emphasise that the pilot sites will offer access to a mix of walk-in primary care services and the services provided will vary from site to site based on locally identified needs. The mix of services could include, for example, nurse-led minor injury clinics, sexual health screening and treatment, simple diagnostic tests and some adult immunisations.</p>

  <p>Spend on mental health services will be drawn from the record funds allocated to NHS boards and local government overall. Further details can be found in the Scottish Budget Report and related concordat with local government (Bib. numbers 44076 and 44077 respectively).</p>

  <p>It is the responsibility of these agencies to work in partnership and to allocate funds from the total financial resources available to them on the basis of local needs, priorities and agreed targets. These priorities include the Scottish Government&rsquo;s focus on progress with the 14 published commitments and four HEAT targets, the latter covering dementia care, and reductions in suicides; hospital readmissions, and levels of antidepressant prescribing.</p>

  <p>As part of the process of negotiating the new GP contract, an independent group of academics made an assessment of the surveys available. The group recommended the Improving Practice and General Practice Accreditation questionnaires for inclusion within the Quality Outcomes Framework of the new contract. This recommendation was accepted by the negotiating parties.</p>

  <p>For both surveys there is published peer-reviewed research. The Improving Practice questionnaire is based on a similar questionnaire used within GP accreditation schemes in other countries and is structured around commonly agreed standards as set out by the Royal Colleges of General Practice. The General Practice Accreditation questionnaire was developed by the University of Manchester in collaboration with the Health Institute of Boston, and is closely related to a questionnaire that has been extensively validated in the USA.</p>

  <p>The NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS) Standards for The Provision of Safe and Effective Primary Medical Services Out-of-Hours (August 2004) require the service provider to take action to identify patient views and satisfaction levels. In addition, the standards require comments, complaints and compliments to be recorded, regularly reviewed and action to be taken.</p>

  <p>All services adhere to and are fully integrated into the NHS board complaints system.</p>

  <p>When reviewing services, NHS QIS found that most services could demonstrate that action was taken where appropriate, lessons learned disseminated to staff, and that complaints were monitored.</p>

  <p>Information on small businesses in the form requested is not held centrally.

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>(i) The rateable value ranges shown in the table correspond to those on page 12 of the <em>Scottish Budget: Spending Review 2007</em>.</p>

  <p>(ii) The table shows the number of non-domestic properties, except zero-rated properties, with rateable values of up to &pound;15,000 in each of the local authority areas in which the Rutherglen parliamentary constituency is situated.</p>

  <p>(iii) The number of eligible businesses will be lower than the number of non-domestic properties in each area, because some businesses have more than one property. This may affect eligibility for relief under the Small Business Bonus Scheme, which will depend on:</p>

  <p>the combined rateable value of all properties in Scotland for which the business is liable to pay rates;</p>

  <p>whether the property is eligible for one of the existing rates relief schemes, and</p>

  <p>the level of other public sector assistance received by the business.</p>
