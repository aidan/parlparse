  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how effective it is for an issue to be included within the national priorities in education, given the view expressed in paragraph 23 of its Policy Memorandum on the Education (Disability Strategies and Pupils' Records) (Scotland) Bill that the inclusion of accessibility strategies in these priorities "would carry little weight".</p>

  <p>Currently those teachers graduating with a teaching qualification in a secondary subject can teach their subject in a primary school. However, to gain full registration they must complete two years probation within a secondary setting. They cannot become fully registered as a primary teacher without further training and a further period of probation.</p>

  <p>The new scheme will guarantee all eligible probationary teachers a one-year training contract, teaching the subject in which they are qualified. In the case of those with a secondary qualification, this will be in a secondary school. This will lead to achievement of the standard for full registration and the opportunity to register as a fully qualified secondary teacher.</p>

  <p>The opportunity to teach in their subject in primary schools is still available but, as with the current situation, will not lead to full registration as a primary teacher.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive considers there is no anomaly in this situation and does not collect information on how many students are in this position.</p>

  <p>The General Teaching Council for Scotland are currently in the process of notifying all probationer teachers of the transitional arrangements, which have been put in place for those who are not part of the Teacher Induction Scheme. These arrangements allow all existing probationer teachers with 270 days teaching experience, to apply for full registration as a teacher. Currently the normal requirement is 380 days.</p>

  <p>The deployment of teachers is a matter for local authorities. Discussions are currently under way to finalise the details of the implementation of the Teacher Induction Scheme in individual authorities, including consideration of any impact on existing probationers.</p>

  <p>North of Scotland Water Authority and West of Scotland Water Authority have both given Scottish ministers an undertaking to carry out improvement works, to comply with the provisions of the new Drinking Water Directive 98/78/EC. There is currently no drinking water quality undertaking for East of Scotland Water Authority. The projects that comprise the undertakings for the North and the West are listed in the authorities annual water quality reports.</p>

  <p>There are 564 water supply zones in Scotland and the North of Scotland Water Authority undertaking should bring about compliance with the Directive in 258 of these zones at an estimated cost of &#163;180 million. The West of Scotland Water Authority undertaking, which covers 28 zones, is estimated to cost &#163;123 million. The cost of the individual projects comprising the undertaking is not held centrally. This is a matter for the water authorities.</p>

  <p>In addition to the undertaking programmes in the North and the West, all three water authorities are carrying out lead pipe replacements and installing orthophosphate dosing equipment, to comply with the new lead standard.</p>
