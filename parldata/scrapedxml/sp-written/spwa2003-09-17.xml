  <p>The Treasury Taskforce Technical Note No. 3, <em>How to Appoint and Manage Advisers</em> , <em></em> provides guidance to assist public bodies to procure the right advisory support at the right time. The guidance includes asking advisors to respond in writing to a series of questions put by the public body prior to appointment. One of these questions asks the advisors to declare &quot;details of any actual or potential conflicts of interest or investigation of any sort by the authority&quot;.</p>

  <p>The note, a copy of which is available in the Parliament&#39;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 20723), is advisory providing guidance on good practice. However, it is expected that all public bodies follow it. It is for the public body to consider appropriate action in any instances where actual or potential conflicts are identified.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what further progress on developing Gaelic-medium education can be promoted under provisions of the Standards in Scotland&#39;s Schools etc. Act 2000.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2003-09-17.12.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80097" speakername="Peter Peacock" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-03/wa0917.htm#7">

  <p>The Standards in Scotland&#39;s Schools etc. Act 2000 requires education authorities to plan for and secure improvement in school education. It places specific requirements on authorities to address Gaelic-medium education in their annual statements of improvement objectives and annual progress reports. Many authorities have used the improvement framework established by the 2000 act to embed their policies around Gaelic-medium education fully into their wider strategy for school education.</p>

  <p>However, I feel that there is scope for many education authorities to improve further their planning of Gaelic-medium education. We are therefore taking action in three areas:</p>

  <p>education authorities will be issued with a clear reminder of their duty to address Gaelic-medium education in their annual statement of improvement objectives and annual progress reports, and our expectation that they will do so.</p>

  <p>local authorities will be asked to establish thresholds against which they will assess parental demand for Gaelic-medium within their area.</p>

  <p>B&#242;rd na G&#224;idhlig (the Gaelic language development agency) and the Management Review Group of local authorities will be invited to establish a joint sub-group to review the performance measurement against which Gaelic-medium education development is measured.</p>

  <p>I am minded to invite B&#242;rd na G&#224;idhlig to offer advice to local education authorities on the development of Gaelic-medium policies and to give them a role in advising the Executive on the sufficiency of such policies if that would be seen as helpful and plan to consult on this issue as part of the consultation process around the proposed Gaelic Language Bill.</p>

  <p>I take the advancement of Gaelic-medium education very seriously. I will not hesitate to use their power to issue statutory guidance under the terms of the Standards in Scotland&#39;s Schools etc. Act 2000 if the further development of education authority improvement plans in relation to Gaelic-medium demonstrates that is needed.</p>

It would be a breach of advertisement control to fly any flag falling within that definition where any necessary consent has not been obtained.</p>
