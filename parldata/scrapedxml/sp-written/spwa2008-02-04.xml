  <p>I anticipate that a Policy and Financial Management Review (PFMR) of HIAL will start in May 2008.</p>

  <p>The PFMR process will ensure that HIAL is subject to challenging review, taking full account of the views of all stakeholders, to ensure that the right structures are in place to deliver the Scottish Government&rsquo;s agenda effectively, efficiently and in a joined-up way.</p>

  <p>To enable a detailed and objective review of whether HIAL continues to meet the expectations and objectives of ministers, we are now seeking to appoint a suitably qualified and independent individual or organisation to conduct a PFMR in the following areas:</p>

  <p>The best future delivery model for the functions currently carried out by HIAL;</p>

  <p>Company performance since 1999;</p>

  <p>The internal structures of HIAL;</p>

  <p>The government/HIAL working relationship, and</p>

  <p>Working relations with other stakeholders.</p>

  <p>A project steering group will be established to guide the review to final report stage and this will include representation from the Scottish Government, HIAL and the independent reviewer. The review will take account of the simplification announcement by the First Minister on 30 January 2008.</p>

  <p>The pathfinder programme, the majority of whose 13 projects began in January 2007, was established by the last administration to explore community engagement at a &quot;grass roots&quot; level, and ways to engage those who do not take part in culture &ndash; through some novel and meaningful approaches. Interim reports are currently being submitted by the projects. There is evidence that the programme is having some success in achieving its objectives, engaging target groups who were identified as &quot;hard to reach&quot; and under-represented in terms of cultural participation, and discovering what culture means to them and what their aspirations are. That is a common thread which runs through all of the projects; they are also exploring links between culture and community planning.</p>

  <p>Most of the projects in the programme are due to finish in the early part of 2008. An independent evaluation will soon be commissioned which will consider the interim findings and, later, the final impacts from the programme. The evaluation report will be published and widely disseminated.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it believes that voluntary organisations and community groups will be disadvantaged in relation to local authorities and professional organisations in bidding for funding to hold events as part of the 2009 Year of Homecoming.</p>

  <p>The Homecoming Scotland Themed Events programme is open to all event organisers. The range of awards (&pound;5,000 to &pound;50,000) shows that the scale of activity funded will vary widely. It is a competitive process and the key consideration in allocating funding will be that proposed events fit the tourism objectives of Homecoming Scotland. EventScotland&rsquo;s Homecoming team is in discussion with a wide range of organisations about potential events, many of them voluntary or community groups.</p>

  <p>Each potential applicant is being invited to talk through their proposal with the themed events programme manager and each project is given appropriate and specific advice to assist them in making the strongest possible application in time for the funding deadline of 26 February.</p>

  <p>EventScotland&rsquo;s experience of funding through its Regional Programme, the model on which the Homecoming Themed Events Programme is based, is that on average 50% of successful applications come from community groups and that often the most innovative ideas come from grass-roots organisations.</p>

  <p>Information relating to legal aid awards is collected centrally by the Scottish Legal Aid Board. It does not, however, hold definitive information on the nationality of individuals who are awarded legal aid. The board has advised that a search of its database produced a total of 16 applications relating to divorce action where the applicant&rsquo;s place of birth is listed as &quot;Poland&quot;. This cannot be taken as definitive since the applicant may have specified a town or city rather than the country in the application.</p>

  <p>There is no information held centrally on the number of jobs lost or created in Scotland. However, information on the number of jobs by industry is collected each year from the Annual Business Inquiry (ABI). Table 1 shows the number of manufacturing jobs in Scotland and the Kilmarnock and Loudon parliamentary constituency from 1999 to 2006. Please note the Kilmarnock and Loudon parliamentary constituency is based on the 1995 definition to allow a complete time series from 1999.</p>

  <p>The reference date for the ABI in the most recent year was changed from December to September so data for 2006 is not directly comparable with data from previous years.</p>

  <p>VisitScotland is responsible for promoting Scotland to potential tourists. The marketing aimed at fishing, which focuses on the quality of the wonderful fishing experience that is available in Scotland, is not specifically aimed at particular regions but promotes the whole of Scotland according to types of fishing, of which angling is one of the most popular.</p>

  <p>VisitScotland has developed a website (<a href="http://www.visitscotland.com/fish" target="_blank">www.visitscotland.com/fish</a>) that provides information on where to fish, what to bring and when to come for the best chance of success. There is also information on permit availability for nearly all of the main lochs and rivers in Scotland; some of which may be booked online. The information is divided into types of fishing rather than locations but does provide a regional listing of quality accommodation for visitors, making it easier for them to visit and book. VisitScotland has also produced an annual brochure on angling in Scotland that is mailed to over 30,000 people on their database with an interest in fishing.</p>

  <p>In March, April and May this year, VisitScotland will be promoting the quality of Scotland&rsquo;s angling and fishing industry with full-page advertisements in several specialised fishing magazines.</p>

  <p>The available statistics on the number of offences with a charge proved in Scottish courts with a bail aggravator recorded (indicating that the offence was committed while the offender was on bail) are given in table 18 of the Criminal Proceedings in Scottish Courts 2005-06 statistical bulletin, available at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/03/21083652/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/03/21083652/0</a>.</p>

  <p>No. The updated guidelines for supervised bail identify certain priority groups for this measure but subject to considerations of public safety and capacity issues do not preclude other accused from being granted supervised bail.

  <p>The &pound;500,000 investment in bail supervision recently announced and the updated guidelines issued extend slightly the categories of accused identified as priorities for this measure. The guidelines suggest priority for those with mental health problems, women accused, single parents, drugs misusers and young people aged between 16 and 21. Where capacity exists and subject to safeguards in respect of public safety, other accused outwith the priority groups can also be granted supervised bail.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is currently consulting on the future of mental health improvement and population mental health. <em>Towards a Mentally Flourishing Scotland</em> invites discussion on what objectives and commitments should be set for 2008-11 as the next stage of this agenda. One of the proposed main themes for action is the promotion of mental wellbeing in local communities.</p>

  <p>Scotland&rsquo;s Mental Health First Aid course is a training course designed to improve the mental health literacy of Scotland&rsquo;s population. Since its launch in 2004 over 9000 people have attended the course.</p>

  <p><em>Better Health, Better Care</em>, the Government&rsquo;s over-arching action plan to transform the NHS in Scotland, launched in December 2007, aims to create a mutual NHS, where patients are partners rather than just recipients of care. A key part of this change will be in creating enabling health services, where people have the knowledge &ndash; including increased mental health literacy - confidence and motivation to make healthy choices. Enhancing mental health literacy in local communities &ndash; particularly in disadvantaged communities - will complement the health-promoting NHS in Scotland envisaged by <em>Better Health Better Care</em> in tackling priority areas such as smoking cessation, drug and alcohol abuse, obesity and reducing sexually transmitted infections and unwanted pregnancies: all areas where good mental health is a key determining factor.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will be providing the NHS and local government in Scotland with record levels of funding over the period covered by the spending review 2008-11.</p>

  <p>For the NHS in Scotland, all NHS boards receive an annual allocation of funds, which will be announced shortly. It is for each NHS board to decide how best to utilise these funds to meet the health care needs of its resident population, including mental health services, taking account of national and local priorities.</p>

  <p>The record funding included within the draft Scottish Government Budget will ensure continuity of approach and investment on mental health and other priorities by all NHS boards, local authorities and other partners and will support the delivery of the now four HEAT targets for NHS Scotland including the focus on early detection and support for those with dementia and for their families.</p>

  <p>For local government, the vast majority of the funding, including the funding for mental health services<em>,</em> will be provided by means of a block grant. It is the responsibility of each local authority to allocate the total financial resources available to it on the basis of local needs and priorities having first fulfilled its statutory obligations and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities including the Scottish Government&rsquo;s key strategic objectives and manifesto commitments.</p>

  <p>The Royal Observatory has not asked the Scottish Government to provide financial assistance and we have no plans to do so. The UK Government&rsquo;s Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) has the primary responsibility for funding the Royal Observatory through its UK Astronomy Technology Centre facility (UKATC). We are aware of the potential difficulties at the Royal Observatory arising out of the STFC&rsquo;s budget cuts, following the UK Government&rsquo;s Spending Review. I have therefore written to John Denham, Secretary of State at the Department of Innovation, Universities and Skills to express my concerns and I also plan to visit the Royal Observatory soon to discuss this issue further.</p>

  <p>The government is not providing a separate funding allocation for this service for 2008-09. Instead, councils will receive an overall allocation and it will be for each council to determine how this is distributed locally across services to meet its statutory duties and also its commitments under the concordat.</p>

  <p>The breakdown of staff employed across directorates by nationality and gender in 2007 is shown below. The system we currently operate does not facilitate the provision of accurate data for previous years as we operate on a one year timeframe and these are not data we have historically assembled and reported upon. As part of the HR Change Programme the SPCB will be considering the level of historical data any new HR IT system should provide.</p>

  <p>Breakdown of Staff by Gender:</p>

  <p>There are several categories for British nationalities set out in this response, i.e. British, British/Irish, Great Britain, English and Scottish. The reason for this is the changes in census categories which have to be reflected in the SPCB&rsquo;s recruitment monitoring form.</p>

  <p>The issue of opening times and days was considered by the previous SPCB to ensure that resources were being used effectively. It noted that a fuller review should be carried out in 2007 when more data was available.</p>

  <p>The process adopted by the SPCB included: analysis of the established pattern of visitors across the week and take up of tours and retail; opening patterns at other UK and European legislatures; opening patterns at other Scottish visitor venues, in particular Our Dynamic Earth and the Palace of Holyroodhouse.</p>

  <p>Taking into account these findings the SPCB also considered the savings resulting from closing on a Sunday and the benefits this might achieve for the public purse and the Parliament. This includes a shift of resources and emphasis to increased public engagement in new areas such as education activities at Holyrood and in the community.</p>

  <p>Finally, the SPCB satisfied itself that Monday &ndash; Saturday public opening, alongside members continued option of bringing in guests on a Sunday, offered a good range of visit opportunities for the public.</p>

  <p>Officials have regular meetings with the Palace of Holyroodhouse and Our Dynamic Earth. Discussions were held around opening times and visitor patterns. Each institution submitted confidential information about their 2007 patterns to inform the SPCB&rsquo;s discussions.</p>

  <p>The analysis of the Parliament&rsquo;s data and that from the other institutions shows that the three institutions have very different patterns of visitors. This is to be expected given the institutions&rsquo; different aims.</p>

  <p>The analysis of data shows that Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday are the most popular days for visitors to the Scottish Parliament. This reflects the fact that parliamentary business and other business day activities, such as constituent meetings and parliamentary events, is consistently the strongest draw for visitors to the Parliament. This is to be expected, given that the Scottish Parliament is not primarily a visitor attraction but is a working Parliament, seeking to engage the public in its role and business.</p>

  <p>The opposite trend is found at the Palace of Holyroodhouse and Our Dynamic Earth, where weekends are the most popular days, reflecting their particular aims as visitor attractions.</p>
