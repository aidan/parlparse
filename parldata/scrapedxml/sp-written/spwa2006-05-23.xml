  <p>There are no dedicated schemes aimed specifically at assisting new entrants to the agriculture sector. Our priority is the creation of a profitable and sustainable agriculture industry which provides real opportunities for all farmers entering and wishing to remain in farming. New entrants to the agriculture sector can, however, access the generic business support and advice services that are available to any new business start-ups through the enterprise networks.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive, in association with NHS Health Scotland, has produced an information leaflet for the industry sector to advise them of their responsibility under the act. This will be distributed to all businesses during breast awareness week. Scotland already has an existing infrastructure to support breastfeeding and through a multi-agency effort we continue to work with these groups to publicise the new legal protection afforded to individuals. As part of the consultation on our Infant Feeding Strategy we will monitor the effect of the introduction of breastfeeding legislation, ensuring key recommendations are considered and implemented.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive works throughout the year with NHS Health Scotland who support a range of promotional, research and best practice at a national level. In addition during breastfeeding awareness week, there are numerous activities planned across Scotland to raise awareness to the public about breastfeeding and health benefits. The Executive has provided funds towards the cost of these events. An information leaflet about the Breastfeeding etc. (Scotland) Act is also being distributed by the Executive to promote awareness amongst employers of their responsibilities towards breastfeeding mothers under the act.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what action it has taken in response to the World Health Organization&rsquo;s decision to revise paediatric growth charts to represent the growth patterns of breastfed babies more accurately in order to reduce instances in which breastfed babies are inaccurately categorised as being underweight.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-05-23.6.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80064" speakername="Lewis Macdonald" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0523.htm#3">

  <p>Paediatric growth charts are an important tool for recording changing patterns in a child&rsquo;s growth. Midwives are responsible for the care of each client and it is an accepted good practice to weigh and measure the baby. Current charts are based on calculations using the growth patterns of babies fed largely on formula milk. Bottle-fed babies put on weight more quickly than those that are breast-fed, meaning breast-fed children could be shown as underweight. The new recommended charts are based on data from breast-fed babies. The Scottish Executive launched the <em>Infant Feeding Strategy for Scotland</em> &ndash; A consultation paper in March 2006. As part of this consultation, due to finish on the 30 June, we will look at and review the use of these charts.</p>

  <p>Citizens with no remaining natural permanent teeth are now predominantly over 55 years old. It is now rare for any person to lose all of their natural permanent teeth before the age of 55 years in Scotland.</p>

  <p>A combination of improved access to fluoride toothpaste and an improved range of available treatments for dental decay and gum disease have led to a considerable and continued decline in tooth loss in Scotland over the last 30 years.</p>

  <p>Scottish Water is responsible for sewers which are part of the public sewerage network. The Sewerage (Scotland) Act 1968 makes provisions relating to sewerage in Scotland - section 16 of the act covers ownership of sewers. Scottish Water maintains records of the public sewerage system and would be happy to field any enquiries if you approach them with details of the location of the particular sewer(s) under question.</p>

  <p>Recommendations for transfer to conditions of lesser security are closely scrutinised by Scottish ministers and include the expert advice of both multi-disciplinary teams and the psychiatric adviser to the Health Department. Should Scottish ministers not be satisfied on grounds of risk they will not consent to the transfer proceeding.</p>

  <p>From 1 May 2006, all patients detained at the State Hospital have a right to appeal against being detained in conditions of excessive security. Scottish ministers are a party to restricted patient appeals and may make representations, either in writing or orally, at the tribunal hearing. Any representations made will be founded on risk.</p>

  <p>Following the publication of the <em>Mental Welfare Commission Report</em> into the care and treatment of Mr L and Mr M on 22 March guidance was issued on the same day indicating that, with immediate effect, a formal risk assessment and risk management plan must be in place before consideration will be given to unescorted suspension of detention.</p>

  <p>Once suspension of detention has been granted the Responsible Medical Officer (RMO) must submit a report on completed suspension of detention three months after the implementation of suspension of detention. If there are any doubts that the suspension of detention should take place, it must be stopped. The RMO must also inform the department should any change occur which affects the basis on which the Scottish ministers&rsquo; consent has been given for suspension of detention.

  <p>Details of the number of interception warrants issued by the Scottish ministers are contained in the annual reports of the Interception of Communications Commissioner. The most recent report &ndash; Bib. number 37809, document number SE/2005/203 &ndash; was laid before the Scottish Parliament on 3 November 2005.</p>

  <p>It is not in the public interest to give details relating to interception warrants beyond the figures reported by the commissioner. To do so could potentially damage the effectiveness of what is an important part of our ability to tackle serious and organised crime.</p>

  <p>The use of Interception as an investigative technique is governed by strict safeguards within the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. The commissioner has stated in successive annual reports Scottish ministers take considerable care to satisfy themselves that warrants are necessary and proportionate for the authorised purposes &ndash; preventing and detecting serious crime.</p>

  <p>The Health Education Board for Scotland ceased to exist in 2003, when it amalgamated with the Public Health Institute for Scotland to form NHS Health Scotland.</p>

  <p>Through their Early Years Programme, NHS Health Scotland has identified a need to support parents of very young children around mental health issues. This need was identified in both the evaluation of the Ready Steady Baby resource and a Toddler Parenting Survey. To begin to address this identified need NHS Health Scotland has improved the mental health content of the redeveloped Ready Steady Baby resource and included mental health issues (of both parent and child) in the development of material aimed at parents of toddlers. It is expected that both will be published by the end of this year.</p>

  <p>The Health Education Board for Scotland/NHS Health Scotland has not been allocated any specific funding packages from the Scottish Executive for the promotion of mental health issues to target parents of children under five since 2001. The work described above has been covered from within NHS Health Scotland&rsquo;s core budget from the Health Department.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Health Survey 2003 and the 2004 National Scottish Survey of Public Attitudes to Mental Health, Mental Well-being and Mental Health Problems ( <em>Well? What do you think?</em> ), found that respondents&rsquo; experience of mental ill-health and their scores on a widely used standard measure of mental distress and psychological ill-health were both strongly related to a range of socioeconomic characteristics, including income, ease of managing on income and area deprivation. These add to an existing body of evidence, which is summarised in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&rsquo;s 2004 report entitled <em>Mental Health and Social Exclusion</em> .</p>

NHSQIS practice development unit develop best practice statements in care of older people and have a network of nurses throughout Scotland where these are shared.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether its strategy to improve the quality of health care for older people includes commitment to establishing a national resource, such as the Caledonian Virtual Practice Development College, which has pioneered evidence-based nursing care and promotes better standards of care for older people.</p>

  <p>No. The Caledonian Virtual Practice Development College is a commercial enterprise and would have to bid for work on a competitive basis alongside other bidders/providers of such a service.</p>

  <p>Population is taken into account in the new police formula. The fire formula is still under review and until new arrangements are agreed funding will continue to be allocated on the basis of establishments. Establishments were based on population, however these were last set in 2005 prior to abolition and therefore do not take account of population changes in the interim.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The information requested is not available as it is not routinely collected by the SPS. The SPS do recognise the relevance and importance of the relationship between prisoners and children, and the SPS works extensively with partner agencies to support these family links.</p>

  <p>In its publication <em>The Strategic Review of Charges 2006-10: The final determination</em> , the Water Industry Commission for Scotland reported that it may be reasonable for Scottish Water to <em>&quot;</em> narrow 50% of the gap between current performance and the economic level of leakage by 2010&quot; and it allocated funding for this purpose. Scottish Water has accepted this challenge and will be working with the Drinking Water Quality Regulator, Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the Water Industry Commission for Scotland to deliver this requirement. The Commission intends to agree initial leakage targets (consistent with its Final Determination) with Scottish Water in the near future.</p>
