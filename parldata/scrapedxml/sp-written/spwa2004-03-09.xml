  <p>The reference amount is based on the average number of determined livestock and hectares held during the three year reference period, multiplied by the amounts in Annex VII of the Council Regulation 1782/2003. We therefore understand the reference amount is not based on the actual amount of subsidy received in the reference period which would impose the penalty already levied and suffered by the farmer for the purposes of all future subsidy payments. We do not however have the final community implementing legislation which may affect the position. In addition, the reference amount will of course depend on the livestock or hectares determined by inspection to be on the farm or croft at that time.</p>

  <p>The difficulties of setting up a Scottish Scheme are the same as those for the UK scheme. Furthermore a Scottish scheme would be much more expensive for our producers as it could not benefit from the economies of scale which the UK Scheme should deliver.</p>

  <p>Local authorities are expected to meet their responsibilities for tackling alcohol problems from within the resources made available to them by the Scottish Executive. While we have no plans to provide additional resources to local authorities for this purpose, we announced on 4 March 2004 that we will be making an additional &#163;8 million available to NHS boards for tackling alcohol problems over the next two financial years.</p>

  <p>Local authorities and managers of services have responsibilities to monitor and improve their performance. Overall, the Scottish Executive undertakes monitoring through the Social Work Services Inspectorate annual report and periodic thematic and specific reports by the Inspectorate. The Children and Young People Delivery Group is taking forward work to strengthen local quality assurance systems and external inspection of children&#8217;s services. Revised guidance for local authorities on planning co-ordinated children&#8217;s services will be issued later this year. The Scottish Executive has collated and published performance by local authorities and other service providers under the time intervals monitoring group. Audit Scotland reports to the Scottish Parliament provide independent assessment of performance.</p>

  <p>At individual case level, children&#8217;s hearings will monitor progress at review hearings. The Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Bill proposes a new power for reporters and hearings to refer local authorities to the courts if there are concerns that statutory obligations are not being met.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s Review of the Children&#8217;s Hearings System will explore how children&#8217;s hearings&#39; decisions and the outcomes of those decisions can be more consistently recorded and monitored to improve the service for children.</p>

  <p>Children&#8217;s Hearings have wide ranging powers to make whatever disposals they consider appropriate to meet the individual needs of the child.

  <p>Measures proposed in the Antisocial Behaviour etc (Scotland) Bill will further extend the range of disposals, e.g. the power to impose electronic monitoring on young people as one element of a package of support measures.

  <p>The first stage of the Executive&#8217;s review of the Children&#8217;s Hearings System will involve wide and open discussions on the hearings system, its principles and its objectives.

  <p>The Scottish Executive regularly considers the contribution to the economy of different communities in a number of ways using available statistics. One approach is to look at Gross Value Added (GVA). The Office of National Statistics (ONS) estimates of GVA are published by local area, and are shown in the table below for 2001. From this it can be seen that 30% of total Scottish GVA was created in Glasgow and Edinburgh. The estimates are calculated on a workplace basis, i.e. income is allocated to an area based on where people work rather than where they live. Therefore areas with high levels of inward commuting will have higher values and so these figures do not fully explain the contributions to the economy from local areas.</p>

  <p>The year 2000 was chosen as the base year for the calculation of GDP because this is the most recent year for which industry weights are available. As industry weights are derived from input-output tables, the base year used in the GDP index will relate to the latest year for which input-output tables are available - currently 2000. This is consistent with the UK approach, and means that the Scottish index is comparable with the UK and other EU countries which have complied with the ESA95 EU regulation.</p>

  <p>When input-output tables for 2001 are published, the Scottish GDP index will be updated to a base year of 2001. This will affect data from 2002 onwards, as previous years data will continue to be calculated with the relevant year&#8217;s input-output derived weights.</p>

  <p>There is currently a significant agenda of work on developing regional indicators of productivity and competitiveness, both within the Executive, and at the national level. DTI is planning to consult on regional productivity indicators, and the Executive will participate fully in this exercise. The Allsopp review of statistics for economic policymaking focuses on regional productivity measurement, and the Executive plans to work in partnership with relevant Whitehall departments and other organisations to take forward the final recommendations. This will include the need to produce comparable indicators for UK regions and countries, and to allow meaningful comparison with other OECD and EU countries.</p>

  <p>Separately, the Executive has already published a number of articles and analysis of productivity information in the <em>Scottish Economic Report</em> (SER) and further analysis is presented in the latest SER, published on 5 March 2004. The report &quot;Measuring Progress in Smart Successful Scotland&quot; due for publication later in the year, will also contain a range of indicators comparing Scottish performance against OECD countries.</p>

  <p>The UK weight for the oil and gas sector covers the whole sector, including extraction. The Scottish weight for oil and gas only covers the part of the sector related to &quot;service activities incidental to oil and gas extraction excluding surveying&quot;.</p>

  <p>As the extraction of oil and gas occurs on the continental shelf, under EU directions it is classified as <em>extra regio</em> and treated as a separate region of the UK. Extraction of oil and gas is therefore included in the UK GDP figures but not in the GDP figures for any of the 12 regions of the UK.</p>

  <p>EC public procurement directives apply to most purchasing contracts let by the public sector where the value exceeds certain thresholds. The EC public procurement directives provide scope for reflecting environmental considerations in procurement, where it is relevant to the subject matter of the contract or based upon environmental objectives of the public body concerned. Given that Public Private Partnerships procurements can involve a substantial amount of new build, the opportunity exists to deliver public services in a more environmentally friendly way.</p>

  <p>We do consider the generation of energy from biomass to be renewable. Electricity generated from biomass sources qualifies for support under the Renewables Obligation Scotland. This is wholly consistent with Article 2 of European Directive 2001/77/EC on the promotion of renewable energy.</p>

However, there are a range of training programmes available to fishermen that are delivered and funded by Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what its policy is on the commercial planting of genetically modified (GM) crops.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2004-03-09.59.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80128" speakername="Allan Wilson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-04/wa0309.htm#24">

  <p>The Executive recognises that the public are uneasy about GM and that there is limited support for the commercial planting of GM crops in Scotland. The biotechnology companies have yet to persuade Scottish farmers and consumers that there are real benefits to be gained from GM crops. The Executive&#8217;s role is not to persuade people to accept GM products. Our primary concern is to safeguard human health and the environment. Our approach is cautious and precautionary. We will not allow the growing of GM crops in Scotland where we have scientific evidence that they represent an increased risk to human health or the environment.</p>

  <p>We do not have the scientific evidence nor are there powers within the framework of European legislation to ban all GM crops. We must, however, maintain an active role in the regulation process, subjecting each application to careful scrutiny and satisfying ourselves that any products which receive approval are safe.</p>

  <p>In relation to the farm-scale evaluation crops, our statutory advisory committee on releases to the environment (ACRE) have advised that GM herbicide-tolerant beet and spring-sown rape should not be approved for planting on the basis of the management regimes tested under the trials. They have also advised that the consent for herbicide-tolerant maize should be amended to restrict the management conditions under which it can be grown. We accept ACRE&#8217;s advice and we have agreed with the UK Government a basis for pursuing the amendment of the maize consent at EU level. In the meantime no GM crops can be grown in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The farm scale evaluations have clearly demonstrated that there is no simple yes or no when it comes to GM and that it is sensible to assess each crop on an individual basis. This case-by-case approach was further supported by the conclusions of the review of GM science. The review panel agreed that a blanket approach to GM technology is not appropriate. Nor would it be compatible with European regulation.</p>

  <p>We should not dismiss the longer-term potential of GM technology out-of-hand. Most people support the development of GM medical applications because they can see the benefits these might bring. We can be proud that Scotland is host to some of the world&#8217;s leading biotechnology research and development and we should not undermine our future competitiveness by closing the door to the potential benefits of this technology.</p>

  <p>But the Executive also accepts that GM crops are not solely a scientific issue. We recognise that people have strong views about whether or not they wish to consume GM foods. It is therefore vital that consumers can exercise informed choice whether or not they wish to buy GM products. The new traceability and labelling regulations, which come in to force next month, will go a long way towards this. They will provide, according to Greenpeace, the strictest and most comprehensive labelling regime in the world.</p>

  <p>In order to provide assurance that farmers will be able to meet consumer demand for non-GM produce we plan to establish statutory coexistence measures. We will consult stakeholders, including conventional and organic farmers, on the most appropriate measures and on possible compensation mechanisms for those who suffer financial loss. We will work with them to put these measures in place before there is any planting of GM crops in Scotland. In addition, we will work with farming bodies to provide guidance to groups of farmers who wish to establish voluntary GM-free zones.</p>

  <p>A joint response by the UK and devolved administrations to the key issues raised during the GM dialogue has also been published today. Copies will be placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>The campaign to encourage the take-up of broadband is a joint publicity initiative between Scottish Enterprise, Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) and the Scottish Executive. In the current year, a total of &#163;172,653.99 has been spent by the Executive on publicity and advertising for this campaign. This figure however does not include spend by Scottish Enterprise or HIE on publicity and advertising related to this campaign.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to give the Executive&#8217;s expenditure for the broadband campaign in any future years as levels of Executive advertising spend have yet to be decided by ministers.</p>

  <p>Scottish Executive policy is to promote the use of community disposals and to continue to improve the range and quality of community sentences available to the courts, so as to encourage the punishment of offenders in the community rather than in custody wherever appropriate and consistent with public safety. Whilst sentencing decisions are a matter for the judiciary, the increases show that the courts are making greater use of probation and community service. The court must seek a social enquiry report when considering a community sentence or when considering custody for a young offender or a person who has not previously served such a sentence. A rise in such requests reflects an increase in demand by the courts.</p>

  <p><a id="OLE_LINK1" name="OLE_LINK1"></a> <strong></strong> Estimates on the impact of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 on the mental health officer (MHO) workforce were reached in consultation with the Association of Directors of Social Work and COSLA. &#163;2.5 million per annum additional funding has been made available for 2004-05 and 2005-06. This should allow for the employment of an additional 50-60 (whole-time-equivalent) MHOs across Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive commissioned research from the Scottish Development Centre for Mental Health on the capacity of MHO services to meet existing and future statutory demand. This research, launched at a conference in October 2003, examined service models and supports in place throughout Scotland. The findings will assist local authorities in examining and redesigning existing MHO services to maximise the availability of MHOs.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is facilitating the development of national standards for Mental Health Officer services, as intimated in the policy document: <em>Renewing Mental Health</em> <em>Law</em>. Agreed standards will assist in the provision of a more efficient and responsive MHO service.</p>

  <p>The benefits of planned care and early pre-discharge planning are well known. The care programme approach (CPA) which has a long history is designed to provide structured continuing care for those with more complex needs. Properly approached and applied the CPA is likely to show the benefits evidenced in Nairn and Ardersier.</p>

  <p>The CPA has been promoted and encouraged at every opportunity in recent years, given its joint working, joint delivery of services components. We continue to encourage its application at every opportunity most recently in our work with the agencies on the preparation of Local Joint Implementation Plans to deliver on the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003.</p>

  <p>A phased study into a proposal to create an Association for the Professional Music Industry in Scotland is currently being carried out by the Scottish Arts Council. This association will become the voice of the industry in Scotland and will, amongst its other responsibilities, assume the role previously taken by the Music Forum. There are, therefore, no plans to reconvene the forum. Past membership of the Music Forum can be found in the reply to parliamentary question S1W-28273.

  <p>The <em>Bid 79 report</em> (Bib number 31082) covers a range of issues from Human Rights Act compliance to training and staff governance issues. There are key recommendations for improvement to the services provided to remote and rural areas and the Executive has already drawn these recommendations to the attention of the statutory agencies.</p>

  <p>Some &#163;1 million has been provided to NHS boards and their partners to support planning for delivery of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003. They will be providing Joint Local Implementation Plans by 31 March and I would expect these to deal appropriately with the recommendations in the <em>Bid 79 report</em>.</p>

  <p>In determining a section 36 application, ministers must consider the characteristics, location and potential impact of the proposal. Whilst the views of the relevant planning authority carry considerable weight, ministers must have regard to the all the other representations received. An application can be refused consent for any one of a number of reasons. These include unacceptable adverse impacts that cannot be mitigated on the natural or cultural heritage, or on for instance certain aviation and radar services; unacceptable loss of amenity to those living in the locality; and incompatibility with government energy policy.</p>

  <p>(a) Young Offenders Institutions:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Prison Service delivers a wide range of basic, core and life skills programmes through a partnership with Motherwell College. This provision covers basic literacy and numeracy programmes together with courses to address IT and problem solving skills. Life skills include courses such as basic financial management, food preparation and cooking, first aid, food hygiene and healthy eating, together with art and music. In addition, offenders get access to physical education.</p>

  <p>In Polmont the vocational training delivered includes hairdressing, joinery, bricklaying, painting and decorating and industrial cleaning. Scottish Prison Service staff using nationally recognised standards of competence to deliver the vocational training.</p>

  <p>(b) Prisons:</p>

  <p>The broad approach to delivery of skills to adult offenders does not differ markedly from the approach taken with young offenders. Scottish Prison Service staff deliver vocational training in all establishments dependent on the prisoner mix and on the facilities available in each prison.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Prison Service is also beginning to develop vocational training in conjunction with employers.</p>

  <p>The legal challenges by the European Commission to two English PPP projects, which both related to the use of the negotiated procedure, have been resolved following discussion between the UK and the Commission. Our approach, as is the case in England, is that individual contracting authorities must choose the appropriate contract award procedure under the procurement directives, taking legal advice as appropriate. However, given the complexity of PPP contracts and the difficulty in pre-determining an appropriate allocation of risk, the negotiated procedure with a call for competition will generally be available.</p>

  <p>To ensure that the developer of a new road assesses the needs of cyclists, the Scottish Executive provides policy on transport and planning in National Planning Policy Guidance 17 (NPPG17). This document recommends that cycling be integrated into the design of new developments and made subject to cycle audit.</p>

  <p>NPPG17 is under review and the intended replacement, draft Scottish Planning Policy 17 (SPP17), has been issued for consultation. This document makes clear the importance of development proposals contributing to safe, convenient and attractive cycle networks. Planning Advice Note 57 (PAN57) provides good practice guidance on how that policy can be achieved.</p>

  <p>The draft SPP17 also requires a developer&#8217;s assessment of a proposal&#8217;s transport implications to consider cycling, walking and public transport.</p>

  <p>The policy and guidance documents referred to above are all in the public domain. Developers, planning authorities and the Scottish Executive Inquiry Reporters Unit (which is the Scottish equivalent to the Planning Inspectorate) should refer to them during the development of proposals and in the making of decisions.</p>

  <p>Ministers have tasked Scottish Water with delivering the current capital programme (Quality and Standards II) to quality and legislative standards as specified by the appropriate regulator and to overall efficiency targets as set by the Water Industry Commissioner.</p>

  <p>The delivery of Scottish Water&#8217;s capital programme is a matter on which ministers place the highest priority. It is one of the principle achievements for which the board of Scottish Water will be held accountable. At my last meeting with Scottish Water when this issue was discussed, I received assurance that current investment commitments would be delivered to the timescales agreed with the relevant regulator.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Separate social inclusion partnership (SIP) funding has been allocated since 2000 to tackle controlled drugs as defined under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 but is not allocated specifically to address alcohol. Although projects dealing with controlled drugs can include support to address alcohol misuse details of these are not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The total grant expenditure across the SIP network under the SIP Tackling Drugs Misuse grant amounted to &#163;0.844 million in 2000-01, &#163;1.088 million in 2001-02 and &#163;1.693 million in 2002-03. Expenditure details are not yet available for 2003-04.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it is on target to meet its aim that no more than 3.5 million tonnes of municipal waste be produced in 2010, as stated in The National Waste Plan 2003.</p>

  <p>The Executive remains committed to the aim in the National Waste Plan to stop growth in the amount of municipal waste produced by 2010. We are taking a number of steps to achieve this aim. These include support for home composting, through the Strategic Waste Fund, and support for a waste minimisation programme by the Waste and Resources Action Programme. This programme includes home composting, the promotion of real nappies and work with retailers. In addition, the Executive is currently working with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and others to develop a national framework for household waste prevention.</p>
