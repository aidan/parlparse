  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether crofters collaborating on a grazings committee that applies for Rural Priorities would receive a higher score as a result of that collaboration should (a) a single application by the committee be made or (b) each crofter apply outlining plans to collaborate on such a committee.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-02-03.S3W-31003.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80340" speakername="Richard Lochhead" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa0203.htm#1">

  <p>The score achieved by any Rural Priorities proposal depends on it meeting a number of criteria.</p>

  <p>In order to achieve a high score for collaboration currently, there needs to be separate applications working together to meet the desired outcomes. However, the scoring criteria under Rural Priorities, including those for the collaboration element, are being reviewed. This review will look at how we should treat applications with unusual circumstances, such as those from a grazings committee.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, given that health warnings about the dangers of mixing alcohol and caffeine are starting to appear in countries such as Canada, France, the Republic of Ireland, Sweden and Australia, (a) what impact such warnings would have in Scotland and (b) whether it plans to introduce such warnings.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-02-03.S3W-30942.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80379" speakername="Shona Robison" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa0203.htm#2">

  <p>Any warnings relating to the mixing of alcohol and caffeine would have to be based on evidence of harm. As the current evidence is inconclusive on the effects of mixing caffeine and alcohol it is not possible to assess the potential impact of such warnings.</p>

  <p>We note the recent call for evidence from manufacturers on the safety of caffeinated alcoholic beverages by US Food and Drug Agency. We will review their findings should they be published and consider whether further research is necessary.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what impact introducing a minimum price per unit of alcohol will have on the (a) cost and (b) levels of consumption of Buckfast tonic wine.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-02-03.S3W-30945.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80379" speakername="Shona Robison" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa0203.htm#2">

  <p>Minimum pricing is likely to predominately affect the low-cost, high-strength drinks, such as white cider, super strength lager and cheap vodka, that are favoured by harmful and hazardous drinkers. Fortified wines, including Buckfast, represent less than 2.4% of the total volume of alcohol sold in Scotland. Buckfast can cost around &pound;7.50 for a 75cl bottle (15% ABV), which equates to 66p per unit.</p>

  <p>Although no decision has been taken on a specific minimum price, it is unlikely that minimum pricing, on its own, will affect those drinks which are already expensive in comparison to their alcohol content. Any action to ban or restrict a specific product or products is likely to raise significant legal problems.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government aims to ensure that croft and croft house tenancies are held by persons who actively croft. The Scottish Government will make such representations as may be necessary in respect of UK Government proposals which appear to conflict with that aim. The valuation of a croft or croft house tenancy is not a matter for the Scottish Government.</p>

  <p>The aim of the Childsmile programme is to provide a Childsmile school service in the most disadvantaged Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) quintile in each NHS board. This is achieved by selecting the schools with the highest number of pupils with a postcode in the most deprived SIMD quintile. The aim is to cover approximately 20% of the children in a board area.</p>

  <p>The Childsmile School programme commenced in the East of Scotland, plus Ayrshire and Arran and recently expanded to include boards in the North of Scotland. Further expansion will take place in Grampian and Highland in the next financial year. Boards in the West of Scotland are now commencing the school programme with further expansion in the next financial year.</p>

  <p>The following table shows for each board area in which Childsmile School has commenced, the total number of primary schools and the number and percentage of schools participating in Childsmile School.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Serious Organised Crime Group Mapping Project was established in April 2008. Led by the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency in partnership with the Scottish Government all Scottish police forces, the Serious Organised Crime Agency, HMRC, and other agencies the project aimed to contribute to a safer and stronger Scotland by identifying the scale and impact of serious organised crime on Scotland, with a view to taking more effective action against this threat.</p>

  <p>Detailed information from the mapping project is not held centrally but a summary of the results are available on the SCDEA website:</p>

  <p>Serious Organised Crime Groups are not restricted by borders and many groups operate across all eight police forces in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Resources will be transferred to local authorities to help support the additional local activity associated with introducing and operating the quality assurance and moderation scheme for assessment for curriculum for excellence.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is currently in discussion with local government to quantify the additional activity required to support moderation for the new assessment arrangements and to agree the resources needed to ensure that teachers have the time required to undertake that activity. Local authorities will continue to prioritise CPD towards development and implementation of Curriculum for Excellence including assessment and moderation.</p>

  <p>Local government is fully committed to delivery of Curriculum for Excellence. Its representatives on the Curriculum for Excellence Management Board support the approach to moderation set out in the Framework for Assessment.</p>

  <p>The arrangements that are put in place will be the same as for previous general elections. Guidance on the conduct of Scottish Government civil servants during UK General Election periods is based on the principle that the Scottish Ministers will continue to carry out their devolved functions as usual. The Scottish Government will remain in office whatever the outcome, and the normal business of the Scottish Government and the Parliament should continue during the election period with as little disruption as possible.</p>

  <p>The total funding provided by the Scottish Government to local government in Scotland in 2009-10 for non domestic rates is &pound;2.165 billion. The poundage rate in Scotland has been maintained equal to that for England since 2007-08. It is below that set for Wales. Settlements in each year since 2007-08, including 2009-10, have allowed for this.</p>

  <p>This government&rsquo;s policy of maintaining parity with the English poundage has not been at the expense of our local government partners, who under this administration have seen their share of the Scottish budget, which had been in steady decline under the previous administration, increase year on year over the current spending review period. We estimate that the approach we have taken in setting the 2010-11 poundage rate for Scotland equal to that in England, following the 2010 revaluation, will deliver a benefit to Scottish businesses worth around &pound;220 million in that year.</p>

  <p>The First Minister announced on 1 December 2009 that Fiona Hyslop had replaced Michael Russell as Minister for Culture and External Affairs in attendance at the Cabinet and that the First Minister had assumed overall responsibility for the constitution and the forthcoming Referendum Bill.</p>

  <p>The First Minister leads on constitutional issues, supported by Ms Hyslop in relation to promoting Scotland&rsquo;s interests in inter-governmental relations with the UK Government and the other devolved administrations and supported by myself in relation to the Referendum Bill and preparations for a subsequent referendum, including continuing work in relation to the National Conversation.</p>

  <p>For the last flood risk years, the Scottish Government has provided SEPA with &pound;100,000 per year to support their annual campaign to raise public awareness of flood risk in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The campaign is carried out in partnership with local authorities and other delivery partners (including fire and rescue services), and involves a series of events throughout the year, including having an information trailer in attendance at events, ongoing advertising in community newspapers, cinemas, buses and at sports grounds in flood risk areas across Scotland. In recent years, it has also included touring plays about flooding - targeted at schools and adults in flood risk areas - and public information events in flood risk communities supported by local newspaper advertising and poster campaigns. SEPA is also planning a series of events this spring with accompanying media activity and community engagement to coincide with the opening of the new North East Flood Warning Scheme serving communities at risk from the rivers North Esk, Dee, Don and Deveron.</p>

  <p>We are also funding the &pound;8.6 million development of SEPA&rsquo;s new Floodline Warnings Direct service. This includes a significant, targeted campaign of awareness-raising prior to the launch of the new service in spring 2011, using community engagement, direct mail and media activity, aimed at people living in flood warning scheme areas.</p>

  <p>In addition, during the recent extreme weather conditions, a SEPA spokesperson and the Floodline number was included in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s &quot;Life Matters&quot; platform which broadcasts across the Bauer local radio network (Forth 1, Forth 2, Clyde 1, Clyde 2, Tay AM, Tay FM, Northsound 1, Northsound 2, Moray Firth Radio, West Sound (West Sound, West FM and South West Sound) and Radio Borders) reaching 40% of all Scottish adults per week. An audio clip by a SEPA spokesman was sent to community and local radio stations across Scotland. The Floodline number was also included within local newspaper adverts across 87 titles, reaching 65% of Scottish adults. SEPA web links were placed on the Scottish Government&rsquo;s website <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/weatherwise" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/weatherwise</a> which was the main port of call for all communication materials for the public information campaign during the recent severe weather.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has also provided funding to support the Scottish Flood Forum; a community-based organisation established to support and represent those who are affected by or are at risk of flooding. The forum also works with SEPA to ensure that its work links closely to SEPA&rsquo;s flood risk awareness raising activities.</p>

  <p>SEPA&rsquo;s Indicative flood risk maps, showing areas at risk from fluvial and coastal flooding are accessible on SEPA&rsquo;s website <a href="http://www.sepa.org.uk/flooding.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.sepa.org.uk/flooding.aspx</a>. We will be funding SEPA to produce a national flood risk assessment from all causes of flooding and improved mapping, under the Flood Risk Management (Scotland) Act 2009, by December 2011 and December 2013 respectively. Both SEPA&rsquo;s and our websites contain further information to improve understanding and awareness of flood risk in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The overarching aim of Scottish Planning Policy for flooding is that inappropriate development which would have a significant probability of being affected by flooding or would increase the probability of flooding elsewhere should not be permitted. Where development is likely to be at risk of flooding a planning authority must consult SEPA and if a planning authority wishes to approve development contrary to SEPA&rsquo;s views they are required to notify it to the Scottish Ministers who may or may not call it in for their own decision.</p>

  <p>The planning and building standards systems both play important roles in helping to safeguard developments from the consequences of flooding. Scottish Planning Policy requires that if development has to take place in medium to high flood risk areas, for example in an already built up area on the flood plain, developers and planning authorities should take account of the extent to which the development, its materials and construction are designed to be water resistant. The documents that support the Building Regulations and Planning Advice Note 69 provide guidance on suitable materials and water resistant construction methods.</p>

  <p>Insurance against the impact of flooding has been a standard feature of household insurance policies since the early 1960s. Financial services, including insurance, is a reserved matter, with the policy lead lying with HM Treasury. However, in December 2008, the Scottish Government agreed with the Association of British Insurers (ABI) a statement of principles to ensure that the risk from flooding is managed effectively and that flood insurance remains as affordable and widely available as possible so that Scottish consumers continue to be able to protect themselves from the financial cost of flooding. To achieve this, we have agreed to work together with the ABI on implementing a number of measures which include promoting access to insurance for low-income households.</p>

  <p>Ministers meet regularly with Scottish Enterprise and other key agencies on strategic issues, to ensure that their activities and resources are focused on the matters likely to make the most significant contribution to delivering sustainable economic growth. However, the Scottish Government is not involved routinely in detailed matters connected to the funding or refocusing of specific interventions. These are matters for the agencies themselves to determine, taking account of this overarching purpose and the need to optimise the value derived from their spend.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-30183 by Michael Russell on 14 January 2010, whether this answer indicates that interested parties are precluded from seeking its intervention in cases where they consider that a local authority consultation in relation to a proposed school closure is flawed, inaccurate and misleading and, if so, what recourse such parties have.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-02-03.S3W-30988.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80381" speakername="Michael Russell" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa0203.htm#17">

  <p>As specified in the answer to question S3W-30183 on 14 January 2010, under current regulations Scottish ministers&rsquo; involvement in local authority consultations on school closures is restricted exclusively to prescribed occupancy and distance criteria. Ministers do not have a locus to intervene otherwise, even if someone makes representations to them that they believe the authority&rsquo;s consultation to be flawed, inaccurate and misleading.</p>

  <p>In such circumstances parties could make a formal complaint under the council&rsquo;s complaints procedure or, if after following such action they remain dissatisfied, refer the matter to the Public Service Ombudsman. Ultimately, the complainant could pursue legal action if they consider that the local authority has not properly fulfilled its statutory responsibilities under the Education (Publication and Consultation Etc.) (Scotland) Regulations 1981.</p>

  <p>Once the Schools (Consultation) (Scotland) Act 2010 is commenced on 5 April 2010 the system for referring certain local authority decisions to ministers for consent will be replaced by a ministerial power to call in school closure decisions. In the case of someone believing the authority&rsquo;s consultation to be flawed, inaccurate and misleading they will be able to make representations to ministers requesting that the decision is called in.</p>

  <p>Schedule 3 of the Schools (Consultation) (Scotland) Act 2010 sets out transitional arrangements for handling consultations underway at the point of commencement of the act on 5 April 2010.</p>

  <p>Consultations on proposed school closures that commence before 5 April 2010 should be conducted under the new process set out in the act unless a decision is taken by the council before commencement.</p>

  <p>Should a decision be taken before commencement then it would still be liable to referral to Scottish Ministers for consent if it meets the criteria (as set out in the answer to the question S3W-30183 on 14 January 2010).</p>

  <p>Should a decision be taken after commencement the consultation would be required to meet the requirements as set out in the Schools (Consultation) Act 2010.</p>

  <p>No. Scottish Ministers will only have the power to call in a local authority school closure decision after the Schools (Consultation) (Scotland) Act 2010 has commenced on 5 April 2010, regardless of whether or not the authority has chosen to consult using the new process set out in the act.

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Due to the way information is collected it is not possible to split the Scottish Government Core information by directorate for all years or by directorate general (DG) for 2007-08.</p>

  <p>2. In 2007-08, recruitment advertising orders for some agencies were placed through the Scottish Government core and the spend is included in the core figure.</p>

  <p>3. As a result of the simplification exercise Mental Health Tribunal and parts of Communities Scotland integrated into the Scottish Government core during this period after which any recruitment spend will be included in the relevant DG area. Some Mental Health Tribunal recruitment spend is reported against Scottish Government Health DG during 2008-09.</p>

  <p>4. Information is provided for the Scottish Government Core and those Agencies for which information is collected centrally by Scottish Government HR, excluding non-ministerial departments, and against which spend is recorded. All spend is ex VAT and as invoiced direct by TMP during the appropriate period.</p>

  <p>5. Scottish Housing Regulator did not exist until April 2008.</p>

  <p>It is for individual local authorities to consider the financial, environmental and any other relevant implications of developing facilities including artificial playing surfaces. A wide range of practical and technical advice is available to local authorities from sportscotland on the planning and development of facilities.</p>
