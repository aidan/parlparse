  <p>All Scottish local authorities are currently in the process of developing Local Biodiversity Action Plans (LBAP). Six have so far been published. They are: City of Edinburgh, Dumfries and Galloway, Fife, North East Scotland (which combines Aberdeenshire and Aberdeen City Councils), North Lanarkshire and West Lothian.</p>

  <p>I understand that Greenpeace in Germany claim to have found tributyl tin (TBT) in disposable babies&#8217; nappies. The levels reported do not appear to give rise to a risk of harm, but, as a precautionary measure, the UK is conducting research into TBT in UK consumer products, including nappies.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to inform members that excellent progress has been made. Learning and Teaching Scotland were commissioned to draft the new documents recommended by the working group. The documents are: <i>Guidance for Schools and Local Authorities on effective Consultation with Parents and Carers, A Guide for Parents and Carers</i> on Sex Education in Scottish Schools and A <i> Summary of National Advice</i> on Sex Education in Scottish Schools for local authorities in schools. Consultation on these documents will commence on 9 October. A draft circular for local authorities on the conduct of sex education will be issued at the same time.</p>

  <p>Training for young people with support needs is delivered by Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise through their network of local companies and the Skillseekers programme. There are a range of training providers which offer supportive training for disadvantaged school leavers.</p>

  <p>The Beattie Committee examined post-school provision for young people with additional support needs. The Scottish Executive has established a National Action Group chaired by Nicol Stephen to implement action in response to the Beattie Report.</p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise together with other agencies are developing post-school provision for disadvantaged young people.</p>
