  <p>Procurators fiscal are authorised by section 302 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 to issue conditional offers of a fixed penalty (commonly referred to as fiscal fines) as an alternative to prosecution in relation to any offence in respect of which an alleged offender could competently be tried before a district court.</p>

  <p>Under section 7(8) of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995, the district court does not have jurisdiction to try any of the following common law offences:</p>

  <p>(a) murder, culpable homicide, robbery, rape, wilful fireraising or attempted wilful fireraising;</p>

  <p>(b) theft by housebreaking, housebreaking with intent to steal;</p>

  <p>(c) theft or reset, falsehood fraud or wilful imposition, breach of trust or embezzlement, where the value of the property is an amount exceeding level 4 on the standard scale;</p>

  <p>(d) assault causing fracture of a limb, assault with intent to ravish, assault to the danger of life, or assault by stabbing;</p>

  <p>(e) uttering forged documents or uttering forged bank or banker&#8217;s notes or offences under the acts relating to coinage.</p>

  <p>Section 7(8) has not been amended since it came into force in 1996. Confidential guidance has been issued to procurators fiscal regarding their use of fiscal fines as an alternative to prosecution, which includes directions as to situations in which procurators fiscal must not issue a fiscal fine. These include cases involving overtones of sexual behaviour or racial motivation or aggravation and cases involving the possession of Class A drugs.</p>

  <p>The use of dogs for the exclusive purpose of locating hedgehogs was trialled on North Uist this year by the Uist Wader Project, a partnership comprising Scottish Natural Heritage, the RSPB and the Scottish Executive. The dogs were accompanied by trained handlers and were not used to hunt or capture hedgehogs.</p>

  <p>The Title Conditions (Scotland) Act 2003 provides a property law regime for enforcing conditions in the title deeds of land which safeguard conservation interests. It provides for a conservation body, prescribed by Scottish ministers, to be able to enforce a particular condition affecting a certain piece of land. Both the conditions and the body will have to seek to protect, for the benefit of the public:</p>

  <p>the architectural or historical characteristics of the land (which includes buildings), or</p>

  <p>any other special characteristics of the land (including a special characteristic derived from the flora, fauna or general appearance of the land).</p>

  <p>These burdens can be used when the conservation body is selling land, but imposes a condition to ensure that the conservation characteristics of the property are not lost.</p>

  <p>It will also be possible for conservation bodies to preserve existing feudal burdens as conservation burdens, provided that they meet the criteria for conservation burdens. The deadline for saving burdens will be the Appointed Day on which the feudal system is finally abolished. We have already announced that this will be on 28 November 2004.</p>

  <p>The Executive is currently in the process of inviting applications from those interested in becoming conservation bodies. Those who would like to be considered should contact the following address:</p>

  <p>Iain Hockenhull, Civil Law Division, 2 West Rear, St Andrew's House, Edinburgh, EH1 3DG.</p>

  <p>Phone/e-mail: 0131 244 8228; iain.hockenhull&#064;scotland.gsi.gov.uk</p>
