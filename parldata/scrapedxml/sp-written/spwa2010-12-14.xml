  <p>We are aware of a number of published studies suggesting links between thyroid diseases and breast cancer, however, evidence of an association is inconclusive and the issue continues to be the subject of debate. If individuals have any concerns, they should discuss these with their GP in the first instance.</p>

  <p>There are steps people can take to reduce their risk of developing breast cancer, for example, being more active, keeping bodyweight within healthy limits and limiting alcohol consumption. The Scottish Government is implementing a wide ranging programme of actions to help people to make healthier lifestyle choices.</p>

  <p>The Keep Well and Well North programmes continue to deliver inequalities targeted health checks to those living in Scotland&rsquo;s most deprived communities.

  <p>Those people, identified through Keep Well, who are found to be at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease, including diabetes, are provided with appropriate treatment and where appropriate referred to further services aimed at reducing the risks to their health and promoting healthier lifestyles.</p>

  <p>To date, over 91,000 individuals have received a Keep Well health check. The Scottish Government plans to mainstream the Keep Well and Well North programmes from April 2012.</p>

  <p>The new Additional Support Needs National Advocacy Service will be delivered by a partnership between Barnardo&rsquo;s and the Scottish Child Law Centre.</p>

  <p>Barnardo&rsquo;s, which submitted the application on behalf of the partners, was informed that the application had been successful on 15 October. A short introductory meeting was held with both Barnardo&rsquo;s and the Scottish Child Law Centre on 21 October. This provided an opportunity for Scottish Government officials to meet the key individuals who would be involved in delivering the service, to provide some feedback on the application and to discuss key actions in disseminating information about the new service.</p>

  <p>The Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2009 places a legal duty on Scottish ministers to secure the provision of an advocacy service to be available on request and free of charge to support parents and young people in tribunal proceedings. The Scottish Government decided to run a competitive grant process to identify one or more organisation that would be awarded a grant to provide advocacy services. Pre-qualification questionnaires were not part of the grant process.</p>

  <p>The Educational Development Research and Services (Scotland) Regulations 1999 and the Education (Additional Support for Learning) Scotland Act 2009 provide the legal basis for the payment of such a grant.</p>

  <p>The information is not held centrally but the Scottish Government is able to estimate the extra fuel required by using data held in the Scottish House Condition Survey. This is modelled information using a standard heating regime to remove the vagaries of individual household use and behaviours but provides consistency of output for each of the areas concerned.</p>

  <p>The output for each area would reflect the differences in:</p>

  <p>Profile of housing stock types;</p>

  <p>Fuel use distribution across each of those dwelling types;</p>

  <p>Geographical differences such as latitude and elevation, and</p>

  <p>Climatic variation such as the degree day region and average wind-speed.</p>

  <p>The following table shows the estimated percentage for the differences in the principal heating system fuels and the difference overall.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to supporting and improving the education of all children and young people. All children should benefit from an education system that is engaging, relevant, tailored to their needs and best prepares them for their future lives. Curriculum for Excellence should lead to improved quality of learning and teaching and increased attainment and achievement for all children and young people, irrespective of where that learning takes place.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises that some children and young people need extra help to enable them to benefit fully from education and is currently providing funding of &pound;65,000 in this financial year to the Scottish Traveller Education Programme (STEP). STEP aims to improve educational opportunities for Scotland&rsquo;s travelling communities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is also providing up to &pound;50,000 to the STEP <em>eLearning and Traveller Education Scotland</em> (eLATES) programme in 2010-11. The e-learning community programme provides distance learning with &quot;anytime anywhere&quot; access for Gypsy/Traveller and travelling show and fairground young people.</p>

  <p>Recommendations on risk factors identify the need for procedures to ensure all women are routinely assessed during the antenatal period for a history of depression; that psychosocial and biological risk factors for postnatal depression and puerperal psychosis should routinely be recorded in the antenatal period, and that pregnant women and their partners should be given information during the antenatal period on the nature of postnatal mood disorders and puerperal psychosis.</p>

  <p>Clinicians will discuss with their patients all aspects of their care including information and advice on treatment options where the evidence base is strongest and which will achieve the best possible outcomes.</p>

  <p>Those assessed as requiring evidence based psychological therapies will have those arranged and delivered in line with national clinical guidelines and on the basis of a thorough needs assessment. In this respect, we are committed to increasing access to evidence based psychological therapies for all. We are including a specific access target in HEAT in 2011-12.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, the question of access generally to the internet by patients who are subject to detention in hospital under the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 is a matter for the hospital concerned in terms of individual patient care and applying the principles of the act.</p>

  <p>The Scottish budget is good for policing. The police have accepted that it will enable them to maintain police numbers at a level 1,000 above that of March 2007. It is up to police authorities and joint boards how to live within their budgets and how many support staff to employ. We are confident that they will make decisions that maintain frontline services to our communities.</p>

  <p>The government has already put in place a number of measures that demonstrates its commitment to ensuring that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are given fair opportunity to bid for public contracts. In April 2009, I wrote to heads of procurement and chief executives throughout the Scottish public sector setting out my expectation that they take Six Simple Steps, to promote access to public sector contracts for SMEs, social enterprises and third sector bodies. <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/1265/0080942.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/1265/0080942.pdf</a></p>

  <p>Earlier this year, in partnership with Scottish Chambers of Commerce, we established a working group with representatives from the public, private and third sector to explore additional ways to enhance the economic impact of public procurement and ways to enhance access to contract opportunities, particularly by smaller organisations. We have also implemented a website for free contract email alert service.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Living Wage was established in 2009 at &pound;7.00 per hour. The minimum rate of pay of staff in the government in 2009 was set in 2008 as part of a three-year pay award and before the establishment of the Scottish Living Wage. At that time, 95.1% of the 5,591 staff were paid above &pound;7.00 per hour.</p>

  <p>Since the Scottish Living Wage was only established in 2009, there are no comparison figures for the years prior to that date.</p>

  <p>Vaccination policy in Scotland is based on advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), an independent expert advisory committee that provides advice to the four UK administrations.</p>

  <p>On 29 March 2010, the JCVI published its recommendations on the shingles (herpes zoster) vaccine. The JCVI recommended that people aged 70 to 79 years should be vaccinated against shingles if the vaccine can be purchased at a cost effective price.</p>

  <p>The current sole manufacturer of shingles vaccine, Sanofi Pasteur, announced in April this year that it is not currently able to supply enough vaccine to support a vaccination programme across the UK. It is not possible to consider implementation of a vaccination programme in line with JCVI advice until this position changes and sufficient stocks of vaccine are available. This will be kept under review.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it considers that a properly functioning network of deer management groups is vital to delivering sustainable deer management.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government takes the view that collaboration and participation in deer management groups is the most effective way to deliver sustainable deer management. This applies to most of the red deer range in the uplands. In the lowlands where roe deer predominate, other arrangements are likely to be more appropriate, and public authorities are more likely to play a key role in deer management.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the average level of attendance at deer management group meetings was in the last two calendar years, expressed as a percentage of estate owners or their representatives who are members of these groups.</p>

  <p>Scottish Natural Heritage does not collect systematic data on deer management group membership or attendance. An attempt to assess attendance was carried out for the year 2009-10. This assessment indicates that 63% of landowners who are members of a deer management group, or their representatives, attend meetings.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government takes the view that collaboration and participation in deer management groups is the most effective way to deliver sustainable deer management. We recognise, however, that attendance and practical engagement within deer management groups needs to better represent a wider range of both public and private interests.</p>
