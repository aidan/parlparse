  <p>The resources provided to councils by the Scottish Executive and Communities Scotland for projects involving partial transfers of housing stock are as follows:</p>

  <p><table border="BORDER" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="50%">

</table></p>

  <p>A further &#163;29.5 million will be made available in future years to allow councils to complete these projects.</p>

  <p>Resources which may be available from Communities Scotland for any other partial transfer projects will be determined in the context of strategic local housing strategies and within the overall level of resources available in the Communities Scotland programme.</p>

  <p>UK Government research, published in 2001, indicated that 18% of people killed in road accidents had used illegal drugs. This represented a six-fold increase in the incidence of such drugs since a similar survey in the mid-1980s. There was no change in the incidence of medicinal drugs (6%) since the previous survey. It is not possible to say that the drugs present in an individual's system caused any of these accidents, merely that drugs were detected in the victim's system.</p>

  <p>Research on recreational drug use and driving, published by the Scottish Executive in 2001, found that:</p>

  <p>nearly 10% of drivers aged 17 to 39 have driven under the influence of illegal drugs;</p>

  <p>cannabis is the most common drug to have been used by drug drivers;</p>

  <p>drug driving is more prevalent among 20- to 24-year-old age group, and</p>

  <p>driving after recreational drug use is widespread among people attending night-clubs and dance venues.</p>

  <p>No element of the grant-in-aid allocated to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) is ring-fenced for any specific purpose. Under the Spending Review 2002 SEPA has been allocated, subject to parliamentary approval, additional resources of &#163;11.2 million for the period 2003-04 to 2005-06 to cover a range of new duties. This included additional funding to develop an online pollution emissions inventory. It is, however, for SEPA to decide what proportion of the extra funding is to be devoted to developing the pollution inventory.</p>

  <p>The SIGN Guideline highlights the causes of venous thromboembolism and the steps that can be taken to reduce the risk of developing the condition. The particular risk of occurrence during long air flights is well understood and publicised, including airlines&rsquo; own in-flight information. The SIGN Guideline, and associated quick reference guide, contain advice which should be given to all travellers on minimising their risk of thrombosis when travelling long distances, especially by air. They also include detailed advice on the prophylactic methods which should be considered for patients at high risk of thrombosis. Anyone planning long-distance air travel who is concerned about the subject should consult their GP before starting their journey.</p>

  <p>Planning and licensing controls are for different statutory and policy purposes and we have no plans to amend the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 in the manner suggested. In those instances where the owner needs both a licence and planning permission he or she has a legal duty to obtain each of them. Local authorities may wish to encourage HMO owners to obtain any necessary planning permission in advance of submitting a licence application to avoid the possibility of abortive work.</p>

  <p>Goods which are on hire purchase or the subject of a conditional sale agreement, which are on the premises only temporarily or which belong to a member of the tenant's family or to a lodger are all exempt from sequestration for rent. Also, any third party, whose property has been included in the sequestration, may apply to the court to be included as an interested party to the court action and may seek recall of the sequestration in respect of his property. Where a warrant of sale has been granted, he may apply to have all other items sold before his.</p>

  <p>Landlord's hypotech and sequestration for rent were discussed in the recent consultation document <i>Enforcement of Civil Obligations in Scotland </i>and consultees were asked for their views on whether sequestration for rent should be abolished.

  <p>The Lord Advocate has already taken steps to clarify the law on consent in rape cases. Last year, he referred the case of Edward Watt to the High Court and secured a ruling that clarified the definition of rape in Scots law. The High Court held that the general rule relating to the law of rape is correctly stated by reference to a woman&rsquo;s lack of consent. This ruling should make prosecution possible in some cases in which it was not previously possible. In view of this clarification we do not consider that there is currently any need for further work to be undertaken in this area.</p>

  <p>Action to prevent marine pollution remains a function of the UK Government. However, the role of the Scottish Executive, and a number of other statutory bodies, is set out in the <i>National Contingency Plan for Marine Pollution from Shipping and Offshore Installations</i> (NCP). The plan is tested annually and the most recent national oil spill exercise, which included participation by the Scottish Executive and a number of its agencies, was conducted in the Firth of Forth in October. A copy of the plan is available in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre, (Bib. number 17730). There is also an Operating Agreement between the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) and the Scottish Executive on Marine Pollution Contingency Planning.</p>

  <p>In the event of an oil spill in waters adjacent to Scotland, the MCA would alert the Scottish Executive and its agencies. The Executive and its agencies would be involved in any Shoreline Response Centre and Environment Group set up under the terms of the NCP to deal with the incident. In addition, the Scottish Executive is responsible as licensing authority for approving the use of chemical dispersants in shallow coastal waters.</p>

  <p>No instructions have yet been issued about the allocation of the resources estimated to be required for the Mental Health (Scotland) Bill currently before the Parliament, if that is the context of this question. The Financial Memorandum accompanying the bill estimated annual costs for the Scottish Executive and local authorities from 2004-05 as totalling &#163;17.1 million, with a further &#163;6 million per annum for NHS Scotland to be met from the substantial funding increases already announced.</p>

  <p>A research programme is being developed within the Executive to support, monitor and evaluate the proposed Mental Health (Scotland) Bill. This programme will include research on the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984, for comparative purposes. We know that admissions to hospital under section 18 have risen steadily (nearly doubling between 1990-91 and 2001-02). An important element of the work planned will be an analysis of case records to explore the characteristics of, and outcomes for, people subject to detention under section 18 since 1990.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The answer to (SPS) question S1W-29277 dealt with an operational and contractual matter for SPS, based on the policy most recently set out by ministers on 11 November 2002 in the protocol referred to in the answer to S1W-31449 today. The new prison referred to in the answer to S1W-29277 will provide a new service to the SPS. It will not involve the transfer of an existing service and existing staff to a private provider, so it will not result in the creation of a two-tier workforce.</p>

  <p>The bill provides for a list of persons unsuitable to work with children to be established. We have proposed amendments at stage 2 that will extend to all organisations employing individuals in child care positions (whether voluntary or statutory) the duty to refer individuals to the list if they have harmed a child or put a child at risk of harm. All organisations will commit an offence if they fail to comply with this duty or employ an individual, in a child care position, who is on the list. We are considering appropriate support, advice and training for all organisations in implementation.</p>

  <p>Local authorities have the discretion to decide how and where their allocations will be spent and some local authorities in urban areas have chosen to fund &quot;dial-a-ride&quot; and other community transport services.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to improving access to transport, and is supporting public transport improvements for many groups who would benefit from community transport. It has introduced free travel for blind people and is improving concessionary bus fare arrangements for pensioners and disabled people so that they now benefit from free local off-peak bus travel.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Executive recently launched the Mobility and Access Committee for Scotland to give disabled people the chance to air their views on transport matters and advise ministers of any practical improvements which could be put in place. The committee's work programme for the coming year will include an investigation into on demand &quot;door-to-door&quot; community transport services.</p>

  <p>We are considering the range of offences that trigger registration on the sex offenders register with the UK Government in order to ensure that the register continues to provide comparable protection throughout the UK.</p>

  <p>Statistical information relevant to the Sexual Offences (Procedure and Evidence)(Scotland) Act 2002 is being collected as from 1 November 2002, the date on which the act came into force. Qualitative research to assess the impact of the act will be commissioned once the new provisions have been in operation for a sufficient period to make such research meaningful. We also plan shortly to commission research on the operation of the pre-2002 law of evidence in sex offence trials, to provide baseline data for the future evaluation of the impact of the act.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is liaising closely with the UK Government on the implementation of the speed policy proposals in the UK road safety strategy <i>Tomorrow&rsquo;s Roads &ndash; Safer for Everyone</i> , which includes the development of a rural road hierarchy for speed management purposes. Copies of the strategy are available in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib number 5711).</p>

  <p>Following the UK Government&rsquo;s response in October to the Transport, Local Government and the Regions Committee&rsquo;s report, <i>Road Traffic Speed</i>, a programme of work is now under way to develop better speed management across the rural road network. This work includes village speed limit entry signing, a simplified method of speed limit order making and the development of a speed management assessment framework that will establish exactly what speeds are being driven on rural roads. All this will feed into plans to revise the guidance to local authorities in Scotland and elsewhere on the setting of local speed limits. A copy of the response is available at:</p>
