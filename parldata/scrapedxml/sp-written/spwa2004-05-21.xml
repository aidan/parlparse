In addition, the Route Development Fund&#8217;s stringent evaluation process ensures that, where there is any doubt about an airline&#8217;s ability to maintain operations, the case for investment does not go beyond pre-qualification consideration.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether, in light of the decline in the red grouse population, the consequent decline in the number of hen harriers resident on the Langholm moors and the designation of the moor as a Special Protection Area, it has any plans to encourage the reintroduction of professional grouse keepers to increase the hen harrier population.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2004-05-21.4.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80128" speakername="Allan Wilson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-04/wa0521.htm#2">

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no plans to reintroduce professional grouse keepers to increase the hen harrier population.</p>

  <p>There is no scientific evidence to link the decline of breeding hen harriers at Langholm moors with a decline in red grouse. Numbers of breeding hen harriers present on moorland areas instead appear to be related principally to the abundance of voles and meadow pipits in spring.</p>

  <p>Scottish Natural Heritage has recently launched a Natural Care Moorland Management Scheme for its Forth and Borders Area. This covers a number of Sites of Special Scientific Interest including the Langholm - Newcastleton Hills Special Protection Area. There is a variety of prescriptions available under this scheme which will support and sustain the important moorland features of each site. Some of these prescriptions are associated with sporting management for red grouse shooting. Support for muirburn will be available on all sites. Support for legal predator control will be available on three areas, including Langholm, as part of a trial study.</p>

  <p>The Executive funded organisations, Cycling Scotland and the Scottish Road Safety Campaign (SRSC) are working in collaboration to extend the current Scottish Cycle Training Scheme (SCTS). The SCTS was completely revamped in 2000 by the SRSC. Since Cycling Scotland&#8217;s inception in October 2003, the two organisations have been liaising on additional cycle training provision. Cycling Scotland now offers basic training called Ready Steady Bike. After undertaking this course, children will have the basic skills to progress to SCTS training provided by local Road Safety Units. However, children who have not completed Ready Steady Bike will not be excluded from the SCTS. A more advanced course of instruction is offered by Cycling Scotland which tackles more complex cycling tasks such as negotiating roundabouts, greenways and cycle lanes. Cycling Scotland has also embarked on a training programme for adult cycle trainers. The SCTS teaching notes are currently being reviewed to include: links with the SRSC&#8217;s Streetsense road safety resource for primary schools; information about more advanced cycling instruction through Cycling Scotland, and reference to the Executive funded school travel co-ordinators.</p>

  <p>The Executive is working with the UK Government to tackle emissions of fluorinated gases. Existing measures have focussed mainly on reducing emissions through recovery and containment, rather than minimising use. These measures are outlined in the partial Regulatory Impact Assessment that accompanied the recent UK consultation on an European Commission proposal for a new EC regulation to reduce emissions of certain fluorinated gases. The proposal, which is currently being considered by EU member states and the European Parliament, includes provisions on the containment, reporting and marketing and use of fluorinated gases. The consultation document and partial Regulatory Impact Assessment are available on the Executive&#8217;s climate change website at www.scotland.gov.uk/climatechange.

  <p>No. The Bull Hire Scheme was intended to deliver improvement to cattle stocks not as a form of financial support for crofting groups. The members of participating groups continue to have access to the full range of agricultural support schemes available in the Highlands and Islands and to the special assistance available to crofters and persons of like status through the Crofting Counties Agricultural Grants Scheme. In due course they will also have access to the grant scheme that will replace the Bull Hire Scheme.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is supporting the development of both the tram and the heavy rail link to Edinburgh Airport. Each of these schemes will serve different markets. A tram link to the airport would provide fast access from various parts of the city, whilst the heavy rail link has the potential to link Edinburgh airport with the entire Scottish rail network. The development of both projects is being taken forward by Transport Initiatives Edinburgh.</p>

  <p>The regulation and safety of medicines is reserved and is the responsibility of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The MHRA has advised that since October 2003 the following vaccines have had thiomersal removed from the manufacturing formulation of the bulk vaccine and consequently the finished products:</p>

  <p>Tetavax - adsorbed Tetanus Vaccine;</p>

  <p>Diftavax - adsorbed Diphtheria and Tetanus Vaccine for adults and adolescents;</p>

  <p>Influvac - influenza vaccine, surface antigen, inactivated, and</p>

  <p>Mastaflu - influenza vaccine, surface antigen, inactivated.</p>

  <p>Thiomersal is not used in the manufacturing process therefore these vaccines do not contain a manufacturing residue.</p>
