  <p>Home, community and residential alcohol detoxification services are available across Scotland. The Executive's <em>Plan for Action on alcohol problems</em> , which was published on 18 January, acknowledges the need to improve alcohol problems services and fill gaps in current provision, including detoxification, if this is appropriate. It requires local Alcohol Action Teams to assess needs in their areas and produce plans to address these by April 2003. The Executive issued a framework for support and treatment services in September to act as a guide for local plans.</p>

  <p>The Executive's <em>Plan for Action on alcohol problems</em> , published in January, sets out a range of measures to reduce alcohol-related harm in Scotland. Reducing binge drinking is one of the two key priorities of the plan and the How Much is Too Much? national communications strategy, launched in April, specifically targets male and female binge drinkers in the 18 to 35 age range. The plan requires Alcohol Action Teams to assess needs in their areas and produce local prevention and communications strategies to address these by April 2003. At present we have no plans for a parliamentary debate.</p>

  <p>Improving services for all children, especially those at risk, is a key priority for the Scottish Executive. The Cabinet Sub-Committee on Children's Services is driving forward better integration of policy, funding and delivery of children&#8217;s services. We also set up an inter-agency audit and review of child protection with the aim of reducing the number of children being abused and neglected and to improve services for those who have experienced abuse or neglect. The report will be published on 25 November and we will respond fully to any recommendations that are made.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-30597 by Cathy Jamieson on 29 October 2002, whether the "normal" upper age limit of 60 for recruitment as a member of a children's panel is discriminatory.</p>

  <p>The age limit is applied flexibly in recognition of the recommendation of the Kilbrandon Committee that panel members should in broad terms be the peers in age of the parents of the children coming before the hearings.</p>

  <p>The application of age limits for panel member recruitment is not therefore discriminatory.</p>

The protocol represents a genuine partnership and flows from our approach of attempting to achieve reform by building consensus.

  <p>Regional selective assistance (RSA) plays a key role in meeting the Executive's commitment to closing the opportunity gap by helping to create and sustain jobs in the assisted areas of Scotland, thereby addressing areas of relatively high disadvantage and unemployment.</p>

  <p>This commitment has recently been further strengthened by a direct link with the New Deal scheme, under which firms can be offered a premium rate of grant as a targeted incentive to recruit and retain New Dealers.</p>

  <p>The Executive is also committed to sustainable development, and in the recent spending review we committed to assessing all RSA applications involving grant offers of &#163;2 million and over against the Executive's sustainable development objectives.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how much funding it has provided to help (a) local authorities and (b) voluntary organisations meet the National Care Standards set in accordance with the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-11-21.S1W-31465.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80199" speakername="Mr Frank McAveety" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa1121.htm#25">

  <p>Responsibility for meeting the National Care Standards is a matter for individual providers in discussion and agreement with the Care Commission.</p>

  <p>The principal source of income to enable providers to meet regulatory standards is the fees they receive. The Scottish Executive is committed to implementing in full the recommendations of the National Review Group on care home fees. We have already committed &#163;52.5 million since July 2001 for that purpose, and discussions are under way with the local authorities and the providers about the appropriate fee levels for 2003-04.</p>

  <p>There are also other Scottish Executive initiatives which will indirectly contribute to a provider&#8217;s ability to meet specific standards:</p>

  <p>Voluntary organisations can make applications to the Scottish Executive for funding under section 9 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act to help with training costs.</p>

  <p>Cathy Jamieson announced earlier this year an Action Plan for Social Services Workforce which included &#163;3.5 million for local authorities in 2002-03 for training social services staff.</p>

  <p>An additional &#163;9.2 million has been allocated for the expansion and development of the early years workforce from 2002-04. A further &#163;6 million per annum is committed during the period 2004-06. This funding is allocated through child care partnerships, and can be used for workforce expansion and development in the local authority, private and voluntary sectors.</p>

  <p>The Care Commission has discretion in applying the standards, taking into account the nature of the services being provided. For example, in the case of care homes for older people, where existing provision cannot meet the standards but is otherwise of good quality, specific criteria may be agreed with the Care Commission officers to allow existing rooms to remain in use.</p>

  <p>In taking forward the development of the National Care Standards Scottish ministers have been mindful of the need to balance the user/improved quality of care focus of the standards with the need to recognise the commercial realities for providers. Likewise, in implementing the standards the Care Commission will aim to work in partnership with the providers to reach an agreed way forward.</p>
