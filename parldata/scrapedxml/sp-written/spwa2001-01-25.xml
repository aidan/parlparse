  <p>A review of Schedule 4 to the Wildlife and Countryside Act is also being undertaken, in co-operation with the Department of the Environment, Transport and Regions (DETR) and the Welsh Assembly.

  <p><i>The Strategy for Carers in Scotland </i> is aimed at addressing the needs of carers for better information and more flexible health and social care support. Financial support to carers through the social security and benefits system remains the responsibility of the UK Government. We welcome the Government&#8217;s recently announced packages of financial measures to help carers. The measures include substantial increases in the weekly Carer Premium, an increase in the earnings limit for Invalid Care Allowance (ICA) and extending eligibility for ICA to carers over the age of 65, all of which should help deliver improvements in the living standards of many Scottish carers.</p>

Ministers expect SNH, in their current budgeting round, to allocate substantially increased resources to the management of protected areas.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Rural Stewardship Scheme will support environmentally friendly farming practices to maintain and enhance important habitats. Preference will be given to applications from farmers and crofters who manage protected nature conservation sites. Provision for agri-environment schemes is &#163;21.5 million for 2001-02.</p>

  <p>These include powers to direct the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) to refuse, grant, vary or revoke an application for authorisation; to require certain applications to be determined by the Scottish Ministers and to cause a local inquiry to be held in relation to such an application; after consultation with the Secretary of State to direct SEPA to restrict knowledge of applications on the grounds of national security, and to determine appeals against the decisions of SEPA.

  <p>The Executive is committed to ensuring that young people from all backgrounds have the opportunity to access further and higher education.</p>

  <p>In higher education, our proposals for improving student support will particularly benefit those from the lowest income backgrounds. We have yet to announce details of improvements in the system of support for further education students, but they too will have a similar focus.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Further Education Funding Council provides a funding premium to colleges for students from socially disadvantaged areas. Similarly, the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council has been asked to devise a mechanism to provide additional support to institutions which reflects the extent to which they provide for students from under-represented groups.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive supports and encourages such opportunities.</p>

  <p>Scotland&#8217;s <i>National Cultural Strategy</i>, published in August 2000, promotes creativity in the arts and other cultural activity, especially by children and young people. A key priority is to recognise and celebrate schools as centres of creativity.</p>

  <p>The Executive is providing &#163;27 million to 2002 under the Excellence Fund Core Programme for study support, some of which will have a creative element.</p>

  <p>The New Opportunities Fund has made available over &#163;23 million for out of school hours learning activity and over &#163;25 million for out of school care. The learning activity includes creative ventures in the arts to help raise the self-esteem and confidence of pupils.

  <p>Assistance will be provided to those affected through dedicated local action teams in accordance with the principles outlined in the Scottish Executive PACE framework. I understand that the company has pledged to co-operate fully with the PACE team. The economic needs of the Borders are being addressed by the New <i> </i> Ways strategy, which has made a number of significant achievements since its launch in March 1999. The Borders Economic Development Forum is leading the way in turning this good start into more jobs, more growth and more prosperity for the people of the Scottish Borders. Scottish Enterprise Borders has been allocated an additional &#163;2.312 million in 2000-01 for its local action plan, the third year of additional funding, in recognition of the particular needs of the region. I intend to visit the Borders on 14 February to hear at first hand about the issues facing the area and the work under way to build on the successes already achieved.</p>

  <p>I will launch the European Year of Languages in Scotland on Monday 22 January at Stirling University. A Scottish committee has been established to promote Scottish involvement in the year through education, business and cultural networks, and a series of events is already planned in school and community facilities throughout Scotland.</p>

  <p>Any economic assessment of the proposed new ferry service between Gill&#8217;s Bay and Orkney is primarily a commercial matter for the promoters of the project. The Scottish Executive has no information about whether an economic assessment has been undertaken.</p>

  <p>Personal Medical Services (PMS) operate under the NHS (Primary Care) Act 1997 and introduce flexibility to primary care services by meeting specific local needs through PMS pilots. Pilot GPs can be salaried either to Primary Care Trusts or within practices or pilots can be practice-based (where the GPs remain independent contractors but have a locally agreed contract). There are currently 15 PMS pilots in Scotland. Regulations state that Scottish Ministers may introduce the permanent PMS option if a review of pilot schemes has taken place and they are satisfied that it would be in the interests of any part of the health service to introduce permanency.</p>

  <p>A review of Scotland&#8217;s first round pilots has recently been completed and, from this, I have concluded that the permanent PMS option would be of benefit to the NHS in Scotland. A copy of the review is available in SPICe and SHOW. A copy has also been sent to the Health and Community Care Committee, health boards, Primary Care Trusts and representative bodies.</p>

  <p>I am therefore pleased to announce that a Permanent Personal Medical Services (PMS) option will be available to GPs and to Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) from April 2001. This will mean that, for the first time, PCTs will be able to employ salaried GPs directly on a permanent basis to help recruitment and retention in deprived and remote and rural areas. This permanent PMS option will also enable PCTs and practices to develop local contracts to meet the specific needs of their local communities.</p>

  <p>Regulations bringing this permanent option into force will be circulated to Parliament and to representative bodies for comment in February 2001.</p>

  <p>Source: ISD Scotland/General Register&#8217;s Office (Scotland), 1999 postcode allocations to parliamentary constituencies and health board areas.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The boundaries of four constituencies span more than one health board area. In such cases, in the table above, the health board with the highest number of individual postcodes is shown. Full details are:</p>

  <p>Coatbridge &amp; Chryston spans Lanarkshire and Greater Glasgow Health Boards;</p>

  <p>Eastwood spans Greater Glasgow and Argyll &amp; Clyde Health Boards;</p>

  <p>Ochil spans Forth Valley and Tayside Health Boards;</p>

  <p>Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale spans Borders and Lothian Health Boards.</p>

  <p>2. Although local NHS Trusts are shown it is stressed that patients within each parliamentary constituency will be treated in other Trusts in Scotland, particularly for specialist services which are not available locally.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has today received the Millan Committee&#8217;s report of its review of the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984. Copies of the report, entitled <i>New Directions</i> , have been placed in the Parliamentary Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>The Executive warmly welcomes this report and is grateful to Mr Millan and his committee for undertaking such a comprehensive and thorough review, which addresses the shift in emphasis in mental health care and treatment in recent years, and the greater recognition of the rights of patients and their families. The report also takes account of the MacLean Committee&#8217;s recommendations in relation to offenders with mental disorder.</p>

  <p>The Executive will now be considering the report&#8217;s recommendations, consulting as appropriate on key issues. A reference group of relevant interests is being set up to assist this process. The aim is to publish a policy statement in the summer, setting out, as promised in <i>Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change</i>, proposals for a modern legislative framework to meet the needs of people with a mental illness who require care and support, both in hospital and the community.</p>

  <p>Feral mink are widely distributed over most of mainland Scotland and many offshore islands. Their impact on ground-nesting birds is well documented and it is widely believed that mink are also associated with the decline of the water vole.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is supporting Scottish Natural Heritage&#8217;s application for EU LIFE-Nature funding to assist with the first phase of a mink eradication programme for the Western Isles.</p>

  <p>SNH continues to maintain an overview on the subject of mink predation and control as it relates to the natural heritage. In view of the extensive range which the species now occupies in Britain, total eradication of the species is not possible. Therefore, resources must be carefully targeted at key sites where long-term control is considered to be a practicable option.</p>

  <p>As part of our drive to modernise government structures, the Executive is carrying out a radical review of all Scottish Public Bodies. We will consider what role public bodies should play in the devolved Scotland and how they should operate and be accountable to ministers and Parliament. We will be considering the scope for reduction in the number of public bodies through abolition and merger, and the circumstances in which new ones should be created.</p>

  <p>I shall make a statement on the way ahead following the review around the end of May.</p>

  <p>To answer the question in its original form, that is, to identify the international organisations each Minister has been in touch with since 1 July 1999, would have required a very extensive trawl of Scottish Executive Departments. It is not possible to say precisely what the cost might have been, but we estimate it would have been well in excess of &#163;550.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether all of Scotland&#8217;s share of the funding for the British pig industry announced on 30 March 2000 remains committed to the Pig Industry Restructuring Scheme, given delays in the scheme&#8217;s opening.</p>

  <p>The &#163;26 million funding announced for the pig industry on 30 March was for the UK and no part of the funding was specifically allocated for Scotland. Approval for the Pig Industry Restructuring Scheme (PIRS) from the EC has taken nearly nine months and final approval was only received in December. The delay in securing EC approval for the scheme will mean that no money will be spent this financial year.</p>

  <p>Some of the money allocated for the scheme has been used to pay for the Pig Welfare (Disposal) Scheme which has provided financial compensation to pig producers in East Anglia who were affected by movement restriction orders as a result of the outbreak of Classical Swine Fever.</p>

  <p>In the late summer MAFF announced a further &#163;20 million for PIRS for each of the financial years 2001-02 and 2002-03. The Outgoers scheme is now open for applications and it is expected that the successful applicants will receive their payments during the financial year 2001-02 on exactly the same basis as originally planned. No Scottish farmer wishing to participate in the Outgoers scheme will be disadvantaged due to the delay in the start of the scheme.</p>

  <p>There will be no change to the level of funding for producers in Scotland or elsewhere in the UK for those who qualify for the Ongoers scheme. Decisions on the overall future funding for the Pig Industry Restructuring Scheme will be made once the scale of payments for the Outgoers scheme are known and the demand for assistance under the Ongoers scheme has been assessed.</p>

The award to Scottish Borders Council for the development of the railway to the Central Borders is to assist the council take the project forward through the parliamentary process. As part of any future bid by the council to the PTF, walking and cycling measures could be included as part of any wider application.</p>

  <p>In the first three rounds of the PTF, only projects which cost over &#163;200,000 have been eligible for assistance under the PTF. In September 2000 I announced that the fund would be increased to &#163;150 million between 2001-04 and I indicated that I propose to give more prominence to cycling and walking projects. Details will be issued to local authorities shortly about the arrangements for seeking bids to the next round of the fund. The budget for the PTF in 2001-02 is &#163;40 million.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for the provision of cycling infrastructure rests with the local authorities. They receive a block allocation for expenditure on a number of services including transport. It is for the local authorities to allocate resources in accordance with locally determined priorities. Information about the level of spending by local authorities on cycling projects is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>However, cycling projects are eligible for support from the Public Transport Fund which was announced in 1998 in the Scottish Transport White Paper to assist local authorities to provide key value for money developments to their public transport network. It is open to all of Scotland&#8217;s local authorities and Strathclyde Passenger Transport Authority to bid for support from the fund.</p>

  <p>So far, three Public Transport Fund Competitions have taken place with 53 projects receiving funding totalling over &#163;95 million. During this time, eight bids for projects for improved cycling facilities have been received; all have been successful and received support from the fund. The projects and allocation is listed in the table.</p>

  <p>In May 2000, I announced that local authorities had been allocated additional capital consents, totalling &#163;5.2 million, to take forward work on implementing safer routes to school schemes. It is for individual authorities to take decisions on the specific measures to be implemented in their areas having regard to local needs and priorities. Measures could, however, include capital expenditure on cycle projects related to safer routes to school schemes.</p>

  <p>In addition, there are occasionally funding opportunities from other sources such as the Millennium Commission which provided resources for the development of the National Cycle Network. However, these are not administered by the Scottish Executive</p>

  <p>My answer to question S1W-12484 indicated that, following a review of remuneration, the SQA intends to increase fees for markers and other appointees in 2001 by 50%. The Executive will fund these increases in full, at a cost of approximately &#163;3 million. SQA&#8217;s progress in recruiting markers will be monitored closely by my officials and by the Ministerial Review Group.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has considered the use of non-lethal methods of seal population control. In 1998 the Executive asked the Special Committee on Seals (SCOS) of the Natural Environment Research Council to assess whether a recently developed Canadian method of contraceptive sterilisation of seals might be a feasible way to stabilise or reduce Scottish grey seal numbers.</p>

  <p>On the basis of SCOS&#8217; advice it was concluded that there would be considerable practical and financial problems involved in attempting a successful sterilisation programme using this method in Scotland. In Scotland seal populations are more scattered and more wary of humans than in Canada and hence cannot easily be approached for effective sterilisation using this method. In order to stabilise the grey seal population at its 1997 level of 95,000 it was estimated that a total of 14,000 adult females would need to be sterilised in the first year with gradually reducing annual numbers thereafter reaching 3,000 after some seven years. In order to reduce the seal population below the 1997 level, much greater numbers of seals would need to be sterilised.</p>

  <p>There are no current plans to introduce contraceptive measures to control the Scottish seal population but the Executive will continue to assess the potential of any future non-lethal control measures.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not hold this information on residents in Scotland. The Executive does, however, take the view that war crimes are among the most serious crimes of concern to the international community. We believe that those responsible for committing atrocities during the Second World War and subsequently should be brought to justice whenever possible. That can only be done within the rule of law and on the evidence available.</p>

  <p>Any specific allegation of war crimes against a former SS member resident in Scotland will be investigated by the police. If sufficient evidence became available it would be for the Lord Advocate to decide whether to prosecute. Any request by a foreign state for the extradition of an alleged war criminal resident in Scotland would be dealt with by Scottish Ministers under extradition legislation.</p>

  <p>I am informed by the Convener of the Holyrood Progress Group that, while a broad time frame was included as part of the Stage D Scheme Design report, it would be misleading to give definitive programme dates relating to the award, site start and completion of the above packages. These are liable to change in line with arrangements made by the Construction Manager, who is employed to manage a dynamic programme, to the overall benefit of the project. The programmed building completion date remains as 31 December 2002.</p>

  <p>The Holyrood Progress Group has previously indicated that it will be happy to release values of contracts awarded where they do not prejudice the future commercial interests of the Parliament or the individual contractors concerned. The Project Team is now in the process of establishing procedures to set this exercise in motion and a report will be made to MSPs as soon as the information becomes available.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer whether any contracts have been let to date in relation to the Holyrood Project with less detailed construction information than is desirable, as outlined in paragraph 1.39 of the Auditor General&#8217;s report <i>The new Scottish Parliament building</i> .</p>

  <p>No. <strong> </strong> Contracts are only let when sufficient information is available to allow construction to take place.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer whether all works packages issued to date, and to be issued, in relation to the Holyrood project contain or will contain penalty clauses to protect the client&#8217;s interest against late completion or other contingencies and whether the value of penalty clauses is calculated in relation to a standard formula or to contract-specific assessments of the possible costs to the client in each case of failure by contractors to achieve completion dates.</p>

  <p>The Convener of the Holyrood Progress Group has informed me that works package contracts stipulate that trade contractors will be liable for all damage, expense, loss or cost suffered or incurred by the client due to default by the trade contractor, including failure to achieve completion dates. It is not considered appropriate to include specific penalty clauses in works contracts for the new Parliament building since their inclusion can lead to increased tender prices.</p>

  <p>The total cost of designing, printing and publishing the Annual Report of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body and Scottish Parliament Statistics was &#163;41,454. 2,500 copies of each publication were printed.</p>

  <p>We intend to review carefully future publications of the Annual Report and Statistics Report in view of the costs identified above.</p>
