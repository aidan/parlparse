  <p>The new integrated delivery service SEARS - Scotland&rsquo;s Environmental and Rural Services - launched on 20 June 2008 will cut red tape and bureaucratic burdens for farmers and other rural land managers and result in:</p>

  <p>almost 2,000 fewer inspections to farms in the first year due to better co-ordination of visits between the nine public organisations involved;</p>

  <p>a reduction in the burden of information provision on land managers, as public bodies will share relevant data to avoid information having to be submitted more than once, and</p>

  <p>a 24 hour, seven days a week contact centre and web portal to ensure easy access to information.</p>

  <p>In addition, a research project looking at the costs and benefits associated with regulation in Scottish agriculture will report later this summer.</p>

  <p>Where higher than normal losses of bees are found after the winter, beekeepers can seek advice from the Scottish Agriculture College apiculture specialist as to the possible causes. In the majority of cases reported to the college, it has been possible to link these to poor management or to Varroa infestation and the secondary viruses associated with the Varroa mite which weakens the colony leaving it more prone to virus attack.</p>

  <p>Beekeepers can also send samples to Science and Advice for Scottish Agriculture for diagnostic examination.</p>

  <p>Both of these services are funded by the Scottish Government and are free to beekeepers.</p>

  <p>It is only right and proper that those who are most affected by business regulations should have some say in how they are implemented. The Regulatory Review Group (RRG), which comprises representatives of the main business organisations, unanimously took the view that a &quot;one in one out&quot; approach may not be wholly appropriate or realisable at present. Consequently, since it is our stated intention to listen carefully to business practitioners and act on their considered advice, we will work with the RRG to advance its recommendations.</p>

  <p>The RRG&rsquo;s views on the subject of measuring the numbers and impact of regulations is explained in more detail in their first annual report which will be published in July 2008.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will always aim to act in the best interests of the Scottish people, and that includes the way it conducts relations with other administrations. We argued successfully for the re-establishment of the Joint Ministerial Committee (JMC), at which we, the other devolved administrations and the UK Government can discuss matters of common interest and consider disputes between administrations that may arise. The first plenary meeting of the re-convened JMC took place on 25 June this year. This represents a major step forward in helping to ensure Scotland&rsquo;s interests are best served in conducting our business with the UK Government.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Beef Calf Scheme (worth about &pound;18 million per year) is funded through the national envelope.

  <p>Scotland already has a fantastic range and number of golf courses, old and new, hidden gems as well as the jewels in the crown like Turnberry, Muirfield and the Old Course. The challenge for those charged with increasing the benefits of golf tourism is to better utilise all of these existing courses. The &quot;Greatest Golf Giveaway&quot;, which is part of next year&rsquo;s Homecoming programme, will aim to do that.</p>

  <p>The appraisal and subsequent prioritisation of transport projects within the strategic transport projects review is being carried out in accordance with the requirements of the Scottish Transport Appraisal Guidance (STAG).</p>

  <p>In terms of the economic criteria within STAG, the cost-benefit ratio is not the sole indicator of the worth of a scheme. Other factors taken into account include impacts on the environment, safety, integration, accessibility and social inclusion. Also, STAG now enables the wider economic benefits to be taken into consideration.</p>

  <p>In September 2007, the Scottish Government announced the Edinburgh to Glasgow improvements project, which includes a number of investment packages with BCRs ranging from 0.9 to 3.8.</p>

  <p>In September 2007, the Scottish Government also committed a financial contribution to the Edinburgh trams project, with a BCR of 1.68 (excluding the Edinburgh Airport Rail Link), and awarded the contract for the replacement vessel for the Islay ferry services. This vessel has been commissioned by Caledonian Maritime Assets Ltd (CMAL) and will be funded by loans from the Scottish Government to CMAL. The appraisal, completed in 2003, showed the option being pursued to have a BCR of 0.48.</p>

  <p>In December 2007 the decision to construct a Forth replacement crossing was announced to the Parliament. The BCR of the preferred option is 4.57.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-13700 by Stewart Stevenson on 11 June 2008, in what month in the summer it expects Transport Scotland to deliver its initial findings from the strategic transport projects review to ministers and whether these findings will be made public.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland expects to deliver its initial findings from the strategic transport projects review to ministers in August 2008. Ministers will need to give careful consideration to these findings before being in a position to make any public announcement.</p>
