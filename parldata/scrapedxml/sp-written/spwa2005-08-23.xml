  <p><em>Cancer in Scotland: Action for change</em> sets out the strategy for tackling cancer in all its forms. The Executive&rsquo;s health improvement policy framework is set out in <em>Improving Health in Scotland &ndash; The Challenge. </em> More information is available from the Scottish Executive website at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Home" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Home</a> .</p>

  <p>NHS Health Scotland is a national resource for improving Scotland&rsquo;s health working at a national level to support organisations, policy-makers, communities and individuals to take action to improve health across Scotland. Their priorities focus on tobacco control and smoking cessation, healthy eating, diet and physical activity. Local NHS board health promotion departments are also active in the promotion of healthy lifestyles through the provision of information and advice on healthy eating, exercise, and alcohol reduction, all of which can impact on bowel cancer incidence.</p>

  <p>Specific bowel cancer awareness raising programmes such as the Big Lottery Fund, West of Scotland Cancer Awareness Project and the joint Lanarkshire/Forth Valley Bowel Cancer Awareness Project are aimed at helping people to understand the signs and symptoms of bowel cancer.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it agrees with the statement reported to me that Scottish Enterprise considers &quot;that there are enough visitor attractions in Scotland&quot;.</p>

  <p>There is a high-level of provision of visitor attractions in Scotland and any major new project could be associated with a high-level of displacement which could potentially undermine the viability of other attractions. However, Scottish Enterprise considers supporting every visitor attraction on a case-by-case basis. Assistance may be offered to fund new attractions that bring economic benefits to the Scottish tourism industry.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what its policy is for attracting privately funded visitor attractions into and within Scotland.</p>

  <p>Visitor attractions are an important part of the visitor experience in Scotland, as they are a part of a wide and rich diversity of offerings and products. VisitScotland supports any industry-led initiative that adds value to Scotland&rsquo;s product offering and will look at support for any new attractions on merit. Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise would also be willing to consider what support may be appropriate for new privately funded attractions. However, this would need to be set in the context of the market situation, and the potential of the attraction to attract additional businesses to Scotland, as well as likely levels of displacement from existing attractions.</p>
