  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether all funds allocated to community learning strategy partnerships for adult literacy and numeracy projects in 2001 were used for this purpose; if not, what steps will now be taken to ensure that the funds are so used, and what action will be taken against any local authority not using such funds for this purpose; whether funding for adult literacy and numeracy for 2006-08 will be allocated to community learning strategy partnerships, and whether such funding will be ring-fenced.</p>

  <p>Our information is that the funds allocated to the partnerships since 2001 have been used for activities relating to adult literacy and numeracy.</p>

  <p>Funding for adult literacy and numeracy for 2006-2008 will be routed as previously through the GAE of local authorities and will not be ring-fenced. We anticipate that these funds will be allocated to the Community Learning Strategy Partnerships.</p>

  <p>Our health improvement policy aims to improve the health of all the people of Scotland but also to close the health gap. We have set within the 2004 Spending Review, a stretching and ambitious target to increase the rate of health improvement across a range of indicators for the most deprived communities by 15% by 2008. The indicators are: under 75 coronary heart disease mortality, under 75 cancer mortality, adults smoking, smoking during pregnancy, teenage pregnancy and suicides in young people. We will require NHS boards to step up action to tackle health inequalities, setting this in the wider context of community planning partnership health inequalities strategies. The Arbuthnott funding formula for NHS Scotland already takes account of levels of deprivation but we will expect NHS boards to move towards use of the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation in determining the impact of their health inequalities actions locally.</p>
