  <p>The time taken to complete a modern apprenticeship framework varies depending upon a range of factors including which sector the framework is designed for, the level of qualification being worked towards, and the pace at which the apprentice undertakes it. This is the case with all modern apprenticeships, including those which attracted the &pound;1,000 Apprenticeship Grant through Invest in an Apprentice.</p>

  <p>There are a number of documents that support the diagnosis of prostate cancer. A Prostate Cancer Risk Management Programme pack, which was originally published by the Department of Health in England, was issued to general practitioners (GPs) across NHS Scotland, urologists and histopathologists working in Scottish hospitals and also those working in Scottish PSA testing laboratories. This has subsequently been tailored to suit a Scottish audience and is available on the Scottish Government Better Cancer Care website, available at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/health/cancer/publications" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/health/cancer/publications</a>.</p>

  <p>To support GPs to refer patients with suspected cancer, the Scottish Executive Health Department Letter (HDL) (2007) 9 Scottish Referral Guidelines for Suspected Cancer was published, which includes referral guidance for patients with suspected prostate cancer. This can be accessed at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.sehd.scot.nhs.uk/mels/HDL2007_09.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.sehd.scot.nhs.uk/mels/HDL2007_09.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p>In 2009, the HDL was summarised into a quick reference guide and this has been circulated to all GPs across Scotland. This document is available at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/264972/0079346.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/264972/0079346.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p>In addition, the National Cancer Quality Steering Group is currently overseeing the development of nationally agreed cancer quality performance indicators (QPIs) which will underpin continuous quality improvement of services and patient outcomes. Prostate cancer will be one of the first tumour groups to undergo this process.</p>

  <p>The most appropriate treatment for an individual is determined following a multi-disciplinary team meeting. Following this it is the responsibility of the clinician caring for individuals to provide the relevant information about treatment options, side effects and support services according to identified needs.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s Living with Cancer group (a subgroup of the Scottish Cancer Taskforce) is currently working with clinicians, patients and representatives from the voluntary sector to identify the best way to support patients, and their families as they deal with a cancer diagnosis, undergo treatment, and subsequently deal with any side effects they may encounter. Further information regarding the work that is undertaken by the Living with Cancer group can be found at:</p>

  <p>In addition, NHS inform is a new national service which will co-ordinate a range of partners, including health boards, in the delivery of quality assured, accessible information on both generic health issues and also specific conditions such as prostate cancer. The service will be delivered through three main channels: online, telephone and direct access and will include information on health conditions, treatment and self management, service availability and health improvement. health board&rsquo;s involvement in the delivery of NHS inform will both develop and enhance the support services they provide to patients.</p>

  <p>Guidance in the form of a Prostate Cancer Risk Management Pack which supports the Prostate Cancer Risk Management Programme was issued to NHS boards (urologists, histopathologists, PSA testing laboratories) and all general practitioners in Scotland. The programme provides guidance to medical practitioners on the situations in which it is suitable to offer PSA testing, the information and guidance that should be provided to patients before PSA testing is undertaken, and the support that may be required by men as they deal with the consequences of the PSA test and any resulting diagnosis.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government strongly believes that a reduction in the drink drive limit from 80mg per 100ml of blood to 50mg would save lives and prevent many serious injuries on our roads.</p>

  <p>The government announced its full support for a reduction in the drink driving limit on 12 March 2008 and wrote then to the Department for Transport, calling upon to UK Government to prioritise a reduction in the limit.</p>

  <p>The Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change and I have written on a number of subsequent occasions, requesting that the UK Government make progress on a reduction in the limit.</p>

  <p>Subsequent to the Scottish Parliament debate on 19 December 2008, which called on the UK Government to reduce the limit to 50mg per 100ml of blood, I wrote again asking that priority be given to a reduction in the limit across the UK and, failing that, that the powers to set the limit be devolved to the Scottish Parliament.</p>

  <p>In June 2009, the Calman Commission recommended that the powers to set the limit be devolved to the Scottish Parliament. Both the First Minister and I made representations to the UK Government pressing for this to be undertaken as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>The international financial crisis acted as the catalyst for the sharpest drop in output in developed economies in over half a century and the first drop in world output since the Second World War. In response, governments across the globe undertook a series of co-ordinated policy measures including, where necessary, support for financial institutions alongside a range of fiscal and monetary policies. The aggregate effects of all these responses, including action taken by the Scottish Government through the Economic Recovery Plan, has been to help support jobs across the international, UK and Scottish economies.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) is leading the development of the new qualifications, which are fully integrated into the overall Curriculum for Excellence Programme Plan. A schedule of all key milestones within the plan, including those related to qualifications, has been communicated to schools and colleges. The Scottish Government is committed to continuing to keep schools and colleges informed.</p>

  <p>SQA is working directly with the education community and delivery partners such as Learning and Teaching Scotland to make sure that the new qualifications take forward the aims of Curriculum for Excellence and meet the needs of schools, colleges and learners. The design principles for National 4 and National 5 have already been agreed.

  <p>Information is not held centrally on the time spent teaching history in schools or on how schools teach history, including whether history is taught by someone without a history qualification. Curriculum for Excellence provides flexibility on time and content to teach history in the context of the experiences and outcomes and other curriculum guidance.</p>

  <p>Developing knowledge and understanding of the world and Scotland&rsquo;s place in it is among the learner entitlements in Curriculum for Excellence and the Social Studies principles and practice guidance makes clear that children and young people&rsquo;s experiences will be broadened using Scottish, British, European and wider contexts for learning, while maintaining a focus on the historical, social, geographic, economic and political changes that have shaped Scotland.</p>

  <p>Scotland&rsquo;s Zero Waste Plan is currently being finalised and will be published this summer. Implementing zero waste policies will encourage better resource utilisation through promotion of waste prevention; minimisation; re-use and recycling, and recovery where waste prevention, re-use or recycling is not feasible.</p>

  <p>Consequently, waste recovery, including making use of thermal energy from waste processes, forms part of an integrated Zero Waste Strategy. Where energy from waste is used, it is important that it is used efficiently and to do so will invariably involve use of both heat and power generated from the plant.</p>

  <p>SEPA has produced environmental permitting guidance to be considered by applicants who propose energy-from-waste plants. This makes it clear that new thermal treatment facilities should not impede recycling or waste prevention opportunities, and that they maximise the recovery of energy.</p>

  <p>The practical implications of the guidance are that plants should only treat residual waste after all reasonable efforts have been made to extract recyclable materials, and that they should recover and use the energy derived from waste efficiently, including utilising heat in industrial applications and/or district heating systems.</p>

  <p>The &pound;76 million allocation of budget consequentials announced on 14 April 2010 will support:</p>

  <p>&pound;31 million for affordable housing developments</p>

  <p>&pound;17 million capital investment in Dundee and Forth Valley colleges</p>

  <p>&pound;10 million for sustainable transport initiatives</p>

  <p>&pound;6.2 million for the upgrade of the A77 Park End to Bennane</p>

  <p>&pound;5.1 million for the upgrade of the A9 at Crubenmore</p>

  <p>&pound;3.8 million to accelerate work on the Dundee waterfront</p>

  <p>&pound;3 million towards renewable energy infrastructure at Arnish in the Western Isles.</p>

  <p>This expenditure will support a range of economic and social outcomes for communities, and households across Scotland. It is estimated that in the short-term the &pound;76 million of expenditure will support over 1,000 jobs in the Scottish economy. In addition, this expenditure can provide long-term benefits to job creation and the wider economy. In particular, by supporting certain sectors whilst demand conditions remain fragile, the expenditure can help retain key skills, such as in construction, and create a legacy of capital assets, such as public infrastructure, which can have long-lasting economic, social and environmental benefits.</p>

  <p>The &pound;76 million of consequentials is available only in 2010-11 and not in future years. Therefore the Scottish Government has allocated these resources to help accelerate shovel-ready capital projects, in order to make the maximum positive contribution to Scotland&rsquo;s economic recovery and to jobs, particularly in the construction industry.</p>

  <p>We are committed to delivering a tightly managed and sustainable capital programme over the medium-term and the key judgement in assessing the implementation of that programme will be the capital budgets that are available to us in future years.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-32759 on 23 April which gave the areas of woodland created annually since 2007-08. Using a broad average stocking density of 2,000 trees per hectare, the number of trees planted annually since 2007-08 is therefore estimated at an average of 6.7 million.</p>

  <p>The first two tables show the areas of planting, and the areas approved for felling, in private woodlands in each of the last five years, broken down by Forestry Commission Scotland (FCS) Conservancy regions.</p>

  <p>The third and fourth tables show the areas of planting and felling carried out by FCS on the national forest estate in each of the last five years. A breakdown by conservancy is not available as national forest estate statistics are not held in that format.</p>

  <p>Information is not collected on the number of trees planted or felled each year, but an average of 2,000 trees per hectare can be used to estimate numbers of trees planted from total area planted. The number of trees felled depends upon a wide range of factors, including felled area, thinned area, stocking density and management objectives.</p>

  <p>The first two tables show the areas of planting, and the areas approved for felling, in private woodlands in each of the last five years, broken down by Forestry Commission Scotland (FCS) Conservancy regions.</p>

  <p>The third and fourth tables show the areas of planting and felling carried out by FCS on the national forest estate in each of the last five years. A breakdown by Conservancy is not available as national forest estate statistics are not held in that format.</p>

  <p>Information is not collected on the number of trees planted or felled each year, but an average of 2,000 trees per hectare can be used to estimate numbers of trees planted from total area planted. The number of trees felled depends upon a wide range of factors, including felled area, thinned area, stocking density and management objectives.</p>

  <p>We published our <em>Rationale for Woodland Expansion </em> early in 2009. It reaffirmed the Scottish Forestry Strategy&rsquo;s vision for a 650,000 hectares increase in Scotland&rsquo;s woodland area by the second half of the century. Our <em>Climate Change Delivery Plan </em> has subsequently recommended planting 10,000 hectares per year (to contribute to a 34% reduction in green-house gas emissions) or 15,000 hectares per year (for a 42% reduction). As regards tree numbers for planting, I indicated in the answers to questions S3W-32887 and S3W-32888 on 28 April 2009, that an average of 2,000 trees per hectare is a reasonable estimate. The geographic distribution of the new woodland will depend on ensuring that the right trees are planted in the right places; this is guided by consultation procedures and indicative forestry strategies (which in future are likely to be informed by the Land Use Strategy).</p>

  <p>Forecasts of felling are generally presented in terms of volume (cubic metres) rather than in terms of area or number of trees. However, based on these forecast volumes, we estimate that the felled area could rise to about 20,000 hectares per annum during the course of the next five years. Nearly all these areas will be restocked in accordance with approved forest management plans. The number of trees felled will depend upon the average tree size, which is itself dependent on a wide range of factors.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS) published Clinical Standards for Adult Renal Services in February 2002. Standard 13 deals with transportation for haemodialysis, and contains a desirable, as opposed to an essential, criterion that within the constraints of population density and geography, that a renal unit is available within half an hour&rsquo;s travelling time for patients. The criterion was included to ensure renal units were considering the possibility of satellite units where appropriate, to minimise travelling times for patients.</p>

  <p>Since the publication of the NHS QIS report, NHS boards have indeed been increasing the number of satellite dialysis units, so that as many people as possible get this form of renal replacement therapy nearer to their home or place of work. As indicated in the answer to S3W-32978 on 28 April 2010, the main renal units in Scotland are now complemented by 22 satellite dialysis units.</p>

  <p>NHS QIS&rsquo; <em>National Overview of Adult Renal Services</em> published in March 2003 highlighted issues for those living in remote and rural areas who face very long and difficult journeys to renal units, and strongly urged NHS boards to develop innovative solutions to these issues.</p>

  <p>There is no gap in funding for universities. Within the 2010-11 Budget, Scottish universities receive a cash increase of just over &pound;42.9 million in resource funding from 2009-10. This represents a 4.3% cash increase and a 2% real terms increase.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers have recognised the need for improvements to the facilities at Bannockburn to bring them up to a standard that reflects the historic importance of the site. Historic Scotland is working with the National Trust for Scotland, which owns and manages the site, to re-present the site in time for the 700th anniversary of the Battle of Bannockburn in June 2014.</p>

  <p>Historic Scotland will be arranging a programme of events to mark the anniversary but it is too early to confirm their nature at this stage. Likewise, National Archives of Scotland will mark this important anniversary but it is too early to confirm their commemorative plans.</p>

  <p>The review will begin later this month. The aim will be to complete a first phase of the review by delivering a report proposing priorities and recommendations at the end of 2010. An implementation phase will then follow, initially to March 2012 but potentially providing a platform for work beyond then. The scope and methodology for the review will be considered at a meeting of the multi-agency Witnesses Issues Group on 29 April 2010. The Scottish Government&rsquo;s aim will be to engage a wide range of interests during the review through the Witnesses Issues Group and other working groups.</p>

  <p>The Government Car Service (Scotland) provides or arranges transport for Scottish ministers, ministers of UK Government Departments when in Scotland, senior officials at the Scottish Government, and visiting dignitaries.</p>

  <p>All ministers and cabinet secretaries share drivers as a pooled resource. Whilst some ministers make greater use of individual drivers than others no drivers are solely utilised by any one minister. This enables the Government Car Service to be delivered in the most efficient and cost effective manner. It would only be possible to allocate overnight costs for each driver to individual ministers and cabinet secretaries at disproportionate cost.</p>

  <p>The costs of overnight accommodation in Glasgow, Edinburgh and elsewhere for all drivers during 2008-09 are contained in the following table.</p>

  <p>The <em>NHS Scotland National Catering and Nutritional Services Specification: Half Yearly Compliance Report (July &ndash; December 2009)</em> is the first ever publication of data that will drive up standards for the nutritional care of patients. The data gives boards an assessment against which they can measure progress and build on performance.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government welcomes publication of this data and encourages all NHS boards to strive for green status in hospitals across Scotland. Our investment in the procurement and rollout this year of an innovative nutritional database will assist boards further in making continuous improvement towards optimum compliance.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government expects NHS boards to achieve green status of at least 90% compliance for each of the food standards by April 2011. NHS boards are now better placed than ever to improve compliance, with, for the first time, data against which to measure progress. Furthermore, the new national nutritional database which has now been procured will revolutionise the provision of hospital food by providing a nutritional analysis of all recipes to ensure that all patients&rsquo; special and unique dietary needs are met. This should help to improve compliance with the Therapeutic Diet Provision criterion in particular, under which boards have found some difficulties in providing a choice of options for patients.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-16220 on 22 September 2008 which explains that paper cannot be eliminated completely from the prescriptions process in Scotland at this stage. While the electronic transfer of prescriptions (ETP) brings a range of benefits we do not expect, overall, to see a substantial financial saving. ETP began implementation in April 2008 and is now fully in place.</p>

  <p>The electronic transfer of prescriptions (ETP) process reduces the risk of transcribing errors in community pharmacies and improves patient safety as most of the information from the paper prescription form is automatically pre-populated into the pharmacy IT system by scanning the bar code on the prescription form. No estimate has been made of the likely reduction in the number of payment errors resulting from ETP.</p>

  <p>National Services Scotland: Practitioner Services Division (PSD) administers the processing of all prescription forms in Scotland. At the abolition of prescription charges, this process will continue. Due to careful forward planning, no redundancies will be made as a result of either the planned abolition of prescription charges or the electronic transfer of prescriptions (ETP) as affected staff will be redeployed into vacancies elsewhere across the organisation. All changes in work patterns have been fully discussed in partnership with the unions.</p>

  <p>Pharmacists who are prescribers currently use paper prescriptions, as do other non-medical prescribers. It should be noted that paper cannot be eliminated completely from the prescriptions process in Scotland at this stage.</p>

  <p>I have asked Willie Pretswell, Interim Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service, to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>At the time of inspection Friarton Hall was less than half full with 42 young offenders all of whom were actively engaged in work as follows:</p>

  <p>Outside work placement &ndash; 1</p>

  <p>Outside project &ndash; 3</p>

  <p>Hall Pass men &ndash; 6</p>

  <p>Grounds/Car Valet &ndash; 5.</p>

  <p>During the day some prisoners may have left their work parties to attend education, visits or PE etc.</p>

  <p>Friarton Hall has now been temporarily taken out of use. A review of its future role is ongoing and issues identified in the report will be addressed dependant on future usage.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government are keen to see, at the very least, a proportionate take up of the 750,000 installations by 2020 predicted by the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change. However, the Feed-In Tariff is a brand new initiative and is demand led. As such, it is too soon for any accurate prediction to be made on how many installations will occur in Scotland in each of the next three years.</p>

  <p>The care needs assessment provided by local authorities should identify the nutritional requirements of those cared for at home. The National Care Standards require care at home providers to develop a personal plan with each person who is using the service which sets out how their care needs will be met. Where the service includes the preparation of food the plan will include details of any special dietary requirements. It is for the Care Commission, as the national regulator, to ensure through its inspections that care at home services are complying with this aspect of the National Care Standards.</p>

  <p>Local authorities undertake care needs assessments for older people receiving care in their own homes. A care needs assessment should identify any issues relating to malnutrition. It is likely to involve more than one agency in contributing to a holistic assessment of needs, including specialist input from a GP and/ or Dietician where there are health concerns around malnutrition.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises the valuable contribution swimming can make to the health and wellbeing of the nation. Many local authorities already offer free or discounted access to public swimming pools for targeted groups, despite the current challenging economic climate.</p>

  <p>Local authorities have a statutory responsibility to ensure there is adequate provision to allow their residents to take part in sporting and recreational activities. It is for them to determine the level and range of services offered accordingly to local needs and circumstances. Scottish ministers have no role to play in the local decision making process.</p>
