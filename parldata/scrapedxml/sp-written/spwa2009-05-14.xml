  <p>Our strategy to maintain and improve Scotland&rsquo;s international air connectivity has two elements: maintaining and developing Scotland&rsquo;s profile within the airline sector, including at global events such as the World Route Development Forum, and the provision of market intelligence and data to airlines on the potential of the Scottish market to sustain new direct international air services. In implementing our strategy we work closely with Scotland&rsquo;s airport operators.</p>

  <p>&pound;3 million of this funding was administered by YouthLink Scotland. Of the &pound;680,000 allocated to Glasgow, &pound;266,438 went to projects based in the east end of Glasgow, including:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Football Association has delivered 42 weekly Midnight League sessions in Whitehill Secondary to 110 individuals from the east end area, at a total cost of approximately &pound;2,500. The total investment in the Soccer One programme was &pound;3,525, which delivered activities in Carntyne Academy, St Mungo&rsquo;s Academy and Lochend Community High School, resulting in the creation of six new teams in the east end of Glasgow. The total amount of CashBack funding invested in football activities in the east end of Glasgow from its commencement in 2008 to date is therefore &pound;6,025.</p>

  <p>Scottish Sports Futures has invested &pound;30,000 in the east end of Glasgow to cover the appointment of two members of staff for Jump2It and Twilight Basketball. Twilight Basketball is delivered in the Wellhouse and Tollcross areas with 45 young people involved every week and Jump2It basketball sessions have been delivered to 693 primary school participants.</p>

  <p>Basketballscotland is working to promote basketball participation across Scotland through the deployment of four regional co-ordinators funded by CashBack, including one in West Scotland. They are working with Scottish Sports Futures and Culture and Sport Glasgow to establish a community basketball club in the east end of Glasgow.</p>

  <p>Scottish Rugby has been allocated &pound;1.4 million over three financial years from 2008-09 to 2010-11. This is broken down to &pound;435,600 for 2008-09, &pound;465,800 for 2009-10 and &pound;513,600 for 2010-11. Approximately &pound;4,500 has been spent in the east end of Glasgow to date. Scottish Rugby has been working in partnership with Culture &amp; Sport Glasgow to support a community coach in delivering schools and community rugby activities. Activities have been delivered in 16 primary schools, including two rugby festivals for over 200 children, and in five secondary schools, including work with Princes Trust in XL clubs.</p>

  <p>The funding has also enabled delivery of four weeks of Street Rugby in South Carntyne and a six-week block in Garthamlock. In addition, Scottish Rugby have set up an after school club at Easterhouse Sports Centre on Friday evenings and a volunteer coach from the area has undertaken a placement with rugby development staff. They are now looking to recruit a full time Development Officer for the east end area to continue and expand these activities.</p>

  <p>The second culture strand of CashBack was announced in March 2009. The Creative Identities project is an 18-month programme of creative learning activities for young people targeting young carers in particular, but will be open to all young people. The east end of Glasgow is included in the West Central Programme Plan, which will be led by Glasgow-based partners Tramway and Glasgow Film Theatre. They have been allocated a total of &pound;343,600 to deliver projects across the region.</p>

  <p>The former Scottish Executive delivered access to broadband provision to every Scottish community, as defined using census output areas, in December 2005. This was achieved through its &pound;16.5 million Broadband for Scotland project, in which BT, under contract to the Scottish Executive, upgraded 378 rural telephone exchanges for broadband provision.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s current Broadband Reach Project, which is being delivered by Avanti Caledonian Broadband Ltd, is providing a basic, affordable broadband service to the known demand from those households and businesses which still remained without broadband access following the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s 2005 project, mainly due to distance from the exchange. Deployment of the current project commenced in July 2008 and will complete in May 2009. Locations within Tayside where at least one of the premises has been enabled for broadband under the current project are as follows:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government commissioned research on domestic abuse against men in 2002. This research was carried out by David Gadd, Stephen Farrall, Damian Dallimore &amp; Nancy Lombard, Dept of Criminology at Keele University and published in September 2002. The full copy of the research can be found at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2002/09/15201/9609" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2002/09/15201/9609</a> .</p>

  <p>However, the Scottish Crime and Justice Survey, currently being carried out, will provide more up to date information on the nature and extent of domestic abuse and sexual violence in Scotland, including information on domestic abuse against men. This is expected to report in the autumn.</p>

  <p>There have been no specialist male services tackling domestic abuse established in Scotland to date.</p>

  <p>However, over &pound;4 million was allocated to Victim Support Scotland (VSS) for 2008-09 (an increase of 2% from 2007-08). VSS provides practical and emotional support to all victims of crime, including men who experience domestic abuse. It is the largest voluntary organisation addressing the needs of victims in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The police, together with their local partners, are best placed to identify local trends in drug use. Among other things, this can help ensure localised targeting of drug misuse campaigns.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that information obtained through the pilot study of drug testing of arrestees in Fife and Strathclyde cannot be assumed to be representative of all arrestees in those areas, since only those interviewees who voluntarily consented received urine tests.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is providing a range of health and supporting services which are particularly sensitive to men&rsquo;s health needs.</p>

  <p>An example is the Keep Well anticipatory care programme, which is targeted at 45 to 64-year-olds in the 15% most deprived communities in Scotland. The programme aims to engage individuals who do not take full advantage of the health care services available to them, many of whom are men. Patients who attend a Keep Well health check are assessed for their risk of current and future ill health. Those found to be at risk are prescribed medication or referred to supporting services including weight management, smoking cessation and brief alcohol interventions.</p>

  <p>Another example is the Scottish Government&rsquo;s recent alcohol framework which recognises that up to 50% of men are drinking over the sensible drinking guidelines, increasing their risk of lasting health damage. The framework sets out a robust and proportionate package of measures to re-balance Scotland&rsquo;s relationship with alcohol.</p>

  <p>The eHealth Strategy takes an incremental approach to improving IT support for clinicians in delivering safe and effective healthcare. Movement toward an electronic health record is also intended to be incremental and based on what has already been achieved within NHS Scotland. It will progressively draw together information prioritised according to clinicians views about those pieces of information which would add the most value to patient care and in step with agreements about how such information should be brought together.</p>

  <p>The Clinical Change Leadership Group (CCLG) is considering these design issues along with IT technical teams and are currently consulting their clinical colleagues to establish these priorities. The advice from CCLG will be used to inform a clinical portal programme, which will give health boards the capability to deliver a virtual Electronic Patient Record by assembling the agreed information elements of the electronic patient record and displaying it in the clinical portal. It is expected that a clinical portal technology pilot will be completed in one health board during 2009 and for other health boards to be able to introduce a clinical portal in 2010.</p>

  <p>The NHS in Scotland and in the rest of the UK have worked closely together on flu pandemic planning. From the outset of the emergence of the Influenza A H1N1 strain, Health Protection Scotland has proactively linked with the Health Protection Agency in England to jointly develop and agree guidance to the service and agree case management strategies which have subsequently been shared with NHS boards in Scotland.</p>

  <p>An enhanced surveillance system and information exchange is in place and Scotland also receives considerable support from the UK reference laboratory in Colindale. Contact takes place daily across the UK to highlight issues and raise matters of concern which require a co-ordinated response.</p>

  <p>The recommendations in the 2005 report <em>A Scottish Prescription: Managing the use of medicines in hospitals</em> have, wherever possible, been introduced into routine practice, are under active consideration or are part of on-going work within a larger programme of work at Scotland or UK level. Of those recommendations identified by Audit Scotland as key, the following have been implemented.</p>

  <p>Develop a national drug dictionary.</p>

  <p>Roll out of the Emergency Care Summary for use by accident and emergency hospital staff dealing with emergency patients.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Medicines Consortium should continue to develop its work on estimating the budget impact of new medicines so that NHS boards are provided with information on all anticipated costs and savings to allow them to estimate the local financial impact of new medicines.</p>

  <p>NHS boards should ensure that the horizon scanning information and monitoring information on the use of medicines is used to inform budgets for medicines.</p>

  <p>NHS boards should ensure that pharmacy is represented at the senior levels of decision-making in the NHS boards and operating divisions.</p>

  <p>NHS boards should develop joint formularies and treatment protocols that promote cost-effective prescribing and monitor their use.</p>

  <p>NHS boards should develop antibiotic strategies and put in place mechanisms to support these strategies, including education, clinical audit and feedback to staff.</p>

  <p>In addition to the above, there are developments at UK level which address key recommendations in relation to the pharmacy workforce. Importantly, the Healthcare and Associated Professions (Miscellaneous Amendments and Practitioner Psychologists) Order 2009 extends the statutory regulation of pharmacy technicians to Scotland. Once pharmacy technicians are registered and trained they will be able to undertake extended roles thus releasing capacity elsewhere. At this time, the Scottish Government is also scoping the potential for a new role of the assistant pharmacist practitioner. These, together with the Action Plan for Pharmacy and Medicines, which is currently being developed, will allow key recommendations relating to the pharmacy workforce, including the use of automation, to be fully addressed.</p>

  <p>The key recommendation relating to the review of education in medicines and prescribing for medical students is being taken forward on a UK basis through the General Medical Council&rsquo;s review of <em>Tomorrow&rsquo;s Doctors</em>, which includes representation from the Scottish Government.</p>

  <p>Recommendations relating to the development and implementation of a national hospital, electronic prescribing and medicines administration system will be an option as part of a Patient Management System. Procurement of such a system is underway and award of contract stage is expected by autumn 2009. Other national information systems, the use of the Community Health Index number in the hospital sector and the national Hospital Medicines Utilisation database, are expected to be completed by end 2009 and 2010 respectively.</p>

  <p>NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (QIS) is currently examining how their clinical guidelines and technology appraisal processes can include cost implications to inform the NHS budget planning. NHS QIS is also examining the feasibility of developing a national incident reporting approach so that any safety learned can be shared throughout the NHS.</p>

  <p>When compiling the invitation list the capacity of the venue, the numbers required for the e-planning launch and the attendee list of the Planning Summit in October 2008 were taken into account. Since it was not possible to have an open invitation we sought to achieve a balance of e-planning representatives, local and national park authorities, agencies, developers, banks, private sector interests, professional organisations, community representatives, and other interest groups involved in planning.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to improving the planning system by: strengthening the involvement of communities; speeding up decisions; reflecting local views better, and allowing quicker investment decisions. ePlanning is an integral part of this modernisation and culture change and the event on 29 April provided an opportunity to allow key stakeholders to reflect on the progress being made on planning reform and to promote the e-planning launch.</p>

  <p>The ePlanning programme contributes to planning modernisation by:</p>

  <p>Reducing bureaucracy via the ePlanning Scotland website which will clearly explain the planning process and guide applicants swiftly through the submission of their application.</p>

  <p>Increasing consistency across Scotland by providing a standard set of planning application forms and advice for Scotland on the ePlanning Scotland website.</p>

  <p>Being more open and transparent, providing more information with an easily accessible 24x7 service for citizens, agents, consultees and businesses. Users will be able to view plans of proposed developments, understand where applications are in the process and provide comments online.</p>

  <p>Being more inclusive allowing more individuals, communities and businesses to engage in the development of their neighbourhoods through increased online interaction in the creation of local plans and processing of applications.</p>

  <p>The programme provides an opportunity to release &pound;16.7 million in savings for an initial investment of &pound;11.2 million. It will also deliver considerable value to citizens and businesses by creating a higher quality, faster, more consistent, more inclusive and easier to use planning system.

  <p>ePlanning will deliver a step change in planning service delivery, providing a wide range of online services to end users that creates an end-to-end ePlanning service; from initial inquiries, to applications, decisions, and where applicable, through the planning appeal process. The service will be inclusive and transparent with all applications, plans and progress updates viewable across the internet.</p>

  <p>The amount and quality of planning information available online is being increased on planning authority websites making the planning process more transparent and accessible. ePlanning allows the progress of applications and appeals to be tracked, comments to be made and decisions better understood. For communities this means greater confidence and certainty.</p>

  <p>During the year ahead local development plans, which are at the heart of Scotland&rsquo;s planning system, will be published online. Individuals and communities will be able to engage more effectively in the process of preparing plans and better understand the future development of their local area.</p>

  <p>The ePlanning Programme is delivering a step change in planning service delivery and driving forward efficiencies in the planning system, moving planning away from a paper process to electronic ways of working. The programme allows for decisions to be made more quickly and more open, thereby increasing efficiencies in the public sector and, providing savings and improved services to citizens, local communities and NGOs.</p>

  <p>Increased inclusion will provide enormous benefit to citizens. With all planning information online, citizens can view current applications, and their plans, their progress at different stages of the planning process, committee dates and decision, submit objections via online forms and become involved with the development of local plans. This reduces the need for citizens to travel into planning offices or libraries to view applications. By encouraging involvement in the creation of local plans, citizens can get involved with the development of the communities at the earliest stage in the planning process.</p>

  <p>In addition, a future programme of work is currently being prepared to support planning authorities publicise and support usage by architects, agents, members of the public, community councils and other stakeholders.</p>

  <p>Local authorities, as facilitators, have a statutory duty to consult and co-operate with communities, including voluntary organisations, in the Community Planning process. The way in which this is done should reflect the circumstances of their particular communities. The Accounts Commission audits councils&rsquo; achievements in relation to their statutory duties, including Community Planning, as part of the audits of Best Value and Community Planning.</p>

  <p>COSLA, Scottish Government, Society of Local Authority Chief Executive (SOLACE), and Scottish Council Voluntary Organisation (SCVO) have committed to working together with the strategic aim of renewing and improving the relationship between the third sector and the public sector, locally, in the context of the new relationship between the Scottish Government and Local Government. The Joint Task Group taking this forward includes third sector representatives.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government, with the full engagement of third and public sector partners, will shortly commission work to map and understand CPPs&rsquo; engagement with third sector organisations. The fieldwork will begin in autumn 2009 and will report in summer 2010.</p>

  <p>The temporary cut in the standard rate of VAT from 17.5% to 15% announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the 24 November is estimated to increase the average Scottish household&rsquo;s income by approximately &pound;4 a week in 2009-10.</p>

  <p>Table 1 summarises the estimated average impact of the VAT cut on the weekly income of different household types in Scotland during 2009-10.

  <p>The Scottish Government responded to Waterwatch Scotland on publication of its affordability report in September 2008. That response set out that we continue to be committed to introducing a fairer local tax based on ability to pay. Such a change would have implications for the household water charge basis given the present links to the Council Tax system. The response also set out that, in light of this planned wider change, it would be difficult to review particular aspects of the water charging system.</p>

  <p>Meantime, the Government is grateful to Waterwatch for this report which addresses a number of important issues. As is reflected in our draft 2010-14 Principles of Charging Statement - a second draft of which was published in March 2009 - we continue to regard the affordability of household charges as a significant objective. We will ensure that the present bespoke reduction scheme for households in receipt of council tax benefit will continue.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has a new level of ambition to tackle poverty in Scotland and is determined to deliver real and lasting change. Last year we published <em>Achieving our Potential </em>&ndash; a framework setting out the shared approach of Scottish Government and local government in tackling poverty in Scotland. This framework refers to our specific measures to tackle fuel poverty, including the new energy assistance package, and outlines other key actions to tackle poverty required by the Scottish Government and its partners, particularly the strengthening of income maximisation work in an attempt to alleviate the disadvantage of all types of poverty in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The framework also calls for the UK government to transfer responsibility for personal taxation and responsibility for the entire benefits system as this relates to Scotland.</p>
