  <p>Continuous Morbidity Records (CMR), Scottish Morbidity Records (SMR), Pre-school and Child Health Surveillance systems and the Special Needs system allow recording of diagnosis or other concerns, including Foetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). However, it is recognised that, at present, prevalence of FAS is probably under-recorded in national data.</p>

  <p>Information from Scottish Morbidity Records (SMR) indicated the following numbers of babies born with Foetal Alcohol Syndrome over the past four years.</p>

  <p>Information from the Child Health Surveillance systems indicated that only two children born in 2001 were diagnosed with Foetal Alcohol Syndrome. The other recording systems are at earlier stages of development and thus any data on FAS is unreliable at the present time.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Information is available centrally only for those patients seen in General Practice or in NHS hospitals.</p>

  <p>2. Information on patients discharged from acute non-obstetric, non-psychiatric hospitals is available from SMR 01 and on patients discharged from neonatal units from SMR 11.</p>

  <p>3. Information about GP consultations is gathered centrally as part of CMR in General Practice (CMR). Currently 81 GP practices contribute to CMR in Scotland out of a total of 1,058. CMR practices cover 8% of the Scottish population and are considered to be broadly representative of age, sex, and deprivation category and rural/urban mix. However, the number of FAS cases recorded is very low and is unlikely to reflect the true prevalence across Scotland.</p>

  <p>4. Ten NHS boards currently participate in the Pre-school Child Health Surveillance system accounting for some 80% of the pre-school population. The School Child Health surveillance system is relatively new with only three NHS boards and one NHS trust having implemented the system. Because of the variation both in national coverage and in recording practices, it is not possible, at present, to regard them as present as sound sources of data on FAS .</p>

  <p>5. The Special Needs System is another potential new source of information on FAS but not all NHS boards currently contribute data.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive ensures that information about foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is included, as appropriate, in relevant publications. The risk of FAS is highlighted in the Health Education Board for Scotland (HEBS) booklet <i>Alcofacts. A guide to sensible drinking</i> which is distributed widely across Scotland. Moreover, a specific reference to FAS will be included in the HEBS booklet given to all new mothers <i>Ready, Steady, Baby</i> a guide to pregnancy, birth and early parenthood which is currently being revised. The risks of FAS are also highlighted in the <i>Framework for Maternity Services</i> published by the Executive in February 2001 and in <i>Getting our Priorities Right</i> offering guidance to agencies on working with families affected by problem drug use, which was published in September 2001.</p>

Authorities report on their delivery of services in annual Community Care Plans, which are publicly available.

  <p>The Executive allocates resources to local authorities to provide a full spectrum of community care services, including support for carers and the people they look after. Additional resources were allocated to local authorities from 2000-01 onwards to implement the Carers Strategy, and the Executive has made it clear to authorities that it expects these additional resources to be used to benefit carers. Detailed decisions about the use of resources are for local authorities, taking account of local needs and priorities, and authorities are answerable to their local communities for these decisions. Authorities report on their use of these resources in annual Community Care Plans, which are publicly available. We are also allocating local authorities further new resources to develop an additional 22,000 weeks of respite services across Scotland by 2003-04 each year and we will be monitoring the outcomes achieved through local outcome agreements with individual councils.</p>

  <p>The ScotXed (Scottish Exchange of Educational Data) project envisages that, by 2005, all major exchanges of data between ScotXed partners should be electronic. As well as transfers of data to the Scottish Executive Education Department (SEED), this will include data transfers between schools, local authorities, colleges, the Scottish Qualifications Authority and Her Majesty&#146;s Inspectorate of Education.</p>

  <p>It is planned that most of SEED&#146;s school education statistical surveys will be carried out by ScotXed by 2005, starting with the Scottish School Census this autumn.

  <p>The ScotXed (Scottish Exchange of Educational Data) project is a partnership of the Scottish Executive Education Department (SEED) with local authorities, schools, the Scottish Qualifications Authority, HM Inspectorate of Education and Learning and Teaching Scotland to promote the electronic exchange of educational information to common standards. The project will provide better quality information and link-ups between education partners in Scotland and will encourage the good use of management information by schools and education authorities.</p>

  <p>Most of the information needed by different ScotXed partners already exists on school Management Information Systems. Adopting a common approach to the format in which this information is held and the way it can be transmitted will reduce the bureaucratic burden on teachers, administrative staff and school managers. Data will only have to be entered once and then can be used to meet the information needs of all ScotXed partners. This will be much more straightforward for teachers, administrative staff and school managers to provide information to those who need it.</p>

  <p>The introduction of automatic quality assurance procedures on school Management Information Systems will make the administrative burden lighter, since less time will have to be spent checking data to make sure they are accurate. ScotXed will also make possible a much wider range of benchmarking information, which will enable schools and authorities to produce analyses of data that are tailored to their particular needs, and assist with targeting resources where they are needed most.</p>

  <p>The strategic planning for the ScotXed project is undertaken by the School Education Information Advisory Group (SEIAG), which has endorsed plans for the 2002 Scottish School Census and beyond. The SEIAG membership includes representatives of: the Association of Directors of Education in Scotland, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, the Headteachers Association of Scotland, the Association of Head Teachers in Scotland, the Educational Institute of Scotland, the Scottish Secondary Teachers Association, the Scottish Qualifications Authority, Learning and Teaching Scotland, Her Majesty&#146;s Inspectorate of Education, as well as representatives from the Scottish Executive Education Department (SEED).</p>

  <p>Consultations have also taken place with the Scottish Council of Independent Schools, the Scottish Parent Teacher Council and with the Scottish School Board Association who have publicly welcomed the project.</p>

  <p>Regular consultations take place with each local authority. SEED hosted two rounds of ScotXed Forum Meetings in January and March 2002. Each local authority and their corresponding school management information system software supplier attended these meetings.</p>

  <p>Each partner has differing information needs which will be collected through ScotXed. Schools, local authorities and the SQA require individual pupils&#146; name and address for administrative purposes.

This includes individual pupils&#146; name and postcode but not address.</p>

  <p>SEED will be collecting the names of individual pupils to assist in technical and administrative checks to ensure the completeness and accuracy of data. SEED will be collecting the postcode of pupils in order to analyse educational data by local geographical areas. The Scottish Executive, under the Neighbourhood Statistics initiative, is committed to producing local area statistics across a range of public services including education. All ScotXed information collected by SEED will be transferred, processed and stored to comply with the Data Protection Act and the National Statistics Code of Practice, to safeguard confidentiality of individuals.</p>

  <p>Agreement was reached with Aberdeenshire Drug and Alcohol Action Team (DAAT) at the turn of the year that I would meet with the DAAT and visit local drug agencies during the Parliament&#146;s presence in Aberdeen at the end of May. Arrangements had to be revised due to unforeseen parliamentary commitments on Tuesday 28 May (the Queen&#146;s Address and a member&#146;s debate on drug misuse in the North East of Scotland). The visit to the DAAT went ahead on Wednesday 29 May and Mary Mulligan, Deputy Minister for Health and Community Care, also attended.</p>

  <p>The First Minister and I visited a local drugs project on the same day, the arrangements for which were made the previous day. I also formally opened the Drug Treatment and Testing Order Office in the Gallowgate, Aberdeen on Wednesday 29 May. This was arranged in mid-May.</p>

  <p>I unfortunately had to cancel, at short notice, two visits in my programme to Turning Point, Peterhead and the Kenmay Drug Project. This was due to my being called away on business related to the parliamentary debate on drug misuse in North East Scotland.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The monitoring process of the contract at Kilmarnock involves daily interaction between the Prison Director and his staff and the Controller and his staff in the course of which a wide range of topics are covered as necessary.</p>

  <p>These discussions will include, as necessary, how appropriately to respond to any communications from third parties but SPS has provided no formal advice or assistance to the operators.</p>

  <p>The main audience for news releases lies in media organisations, but the Press Office also sends by email copies of press releases to a small number of MSPs, researchers and others in Parliament who have requested copies. In practice the best vehicle to keep in touch with Executive news releases is the Executive news website which carries all news releases shortly after they have been issued to the media: ( <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/pages/news/today.aspx">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/pages/news/today.aspx</a> ).</p>

  <p>No black granite is being sourced from Zimbabwe for the Scottish Parliament. The Convener of the Holyrood Progress Group has informed me that some black granite is required for cladding purposes, to provide a contrast with the other cladding, and supplies of Belfast Black granite are being obtained from a quarry in South Africa. Black granite is not available in Scotland, but the vast majority of all granite supplies being procured for the Parliament building project is being sourced from Kemnay Quarry in Aberdeenshire.</p>
