  <p>The Scottish Arts Council recently announced its flexible funding programme for 2009-11. Decisions on the allocation of funds are a matter for the Scottish Arts Council.

  <p>Note: 1. Registrations are based on the postcode of the practice as opposed to the postcode of the patient. The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of registrations by the resident population for the particular area/age group etc. This has led to percentages greater than 100.</p>

  <p>Information on the number of national broadband connections is not held centrally. However, figures for broadband connections on the Western Isles could be ascertained by adding together the number of customers served by Connected Communities with those served by BT broadband-enabled exchanges on the islands. These latter figures can be obtained by contacting Highlands and Islands Enterprise and BT.</p>

  <p>There was never such an agreement with BT as to which areas of the Western Isles would or would not be provided with broadband services. BT chose which exchanges on the Islands they would enable for broadband. Their decision was a purely commercial one in which the Scottish Government had no role.</p>

  <p>HMIE monitors the feedback it seeks and receives on a constant basis from head teachers, staff and professional associations on its inspection processes. It also commissions regular external, independent research involving parents and other stakeholders. As a result and over a number of years, HMIE has taken positive action to address issues raised, including mitigating unnecessary pressure on teaching staff. Such actions have included reducing the notification period for inspections and reducing the amount of pre-inspection information requested from establishments being inspected.</p>

  <p>HMIE works hard to ensure that inspections are as constructive and positive an experience as possible and that they lead to improvement for children and other learners. It invests heavily in induction training and continuing professional development of inspectors to ensure that inspections are conducted professionally and constructively.</p>

  <p>Following initial internal development from January 2008, agreement was reached in March 2008 with Scottish ministers on the principles to be applied in the new models of inspection. Starting in April, HMIE entered a period of consultation with a wide range of stakeholders on these principles and the processes to be applied in the new inspections. This consultation exercise is still on-going and the approaches are presently being tested in a set of pilot inspections following which the stakeholders involved will be asked to provide feedback. Taking account of this feedback and to give all schools and education authorities detail about the new arrangements, HMIE will provide comprehensive public information on its plans to implement the new approach in time for the start of school session 2008-09. They have been designed to take account of the changing environment within which scrutiny of public services takes place as well as the feedback received on the inspection process, and the findings from research with external stakeholders. The new inspection models are designed to ensure that any inspection has maximum impact with minimum intrusion. Inspections will be shorter, more proportionate and involve the evaluation of a reduced number of quality indicators. To help reduce bureaucracy, the new inspections will require the preparation of less documentation by the school and will build more on the school&rsquo;s own self-evaluation. Greater emphasis is also being placed on professional dialogue between inspectors and staff in these new inspections to promote better partnership working and provide support to bring about improvement for all learners.</p>

  <p>The recently launched Energy Saving Scotland advice network, funded by Scottish Government and managed by the Energy Saving Trust, provides advice and support to householders wishing to reduce their energy use and cut their fuel bills.</p>

  <p>Smart meters and real time displays could also play a role and we work closely with the UK Government in this policy area. The UK Government is already undertaking a major UK-wide pilot to gain a good understanding of the costs and benefits of smart meters. This pilot includes Scottish consumers and we await the results of the pilot with keen interest.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government and the Northern Ireland Executive have appointed MVA Consultancy to undertake a STAG Appraisal of the route. The STAG Appraisal will consider all of the options available for delivering a ferry service on this route, and will allow us to examine the economic viability of the route. MVA Consultancy is making good progress with this work, and is on target to deliver the appraisal by summer 2008.</p>

  <p>Following completion of the STAG appraisal, Scottish Government and Northern Ireland ministers will reach a decision about a future tender for a subsidised ferry service on this route. The Scottish Government has put funding in place to allow the service to start in 2009.</p>

  <p>This consultation is designed to set out proposals to safeguard the future of Scottish fishing communities. For the purposes of operating a distinct quota management and licensing system in Scotland it sets out proposals for licensing conditions of Scottish fishing vessels and for defining &quot;Scottish quota&quot; which is designed to reflect the current makeup of the industry in Scotland, and currently applies to the vast majority of vessels and vessel owners who deem themselves Scottish. It should have little impact on business activity.</p>

  <p>In the run up to implementation of any new system following consultation we have implemented a moratorium which is designed to help provide stability and ensure that at the end of the consultation process Scotland has broadly the same amount of quota under management as it did at the start.

  <p>The Scottish Government proposes that the requirement to demonstrate an economic link to the UK will remain and be varied so as to require a vessel fishing against FQAs associated with a Scottish fishing vessel licence to demonstrate an economic link to Scotland. As with the UK economic link requirements there will be a number of ways the economic link can be satisfied.</p>

Where a vessel does not meet the proposed licence condition for a Scottish fishing vessel i.e. registered and administered in a port in Scotland and in membership of a Scottish recognised PO, these vessels will be given an opportunity to declare their preferred choice of administrations.</p>

Aggregations can be a useful tool in helping to deliver change in the fishing industry.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will outline the saving anticipated from the reform of summary justice.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-06-09.S3W-13333.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80341" speakername="Kenny MacAskill" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa0609.htm#26">

  <p>The purpose of the summary justice reforms, as set out by the Scottish Government in the <em>Summary</em> <em>Justice Reform System Model</em> in 2007, is to improve the speed and effectiveness of the summary criminal courts in Scotland, by ensuring that only cases which should go to court do so and that those cases get there more quickly, are better prepared and progress more speedily for the benefit of victims and witnesses. A copy of the System Model paper is available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number. 45774) and on the Scottish Government website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/09/06092618/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/09/06092618/0</a> .</p>

  <p>Whilst the programme is not primarily designed to make savings, the Scottish Government expects that, alongside improvements in the operation of the summary justice system, some cash-releasing and time-releasing savings will accrue.</p>

  <p>It is estimated that the legislative reforms to fines enforcement will lead to annual cash savings for the Scottish Court Service (SCS) of around &pound;1 million. These expected cash savings derive from a reduction in the number of means enquiry courts and more administrative collection of fines through the introduction of fines enforcement officers. These cash savings will allow SCS to improve the level of court service provision they provide by investing in front line court services.</p>

  <p>In addition, further estimated savings arising from SCS centralising their fines collection systems and phased court unification have been identified and feature in DG Justice <em>Efficiency Delivery Plans</em> 14 &amp; 18 with cash savings of &pound;0.685 million in financial year 2008-09, &pound;0.802 million in 2009-10 and &pound;1.002 million in 2010-11 expected.</p>

  <p>The <em>Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service Efficiency Delivery Plan 1 - Summary Justice Reform</em> outlined cash savings of &pound;1.92 million in 2008-09 and &pound;3.7 million in 2009-10. These savings will derive from more offences being dealt outwith the courts and a redistribution of business from the sheriff solemn courts to the sheriff summary courts and from sheriff summary courts to district courts. These expected efficiencies were taken into account by ministers in setting the allocation to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service as part of the 2007 Spending Review settlement.</p>

  <p>Changes to the volume of cases being prosecuted in the summary courts is expected to lead to a reduction in expenditure on legal aid estimated at &pound;3.9 million annually by 2010-11. This is detailed at paragraph 14.1 of the DG <em>Justice Efficiency Delivery Plan 7</em>, which outlines the Scottish Legal Aid Board&rsquo;s broader programme of efficiency improvements.</p>

  <p>It is expected that the summary reforms will not have a significant impact on prison numbers (details can be found at paragraph 431 of the financial memorandum for the Criminal Proceedings etc. (Reform) (Scotland) Act 2007).</p>

  <p><a href="../../../business/bills/55-criminalProceedings/b55s2-introd-en.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/bills/55-criminalProceedings/b55s2-introd-en.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p>There will be some time releasing savings for the police in relation to dealing with fewer means enquiry warrants and requiring to give evidence in court in fewer cases. It is estimated these time releasing savings will amount to some &pound;1 million a year by 2010-11 and will allow a reprioritisation of police officer duties into front line duties.</p>

  <p>Each of the Efficiency Delivery Plans referred to is available in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s revised <em>Efficiency Delivery Plans 2008-2011</em> published on 30 May 2008. A copy of the document is available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number: 45688), and also on the Scottish Government website.</p>

  <p>The recorded crime data held centrally has the number of crimes recorded by the police and the number recorded as detected (that is, there is sufficient evidence to justify consideration of criminal proceedings). We cannot provide any information on the number of people involved in crimes, since it is possible that individuals may be responsible for more than one of the crimes recorded.

  <p>Councils have a duty to properly assess their activities for equalities impact. It is not for the government to compel a council to undertake an EQIA. However as the Scottish Government is engaged with local authorities in the development of single outcome agreements, it recognises its responsibility to work with councils to ensure that equality is properly considered and reflected.</p>

  <p>Under the arrangements set out in the concordat between the Scottish Government and local government, each council will be required to submit an annual report setting out progress and achievements towards the national outcomes.

  <p>In further support we have published a guidance report last year setting out the care advantages of and steps toward social prescribing for those with anxiety and depression or other mental illness.</p>

  <p>That report, <em>Developing Social Prescribing and Community Referrals for Mental Health in Scotland</em> (Bib. number 45194) provides current service examples and offers guidance on steps that can be taken to encourage and arrange access to the arts; creativity, physical activity, learning, volunteering and other approaches for the potential positive impact these pursuits can have on mental wellbeing. The report sets out roles for Community Mental Health Partnerships and others.</p>

  <p>Attention on progress is maintained through our focus on delivering the now four HEAT targets for mental health which include action on alternatives to medication and on reducing admissions to hospital care both of which have relevance to the objectives set.</p>

I understand it is already in the commercial interests of the train operating companies to maximise revenue and, accordingly, it has not proved necessary to impose mandatory requirements to maximise the uptake of underused services.</p>

  <p>The key aim of the Science Engagement Grant scheme is to support informal science engagement outreach activities across Scotland. This competitive grant scheme is advertised on the Scottish Government website ( <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk</a> ) and is open to all competent science engagement providers to bid for grant.</p>

  <p>No bids were received specifically from organisations in the Kilmarnock and Loudoun area for 2008-09. However, Scottish Government has funded initiatives such as <em>Generation Science</em>, a touring science engagement programme managed by the Edinburgh International Science Festival, which this year visited a number of schools in the Kilmarnock and Loudoun area.</p>

  <p>While the Scottish Government is keen that successful projects reach as wide an audience as possible, it has not to date taken any steps to target specific areas of Scotland: rather, it responds to bids received. The assessment criteria for the Science Engagement Grant scheme are kept under constant review and currently include a weighting for bids that target areas where engagement is currently low.</p>

  <p>Students who are not eligible to apply for the disabled students allowance (DSA) are:</p>

  <p>those who do not meet the residence conditions as set out in the Students&rsquo; Allowance (Scotland) Regulations 2007 (as amended);</p>

  <p>those who are studying a course that the Student Awards Agency for Scotland (SAAS) does not support;</p>

  <p>part-time students undertaking less than 50% of a full time course;</p>

  <p>Open University students studying less than 60 credits;</p>

  <p>students undertaking a course below HNC level (except those doing a SAAS funded adult education course at one of the UK&rsquo;s adult education residential colleges);</p>

  <p>students who are receiving funding from their local education authority, and</p>

  <p>postgraduate students who are receiving funding from a research council or the social work department.</p>

  <p>However, these students can receive support via other means. For example, students undertaking a further education course can apply for an additional support needs learning allowance. Colleges and universities also have a responsibility under the Disability Discrimination Act to make reasonable adjustments to ensure that students with disabilities are not at a substantial disadvantage compared to non-disabled students when attending their institutions. This can include providing, within reason, equipment, services, appropriate access to buildings and that adjustments are made to teaching practices and assessments. This duty means that the needs of all disabled students should be met whether or not they receive the DSA or the additional support needs learning allowance. In addition, institutions are also allocated additional funding through the disabled students premium and extended learning support to support disabled students. This funding can also be used to support students who are not eligible for the DSA.</p>
