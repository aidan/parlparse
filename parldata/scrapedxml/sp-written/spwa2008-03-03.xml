  <p>Scotland&rsquo;s share of the money raised by the UK Government from the aggregates tax is indirectly reflected in our overall spending review settlement. Environmental spending is a devolved matter and the Scottish Government&rsquo;s plans for environmental spending are set out in our budget. A couple of the larger projects that have been funded in recent years are a Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) aggregates programme, aimed at increasing the country&rsquo;s production and use of secondary and recycled aggregates, and a Sustainable Design in Architecture project raising awareness of the need for a more considered design approach to our built environment based on principles of sustainable development.</p>

  <p>The fuel poverty programmes have included the provision of central heating in both the public and private sectors. In the public sector, local authorities completed installations in their properties in March 2004 and housing associations completed installations in their properties in December 2004, except Glasgow Housing Association properties where, due to the high number of properties involved, the Programme was completed in March 2007. In the private sector, installations have been carried out by the managing agent.</p>

  <p>The number of systems installed in the public sector from the start of the programme in 2001 until the programme ended in December 2004 are held as annual installation figures. The number of systems installed over the period requested in Falkirk, North Lanarkshire and South Lanarkshire council areas, is shown in the following table:</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-6592 on 6 December 2007, which provided figures which were calculated using total Scottish Budget figures that included Annually Managed Expenditure which contains those elements of expenditure that are not readily predictable such as NHS and Teachers&rsquo; pensions and the cost of capital for Scotland&rsquo;s trunk road network. The alternative measure of Scottish Government budget is Departmental Expenditure Limit. Both these figures for each year are noted as follows.</p>

  <p>2007-08</p>

  <p>Total Managed Expenditure (TME) = &pound;31,894.9 million.</p>

  <p>Departmental Expenditure Limit (DEL) (minus AME) = &pound;26,717.4 million.</p>

  <p>2008-09</p>

  <p>Total Managed Expenditure (TME) = &pound;33,181.2 million.</p>

  <p>Departmental Expenditure Limit (DEL) (minus AME) = &pound;27,891.7million.</p>

  <p>For consistency&rsquo;s sake, the percentage figures requested have been provided using both TME and DEL budget figures:</p>

  <p>2007-08</p>

  <p>Based on TME, the culture budget is 0.75% of the total Scottish budget.</p>

  <p>Based on DEL, the culture budget is 0.89% of the total Scottish budget.</p>

  <p>2008-09</p>

  <p>Based on TME, the culture budget is 0.76% of the total Scottish budget.</p>

  <p>Based on DEL, the culture budget is 0.90% of the total Scottish budget.</p>

  <p>In addition to this, one-off additional funding of &pound;12.3 million was received in 2007-08 at the spring and autumn budget revisions.</p>

  <p>The primary aim of statutory regulation of the healthcare professions is to improve public safety. Regulation by the General Dental Council (GDC) was introduced for professions complementary to dentistry by the Dental Act 1984 (Amendment) Order 2005 following extensive UK-wide consultation. Further legislation in 2006 specified dental nurses, dental technicians, clinical dental technicians and orthodontic therapists as professions complementary to dentistry and also made provisions relating to their registration with the GDC.</p>

  <p>From 31 July 2008, all dental technicians must be registered with the General Dental Council in order to practise as such. In terms of legislation made in 2006 they have already had two years to register on the basis of GDC approved experience and/or qualifications. From 31 July 2008 they will only be able to register on the basis of approved qualifications.</p>

  <p>The GDC has carried out a widespread publicity campaign to ensure that dental technicians register on time and are able to continue to practise after 31 July 2008. The council has issued regular press releases and articles to the trade press, and representatives have attended relevant dental professional exhibitions and events as well as numerous speaking opportunities. Information has also been posted on the GDC website and in its newsletter, which has been distributed with the two main dental technician publications during the two year transition period. The GDC has also been liaising with the relevant professional organisations, who have been targeting their members and have written directly to all registered dentists asking them to contact their dental technicians and ask them if they are registered. The GDC will continue this publicity campaign and plans to write directly to dental laboratories within the next few weeks.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has no power to stop dentists sending their work overseas, rather than to laboratories in Scotland or the rest of the UK, now or after July 2008, as to do so would be to act incompatibly with community law. It is for dentists themselves to ensure that they deliver a safe service and we would encourage them to send work to dental technicians registered with the General Dental Council to ensure patient safety.</p>

  <p>Under the previous Scottish Executive, information on partners and their income was not recorded. The Student Awards Agency for Scotland (SAAS) does not ask for details of partner&rsquo;s income because they are currently not recognised in the income assessment for living cost support. It is therefore not possible to estimate how many students will be affected by the changes as we do not know how many students have partners, or what the partner&rsquo;s income is.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government did attempt to model the costs involved in estimating how many students in Scotland will benefit from the extension of the dependant&rsquo;s grant to students who have a partner on a low income. However, because this information is not available, it is not possible to produce accurate forecasts.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will ensure that all income available to households will be recorded by SAAS and will closely monitor the numbers affected by these changes from 2008-09 onwards.</p>

  <p>The notice issued by B&ograve;rd na G&agrave;idhlig to the Scottish Executive in August 2006 specified that the Scottish Executive Gaelic language plan should be submitted to B&ograve;rd na G&agrave;idhlig in August 2007. In common with other public bodies which have been asked to prepare statutory Gaelic language plans the then Scottish Executive sought, and was granted, an extension by B&ograve;rd na G&agrave;idhlig. This extension was required to enable adequate time to consider the two key statutory documents published in May 2007, the National Gaelic Language Plan and Guidance on the development of Gaelic language plans, which public bodies must have regard to when preparing their Gaelic language plans. The extension also allowed the new Scottish Government time to consider the opportunities for Gaelic development which could be included in the Gaelic language plan. The Scottish Government intends to publish a draft Gaelic language plan for consultation shortly, with a view to submitting a final Gaelic language plan to B&ograve;rd na G&agrave;idhlig for approval as soon as possible thereafter.</p>

  <p>The early management of patients with a head injury is covered in <em>SIGN Guideline 46</em> which is currently under revision and due for publication in 2009. The draft revised guidelines suggest that patients with severe head injury should be assessed for multi-disciplinary rehabilitation. A discharge letter should be sent to every general practitioner about every patient, whether admitted to hospital or not and should indicate whether follow up has been arranged. If no follow up has been offered, the discharge letter should indicate that good recovery is likely within a few weeks but should unforeseen or persisting difficulties arise then follow up would be arranged.</p>

  <p>We are currently implementing our Rehabilitation Framework which will be taken forward in each NHS board by rehabilitation coordinators who are about to be appointed. The framework will create an effective multi-agency approach to rehabilitation services which are flexible and responsive to the needs of patients and communities in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The most suitable vehicle for taking this forward is the national Managed Clinical Network (MCN) for Acquired Brain Injury (ABI). One of its main aims is to provide, in easily accessible formats, high quality information for people with ABI and their families and carers which is relevant to the different stages of the patient journey. One of the MCN&rsquo;s working groups is identifying current practice related to information-giving and is in the process of collecting good examples of written information made available to patients and their families.</p>

The Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) was established to reduce the incidence of so called &quot;postcode prescribing&quot; in Scotland. Its remit is to provide advice to all NHS boards and their Area Drug and Therapeutics Committees (ADTCs) across Scotland about the status of all newly licensed medicines, all new formulations of existing medicines and new indications for established products.

  <p>The latest figures for landlord registration show that the number of applications by landlords for registration is approximately 108,000, while the number of privately rented dwellings they operate is approximately 160,000. Landlords and agents are required to register in each authority where they own or manage property, so these figures include multiple registrations for some individuals or organisations.</p>

  <p>The landlord registration system does not collect information on whether properties meet the Tolerable Standard or the Scottish Housing Quality Standard (SQHS). However, on the basis of the sampling carried out by the Scottish House Condition Survey we estimate that at least 96% of privately rented properties meet the Tolerable Standard and between 13% and 25% meet the SHQS. There is no legal requirement for privately rented houses to meet the SHQS. However, since September 2007 private landlords have been required to ensure that their properties meet the Repairing Standard. If a landlord fails to comply with a Repairing Standard enforcement order, the local authority must take this into account when determining whether the landlord is fit and proper to let property.</p>

  <p>We will implement provisions in the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 that enhance local authorities&rsquo; powers to enforce higher quality standards in the private housing sector as a whole, including the private rented sector. For example, a local authority will be able to require the drawing up and implementation of a maintenance plan for a house that has not been, or is unlikely to be, maintained to a reasonable standard.</p>

  <p>For the private rented sector the recently announced National Voluntary Landlord Accreditation scheme will require landlords to confirm that they are meeting legal requirements in letting and will encourage a process of continuous improvement in both the physical condition and management of private rented accommodation. This builds on the steps already taken to ensure sound minimum standards through the requirement for private landlords to be registered and the introduction in September 2007 of the Repairing Standard for private rented houses. This standard extends the statutory responsibility of a private landlord to maintain a house in a reasonable state of repair. Tenants now have the power to enforce the standard by applying to the Private Rented Housing Panel, which can take action against landlords who fail to comply with the standard.</p>

  <p>1. The figures give courses which have been undertaken by learners and it includes some repeat learning by individual learners.</p>

  <p>2. The amount spent by learners excludes any personal or third party contribution paid towards the cost of learning.</p>

  <p>3. The unit cost includes all admin costs, VAT, development costs, marketing costs and the amount spent by learners as at 1.</p>

  <p>4. The Individual Learning Account Scotland scheme began in December 2004 and therefore the data is given to the end of the financial year at March 2005.</p>

  <p>No such discussions have taken place. However, we have recently announced a three year funding package of &pound;778,000 for the Scottish Business Crime Centre (SBCC). The SBCC provide practical advice to the business/commercial sectors on how to develop business crime reduction and prevention strategies. Through the Scottish Financial Crime Group, which the SBCC are responsible for, Scotland continues to monitor the issue, particularly in relation to any migration/displacement of such crimes and any local and regional increases in Scotland. Prevention is very much the primary focus of its work.</p>

  <p>The following table shows the numbers of applications for sanction to instruct senior and/or junior counsel for trial or proof by the month in which they were received by the Scottish Legal Aid Board. The table shows the final decision on those applications taking into account any reconsiderations (further reconsiderations of refusals may yet be received) and the number granted or part-granted as a proportion of the number of applications in that month.</p>

  <p>Applications which were granted in part are those where sanction was not deemed to be appropriate for the full extent of the work for which it was sought. Applications which were &quot;not considered&quot; are primarily those where the applicant indicated, before a final decision was made, that sanction is no longer required.</p>

  <p>One of the aims of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005 is to encourage pubs to become more child and family friendly. The new act replaces the complicated system of children&rsquo;s certificates with mandatory conditions concerning premises&rsquo; policies on access by children and a requirement for baby changing facilities in every on-sales premises allowing access to children under five. It will be a matter for operators to ensure that their premises are safe and suitable for those under 18 and this will be carefully assessed by their local licensing board in granting the licence on those terms.</p>

  <p>The Chief Scientist Office (CSO), of the Scottish Government Health Directorates, has responsibility for encouraging and supporting research into health and health care needs in Scotland. The CSO primarily responds to requests for funding research proposals initiated by the research community in Scotland.</p>

  <p>For the purposes of this reply, neuroscience is defined as the study of the nervous system including the brain, the spinal cord and networks of sensory nerve cells or neurons. It includes Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, dementias, Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, neurodegenerative diseases, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. It does not include mental health or stroke management research. In each of the last five years to support neuroscience research in Scotland, the CSO has awarded directly the following funds:</p>

  <p>2003: &pound;557,259</p>

  <p>2004: &pound;1,108,322</p>

  <p>2005: &pound;827,287</p>

  <p>2006: &pound;735,285</p>

  <p>2007: &pound;827,830.</p>

  <p>The CSO would welcome further research proposals in this area which would be subject to the usual peer and committee review.</p>

  <p>The main agency through which the UK Government supports medical and clinical research is the Medical Research Council (MRC). The value of funding awards for neuroscience research in Scotland made by the MRC for each year of the last five years is not available. The MRC fund research on a UK wide basis and do not hold funding information specific to Scotland. In 2006, the UK Clinical Research Collaboration (UKCRC) published a health research analysis report, which can be obtained at <a href="http://www.ukcrc.org/publications/reports.aspx" target="_blank">www.ukcrc.org/publications/reports.aspx.</a> The analysis does not give separate data for Scotland but provides information of the distribution of research funding across all types of research in the UK for the first time. The data collected by UKCRC for this analysis was from the 11 largest government and charity funders of health related research for the financial year 2004-05. From this data UKCRC has advised that the MRC spent &pound;3.5 million on neuroscience research in Scotland in 2004-05.</p>

  <p>The above mentioned funds exclude indirect research support and infrastructure costs for neuroscience research, details of which are not held centrally.</p>

  <p>Health care, including dentistry, for serving armed forces personnel is provided by Medical Defence Services. On leaving the Service, they are entitled to register with a GP in the same way as the general population. The extension of priority treatment for veterans guidance, which issued to NHS Scotland on 13 February 2008, also includes guidance for GPs obtaining the medical records of ex-servicemen and women from the Ministry of Defence.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government wishes to improve access to NHS dentistry for everyone and is:</p>

  <p>increasing the number of dental students to help meet the demand for dental care. Bursaries are available for students on the understanding that they work for a period of time in the NHS after qualification;</p>

  <p>opening a new dental school in Aberdeen, planned for October 2008, which will add to the number of dentists in Scotland;</p>

  <p>making grants available through the Scottish dental access initiative for practitioners to expand their NHS practice or to open a new practice and there are allowances to encourage dentists to set up in rural and remote areas, and</p>

No adjustment has been made to the above figures to reflect these extra costs.</p>

  <p>1. The number of physiotherapists employed on an agenda for change (AfC) band 5 is 439 (head count) and 398.3. (whole-time equivalent) as at 30 September 2007. This will include newly qualified physiotherapists and staff who have been in post for more than a year.</p>

  <p>2. As part of their workforce planning, NHS boards have forecast an increase in qualified Physiotherapists by 6.9% over the next three years.</p>

  <p>3. Information about the number of physiotherapy students who will graduate in the next 10 years is not available. The Scottish Government Health Directorates neither commission nor control the numbers of physiotherapists in training in Scotland.

In particular, the National Solutions Group which includes the CSP, is taking forward a range of solutions including the development of a pan-Scotland AHP Bank to provide wide ranging and flexible job opportunities for newly qualified AHPs to work in a community care setting and developing the NES Ready4Work Programme which will be online from April and aims to keep graduates work ready.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what steps it is taking to provide details of in-patient and out-patient waiting times for treatment for glaucoma and cataracts in each of the last three years, broken down by NHS board.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-03-03.S3W-10051.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80396" speakername="Nicola Sturgeon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa0303.htm#34">

  <p>On 31 December 2007, no patient waited more than 18 weeks for a first out-patient consultation, or for in-patient and day case treatment. Also on that date NHSScotland effectively delivered a 18 weeks total journey waiting time from General Medical Practitioner/Optometrist referral to cataract surgery</p>

  <p>Retrospective analyses of waiting times for first out-patient consultations are only available at specialty level and exclude patients who held an availability status code. Information on waiting times for a first out-patient consultation in the speciality of ophthalmology showing the median wait and the percentage of patients seen within 18 weeks following referral, for the years ending 31 December 2005, 2006 and 2007 has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 44909). Waiting times information is also collected from a monthly waiting list census and information on the number of patients without an availability status code who had waited more than 18 weeks for a first out-patient consultation in the speciality of ophthalmology on 31 December 2005, 2005 and 2007 has also been provided.</p>

  <p>Retrospective analyses of waiting times for in-patient and day case treatment are based on data that does not record whether patients have had an availability status code applied. The information requested on treatment for glaucoma and cataracts showing the median wait and the percentage of patients treated within 18 weeks of being placed on the in-patient and day case waiting list for the years ending 31 December 2005, 2006 and 2007 has also been provided; it includes the waiting times of patients who were exempted from the guarantee. In-patient and day case waiting times information is also collected from a monthly census. As data is collected for cataract surgery but not for glaucoma treatment, information on the number of patients with a waiting time guarantee waiting more than 18 weeks for in-patient and day case treatment in the specialty of ophthalmology and for cataract surgery on 31 December 2005, 2006 and 2007 has been provided.</p>

  <p>The new approach to defining and measuring waiting &ndash; referred to as new ways &ndash; came into effect on 1 January 2008. Unlike the previous system where patients who had an availability status code applied could have exceedingly long waits - in some cases of over 12 months - all patients will be covered by the maximum waiting time standard. It is intended to publish as much information as possible about patients waiting times experience including periods of unavailability. Information for the three months ending 31 March 2008 will be published at the end of May 2008.</p>

  <p>There has been no guidance issued to NHS boards since May 2007 in respect of funding of patient services in the private sector.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are responsible for decision making in relation to creating capacity to deliver their commitments to patients, including use of the independent sector where this is deemed appropriate. However, we would expect that NHS boards will always maximise the use of NHS capacity before turning to the private sector.</p>

  <p>Using data supplied by the Health Professions Council (HPC), our best estimate (rounded to the nearest 10) for the number of occupational therapists who are registered and who are known to be working in Aberdeen City, Aberdeenshire and Angus are as follows:</p>

  <p>Aberdeen City - 130 occupational therapists</p>

  <p>Aberdeenshire - 60 occupational therapists</p>

  <p>Angus - 30 occupational therapists.</p>

  <p>The above figures should be seen as estimates as the HPC do not have recorded the workplace for all registered occupational therapists in Scotland. Therefore, the above figures could possibly be under-estimated.</p>

  <p>Also, the above estimates are based on the postcode district (i.e. the first part of the postcode) of the registered occupational therapist&rsquo;s workplace. As the same postcode district could be spread across more than one local authority area, occupational therapists have been assigned to the local authority that accounted for the highest number of individual postcodes within each postcode district.</p>

  <p>No specific targets have been set to reduce travel times on the Inverness to Wick/Thurso, Mallaig to Glasgow and Oban to Glasgow lines. We are, however, committed to improving journey times across Scotland.</p>

  <p>We have an aspiration to upgrade the Highland Main Line between Inverness and Perth offering a reduced journey time to Perth and Edinburgh/Glasgow. Current estimates suggest that a journey time saving of around 15 minutes can be achieved on the current fastest trains from Inverness to Perth.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-8799 on 1 February 2008. The resources referred to are the time and expertise of the consultants. They are providing advice and support to the councils on the preparation of spatial frameworks and policies for wind farms. The consultants have written to the councils to explain their work and seek initial feedback on the services they can offer. They have also invited the councils to attend a workshop in March. The consultant&rsquo;s remit does not include work on specific applications so a break down on that basis cannot be provided.</p>

  <p>Each care home will have its own set of rules for the day-to-day running of the home. <em>The National Care Standards - Care Homes for Older People</em> require care home providers to ensure that residents and their representatives are aware of the rules before taking up residence in the home. Residents must also be advised of their rights and responsibilities whilst living in the home. Care Home providers are also required to have proper systems in place to protect residents. These should include a system whereby visitors obtain permission prior to entering the home.</p>

  <p>For an adult with a mental incapacity, account should be taken of the views of anyone with formal powers to take decisions about the person&rsquo;s welfare. All decisions taken on behalf of a person with impaired capacity must reflect the principles set out in the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000, including to ensure that each decision will benefit the adult and takes account of the views of others with an interest in his or her welfare.</p>

  <p>There may be occasions when care home managers refuse to allow visitors entry to the home. This could be in response to the wishes of residents and their families or for reasons of safety.</p>

  <p>Care homes are regulated by the Care Commission, which takes the National Care Standards into account in carrying out its regulatory role.</p>

  <p>We believe that students are being wrongly assessed under the current means test arrangements. In recognising household income from 2008-09, the revised means test will ensure that all students are now assessed for student support on an equal basis.</p>

  <p>We recognise that some students may be eligible for less student support from the government and a higher contribution from their household as result of the additional income that we will now take into account.</p>

  <p>Therefore, for a transitional period, we will make funds available through our discretionary funds to those students who are in genuine financial difficulty as a result of changes to the means test.</p>
