  <p>The use of cash retentions is a common practice that has, for decades, been a feature of standard conditions of contract widely used in the construction industry. Whilst retentions are at times unpopular with contractors, they do provide some comfort to clients by providing an incentive for contractors and suppliers to comply fully with their obligations, or to fund the making good of defects. However, cash retentions are not a matter in which the Scottish Executive has any regulatory authority.</p>

  <p>The aim of the Scottish Welfare to Work Task Force Construction Sub-group is to increase the number of long-term unemployed people entering the Construction Industry through an employer-led welfare to work access model, tailored to the needs of Scotland.</p>

  <p>The group has not set specific targets of numbers into work. Its role is to develop and test the access model, with a view to implementation across Scotland using local partnerships.</p>

  <p>The objectives of the Sub-group are:</p>

  <p>Research and evaluate various construction industry initiatives throughout the country and specifically in relation to Glasgow;</p>

  <p>Increase awareness of Welfare to Work programmes and their potential contributions within the sector;</p>

  <p>Develop a generic access model for training welfare to work clients in Scotland;</p>

  <p>Connect key players to Jobcentre Plus (CITB, employers, training providers, Local Enterprise Companies and Development Companies) and to support the development of local partnerships, and</p>

  <p>Ensure that the mechanism is in place to implement employer-led routeways through these partnerships.</p>

  <p>It intends to complete it&#146;s objectives by December this year.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Welfare to Work Task Force Construction Sub-group has not developed a New Deal scheme.</p>

  <p>Working closely with employers, CITB, local authorities, Scottish Enterprise and local training providers, it has agreed a generic construction industry access model for the long-term unemployed, and those disadvantaged in the labour market. It is intended that this could be used across the country in areas with skills shortages. Discussion is on-going to identify a suitable pilot area. At this time, it is likely that this will be in Glasgow.</p>

  <p>The model will make use of national and local welfare to work training funds.</p>

  <p>The decision on which type of hearing aid best meets the clinical need of individual patients is for the clinician in charge of their care.</p>

  <p>The Good Practice Guidance on Adult Hearing Aid Fitting Services issued by the Executive to NHSScotland in March last year recommends digital aids should be provided whenever clinical judgement indicates that they would provide benefit to the patient involved that would not be provided by other types of hearing aid. The guidance emphasises that the important issue is that of matching the features of the needs of the patient rather than whether these features are incorporated in digital, analogue or digitally programmable packages.</p>

  <p>There are currently 18 different types of digital hearing aid included within the wide range of hearing aids available on the central contracts arranged by Scottish Health care Supplies for the NHSScotland.</p>

  <p>Reducing health inequalities is the overarching aim of public health improvement policy. We are seeking to make progress by addressing the upstream determinants of health, through demonstration projects, healthy living centres, the Health Improvement Fund and wider work on lifestyles and life circumstances. At the same time, through a combination of investment and reform, we are seeking to enhance health care services in Scotland. NHS funding, which is at record levels and rising, is now distributed in a way that recognises the influence of deprivation and remoteness on health care needs.</p>

  <p>Besides this generic programme, we are directing specific attention to cancer and implementing a comprehensive strategy <i>Cancer in Scotland</i> (backed by &#163;60 million additional investment up until 2003-04) bringing together government, NHSScotland, and patients to secure better access and ensure more rapid diagnosis and treatment and improved services for people with cancer.</p>

  <p>Arrangements for the funding of adult voluntary hospices remain as set out in Management Executive Letter (1994) 104. NHS boards are expected, taking account of local circumstances, to fund 50% of hospices&#146; annual running costs. The Executive continuously monitors boards&#146; performance against that target, and is currently in discussion with the adult voluntary hospices about issuing further advice designed to clarify the elements of hospices&#146; running costs which would be eligible for 50% funding.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no reason to collect such information and has not done so. In any case this is information that can only be readily established through local enquiry. In our view most salmon fishing proprietors will already know whether their salmon fishings are liable to fall within the definition of &quot;eligible croft land&quot;. For those that do not it should be relatively straightforward to establish the circumstances of individual salmon fishings on a case by case basis by making local enquiries.</p>

  <p>The provisions relating to the valuation of land under Part 3 of the Land Reform Bill are contained in section 85 of the bill and these make it clear that the consideration will be based on the market value of the land as determined by a valuer.

  <p>The purpose of the Arbuthnott formula is to ensure that every NHS board in Scotland receives a level of funding that reflects the size of its population, their levels of deprivation and ill health, and the costs of delivering health care in remote and rural areas. Distributing resources for health care in a fair manner requires some changes in the share of resources going to different NHS boards. However, no board has experienced a funding reduction under the Arbuthnott formula. In fact all boards have received substantial growth in funding since this formula was introduced, with some additional funding targeted on those boards whose share of resources needs to increase.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The independent engineer cost relates to the pre-opening phase of the prison and was properly classified as a cost of procurement rather than post-opening cost of contract compliance.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>No. The level of non-domestic rates is effectively set by the government and cannot be influenced by the prison operator. It is therefore better to pay for it centrally rather than to pay the sum to the operator to pass on as non-domestic rates.</p>
