  <p>The radiotherapy equipment modernisation programme has been agreed through a steering group, comprising NHSScotland physicists and oncologists who deliver the services, to determine immediate and longer-term equipment requirements. The programme has maintained steady progress over the last three years in replacing old, out of date linear accelerators and related equipment in all five of Scotland's cancer centres. The table sets out the current position:</p>

  <p>Long lead times are experienced in the planning, building works (if necessary) installation and commissioning of linear accelerators and associated equipment.</p>

  <p>A further wave of central purchasing (Wave 4) is currently being planned that, subject to the required investment appraisal process by NHS boards, will see a further six machines being commissioned. Two of these would be replacements and four additional to current numbers.</p>

  <p>Waiting times for radiotherapy treatment in Glasgow have fallen from eight weeks to approximately four weeks. In other centres the position is currently fluctuating as replacement equipment installation and commissioning can mean longer waiting times over a period of months. Waiting times in other centres are currently four to six weeks.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it supports the provision of a local CCTV system in Grantown-on-Spey and, if so, how such a scheme can be funded; what budget lines are available for the funding of such schemes, and whether its policy on this matter will be reviewed in order to ensure that CCTV schemes are available to towns such as Grantown-on-Spey.</p>

  <p>On 31 October 2001 we announced details of a new community safety award programme to supersede both the CCTV and Community Safety Challenge Competitions. The new scheme gives all local authority-led Community Safety Partnerships a share of &#163;12 million over the next three years for local community safety initiatives. The funding available for 2002-03 is &#163;4 million - &#163;1 million more than the combined annual Challenge Competition awards for previous years. The same sum will also be available to Community Safety Partnerships in 2003-04 and 2004-05. For 2002-03 the Highland Wellbeing Alliance Community Safety Partnership has been allocated a total community safety award of &#163;139,501. A similar sum will be awarded to the partnership in both 2003-04 and 2004-05.</p>

  <p>The programme allows Community Safety Partnerships to secure, for the first time, sustained mainstream funding to be used solely for the purposes of taking forward local priorities identified within their community safety strategies and action plans. Funding can be utilised for both capital and revenue funding including CCTV. Decisions on local community safety priorities are therefore a matter for the local Community Safety Partnership.</p>

  <p>No separate financial allocations are made for eating disorder services within the funds allocated each year to NHSScotland. It is for each NHS board to agree the level of investment to make in consideration of assessed local needs and following the guidance which was issued in October 2001.</p>

  <p>The health department published guidance in October 2001 on the provision of eating disorder services. At that time, NHS boards were asked to assess the needs of their local population for all aspects of eating disorder services, including in-patient care. It is for NHS boards to consider what provision best suits the assessed needs of their area, in collaboration with neighbouring boards where appropriate. A number of NHS boards are currently reviewing their services in this regard.</p>

  <p>Nationally there is evidence of an increased incidence and prevalence of eating disorders. However, this may, in part, result from greater awareness of the condition.</p>

  <p>In terms of resource allocation, it is for each NHS board to consider the most appropriate response in terms of investment, following the guidance which was issued in October 2001.</p>

  <p>The manufacturing sector has experienced falling output in recent times, due to the global slowdown and re-structuring in key industries such as electronics. Scotland cannot be immune from global developments. All major industrialised economies have recently experienced a fall in industrial output.</p>

  <p>Although the Executive recognises that trading conditions remain difficult, there is some evidence that situation is improving for the manufacturing sector. Business survey evidence regarding optimism and demand does show an expected improvement in the latter part of 2002.</p>

  <p>A framework for support for manufacturing across Scotland was set out in <em>Created in Scotland</em>, in March 2000. It includes 52 initiatives which are being progressed at the Scottish and UK levels; 38 of these are being implemented by the Executive and its agencies. Good progress has already been made on almost all of these initiatives and a number of them can provide support to small businesses. One example is the Small Business Gateway which provides access to advice and information on business support available both locally and nationally.</p>

  <p>The number of rheumatologists per head of the population is less than the level recommended by the British Society for Rheumatology. The staffing establishment in NHSScotland is decided by the local NHS board, in consultation with the trusts in its area, in order to provide a modern, flexible service matched to local needs. Criteria produced by external organisations do not govern the staffing establishment, although we would expect NHS boards to consider such recommendations in their future planning.</p>

  <p>The new workforce development arrangements that we are establishing will seek to bring a more co-ordinated approach to assessing the workforce needs of NHSScotland.</p>

  <p>It is a matter for individual NHS boards and trusts to determine staffing levels on the basis of local need. Trusts must be able to adapt staffing arrangements to suit the changing pattern of local circumstances, and be judged by outcomes rather than inputs.</p>

  <p>A review of the Scottish medical workforce has been commissioned and is expected to report shortly. This report will help inform the future planning of the medical workforce across Scotland, and will be a key element of the workforce development arrangements which we are establishing to support boards and trusts in assessing and providing for their workforce needs.</p>

The Lord Advocate has directed that: (a) proceedings should not be taken in the district court for a breach of a Sex Offenders Order, or any offence aggravated by a breach of a Sex Offender Order; (b) proceedings should not be taken in the district court where the prosecutor considers a Non-Harassment Order to be appropriate, and (c) proceeding should not be taken in the district court where the offence is racially aggravated or contrary to section 50A of the Criminal Law (Consolidated) (Scotland) Act 1995. The criteria for the use of alternatives to prosecution are set out in the Prosecution Code which has been published and made available on the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service website.</p>

  <p>The reduction in business in the district court is a consequence of the reduction in the overall number of cases reported to the procurator fiscal, the availability of fiscal fines and other alternatives to prosecution and the shift in the balance of business towards more serious crime.</p>

  <p>The adjournment of a trial on the date of the trial usually involves the payment of expenses to witnesses who have been inconvenienced. The adjournment of a trial at any time means that staff time in preparing for the trial (including administrative staff time in citing witnesses, arranging for productions to be in court and paper handling) has been wasted. The extent of that wasted expense depends on how long before the trial date it is known that there is to be an adjournment.</p>

  <p>It is, by statute, one of the duties of a police officer to attend any court of law for the purpose of giving evidence. Procurators Fiscal have been instructed in the following terms: "Procurators Fiscal should take steps to ensure that no more witnesses are cited than are necessary to prove a particular case. Procurators Fiscal are therefore urged to examine carefully the question of who should be cited to attend in a particular case, with the aim of ensuring that unnecessary witnesses are not cited. Police witnesses speaking only to a non-reply to caution and charge or to forms raised by the police in terms of the detention provisions of section 14 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 are unlikely to be necessary witnesses. In summary cases Procurators Fiscal should therefore rely where appropriate on the presumption offered by section 280(A) of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 and should take steps to ensure that such witnesses are not normally cited (or, where they have been cited, countermand them once the position becomes clear). Where there is ample other evidence consideration should also be given to the need to cite both police witnesses speaking to an incriminating reply by an accused. For the avoidance of doubt two police witnesses will of course be required to speak to 'special knowledge' replies".</p>

  <p>Police officers inform the procurator fiscal, in the report which they submit, of any dates on which they will not be available. Procurators Fiscal take that information into account in accepting suggested trial diets. Lothian and Borders Police are, with the co-operation of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service and the Scottish Court Service piloting arrangements for police rostering, leave and availability to be checked immediately before trials are fixed. Early indications are that significant reductions in adjournments are being achieved as a result. Grampian Police are also, with the co-operation of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service and the Scottish Court Service, piloting a similar process but one based on direct computer access in court. Such measures are designed to ensure that, so far as possible, trial dates are fixed when police officers will be available.</p>

Any problems which exist will be resolved when opponents stop talking up the problems and start making realistic and sober assessments of the effects of these proposals.

  <p>The right to buy extends only to land which consists of salmon fishings as defined in section 65(2)(d). Where existing arrangements such as leases, timeshare or syndications are binding on the present owner, these arrangements will be binding on the new owner. Timeshare or syndication arrangements which constitute joint or common ownership would in theory be susceptible to purchase through the provisions of section 70(4). However, it may prove difficult to demonstrate that the purchase of fishings held under such arrangements would lead to sustainable development or be in the public interest. Furthermore, in many cases affordability is likely to be an issue for crofting community bodies. There is also a specific protection for tenancies in section 67(5).</p>

  <p>The objective of land reform is to remove land-based barriers to the sustainable development of rural communities.

  <p>We believe that there are advantages to be derived from being able to manage all land-based activities on a property in a holistic fashion. We consider that crofting communities should have that opportunity if they want it. The very existence of this right to buy is also a significant factor in altering the balance of power between the crofting community and landowners, including proprietors of salmon fishings.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive consults COSLA and local authorities on a wide range of issues. Proposals which affect the broad structure, role functions and financing of local authorities generally are more likely to be dealt with, initially, through COSLA whereas a proposal which directly affects some but not all councils will be more specifically targeted. We believe that it is in the interests of a strong partnership between central and local government that local government should speak with one voice and that we should consult through COSLA on matters of collective significance to local government. All local authorities can make representations to the Scottish Executive at any time.</p>

  <p>The national waiting time standards for NHSScotland are set out in <em>Our National Health</em> which was published in December 2000. It includes a commitment to reduce the national maximum waiting time for in-patient/day case treatment to nine months, from the current 12 months by 2003, as well as a number of specific waiting times standards for coronary heart disease and cancer.</p>

  <p>The National Waiting Times Unit is currently undertaking a programme of visits to all mainland NHS boards and trusts for discussions with senior management about their plans for ensuring delivery of national waiting times standards, and on the development of local standards which will tackle the longest waits for out-patient appointments and diagnostic tests.</p>

There are no current plans to amend these regulations as regards the number of consecutive night shifts worked by police officers.

  <p>Counselling is a day-to-day function in all Scottish prisons for which there is no programme accreditation. Offending behaviour programmes at HMP Kilmarnock are accredited through the same processes and to the same standards as in any other Scottish prison, viz by the Scottish Prison Service Programme Accreditation Panel, the majority of whom are external to SPS.

  <p>The decision as to the court in which to prosecute a case involving a contravention of section 1 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 (causing death by dangerous driving) is made according to the individual facts and circumstances of the particular case.

  <p><a href="http://www.crownoffice.gov.uk/" target="_blank">www.crownoffice.gov.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>The holiday on 31 May is in recognition of the Queen's Official Birthday. The holidays on 3 and 4 June are bank holidays - the former is to mark the Queen's Golden Jubilee, and the latter is the spring bank holiday which, this year has been moved from 27 May. Taken with the intervening weekend they will allow Scottish Executive staff a five-day celebration for the Queen's Golden Jubilee.</p>

  <p>Traditionally the Scottish Executive has regarded the holiday to mark the Queen's Official Birthday as a privilege holiday, and the spring bank holiday as a public holiday. In accordance with the discretion available to employers, the Scottish Executive has decided that the new holiday on 3 June should be regarded as a privilege holiday.</p>

  <p>In accordance with long standing arrangements, staff who are required to work on a public holiday will, in addition to their basic salary, receive a payment at plain time rate for their hours of attendance.

  <p>The compliance standards expected are set out in the National Objectives and Standards for Social Work Services in the Criminal Justice System, part 2, Service Standards, Community Service, paragraphs 75 to 100. These standards set out disciplinary procedures in the event of the following specific grounds for non-compliance comprise:</p>

  <p>failure to attend for work;</p>

  <p>lack of punctuality;</p>

  <p>failure to report as required by the Community Service Officer;</p>

  <p>failure to notify a change of address without delay;</p>

  <p>failure to notify a change in employment circumstances without delay, and</p>

  <p>failure to perform work to a satisfactory standard.</p>

  <p>Disciplinary procedures will normally involve giving the offender a chance to explain or rectify the failure and may lead to a formal warning. After a second failure, breach proceedings will normally follow, although a measure of flexibility has been built to allow the development of effective local practice and to reflect the individual circumstances of cases.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is responsible for lighting on motorways and trunk roads whilst the responsibility for lighting on local roads rests with the appropriate local authority.</p>

  <p>Both the Executive and local authorities work to the relevant British Standards for road lighting installation and employ technologies which take full account of advances in efficiency and design. All trunk road lighting schemes are also designed in accordance with the best practice guidance set out in <em>the Design Manual for Roads and Bridges</em>. The objective is to provide lighting which achieves night-time road safety objectives whilst minimising adverse environmental impacts and intrusion. All new and replacement trunk road lighting is of a less polluting type which offers superior control of the emitted light, giving a reduction in the amount of light spillage into the night sky.</p>

  <p>The Executive is not currently undertaking any research in respect of reducing visual pollution from street lighting</p>

  <p>The Title Conditions (Scotland) Bill will be introduced to Parliament tomorrow (6 June). The bill will mark the second stage in the Property Law Reform Programme commenced by the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000. It will reform and clarify the law relating to non-feudal conditions and burdens on land which remain following the abolition of the feudal system. The bill, which was originally drafted by the Scottish Law Commission, has been amended in the light of the consultation exercise conducted last summer, and I would like to express my thanks both to the commission and to all who offered an opinion.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive supports the national network of Volunteer Centres. Volunteer Centres are one-stop shops where information, advice and support on volunteering opportunities can be obtained by people, irrespective of their background or circumstances. We have increased our investment in the network to &#163;2 million in 2002-03. This is double the funding made available in 2001-02. The additional resources are being distributed to the volunteer centres on the basis of the same formula that applies to our support to local authorities i.e. it takes account of various factors including levels of deprivation.</p>

The Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport will give the keynote address at the Volunteering in the Arts conference on 8 June and the Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning will speak at the "Getting Connected" conference on employer supported volunteering on 13 June. A number of ministers, including Mr Henry and myself, have agreed to participate in volunteering opportunities across Scotland throughout the week.</p>

  <p>Budget proposals submitted via the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland for 2002-03 were met in full in the funding settlement. As a result, the level of funding provided to forces is now at record levels. It is an operational matter for chief constables to determine how they use the funding at their disposal to meet local needs and priorities within their areas. In April 2002, the National Criminal Intelligence Service established a national wildlife crime intelligence unit to work with forces in Scotland as well as elsewhere in the UK specifically to target those whose business is organised wildlife crime.</p>
