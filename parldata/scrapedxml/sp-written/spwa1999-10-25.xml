  <p>The precise arrangements for managing special needs work vary between careers service companies. In general careers advisors do not work specifically with special needs clients. Careers advisers who work in mainstream schools normally operate in a generic capacity. However every special school in Scotland has a nominated careers adviser.</p>

  <p>Each of the 17 career service companies in Scotland is allocated funding for the provision of careers advice to the statutory group of clients and other core clients. This includes those in full time education (except higher education), those in part time education to prepare them for a job, 16 and 17 year olds who have left education, and individuals of any age with disabilities (including learning difficulties). A service must also be offered to parents, employers and educational institutions. There is no specific financial allocation for clients with special needs, however individual companies are required to ensure that access to services is equally available to all clients and that clients with special needs have access to specialist advice.</p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise manage and deliver the national training programme for young people, Skillseekers, through their network of local enterprise companies. Young people who do not have the capability to achieve SVQ Level 2 are endorsed by the careers service as eligible for special training needs (STN) provision. The training will include work placement and, in some cases, direct employment. SE and HIE provide monitoring information on a quarterly basis to the Scottish Executive on the number of young people in STN provision.</p>

  <p>Pupils from special schools also participate in work experience. Summary information on numbers has been collected and published in recent years. The Scottish Executive is now moving to electronic methods of data collection which will give details of work experience and SEN for each individual pupil. A greater range of analysis will then be possible.</p>

  <p>Career service companies do not correspond to local authority areas. The following table therefore sets out the number of careers advisers and other staff by the 17 career service company areas; these are co-terminous with local enterprise company areas. It is not possible to give career assistant numbers separately.</p>

  <p>The information on training for dealing with young people with special needs is dated and a new staffing survey is currently being undertaken jointly with the Department for Education and Employment. The timescale for publication is not yet finalised.</p>

  <p>The Government&#8217;s response was published today. I have arranged for a copy of the response to be placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe). This recognises the role of the Scottish Executive in taking forward the development of policy on radioactive waste management. I have also written to Mr Andy Kerr, MSP, Convener of the Transport and Environment Committee enclosing a copy of the response.</p>

  <p>This is the first stage of the process to identify, develop and implement the best possible management option for radioactive wastes &#8211; one which commands widespread public support. It sets out our commitment to a comprehensive policy for long-lived radioactive wastes, developed in an open and transparent way on the basis of widespread consultation to ensure the maximum possible public acceptance. The next stage will be full consultation on the management options for radioactive waste. Subsequent steps will need to be considered in the light of the results from this consultation and if we decide to pursue the policy of disposal. There is no question at this stage of looking at the potential suitability of any particular sites. We wish to carry out an extensive consultation and consensus-building process in deciding on the way forward.</p>

  <p>The figures are based on 1999-2000 prices, adjusted in line with the latest GDP deflator figures published by ONS.</p>

  <p>We are currently discussing possible further new burdens with CoSLA as part of the statutory consultations which take place each year on the local government finance settlement. Any further new burdens recognised for next year will be included in the 2000-01 settlement. Further potential new burdens for 2001-02 will be discussed with CoSLA next year as part of the consultation for that settlement.</p>

  <p>Assistance for households in such circumstances falls within the scope of the improvement and repairs grant scheme which is administered by local authorities. Grant may be paid in respect of works to private houses more than 10 years old. It is subject to a test of resources and payable at rates up to 90% for low-income households. The cost of the test to establish the level of lead in the drinking water is eligible for grant purposes. The improvement and repairs grant system is funded by local authorities from their general fund. It is for each local authority to allocate resources to the scheme from its general fund, in the light of local circumstances.</p>

  <p>Abolition of the feudal system will mean that superiority interests will disappear and all remaining feuduties will be extinguished. Individuals and companies will no longer be able to buy up superiority interests with the specific intention of charging vassals sums of money in return for granting consent to variations of feuing conditions to allow alterations and extensions to property. Superiors will no longer have the right to enforce feudal conditions. It will also no longer be possible for superiors to "irritate" feus, a legal process whereby a superior can repossess a property from the vassal because of an alleged breach of feuing conditions or failure to pay feuduty.</p>

  <p>The reports referred to are misleading. Following an inspection programme in late 1998, the French Government reported in April this year isolated instances of waste material being illegally used in four animal feed plants.

  <p>In general, the responsibility for pest control rests with the owner or occupier of a property.</p>

  <p>Scottish Natural Heritage is involved in mink control because of the threat the animals pose to natural heritage interests, particularly to ground nesting birds. It is not responsible for measures to prevent depredation of crofters&#8217; livestock, nor am I aware that this is a significant problem.</p>

  <p>To meet natural heritage objectives, Scottish Natural Heritage is currently, with a number of other organisations, participating in the control of mink through funding and oversight of trapping on South Harris and North Uist. It has also commissioned a field survey to establish the number and distribution of mink on the Uists. The results of this survey are expected in January, and at that stage the situation will be reviewed. In the meantime the measures Scottish Natural Heritage is taking are considered adequate.</p>

  <p>Under schedule 5 of the Scotland Act 1998, the provision and regulation of railway services, which includes rail safety, are reserved matters. They are the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions within the UK government.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is in regular contact with the Department of the Environment, Transport and Regions, the Health and Safety Executive and their Railways Inspectorate, the Rail Regulator and the British Transport Police on matters relating to rail safety in Scotland.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, following the transfer of executive functions for railways, which body will ultimately be responsible for enforcing safety standards on Scotland&#8217;s railways and the penalties Railtrack and franchise operators face if they fail to meet safety standards.</p>

  <p>The transfer of executive functions for railways did not include responsibility for rail safety, which is a reserved matter and is the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Transport and Regions within the UK government. The Health and Safety Executive are responsible for enforcing safety standards on railways throughout Great Britain, including those in Scotland. The Scottish Executive is in regular contact with these and other responsible bodies on matters relating to rail safety in Scotland. <br /></p>
