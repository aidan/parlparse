  <p>The Pathfinders to Parliament initiative was launched at the start of 1999 to give businesses in Scotland the opportunity to develop business agenda ideas for early consideration by the Scottish Parliament. As part of that initiative, the Construction Pathfinders Group was asked to review the problems and opportunities facing this sector. The Group&#8217;s recommendations have informed the Executive&#8217;s thinking and strategy over the last year.</p>

  <p>Comprehensive and regular market information is the key component in ensuring that sectors have the qualified people they need both today and in the future. The Scottish Executive is currently working with Scottish Enterprise to set up a Scottish Labour Market Unit (SLMU) from May 2000. Workshops are taking place with a wide range of interests to assess organisations&#8217; present and future data requirements.</p>

  <p>The precise arrangements for INTERREG III Programmes have yet to be finalised with the European Commission.

  <p>As regards additionality and match funding for local authorities, the UK will continue to meet the requirements of European Regulations.</p>

  <p>The heavier users of bank and agency nurses are adopting practices which ensure authorisation for requests for such nurses is considered and made at senior nurse level. They are also seeking to recruit to unfilled posts on a permanent basis, rather than use bank or agency nurses. In addition trusts are putting in train improved arrangements for monitoring employment of bank and agency nurses and for their continued training and development.</p>

  <p>All Trusts should currently be reviewing their practices concerning the employment of bank and agency nurses and be taking steps to ensure their policies and practices are in accord with the Accounts Commission Report. The Scottish Partnership Forum (SPF) has already received a presentation from North Glasgow University Hospitals NHS Trust on their comprehensive review of agency and bank nurses. They are due to hear further presentations from Lothian University Hospitals Trust and Renfrewshire and Inverclyde Primary Care Trust, who are main users of bank and agency nurses, at their next meeting on 14 April. Following the presentations the SPF are expected to decide what further action may be required.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-4245 by Susan Deacon on 22 February 2000, what specific measures are used by health boards to ensure that nursing agency staff are qualified in the speciality to which they are assigned.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-03-17.13.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80146" speakername="Susan Deacon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa0317.htm#4963">

  <p>Nursing agencies are currently licensed to operate by the Nursing Home Registration and Inspection Unit of health boards.</p>

  <p>While detailed operational procedures differ for each health board, all boards require nursing agencies to ensure that nurses they supply are registered by the United Kingdom Central Council for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting (UKCC), and have not got a criminal record (nurses are exempt from the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act). In addition the agency must take up references for its nurses and must have a quality assurance system in place including staff performance appraisals and client assessments.</p>

  <p>If a registered nurse has a specialist qualification it is recorded by the UKCC. This information is readily accessible to employers.</p>

  <p>Nurses may become competent practitioners in specialist areas by means other than undertaking a specialist qualification but an individual nurse would be considered guilty of professional misconduct were they to claim competence in a specific area when they were not.</p>

  <p>Specifically, the Group will seek to support, influence and advance the further development of mental health services in Scotland and offer advice locally, and to the Scottish Executive, on solutions and best practice in the full implementation of the <i>Framework for Mental Health Services in Scotland</i> agenda for change and improvement in mental health services.</p>

  <p>Dealings with the United Nations remain a reserved matter for the UK Government. Niche markets such as walking and climbing which take advantage of Scotland&#8217;s spectacular environment and particularly its mountains are a vital element of the country&#8217;s tourism product. In line with <i>A New Strategy for Scottish Tourism</i> the Scottish Tourist Board will seek to promote these activities while emphasising the conservation of the environment on which they depend.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has been pursuing for some time the sustainable development of mountain areas as encompassed in Chapter 21 of Agenda 21. Initiatives such as the formation of the Glenmore Working Group, the commitment to the Rothiemurchus Concordat, projects carried out by the members of the Cairngorm Partnership and our recent commitment to establishing national parks are contributing to fulfilling the UK Government&#8217;s undertaking.</p>
