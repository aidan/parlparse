  <p>The current breast cancer service in Renfrewshire is working well. Two one stop multi-disciplinary breast clinics are established at Royal Alexandra Hospital. In addition an innovative appointment system developed in partnership with primary care has helped ensure that clinic waiting times are on average less than five days. There are no reported issues surrounding waiting times for surgery after a diagnosis of breast cancer.</p>

  <p>Any further areas for potential development, including for example benign breast disease surgery, will be taken forward within the context of the local cancer plan.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, the Acting Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>We do offer assistance for the installation of solid fuel central heating systems. Central heating is provided free of charge to all those over 60 in the private sector who currently have no central heating, or have a system which is broken beyond repair. Local authorities and registered social landlords are also being funded to install central heating in all their properties where that facility is not currently available. Most installations, however, use gas or electricity and the average cost across all types of central heating installations is in the region of &#163;2,500.</p>

  <p>There is strong evidence to suggest that thiomersal in vaccines does not cause any harm (except for skin rashes or local swelling at the site of injection). Despite this, and as part of a global goal to reduce exposure to mercury from avoidable sources in general, the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA) has recommended that vaccine manufacturers phase out use of thiomersal wherever possible as a purely precautionary measure <em>. </em> The Committee on Safety of Medicines endorses this recommendation. As the body responsible for the safety of all medicines available on the UK market, the medicines and health care products regulatory agency is working with vaccine manufacturers to implement the EMEA recommendations.</p>

  <p>The NHS Quality Improvement Scotland report on breast screening, which was released on 24 November, noted that there were delays at some centres in women receiving their screening result.

  <p>The information is not available centrally in the form requested. Information from samples of GP records in practices across Scotland whose population is nationally representative suggests that approximately 5,900 patients with multiple sclerosis were seen by GPs in the year ended March 2003. However, the Executive recognises that this may be an underestimate. People with the relapsing/remitting form of MS may not need to visit their GPs in the course of any given year. The MS Society Scotland estimates that there are over 10,000 people with MS in Scotland.</p>

  <p>No specific funding is made available for the provision of specialist MS nurses. However, the Executive has committed some &#163;10 million to a number of nursing recruitment and retention initiatives over the financial years 2002-03 and 2003-04, and some &#163;1.75 million additional funding has been allocated for the continuous professional development of nurses.

  <p>Provisional information for the year ended 30 September 2003 shows that the median waiting time for knee joint replacement surgery (undertaken in NHS and contracted private sector hospitals) in Argyll and Clyde NHS board area of residence, was 243 days. Due to data recording difficulties currently being experienced in NHS Argyll and Clyde, it is not possible to provide separate waiting times information for patients treated in NHS and contracted private sector hospitals.</p>

  <p>There are particular UK-wide pressures in the specialty of orthopaedics due to difficulties in matching demand and capacity. Since September 2002, we have made over &#163;9 million available to NHSScotland to speed up treatment for patients awaiting hip or knee joint replacement surgery. This will also help ensure delivery of the nine months national maximum waiting time for in-patient and day case treatment, including knee replacement surgery, from the end of this year.</p>

  <p>Information and Statistics Division issues over 30 quarterly or annual national statistics releases and a large number of other publications containing health statistics each year, providing information on a wide range of topics about the NHS and the health of people in Scotland. Most of these releases are published electronically on ISD&#8217;s website at www.isdscotland.org.</p>

  <p>In accordance with good statistical practice ISD seeks to highlight in each release any changes in the underlying data, organisational changes affecting how the statistics are presented, or changes in the selection of statistics published. Key factors which have changed the statistics published by ISD since 1999 and in doing so affected comparability with previous years include:</p>

  <p>Legislative changes in ophthalmic services in 1999.</p>

  <p>Changing service provision in hospitals whereby some surgical operations/procedures are now carried out in out-patients, where previously they would have involved day case treatment.</p>

  <p>Changes in the way waiting lists/times are classified and improved coverage in response to the Audit Scotland report on waiting (2002) and my decision to abolish the Deferred Waiting List from April 2003.</p>

  <p>Improvements made to the national statistical return that collects information on people attending services for drug problems.</p>

  <p>There will have been other minor improvements to definitions since 1999 that might make some figures not strictly comparable. However, searching through the thousands of pages of material to quantify this would incur disproportionate cost.</p>

  <p>Detailed guidelines for the operation of the vacant and derelict land fund are currently being developed through a local stakeholders group involving representatives from the local partnerships (i.e. the local council, Communities Scotland and the local enterprise company) for the three areas covered by the fund. Each of the local partnerships will be invited to submit proposals under those guidelines and allocations will be made on the basis of the appraisal of the proposals.</p>

  <p>We have introduced a number of measures to complement the action plan instigated last year. These include a fast-track scheme for 120 graduates to train as social workers within 15-18 months, an incentive scheme for eligible social work graduates to work in priority areas, grants to relevant employers towards the cost of student practice placements, a new Framework for Social Work Education, including a new four-year honours degree, a leadership training initiative for 200 first line and middle managers, specific grant to local authorities for training in the current year and an additional &#163;9 million over the next three years for the same purpose. We have also provided &#163;1.22 million to create the Institute for Excellence in Social Work Education, developing new approaches to learning and ensuring that training in the new degree equips new workers to be confident in their knowledge and skills and to work effectively with other professionals.</p>

  <p>As well as our on-going recruitment and awareness campaign, we are campaigning specifically to encourage school-leavers to take advantage of the new degree. In addition, I am chairing a national workforce group to develop a workforce action plan that will be supported by three working groups. One will be responsible for producing a national education, training and development strategy, the second for improving workforce information and intelligence and the third will support recruitment and retention, human resource management and organisational development across the sector. These groups will have substantial impact on helping this valuable workforce achieve the improvements we all seek.</p>
