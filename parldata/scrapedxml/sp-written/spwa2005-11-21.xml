  <p>In 2001, the Scottish Executive published <em>NHS Audiology Services in Scotland</em> which provides a brief summary of the various professions and specialisms in the NHS who are involved in the care of people with hearing impairment, tinnitus or balance disorders. This includes audiologists and otologists (audiological medicine), hearing therapists, audiological scientists, educational audiologists, speech and language therapists, otologists, audiological physicians, paediatricians, clinical psychologists, vestibular scientists, counsellors, assistant technical officers, clerical and reception staff and registered hearing aid dispensers.</p>

  <p>Provision of services is a matter for individual local authorities. We are making provision for expenditure by local authorities on community care totalling &pound;1.6 billion in 2005-06. It is their responsibility to decide how these very substantial resources should be deployed to best meet local needs and priorities.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Care Commission inspects day care services at least once a year, and the Regulation of Care (Requirements as to Care Services) (Scotland) Regulations 2002 require a care service provider to ensure that at all times suitably qualified and competent persons are working in the care service in such numbers as are appropriate for the health and welfare of service users.</p>

  <p><em>Better Outcomes for Older People</em> (Bib. number 37677) urges local partnerships to review and develop more joint services including day opportunities to meet the increasing needs of older people.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive Health Department is aware of voice recognition technology in the clinical setting, but has no current plans to instigate work in this area. There are isolated incidences in Scotland of its use in practice where staff in local board areas are able to obtain funding for such work.

  <p>Many individuals, including people with communication impairments, can require additional support in their dealings with health professionals. This was one of the reasons for establishing a strategic partnership between the Scottish Executive, the NHS and the Disability Rights Commission. This <em>Fair for All - Disability </em> project aims to support the development of local NHS services that are responsive to the needs of all service users, including those with communications impairment.</p>

  <p>The <em>Fair for All &ndash; Disability</em> Project is currently consulting on draft guidance which contains advice on promoting effective communication and support for service users who, for example, are deaf, hard of hearing, blind, or have a learning disability or mental health problem.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive was happy to accept the findings of the SCRE Evaluation of study support and out of school hours learning in Scotland. This showed that almost all secondary schools and over three-quarters of primary schools currently provide a range of study support/out of school hours learning activities.</p>

  <p>The SCRE evaluation recommended that the Executive support the development of SS/OSHL by offering more strategic direction, raising awareness of the impact OSHL can have on young people and school communities, promoting partnership working and continuing to support the dissemination of good practice.</p>

  <p>In response to this, officials have been working with the Scottish Study Support Network to develop new guidance for OSHL in Scotland. The document will outline the contribution OSHL can make towards the broader education agenda as well as offering good practice and self-evaluation guidance. An event is planned to launch the guidance document in spring 2006.</p>

  <p>Scottish education authorities work with their schools to ensure their development plans reflect appropriate objectives for behaviour and attendance. Education authorities have local quality assurance and quality improvement officers to assist head teachers to review their practice on promoting positive behaviour in schools and to consider strategies to improve behaviour and attendance. In most areas, schools are also assisted by advisors within education authorities, including educational psychologists and specialists in behaviour support services.</p>

  <p>Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education plays an advisory role for education authorities in ensuring improvement. The Scottish Executive supports sharing of good practice to enable education authorities and schools to consider the development of their local approaches to promoting positive behaviour and attendance, through the website <a href="http://www.betterbehaviourscotland.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.betterbehaviourscotland.gov.uk</a>, through reports such as the <em>Connect Report</em> (Scottish Executive Education Department 2004) and through local seminars and conferences.</p>

  <p>The 2001 report of the Discipline Task Group, <em>Better Behaviour - Better Learning, </em> provides a strong policy framework for school discipline, which ensures that education authorities and schools agree a local policy framework within which pupils, parents and staff are clear on their responsibilities and the rules of the school. Many education practitioners have shared the view that an on-going process of consultation and development between these parties is essential to a relevant and meaningful system of rules and rewards in schools, to which there is shared commitment.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive maintains a dialogue with key stakeholders on issues concerning school discipline. Stakeholders have agreed our current approach, to provide schools and authorities with a range of options to promote positive behaviour, and trust in their professionalism and judgment in tailoring these to suit their local circumstances.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive expects parents and schools to work in partnership to develop caring school communities with shared values and expectations, as described in recommendations 15 and 18 of <em>Better Behaviour &ndash; Better Learning</em> (2001). The Executive has also recommended that school policies on issues such as school uniform, attendance and behaviour should be developed in consultation with parents, in line with Executive and authority guidelines. The report of the <em>National Review of Guidance</em> has highlighted the role of schools and parents as partners, working in children and young people&rsquo;s best interests.</p>

  <p>The Executive supports authorities to share and develop good practice in effective working with parents. Some authorities are introducing new approaches to signed agreements by parents regarding their child&rsquo;s involvement in school in response to a statement of commitment by the school. Where such practice proves successful the Scottish Executive will assist in dissemination of the information to other education authorities and schools.</p>

  <p>In Scotland, relationships between schools and parents are being enhanced through increased home-school link working, following recommendation 17 of <em>Better Behaviour &ndash; Better Learning (2001)</em> . The Scottish Executive has allocated &pound;34.9 million to authorities for additional support staff in schools, including home-school link workers, to boost the development of this role within education authorities and schools.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive works with education authorities and schools to tackle bullying and promote positive behaviour. We have published design guidance for authorities which highlights the importance of their considering, at an early stage in any design process, the need to engage in thorough consultations and to ensure that design proposals will indeed contribute to the provision of a safe and secure environment in all areas of the school.</p>

  <p>It has been well established in Scottish education legislation that education authorities and schools have a duty to ensure good discipline in schools, by making rules and applying sanctions if pupils or parents fail to comply with those rules, as follows:</p>

  <p>In the day-to-day conduct of every school under their management, an education authority shall ensure that care is taken to develop in pupils &quot;reasonable and responsible social attitudes and relationships; consideration for others; good manners &hellip;&quot;</p>

  <p><em>Regulation 11 of the Schools General (Scotland) Regulations 1975</em></p>

  <p>An education authority has the power to exclude a pupil from school if the parent of the pupil refuses or fails to comply, or to allow the pupil to comply, with the rules, regulations or disciplinary requirements of the school, or consider that to allow the pupil to continue attendance at the school would be likely to be seriously detrimental to order and discipline in the school:</p>

  <p><em>Regulation 4 of the Schools General (Scotland) Regulations 1975 (as amended by the Schools General (Scotland)(Amendment) Regulations 1982 </em>and the<em> Schools General (Scotland) Amendment (2) Regulations 1982.</em></p>

  <p>Education authorities have a duty to supply basic information to any parent, including school policy on discipline, school rules and enforcement of attendance:</p>

  <p><em>Education (School and Placing Information)(Scotland) Regulations 1982; Schedule 2</em></p>

  <p>The right to discipline pupils by corporal punishment was repealed in the Standards in Scotland&rsquo;s Schools etc. Act 2000; but exclusion and other forms of sanctions are used daily within Scotland&rsquo;s schools.</p>

  <p>Scottish Executive policy on discipline in schools makes it clear that schools and education authorities should develop a clear system of rules, sanctions and rewards in consultation with pupils and parents (<em>Better Behaviour &ndash; Better Learning, 2001</em>).</p>

  <p>Education authorities are recommended to have in place guidelines on levels of intervention, for example in relation to restraint (recommendation 11 of <em>Better Behaviour &ndash; Better Learning</em>). The handbook on child protection in education, <em>Safe and Well (2005)</em>, reiterated the importance of ensuring good practice and of training for staff in safe techniques in settings where restraint may be necessary. Many education authorities use training programmes such as CALM or Therapeutic Crisis Intervention for their staff.</p>

  <p><em>Safe and Well</em> also provides advice on how schools should respond if a child is found to be in possession of a weapon in school.</p>

  <p>The balance on the General Reserve of the Scottish Consolidated Fund does not necessarily represent an amount available for appropriation by a Budget Act or other means as there may be sums due to the Scottish Executive or other funded bodies and/or sums due to the Department of Constitutional Affairs for onward transmission to the UK Consolidated Fund.</p>

  <p>During 2003-04 the Executive took action to reduce the significant balance that was in the account at the end of financial year 2002-03. Action taken has resulted in &pound;818 million of the balance on the account at the 31 March 2003 being utilised by the bodies directly funded by the Fund, through a reduction in the sum drawn down from the Department of Constitutional Affairs.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will issue a policy statement on the spread of avian influenza and the measures it is taking to control the infection, including information on which categories of birds are included in, or excluded from, any restrictions designed to prevent the spread of avian influenza.</p>

  <p>I made a statement to the Scottish Parliament on 2 November 2005 which outlined the current global disease situation and the potential risks to Scotland. Whilst the risk of immediate introduction of avian influenza from migrating wildfowl is judged to be low, we continue to work with industry and other stakeholders to minimise the risk of disease spread.</p>

  <p>As a consequence of an EU-wide ban on bird gatherings such events have been cancelled unless licensed on the basis of a veterinary risk assessment. We have started to license low-risk events and are considering how others can go ahead under appropriate biosecurity guidance. The full veterinary risk assessment process for such events is currently being developed to allow as many events as possible to go ahead subject to a proportionate level of risk.</p>

  <p>The ban on gatherings is being kept under review by the European Commission&rsquo;s Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health.</p>

  <p>The information specifically requested is not available. The number of NHS locations recorded as providing an accident and emergency service for each financial year is shown in the table. The list includes services which are provided other than on a 24-hour, seven-day basis, and services provided by a range of clinical staff including GPs and nurses. It also includes other units such as those dealing with minor injuries and community casualties. This wide range of provision enables effective services to be offered which are tailored to delivering good patient outcomes.</p>

  <p>The reduction in sites providing accident and emergency services reflects the work by boards&rsquo; to provide high quality services from well-equipped premises, meeting our goals for safe, sustainable services provided as locally as possible.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many NHS appointments have been missed in each year since 1997 and at what cost to the NHS.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-11-21.S2W-20403.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80057" speakername="Mr Andy Kerr" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa1121.htm#14">

  <p>Information is available centrally in respect of patients failing to attend first appointments at consultant-led out-patient clinics. Information on patients who miss appointments for other NHS services such as at local family doctor practices is not collected centrally.</p>

  <p>The table gives the number of missed first out-patient appointments in each year since 1997-98. The average cost of a first out-patient appointment in 2003-04 was approximately &pound;80 but the costs of missed appointments are dependent on too many variables to be able to make meaningful estimates.</p>

  <p>The cost to the NHS of missed appointments will vary depending on the circumstances of the appointment. For example, hospitals may anticipate, in scheduling out-patient clinics, that a proportion of patients will miss their appointments. On that basis, the hospital may decide to overbook appointments at clinics. If all patients attend, the clinic may overrun, with inconvenience to patients seen at the end of the clinic and to staff.</p>

  <p>Overall, NHS patients who fail to keep appointments increase costs for the NHS and deprive others of the opportunity for good service by wasting the time of clinicians and supporting staff.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the statement in <em>Building a Health Service Fit for the Future: A guide for the NHS</em> that the greatest need of many older people in the community is &quot;to be kept an eye on&quot;, what this means and how it will be achieved.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-11-21.S2W-20443.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80064" speakername="Lewis Macdonald" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa1121.htm#14">

  <p>The statement is in the context of developments in information and communication technology (telecare) that allow alarm systems and other devices to be monitored remotely.</p>

  <p>Being kept an eye on means that older people want to be reassured that if they fall, the alarm will be raised quickly; that if they do not get up in the morning, someone knows; or that if someone with dementia wanders in the night, they are reminded to go back to bed.</p>

  <p>Use of telecare is evolving rapidly and allows, for example, non-intrusive monitoring of whether an individual has got up in the morning, or has fallen, or has had a flood in the kitchen or bathroom. It can be used to remind people to take medicine, and allows remote blood monitoring for diabetes sufferers. These developments are happening now, and are driven by user&rsquo;s needs, technology as new devices are developed, and provision of monitoring/call centres that respond to alarms or information transmitted.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to ensuring that people remain at home and retain as much independence as possible. The provision of flexible person-centred care packages that include equipment and adaptations delivered through a modern community care structure is the best way to achieve this.</p>

  <p>Legislation and guidance on the provision of equipment and adaptations is summarised in <em>Using the Law to Develop and Improve Equipment and Adaptation Provision</em> published by the Scottish Executive in 2003.</p>

  <p>It is a matter for individual local partnerships to decide how resources should best be deployed to meet local needs and priorities, consistent with their statutory functions and with government policy.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not available centrally. Information on NHS waiting times and lists is collected centrally only for first out-patient appointments at consultant-led clinics, following referral by a general medical or dental practitioner, at specialty level only, and for in-patient and day case treatment. Audiology services are in the specialty of ear, nose and throat (ENT), and hearing tests will normally be conducted in an out-patient setting by an audiologist.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to modernising and improving audiology services across NHSScotland. We are investing almost &pound;20 million over the five year period 2002-03 to 2006-07 to ensure NHS boards are equipped with the necessary facilities, equipment, staff and hearing aids to provide a modernised service.</p>

  <p>Care of Older People as the central responsibility of NHS Scotland was first set out in the <em>Adding Life to Years Report 2002</em> . There have been significant developments since its publication. However, <em>Delivering for Health</em> (Bib. number 37847), the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s response to the Kerr Report <em>Building a Health Service Fit for The Future</em> (Bib. number 36608), makes it clear that we now expect NHS boards and regional planning groups to use the Kerr Report to drive their service improvement. The document contains timelines which set out the actions we now expect from constituent parts of the NHS by particular dates.</p>

  <p>The Health Department&rsquo;s new delivery group will monitor the full sets of commitments made in <em>Delivering for Health</em> and will publish progress.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how much it has allocated towards the funding of local authority PPP projects in total and broken down by project; how many local authority PPP projects have subsequently been referred for Executive consideration, broken down by project; how many local authority PPP projects have been agreed by the Executive, broken down by project, and whether the Executive's involvement in determining what method of development to support, providing funding towards local authority PPP projects and agreeing which projects can proceed could give rise to any conflict of interest.</p>

  <p>The funding allocated by the Scottish Executive towards local authority PPP projects is shown in the following table. The figures represent the amount of financial support provided (or to be provided) by the Executive for these projects annually, and does not include any additional funding provided by the local authorities themselves.</p>

  <p>The funding represents a capped annual figure and this has been (or will be) awarded for the length of the PPP contract which in most cases is 25 to 30 years. Executive funding has been confirmed in those projects marked &quot;operational&quot; or &quot;at financial close&quot; in the last column.</p>

  <p>Further details on these projects and other PPP projects in Scotland can be found on the Financial Partnerships Unit&rsquo;s website <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/ppp" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/ppp</a>.</p>

  <p>There have been two funding rounds for Executive support for local authority PPP projects. The first invited bids from local authorities for priority projects under Finance Circulars 2/1998 and 5/1998; the second for schools projects under Scottish Executive Education Department Circular 8/2001. The successful local authority projects from these rounds are shown in the above table. In both of the funding rounds the bids received were assessed against criteria already agreed by an evaluation panel. There are currently no other funding rounds for Executive support for local authority PPP projects.</p>

  <p>Deferred Payment Agreements (DPAs) were introduced in July 2002 under the Community Care and Health (Scotland) Act 2002. The Scottish Executive surveyed local authorities in 2003 and 2004 on the numbers of DPAs in place. I refer the member to the answers to questions S2W-6217 on 9 March 2004, and S2W-12177 on 25 November 2004.</p>

  <p>The Executive is fully committed to playing its part in delivering the targets set out in Sport 21. We cannot do that alone and all partners involved including local authorities, who are by far the biggest provider of sporting opportunities in Scotland, must play their part. Sport 21 was developed with the full support of the Scottish Executive, local authorities, sports governing bodies and other partners who all accepted their responsibilities in securing its objectives. The partners commitment and specific roles and responsibilities are set out in the Sport 21 target strategies which can be found on <strong></strong> sportscotland&rsquo;s website at <a href="http://www.sportscotland.org.uk" target="_blank">www.sportscotland.org.uk</a> . The Scottish Executive has demonstrated its contribution towards the delivery of Sport 21 targets by working with local authorities on the development of Active Schools. With &pound;24 million invested to date, this programme is delivering a wide range of opportunities aimed at stimulating an interest and commitment to sport and increased levels of physical activity in and around the school day. Active Schools provides local authorities with an excellent foundation at grass roots level on which to build. With the review of Sport 21 due, it is now appropriate to consider how each partner can further secure their contribution towards the delivery of Sport 21&rsquo;s aims.</p>
