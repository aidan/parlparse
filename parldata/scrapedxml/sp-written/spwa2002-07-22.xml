  <p>We have made good progress. Around 650 posts have been located or are currently planned to be located outwith Edinburgh as a direct result of this policy. Including the new reviews announced in November last year, around 3,000 further posts will be covered by formal relocation reviews.</p>

  <p>The Education and Lifelong Learning Department is now wholly located in Glasgow; the Foods Standards Agency Scotland has been set up in Aberdeen and the Public Guardian's Office has been set up in Falkirk. The offices of the Scottish Social Services Council and the National Office of the Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care have been set up in Dundee. The commission's regional office for the area will also be located in the Dundee HQ, with a further five regional offices located in Aberdeen, Musselburgh, Paisley, Hamilton and Inverness. The Scottish Public Pensions Agency will be located in Galashiels, and Scottish Water will set up its HQ in Dunfermline.</p>

  <p>Decisions are expected on the location of the Health Education Board for Scotland, <strong></strong>sportscotland, the Common Services Agency of the National Health Service in Scotland, and Scottish Natural Heritage in the course of this year. Decisions are expected on the location of the Scottish Arts Council by the end of 2002, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education by mid 2003 and on Registers of Scotland in 2004.</p>

  <p>I was pleased to meet last month with representatives of Scotland's music industry. Representation at that exploratory meeting covered a wide cross-section of interests. The meeting heard strong support for the convening of a forum, which I shall chair, whereby key representatives from across the sector can explore issues affecting the industry and its response to the National Cultural Strategy within the framework of the Scottish Arts Council's Music Strategy, and contribute to future policy development.</p>

  <p>One of the first tasks will be to determine the core membership of the forum. Those invited to the exploratory meeting, including representative bodies, are being asked to comment on this; I shall write to the member again when it is established. The forum will meet at about six-monthly intervals and will have an advisory role in the implementation of the National Cultural Strategy. No final minutes will be published, but notes of meetings will be available to members; the policy regarding its minutes will be a matter for the members.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive set out its broadband strategy last year in the document, <em>Connecting Scotland: Our Broadband Future</em> . Our vision behind the strategy was to make broadband connections more affordable and pervasive across the country. We are pursuing this in three ways:</p>

  <p>Firstly, the Executive has developed the Pathfinder Initiatives to aggregate public sector demand for broadband in the Highlands and Islands and South of Scotland. It is hoped that this major investment on the part of the public sector will help to stimulate both demand for and supply of broadband within these areas which might not be immediately covered by the commercial market. Secondly, the strategy undertook to identify where there was a need for direct support measures; our programme under the UK Broadband Fund is developing this element through awareness raising measures and technology trials. Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise will be managing the projects under the Broadband Fund over 2002-03 and 2003-04. The last element of the strategy is on-going regulatory liaison at UK level and we continue to work closely on this with our counterparts at UK level.</p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise is spending &#163;6 million on the first phase of its ATLAS project. The project will set up a Telecoms Trading Exchange and aims to substantially cut high bandwidth telecoms costs for Scottish businesses and encourage the use of broadband services. The first phase of ATLAS is planned to be operational by the end of this year.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Highlands and Islands Partnership Programme (HIPP) also has funding to stimulate demand and to enhance infrastructure in remoter areas.</p>

  <p>The benefits to businesses of broadband connectivity are well established. Broadband gives fast access to global markets, enhances the efficiency of existing structures and supply chains while providing a means of enhancing customer service through effective online trading. In short, broadband has the capacity to enhance the competitiveness of businesses.</p>

  <p>The UK Government and other organisations have conducted studies which support these benefits. For example, the Federation of Small Businesses 2001 survey, "Small Businesses in an Electronic Age II" indicated that more than three-quarters of businesses surveyed and using broadband had enjoyed improved productivity as a result of broadband connectivity. The survey also showed that more than half of businesses with broadband had experienced reductions in their business cost base.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>In HM Chief Inspector of Prisons' last formal report he included 12 items of best practice at HM Prison Kilmarnock. The company operates a 50 category performance monitoring system superior to that elsewhere in SPS. They provide higher quality management information on the main outputs than we have for any of our other prisons.</p>

  <p>SPS Operating Standards are a key driver for improving performance. Nowhere in comparable establishments are prisoners out of their cells for as long as they are at Kilmarnock during which they are challenged on their offending behaviour and the need to work. In this respect Kilmarnock is in the forefront of correctional excellence which we intend to roll out through the service over the next few years. The flexibility and speed of response to changing requirements is generally faster than elsewhere in SPS.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The Civil Service Business Appointment Rules provide for this, therefore no specific clause within such staff's contracts is deemed necessary. The period for which an individual must seek approval before taking any form of full, part-time or fee-paid employment with such an organisation is two years.</p>

  <p>The overall level of assistance with living costs available to Scottish domiciled students is the same whether they study in Scotland or elsewhere in the UK.</p>

  <p>Under the student support arrangements introduced in 2001-02, young Scottish domiciled students from low income backgrounds studying in Scotland can receive up to &#163;2,050 of their student loan entitlement in the form of a bursary and additional loan support of up to &#163;510. Students eligible to receive support under the new arrangements may also be liable to pay the new Graduate Endowment when they complete their studies. Income from the endowment is intended to help provide similar support for future generations of students.</p>

  <p>Because students who are not studying at a Scottish institution would not be liable to pay the Graduate Endowment, it was decided that they should not be entitled to the other elements of the new support package, including the Young Students' Bursary. It was, however, subsequently decided that such students should be entitled to the same level of spending power as their counterparts in Scotland. They will, therefore, from 2002-03 onwards, be entitled to bursaries of up to &#163;510 in addition to their student loan entitlement.</p>
