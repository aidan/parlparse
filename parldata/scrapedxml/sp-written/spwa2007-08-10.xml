  <p>It is for the UK Government to comment upon the conclusions and recommendations of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee of the UK Parliament. Nonetheless, I am aware of them.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive conducted its own public consultation on transposition of the Environmental Liability Directive, including options for going beyond the basic provisions. It received some 250 responses and is currently taking account of them in reviewing its initial policy and preparing for a second public consultation, on draft transposing regulations, in the autumn. A summary/report of the responses will be published on the Executive&rsquo;s website in due course.</p>

  <p>Certain areas of blanket bog in Scotland are designated under the EC Habitats Directive as a qualifying feature on a number of Special Areas of Conservation (or secondarily as the habitat of qualifying species in Special Areas of Conservation or Special Protection Areas). Collectively, these designated sites form a network across the EU known as &quot;Natura 2000&quot;.</p>

  <p>Article 6 of the Habitats Directive sets out the process of consideration which all competent authorities must follow when considering the interests of a Natura 2000 site before undertaking or consenting to development. The Conservation (Natural Habitats, &amp;c.) Regulations 1994 (as amended) transpose this requirement into domestic law. Development affecting a Natura 2000 site may be undertaken or authorised if it will not adversely affect the integrity of the site. Development which does adversely affect the integrity of a site may only proceed if, there is no alternative; there is an over-riding public interest in the development proceeding; and appropriate compensatory measures are deployed which will maintain the overall integrity and coherence of the Natura 2000 network.</p>

  <p>Further information is available in the Scottish Executive June 2000 guidance which updates Scottish Office Circular No. 6/1995. This is available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre.</p>

  <p>The National Parks (Scotland) Act 2000 provides powers for Scottish Ministers to designate national parks where they are satisfied: that an area is of outstanding national importance because of its natural, or natural and cultural heritage; that the area has a distinctive and coherent identity; and that designation of a national park would represent the best means of meeting the special needs of the area. The act identifies the aims of National Parks as:</p>

  <p>(a) to conserve and enhance the natural and cultural heritage of the area;</p>

  <p>(b) to promote sustainable use of the natural resources of the area;</p>

  <p>(c) to promote understanding and enjoyment (including enjoyment in the form of recreation) of the special qualities of the area by the public; and</p>

  <p>(d) to promote sustainable economic and social development of the area&rsquo;s communities.</p>

  <p>Regional Parks may be designated by local authorities under powers provided in the Wildlife and Countryside (Scotland) Act 1981. The act defines a regional park as &quot;an extensive area of land, part of which is devoted to the recreational needs of the public&quot;. Regional Park designations are subject to confirmation by Ministers.</p>

  <p>The EC Habitats Directive defines certain species and habitats as having &quot;priority&quot; if they are particularly threatened in global terms and if the European Community contains a significant proportion of their natural range. Whilst all habitats and species listed in Annexes 1 and 2 of the Directive must receive protection through the designation of Special Areas of Conservation (SACs), stricter criteria apply to those with priority status.</p>

  <p>Whilst the boundaries of designated SACs are marked on national park and local authority plans at all stages, information about the precise extent of particular habitat types does not currently exist in a form which would allow comprehensive mapping of the extent of individual habitat types. However, information about the presence of priority habitat interests on SACs is available on the Joint Nature Conservation Committee&rsquo;s website: <a href="http://www.jncc.gov.uk" target="_blank">http://www.jncc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>I expect to initiate a review covering both National Parks in 2008 with the objective of examining the operation of the Park Authorities as well as questions about the park boundaries. I will make a statement about the scope of the review, its procedures and the consultation processes before the review commences.</p>

  <p>Any formal review of the National Park boundaries would need to be undertaken in line with the requirements of the National Parks (Scotland) Act 2000 and with the consultation procedures which it specifies.</p>

</table></p>

  <p>Funding allocations for smoking cessation services are agreed by the Scottish Ministerial Working Group on Tobacco Control and include an additional adjustment to take account of social deprivation, which is closely linked to smoking rates, in each health board Area.</p>

  <p>An uplift of &pound;2 million was allocated to health boards in 2007-08 in order to expand cessation services. In addition to the pro-rata increase this year, Greater Glasgow and Clyde Health Board would have received a further uplift in funding to take account of its share of funding for Clyde area residents, and Highland Health Board has received funding in respect of Argyll residents.</p>

  <p>Keep Well aims to increase the rate of health improvement in deprived communities and includes a specific funding stream for smoking cessation activity.</p>
