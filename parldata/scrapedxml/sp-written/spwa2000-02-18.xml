  <p>Agri-environment stock disposal payments of up to &pound;485,000 may have been made to farming and crofting participants in the Environmentally Sensitive Area Scheme, Countryside Premium Scheme and Heather Moorland Scheme who were continuing to claim Sheep Annual Premium using quota rights which ought to have been frozen. I have already announced that I am not minded to recover the double payments, but the decision will ultimately rest on EC State Aid approval. Entitlement to future stock disposal payments will depend on whether producers opt to continue with the agri-environment stock disposal option. Those who choose this option will have frozen a number of quota rights equivalent to the number of animals for which they will receive headage payments under the agri-environment schemes.</p>

  <p>In the first pilot phase of the Computers for Teachers scheme, 1,974 primary teachers, 2,783 secondary teachers and 117 SEN teachers have been offered support.</p>

  <p>The scheme is administered by the Scottish Council for Educational Technology (SCET) on behalf of the Scottish Executive. It is open to all GTC-registered teachers in publicly funded primary and secondary schools. Successful applicants can claim &pound;200 against the cost of a computer that meets or exceeds the minimum specification drawn up by SCET and that was purchased after the announcement of the scheme on 22 November 1999. The payment is a taxable benefit, but the Scottish Executive has made arrangements to settle the tax and National Insurance centrally in addition to the &pound;200 allocation to each teacher. No liability will fall on the individual teachers.</p>

  <p>In this first phase sufficient funds were made available to support all teachers who applied.</p>

This objective is fully reflected in the UK position in negotiations, but I was able to make this point at the Agriculture Council in December and also more recently, my officials have in Council working groups convened on 11, 12 and 27 January.</p>

  <p>Lorna Naismith was given early retirement on grounds of organisational change due to Trust reconfiguration. She did not receive the sum mentioned, the major part of that figure - &pound;268,000 - represents the capitalisation costs for the penn which the employer is obliged to set aside to cover future payment of the pension until normal retiral age. The Trust reconfiguration process was a managed one which has been audited and shown to provide value for money to the NHS in Scotland. The process is expected to save &pound;100 million for investment in patient care.</p>

  <p>The information requested is set out in the table below. The figures, updated to include figures for the board areas not available at the time of the question referred to, are the product of an informal survey of health boards conducted in October 1999. From 1 April this year the information will be collected quarterly against agreed national definitions and will be published thereafter.</p>

  <p>Health boards, NHS Trusts and local authorities continue to work together to remove the causes and reduce the periods of delays to discharge.</p>

  <p>The table below shows the average length of time, in days, spent in hospital after the birth of the first child and subsequent children in the years 1990-91, 1994-95 and 1998-99.</p>

  <p>There has been a gradual reduction in the length of time spent in hospital by post-natal mothers, which reflects changed practices. This has also responded to the wishes of mothers to leave hospitals earlier and to the change of policy in providing more post-natal care by midwives in the community. However the provision of care is based on a flexible approach and mothers who feel they would benefit from a longer stay can do so.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what impact it estimates the proposal by Greater Glasgow Health Board to close the maternity unit at the Queen Mother&#8217;s Hospital while retaining the units at Glasgow Royal Infirmary and the Southern General Hospital would have on (a) the number of staff employed in maternity units in Greater Glasgow Health Board area; (b) the average number of hours worked per week by staff employed in maternity units in Greater Glasgow Health Board area; (c) the number of induced births and (d) the average time spent in hospital by mothers giving birth.</p>

  <p>It is for Greater Glasgow Health Board to determine how to organise services to meet the health care needs of the local population. Such provision must take account of declining numbers of births and changes in provision across the country, which reflect a shift in balance towards community provision. Further details are available from Greater Glasgow Health Board.</p>

  <p>In considering the provision and configuration of maternity services, local health boards are expected to take account of the 1993 Policy Review of the Provision of Maternity Services in Scotland. This recommended a move to increasing the choice for the woman, greater continuity of care and a move to midwife-led care while at the same time maintaining the safety of both mother and baby.</p>

  <p>The 1996 Policy Review of Health Services in Schools placed the responsibility for the provision of Health Services in Schools at local level with Primary Care Trusts. The review recommended a shift away from routine physical examinations towards a more selective approach based on assessment of individual needs.</p>

  <p>The School Health Service is not an isolated service but contributes with others towards the overall health of the child. Before starting school a child will have had a programme of health screening and immunisation. During this period any specific problems or needs will be identified. Any special needs identified will then be picked up by the School Health Service and the General Practitioner. This means that the needs of the child should be addressed at an early stage. Most children will receive a comprehensive physical examination that includes growth, vision and hearing in primary one. Thereafter the school nurse or Doctor provides health education, immunisation and selected examinations of certain children whenever it is felt they are needed.</p>

  <p>There are no plans currently to place defibrillators at public locations in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The evidence for improved outcomes resulting from the placing of defibrillators in public locations is not as clear-cut as might be assumed. A number of important issues would have to be considered including the recruitment and training of members of the public to undertake basic Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and use defibrillators. This would be crucial if members of the public are not to be put at risk as a result of inappropriate use of such equipment.</p>

  <p>I have therefore asked the Coronary Heart Disease Task Force to provide advice to the Executive on the risk:benefit analysis of such a programme.</p>

  <p>It is not the case that children's health needs have not been addressed in the Arbuthnott Review. First, the proposed resource allocation formula includes a set of age and sex cost weights based on evidence about the use made of services by different age and sex groups. These show, for example, that children under five make more intensive use of services than children in older age groups. Second, the proposed formula also involves an assessment of the influence of morbidity and life circumstances on the relative healthcare needs of the total population of each health board area. This assessment is based on an analysis of the use of services by people from different areas in Scotland, including the relative use of health services by children from affluent and deprived areas.</p>

  <p>The Yorkhill NHS Trust submitted comments on the Arbuthnott Report during the consultation period. As you know, I asked Sir John Arbuthnott to reconvene the Steering Group to consider the comments made on the report and to provide me with revised recommendations. The concerns raised by Professor Cockburn will be considered as part of this further work.</p>

  <p>I welcome any contribution to the store of knowledge about malnutrition.</p>

  <p>Malnutrition in hospitals has been the subject of research over a number of years and the complex nature of the effect of illness on indicators of nutritional status is a factor that has to be taken into account. It is important to make a distinction between malnutrition due to lack of nutritious food and that caused by the metabolic response to illness and injury.</p>

  <p>We are however taking steps to tackle malnutrition on a number of fronts. The Scottish Executive Health Department has asked health boards to apply nutritional standards in all NHS facilities and a multi-disciplinary advisory group is taking forward further work on this. In the wider context, the Scottish Diet Action Plan, with the help of Scottish Executive funding, provides the framework for a range of initiatives. These include promoting healthy diet in local communities and schools; assessing and managing nutritional status in the community through district nursing and health visiting services; and applying rigorous standards to dietary needs in nursing homes. Nutrition of elderly people also features in our Clinical Effectiveness Programme.</p>

Sites are chosen, such as car parks, where vehicle crime is common. Police officers stop drivers to provide them with information on how to prevent vehicle crime. Some 20,000 drivers have been spoken to under this initiative. Chat Points are not intended to detect offenders and no arrests have been reported.</p>

Under the Executive Devolution Order which took effect on 1 July 1999, the relevant functions are exercisable in Scotland by the Scottish Ministers as well as by the Secretary of State; and before the Scottish Ministers exercise those functions, they must first consult the Secretary of State.

  <p>: We ask applicants two question relating to health on our application forms. Firstly, whether they have a disability within the meaning of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. Secondly, if they have a disability/health problem which affects the work they can do. There is space on the form for applicants to provide further details. Applicants are advised that they need not answer these questions unless they wish to do so.</p>

  <p>The questions are asked to determine if an applicant&#8217;s disability is relevant to their ability to do the job - after a reasonable adjustment, if necessary. Asking about the effects of a disability is important in deciding what adjustments might need to be made.</p>

  <p>We have a number of measures in place to prevent discrimination of any kind against people who apply for jobs in the Parliament.</p>

  <p>First and foremost, the Scottish Parliament is an equal opportunities employer. We are firmly committed to providing equal opportunities for all of our staff irrespective of age, disability, gender, marital status, sexual orientation, race, colour, religion, nationality, ethnic or national origin.</p>

  <p>This commitment is reflected in our recruitment practices which provide that all eligible people will have equality of opportunity for employment on the basis of their suitability for the work.</p>

  <p>At no point in the recruitment process is a candidate required to disclose any information about their health, including epilepsy, to anyone directly involved in the recruitment process. Health declarations are required after the interview stage, but these are considered by the health advisers to the Parliament and the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme (PCSPS) and are passed in sealed envelopes between the individual and the respective health advisers.<br /></p>
