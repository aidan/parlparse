  <p>The Scottish Agricultural Science Agency is responsible for the operation of the Seed Potato Classification Scheme in Scotland. I have asked Dr Robert Hay, Chief Executive of the agency, to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Agricultural Science Agency has not changed its system of payment for seed potato inspection services. The Seed Potatoes (Fees) Regulations 1993 require that all fees relating to seed potato inspections be paid in advance of the inspections. However, to facilitate trade, the agency extends credit facilities for the inspection of seed potato tubers and the provision of seed potato labels to customers who meet certain criteria. These credit facilities may be withdrawn from customers who do not settle their accounts within a reasonable time.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Agricultural Science Agency has not changed the system of payment for the sale of seed potato plantlets.

  <p>The statutory scheme of drink-drive rehabilitation courses is a reserved matter. The Department for Transport, which administers the scheme, has commissioned research into the operation of these courses and their effectiveness in discouraging reoffending since the creation of a permanent scheme in January 2000. The research will cover Scotland and the Scottish Executive will have access to the results of that evaluation as soon as they are available. Monitoring of the pilot scheme, which ended in 1999, found that those offenders who had attended a course were between two and three times less likely to re-offend than those who had not.</p>

  <p>The priority-based dispatch system is scheduled to be rolled out across Scotland by 2004.

  <p>While ASBOs can be used to address anti-social behaviour wherever it occurs, research commissioned by the Executive into the use of ASBOs suggests that, in the period 1 December 2000 to 30 November 2001, no ASBOs have been issued specifically to control anti-social conduct in retail outlets.

  <p>The conditions of carriage for concessionary fares schemes, including rules on cross-boundary travel, are subject to contractual arrangements between transport authorities and bus operators. Certain schemes permit cross-boundary travel to a limited number of approved destinations at a concessionary or free fare.

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2003-02-18.14.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80171" speakername="Hugh Henry" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-03/wa0218.htm#10">

  <p>The Scottish Executive has actively encouraged the establishment of community safety partnerships led by the local authority and the police and involving the public, private and voluntary bodies to tackle community safety issues at a local level. Community Safety Partnerships are encouraged to focus on the main themes of improved crime prevention; tackling alcohol and drug related crime; changing attitudes and modifying behaviour; diverting young people away from criminal and anti-social behaviour, and reducing the fear of crime.</p>

  <p>Crime prevention spend by the Scottish Executive in Argyll and Bute and West Dunbartonshire is outlined in the answer given to question S1W-33835 today. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament's website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="/webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a>..</p>

  <p>Both council areas also benefit from Better Neighbourhood Services Fund (BNSF) and Social Inclusion Partnership (SIP) funding.</p>

  <p>Under BNSF Argyll and Bute has been awarded &#163;2.7 million and West Dunbartonshire has been awarded &#163;9 million over a three-year period 2001-02, 2002-03, 2003-04. Although the Local Outcome Agreements for neither area are specifically aimed at preventing crime, Argyll and Bute do include activities aimed at reducing the fear of crime among older people and West Dunbartonshire is providing a range of information, services and activities for young people to make it less likely that they will become involved in crime.</p>

  <p>Since 1997 the Argyll and Bute SIP has funded various crime prevention projects totalling &#163;204,000. Although in West Dunbartonshire few project allocations by the SIP have been for direct crime prevention work, they have provided &#163;1 million funding for projects which have an impact on crime prevention and reduction, such as young person's befriending schemes, action against vandalism, domestic violence, crimestoppers, youth diversion schemes and other similar schemes.</p>

  <p>The Executive does not have a single working group on discrimination. However, we have established a number of working groups which have considered aspects of discrimination for particular groups. For example, the Race Equality Advisory Forum considered issues of discrimination for minority ethnic communities in Scotland; we have established a Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) health discussion forum which is considering access to primary health care for LGBT people, and we recently announced the creation of a new independent group to examine what more the Executive should do to improve opportunities for women.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Executive is in regular contact with a range of minority groups and equality organisations.</p>

  <p>During 2001-02, the estimated street value of controlled drugs seized in all operations involving the Scottish Drug Enforcement Agency (including those involving Scottish police forces) was &#163;19.9 million. Equivalent figures for individual divisions of police forces are only available on a calendar year basis. The estimated street value of controlled drugs seized by L Division of Strathclyde Police in the calendar years 2001 and 2002 was &#163;686,000. The estimated value of drugs seized is of course different from the value of assets recovered.</p>

  <p>None of the recovered criminal assets we have redistributed so far have been provided specifically to West Dunbartonshire or Argyll and Bute.</p>

  <p>However, &#163;180,000 from recovered criminal assets has been earmarked to support families across Scotland affected by drug misuse. A national network of family support groups is being established, and this is being driven by a steering group of family members. This will determine, in due course, how these resources can best be used to support the families of drug misusers, including those in West Dunbartonshire and Argyll and Bute.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&#146;s drugs strategy, <em>Tackling Drugs in Scotland: Action in Partnership</em> , <em> </em> is backed by around &#163;130 million in new resources for 2001-02 to 2003-04. All areas of Scotland have benefited from these additional resources in terms of new drug treatment and rehabilitation services, improved support for young people and families, improved treatment provision in prisons, more criminal justice interventions, strengthened enforcement activity, enhanced drugs education in schools and in the community and better improved information on drugs.</p>

  <p>However, the planning and delivery of local activities and initiatives is the responsibility of local drug action teams and partner agencies. drug action teams are required to report to the Scottish Executive on actions undertaken and planned in their annual corporate action plans. These can be found on the national drugs website at <a href="http://www.drugmisuse.isdscotland.org/" target="_blank">www.drugmisuse.isdscotland.org</a> The plans show evidence of enhanced service provision in the areas requested, particularly in terms of services for vulnerable young people, the further development of integrated services, and the provision of training and employment opportunities for recovering drug users. A Drug Treatment and Testing Order has also recently come into operation in the Argyll and Clyde area.</p>

  <p>Information on drug-related expenditure is not held on a constituency basis. The main components of drugs specific expenditure allocated to NHS boards and local authorities in the areas requested is outlined in the following tables. The areas may also be benefiting from other resources which are not drug specific, but which impact on the problem.</p>

  <p>Planning consent for landfill is a matter for local authorities, and operational permits are a matter for the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. Planning applications are not automatically notifiable to the Scottish ministers for the sole reason that they relate to landfill sites, but may be notified because of a variety of other criteria.</p>

  <p>Five applications for planning permission for landfill sites have been notified to the Scottish ministers during the last five years. The breakdown is as follows:</p>

  <p>I have today written to the Conveners of the Justice Committees outlining a wide-ranging package of proposed reforms, which have been agreed following intensive discussions between the Executive, the Law Society of Scotland and the Scottish Legal Aid Board. The reforms involve three key elements: a new application and reporting regime; a new block fee structure for work in the sheriff court, and the introduction of a quality assurance scheme, based on registration and peer review, to be operated jointly by the society and the board. These reforms also respond to recommendations of the Justice 1 Committee in its report on legal aid.</p>

  <p>Taken as a whole, the package represents real modernisation of the legal aid system. Together with changes made last year to eligibility, urgency provision, and contributions, it will be the first major change in over a decade. The reforms I propose should deliver significant benefits to all of the key stakeholders. For clients, they will create a fee structure that rewards efficient and effective conduct of cases, and ensure quality of service. For solicitors, they will deliver improved remuneration in return for modernisation. For the wider public, they should ensure an adequate supply of legal practitioners across the country. For the board and the Executive &#150; and the Scottish taxpayer - the reforms will provide better monitoring and control of cases; and simpler, more flexible and more transparent processes which will facilitate the introduction of e-business, creating more efficiencies.</p>

  <p>Overall, I believe that the package marks a significant step towards a civil legal aid system that is fit for purpose for the 21st century &#150; a system that delivers efficient and effective access to justice for people who need it.</p>

  <p>I intend to lay regulations on the new fee structure before Parliament for approval as quickly as possible.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#146;s new Lifelong Learning Strategy emphasises the importance of informal community-based learning opportunities in encouraging non-traditional learners back into learning.</p>

  <p>On 28 January, the Scottish Executive issued guidance on community learning and development to all local authorities and their Community Planning Partners. This guidance has highlighted community-based adult learning as one of four national priorities for local community learning and development partnerships. The guidance emphasises the need for statutory and voluntary sector agencies to work together to raise standards of achievement in learning for adults, in the core skills of literacy and numeracy and in ICT, and through extending community-based vocational and non-vocational lifelong learning opportunities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has committed &#163;51 million over five years to 2006 to help 150,000 adults with low literacy and numeracy skills. &#163;40 million of this will be routed through local authorities to Community Learning Strategy Partnerships to provide a wide range of learning opportunities in local communities.</p>

  <p>The consultation paper on lottery distribution policy was published in July 2002 by ministers from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the Scottish Executive, the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly. The consultation closed on 30 October 2002. Consultation responses were collected by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, with responses from Scotland being copied to the Scottish Executive. I have written to the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport conveying Scottish ministers&#146; views in the light of the Scottish consultation responses. Copies of the letter have been placed in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 26471).

  <p>The Scottish Executive will continue to process Freight Facilities Grant (FFG) applications where they relate to facilities or traffic flows within Scotland. We will also continue to process applications which involve traffic flows between Scotland and England where the FFG funded capital expenditure is limited to Scotland. Out of 15 rail FFGs awarded since August 1997, 12 have required FFG funded capital expenditure in Scotland only.</p>

  <p>Similarly Track Access Grant (TAG) applications with flows entirely within Scotland will not be affected, but cross-border applications may be affected.

  <p>Decisions on whether to prosecute those who breach environmental legislation are entirely matters for the Crown Office and the Procurators Fiscal Service. Guidelines have been issued to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) by the Crown Office to assist the agency in reporting cases to the procurators fiscal and to address issues such as sufficiency of evidence and public interest.</p>

  <p>SEPA&#146;s policy on when to recommend to the procurator fiscal that a case be brought against an offender was developed after consultation with the Scottish Executive and a wide range of stakeholders. This policy takes into account the need to punish offenders, as well as proportionality in relation to the risks posed to the environment and the seriousness of the offence. A copy of SEPA&#146;s Policy Statement on Enforcement is available on the agency&#146;s website at <a href="http://www.sepa.org.uk/" target="_blank">www.sepa.org.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>Young Scottish students studying full-time higher education courses in Scotland from 2001-02 are entitled to an annual Young Students' Bursary (YSB) of up to &#163;2,050, which replaces part of their loan support. Young Scottish students studying elsewhere in the UK for the first time from 2002-03 onwards are entitled to an annual Young Students' Outside Scotland Bursary (YSO) of up to &#163;510, which is provided in addition to their student loan entitlement. Both bursaries are provided as an entitlement based on the level of parental income and eligibility is assessed as part of the overall assessment of eligibility for student support.</p>

  <p>In the current academic year, to date, 21,384 YSB awards and 317 Young Students' Outside Scotland Bursary awards have been made, of whom 403 were domiciled in Argyll and Bute and 450 were domiciled in West Dunbartonshire.</p>

  <p>Non-repayable supplementary grants are also available for those students who have additional financial needs, such as students who have dependants or who have a disability. Additional discretionary grants are available from individual colleges and universities for new mature students with child care costs and for any student who faces particular financial difficulties, which might prevent them from accessing or continuing their course.</p>

  <p>Tuition fees have been abolished for Scottish domiciled and EU students studying full-time higher education courses in Scotland. This support is not repayable and is available to all eligible full-time students to undertake one first degree, or comparable course of higher education, provided they have not previously undertaken such a course with assistance from public funds. This support is paid irrespective of the students' family income.</p>

  <p>Scottish domiciled students who study full-time higher education (HE) courses elsewhere in the UK make an annual means tested contribution of up to &#163;1,100 towards the cost of their tuition. Such students from low-income families will, therefore, have their tuition fees paid on their behalf by SAAS.</p>

  <p>In the current academic year there are 2,018 undergraduate students from Argyll and Bute and 1,808 undergraduate students from West Dunbartonshire local authority area who have had their tuition fees waived.</p>

  <p>Scottish domiciled students who study part-time HE courses in Scotland can apply to their institution to waive their fees if they have a disability, are claiming benefits or are from a low income family. Information on the number of part-time students who have their fees waived is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>Students studying at institutions overseas generally do not receive tuition fee support.</p>

  <p>Quarterly surveys seeking feedback from service users have been carried out over the term of the existing contract and the results incorporated into the specified service requirement, which was issued to all tenderers. Under the Scotland Act 1998, the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB) is given the function of providing the Parliament, or ensuring that the Parliament is provided with, the property, staff and services required for the Parliament&#146;s purposes. This places the responsibility for the letting of contracts with the SPCB, and it is the SPCB that would be liable for any legal challenge that ensued as the result of a contract award decision.

  <p>There has been no consultation with trade unions because the internal messenger service in the Parliament has been contracted out since 1999. It would not be appropriate for the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to consult with the trade union representing employees of another organisation that is tendering for a contract.</p>
