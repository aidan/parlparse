  <p>Taxation matters are reserved. The Chancellor&#8217;s intention is to recycle the revenues from the aggregates tax into a reduction in employers&#8217; NI contributions. This can be expected to lead to a net increase in employment.</p>

  <p>I refer to the answer I gave to question S1W-11027 on 22 November 2000. Each year the number of sequestrations among Scottish farmers is very small. Most farmers leaving the industry, as a result of financial pressure, do so in an orderly way by selling up and realising their assets. I expect this still to be the case over the next two years.</p>

  <p>Cancer is one of three national clinical priorities for the NHS in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Mesothelioma is a particularly distressing disease, for which the treatment options are the same as for all cancers i.e. chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery. Decisions on treatment options are reached in agreement between clinicians and their patients.</p>

  <p>Similarly, a wide range of support services are available for everyone with cancer. Referral to the appropriate services would normally be made by medical staff after discussion and agreement with patients.</p>

  <p>A comprehensive range of policy measures is in place to ensure that those with disabilities or other special needs can play an effective part in Scotland&#8217;s economic future, and gain access to education and lifelong learning to improve their employability.</p>

  <p>Employment policy is a reserved area. The New Deal is delivered in Scotland in partnership with the Scottish Executive and other Scottish organisations. By the end of August, over 2,300 disabled people had sought help through the New Deal for Disabled People in Scotland and over 600 had found work. A New Deal for Disabled People prospectus was launched on 13 November. This invites bids from the private, voluntary and public sectors for the provision of Job Broker services, as part of a variety of innovative approaches to help disabled people to move from benefits to sustained employment.</p>

  <p>We are also committed to widening access to further and higher education. The needs of people with disabilities will be a key element in taking forward our current consultation on student support and our commitment to targeting resource on the most disadvantaged students, and unemployed people.</p>

  <p>Children with disabilities have the same entitlement to pre-school education as other eligible children. Education authorities are responsible for ensuring that the places provided for <i>all</i> children meet their individual needs. Authorities may provide places directly or commission places in the private and voluntary sector. Where places are commissioned for children with disabilities, authorities should ensure that any specialist support required is in place.</p>

  <p>Employment policy is reserved to the UK Government which takes the lead on the funding and delivery of the New Deal, although in close consultation with its partners, including the Scottish Executive. The New Deal 50plus offers personal advice, job search support and an Employment Credit to people over 50 who are looking for work.</p>

  <p>The Executive also supports the Department for Education and Employment&#8217;s Code of Practice on Age Diversity in Employment, which calls upon all employers to tackle age discrimination.</p>

  <p>Training for Work, the Scottish Executive&#8217;s training programme for long-term unemployed adults over the age of 25, is currently being reviewed. Our consultation document includes a proposal to extend entry to all unemployed people aged 50 and over.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is working closely with Scottish Enterprise to strengthen Scotland&#8217;s position as a world centre for leading edge biotechnology and pharmaceutical research. Between 1999 and 2004, as part of the biotechnology cluster action plan, Scottish Enterprise is due to inject &pound;38 million into the continued development of this key sector. This promotional activity is taking a number of forms, including issuing regular e-bulletins to over 2,000 international contacts and use of the Biotechnology Scotland website, where 50% of visitors to the site are from overseas. Opportunities for networking and international partnership working are also being developed.</p>

  <p>This work is supported by Scottish Trade International and its network of overseas offices, including its four Scottish Technology and Research Centres in the US. This provides a platform within priority markets for the promotion of Scottish research expertise and the development of strategic alliances. One such partnership agreement was signed in August between Scottish Enterprise and the Maryland Bioscience Alliance, with the support of the Scottish Executive and the State of Maryland. This alliance will help promote business and research collaborations with one of the premier life science centres in the United States.</p>

  <p>In another recent development, a research agreement worth over &pound;5 million, between the Japanese company Kyorin Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. and Scottish Biomedical, will see the creation of a brand new research facility based at the West of Scotland Science Park.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has already discussed with the industry and other interested parties issues arising from the CFP with a view to developing a Scottish perspective to the UK response to the Commission Green Paper on the reform, which is due for publication next spring. I took the opportunity to raise with Commissioner Fischler, when he visited Peterhead recently, the importance we attach to issues like 6- and 12-mile limits, relative stability, the Shetland Box and enhancing the regional dimension of the CFP.</p>

  <p>I understand that the European Committee intend to hold an inquiry into the review, and the Executive will be happy to contribute to this.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is advised by the Food Standards Agency on food safety matters. On 1 October this year more stringent BSE-related controls were applied across the EU regarding the removal of specified risk material (SRM) from cattle for human consumption. It is illegal to sell beef in the UK, for human consumption, from animals over 30 months old that come from countries with a risk of BSE.</p>

  <p>Potential risks to consumers from imported beef are being closely monitored. The agency has issued guidance to enforcement authorities throughout the UK requesting that checks on all documentation which accompanies consignments of imported beef are stepped up.</p>

  <p>The agency has welcomed yesterday&#8217;s further proposals from the Commission. These reflect current UK controls and provide effective protection for consumers against the spread of BSE across Europe. The agency will be checking progress on the key issues of when these new controls are introduced and the effectiveness of enforcement measures.</p>

  <p>The agency will provide further advice on the safety of imported beef directly to the Scottish Executive, as well as to other UK administrations.</p>

  <p>There has for long been comprehensive central guidance on the prevention of infection in hospital, most recently revised in 1998 in the form of the <i>Scottish Infection Manual</i> . This guidance contains a chapter on the prevention of infection in &quot;Units of High Potential Risk&quot;, which include certain paediatric units, and indicates specific measures to be put in place in addition to the standard infection control precautions.</p>

  <p>The importance of reducing the incidence of hospital-acquired infection generally is recognised and the Executive has recently established a working group to examine this whole area.</p>

  <p>All universities and higher education institutions throughout the UK are currently being consulted on the proposed e-university business model. A UK-wide steering group for the e-university (e-U) has representation from a Scottish university, and the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council (SHEFC) also has observer status on that group, to ensure that Scottish institutions&#8217; interests are considered and to keep Scottish institutions informed of the group&#8217;s work.</p>

  <p>SHEFC will consider all responses from Scottish institutions to the current consultation, which will inform its future policies.</p>

  <p>The e-U business model report refers to the existence of &quot;Scottish Knowledge&quot;, launched in 1999, as &quot;perhaps the most comprehensive e-development within the UK, set up by a group of Scottish universities and UK businesses to act as a commercial and global marketing partner. (It) has some similarities with (the) proposals for the e-U&quot;. It is clear that the e-U steering group, and the consultants who prepared the business model report, are well aware of Scottish developments.</p>

  <p>Over the last two years, the Forestry Commission has taken several steps to ensure that the Holyrood project team is fully aware of the opportunities for using Scottish timber in the Scottish Parliament. It has arranged for representatives of the timber trade to meet members of the project team, the contractors and the architects, and it has organised a tour to show members of the project team how Scottish hardwoods are processed and how they have been used in recent buildings. The commission has co-sponsored a study into the amount of Scottish oak that is currently available as sawn timber, and it has also provided information to the contractors about how much other Scottish timber is likely to be available, and how it could be obtained for the Holyrood project. I am pleased to say that, following this contact, a contract has recently been let to provide about 50 cubic metres of Scottish grown oak for the new Scottish Parliament building.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive already has established links with the Faroe Islands with, most recently, a visit to Scotland at the end of September by the Faroese Minister of Health and Social Affairs. These links have had a particular emphasis on co-operation in the oil and gas sector. In addition, the Export Partnership for north-east Scotland, which co-ordinates local export support in this region, is helping to arrange a trade mission to the Faroes in spring 2001.</p>

  <p>In general, landowners do not require consent to plant trees, unless the proposed tree planting is likely to have significant effects on the environment. Where this is the case, the landowner must prepare an environmental statement and submit this to the Forestry Commissioners with an application for consent. Applicants may appeal to Scottish Ministers where the Commissioners have refused consent, or have granted consent subject to certain conditions. Any person aggrieved by a grant of consent may apply to the Court of Session for an Order reducing the consent. We have no plans to introduce amendments to the relevant regulations.</p>

  <p>In Scotland, English, Welsh and Scottish Railway currently moves approximately 143,000 tonnes of Scottish timber per annum. Private sector timber harvested in 1999 was 1.7 million cubic metres and Forest Enterprise harvested timber in 1999-2000 was 2.994 million cubic metres, equivalent to approximately 4.7 million tonnes altogether.</p>

  <p>It is anticipated that the proposed reopening of the access road to Beattock railway sidings in Dumfries will enable the volume of timber moved by rail to more than double. The council, Railtrack and English, Welsh and Scottish Railway are currently in discussions about this matter.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to increasing the proportion of freight that goes by rail and waterborne modes of transport. We have doubled the funding available under the Freight Facilities Grant scheme to &pound;36 million from March 2001 to March 2004 in order to support the transfer of freight from road to these alternative modes.</p>

  <p>None. Research and development of renewable sources of energy is carried out under a UK programme funded by the Department of Trade and Industry. The contracts awarded to renewables generators in Scotland under the three Orders making up the Scottish Renewables Obligation are funded by the Fossil Fuel Levy on all electricity suppliers, which is in turn passed on to electricity consumers in Scotland.

  <p>Science underpins, directly or indirectly, a wide range of Scottish Executive policies. These cover not only innovation in industry and wealth creation more generally, but also health, agriculture and fisheries, the environment, the built heritage, education, transport, housing, construction and local authority services.</p>

  <p>In addition,the Scottish Executive has a responsibility for supporting the science base in Scotland as part of the UK science base. It does this both through infrastructure support of universities, through the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council and by the sponsorship funding of research institutes and units such as the Scottish Agricultural and Biological Research Institutes funded by the Rural Affairs Department and the Research Units funded by the Chief Scientist Office of the Health Department. Other major science facilities funded directly by the Scottish Executive are the Fisheries Research Services and the Scottish Agricultural Science Agency, both being agencies of the Rural Development Department. Historic Scotland, an agency of the Education Department, carries out and commissions scientific work in support of conservation. A range of public bodies sponsored by the Scottish Executive, such as Scottish Natural Heritage, the National Museums of Scotland, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the water authorities also have a science capability.</p>

  <p>The Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Department is taking forward the development of a science strategy for Scotland, which will provide a strategic framework of policies to guide the provision and use of science in pursuit of Scottish Executive objectives. It will be published in the New Year.</p>

  <p>The Executive will consider the need for further measures on the effects of passive smoking when the results of a recent survey commissioned by HEBS and ASH Scotland on public perceptions of passive smoking are known, together with the impact of the Scottish Voluntary Charter on Smoking in Public Places and the HSE&#8217;s proposed code of practice on passive smoking in the workplace.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive agrees that we need to do more to ensure that excluded young people have the opportunity to make a successful transition to adulthood.</p>

  <p>We recognise the particular problems of poverty and disadvantage in Glasgow and are investing significant amounts to enable agencies and organisations to address these problems more effectively. Glasgow City Council received a special deprivation payment of &pound;8.7 million in 2000-01 and can also expect to receive real terms grant increases in each of the next three years as a result of the extra &pound;1.2 billion support for local government we announced in the Spending Review. We have committed &pound;12.5 million to resource alternative provision for Glasgow&#8217;s hostel dwellers, many of whom are excluded young people and Glasgow will benefit from the additional &pound;100 million we have announced for tackling drug misuse. In addition the implementation of the recommendations of the Arbuthnott Report and the &pound;90 million Better Neighbourhoods Fund, will ensure that service providers can access increased resources to tackle deprivation and social exclusion in areas of greatest need, including Glasgow.</p>

  <p>Decisions on new transatlantic air service links are for the commercial judgment of airlines and airport operators who assess the potential for new services. The Executive, Scottish Enterprise and the STB play a supportive and influencing role in promoting new and improved links.</p>

  <p>Prior to the current public consultation on the affordability of water and sewerage charges, the Executive invited views on the subject from various experts, including the Water Industry Commissioner. Ministers drew on these views in framing their proposals for a scheme to cap water and sewerage charges for those on Council Tax Benefit.</p>

  <p>The initial and subsequent costs to the local authorities of administering the scheme to cap water and sewerage charges for those on Council Tax Benefit will be established in discussions between the Executive and the local authorities. The Executive has undertaken to reimburse the authorities for these costs.</p>

  <p>The national telephone debtline is being developed by a partnership that includes the money advice sector, the Scottish Executive, departments of the UK Government and the private sector. Plans for three pilots are being drawn up; one will be in Scotland, with the Executive&#8217;s contribution to the &pound;2 million costs expected to be &pound;50,000.</p>

  <p>The proposed scheme will cap water and sewerage charges for those on Council Tax Benefit. The cap for each year will be set once water and sewerage charges for the year have been announced. The estimated cost of &pound;24 million over three years reflects assumptions about level of the cap and the number of households likely to be eligible for the scheme. It also includes an element to cover the cost to the local authorities of administering the scheme.</p>
