  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the contaminated land survey proposed for Monklands will include consideration of the impact of contaminated land on the health of people in local communities and whether funding will be made available for treatment of contaminated land found as a result of this survey.</p>

  <p>I understand that North Lanarkshire Council is currently gathering information on potential contaminated land sites within its area, including Monklands, so that when the new contaminated land regime is implemented later this year it will be well placed to carry out its statutory responsibilities. The impact of a potential contaminated site on human health is one of the possible causes of significant harm which are to be taken into account by local authorities when considering the designation of particular areas of land as contaminated.</p>

  <p>Under the regulations, responsibility for paying for remediation will follow the polluter pays principle. This means that, in the first instance, the persons who caused or knowingly permitted the contamination will be liable for undertaking the remediation and meeting its costs. Funding of &pound;10.7 million has been made available over the three years 1999-2000 to 2001-02 to help local authorities in Scotland develop inspection strategies, carry out site investigations and take forward enforcement action.</p>

  <p>The future provision of cochlear implantation in Scotland has been considered by the National Services Advisory Group (NSAG), which advises the Scottish Executive on specialist services. Following careful consideration of this work, I have decided:</p>

  <p>Cochlear implantation services will continue to be nationally commissioned for the next three years;</p>

  <p>The Scottish Cancer Group (SCG) is the overarching advisory body responsible for the development of Scotland&#8217;s cancer strategy. There are SCG sub-groups for Quality Assurance, Chemotherapy and Cancer Genetics.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive Health Department&#8217;s Cancer Executive Group (CEG) supports the SCG agenda and is responsible for the work of the Scottish Cancer Therapy Network (SCTN). SCTN is funded by the Scottish Executive and supports the nationwide quality assurance of cancer services and clinical trials.</p>

  <p>Other bodies/committees involved in strategic developments in cancer are:</p>

  <p>The Clinical Standards Board for Scotland (CSBS) was established from 1 April 1999 as a Special Health Board responsible for monitoring standards of clinical services provided by the NHS. The CSBS and the QA Sub-Group work together to co-ordinate the establishment and monitoring clinical standards initially in breast, lung, colorectal, gynaecological cancer services and in palliative care. The CSBS has established sub-groups to develop generic and tumour/service specific clinical standards in each of these areas.</p>

  <p>National clinical audits funded by the Executive&#8217;s Clinical Resource and Audit Group are also underway, or will commence shortly, in gastric-oesophageal, urological and head and neck cancers and will provide the basis for QA and the development of clinical standards in these tumour types.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN), also funded by the Executive, has published national clinical guidelines for breast, colorectal, lung and testicular cancer. A guideline for the management of pain in cancer is expected to be published this year.</p>

  <p>Two sub-groups of the Scottish Medical and Scientific Advisory Committee (SMASAC) are expected to report shortly on (i) recommendations for a radiological equipment replacement programme using cancer as a model and (ii) the diagnostic/laboratory services required to support a breast cancer managed clinical network.</p>

  <p>The issue of balancing full-time manned services and on-call arrangements at ambulance stations is a matter for the management of the Scottish Ambulance Service to consider.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-3451 by Susan Deacon on 10 January 2000, whether it has any plans to establish a national rate for caesarean sections, bearing in mind the World Health Organisation recognised rate of 10-15%.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-02-09.S1W-3973.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80146" speakername="Susan Deacon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa0209.htm#737">

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no plans to do so.</p>

  <p>The World Health Organisation does not make specific recommendations about the rate of caesarean delivery. They do advise that rates lower than 5% should alert health planners and managers to the possibility that access to essential care is insufficient and that rates higher than 15% should draw attention to the possibility of the overuse of caesarean section. WHO also point out that where national rates for caesarean delivery fall between 5 and 15% it cannot be assumed that that is the appropriate rate as much depends on the circumstances surrounding each birth. The decision on the way a baby is to be delivered will be taken by the doctors and midwives on the basis of a number of factors.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive together with the Royal College of Gynaecologists are actively looking to reduce the rates where clinically appropriate.</p>

The Scottish Executive also expressed its commitment to the principles of equal opportunities and to tackling exclusion in all walks of life in <i>Scotland in the Partnership</i> document.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive consulted extensively on its intention to repeal section 2A in its consultation document <i>Standards in Public Life: Consultation on the Ethical Standards in Public Life etc. (Scotland) Bill</i> which issued on 18 November 1999. The consultation period closed on 14 January 2000. Over 6,500 copies of the paper were sent out. In addition, the Bill appeared on the Scottish Executive website. There were over 2,300 responses to that consultation.</p>

  <p>Staffing levels are a matter for local authorities themselves. Available figures for local authority staffing levels show an overall decrease of 2,161 full-time equivalent (FTE) staff for the period 1997-98, a further decrease of 1,859 for the period 1998-99, and an increase of 374 for the period March-June 1999. These figures, which are drawn from <i>Joint Staffing Watch</i> , issued jointly by the Scottish Executive and CoSLA, include fire and police services and comprise all full and part-time posts; the actual number of jobs, therefore, may vary independently of the number of FTE staff.</p>

  <p>Local authorities, in association with the police, are responsible for the installation and operation of speed cameras on local roads such as the A89. The Scottish Executive, in association with the police, is responsible for cameras on trunk roads.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive provides local authorities with a block allocation for expenditure on a number of services. It is for each council to consider the priority to be given to the installation of speed cameras, in terms of all the services for which it is responsible, and to allocate resources accordingly. These arrangements give local authorities flexibility to determine what measures are required to meet local needs and circumstances.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has not identified any speed-related accident blackspots on the trunk road network in Lanarkshire and has no plans to install cameras.<br /></p>
