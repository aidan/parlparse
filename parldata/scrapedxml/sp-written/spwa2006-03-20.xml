  <p>Officials were involved in the Equal Opportunities Commissions (EOC) External Advisory Group as part of their research into occupation segregation. I have met with the EOC since the launch of their investigative report into occupational segregation in modern apprenticeships (MAs), <em>Jobs for the boys and girls: promoting a smart successful and equal Scotland</em> .</p>

  <p>I recognise that there are a complex set of factors which influence career choice and the Executive have agreed to set up a cross departmental working group on occupational segregation. Officials are currently liaising with the EOC Scotland over the remit, membership and duration of the group.</p>

  <p>We have also, through the Modern Apprenticeship Implementation Group (MAIG), encouraged changes to the role of the group, the way it operates and also the process that MA frameworks are approved. The process is now more robust and through Sector Skills Agreements we can encourage employers to become more proactive in tackling occupational segregation and share best practice.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Health Promoting Schools Unit was established to develop a whole school approach to promoting the physical, social, spiritual, mental and emotional well-being of all pupils. This ensures not only that health education is integral to the curriculum but also that school ethos, policies, services and extra-curricular activities foster mental, physical and social well-being and healthy development. All schools are required to be health promoting by 2007.</p>

  <p>The agenda set out in <em>Ambitious Excellent Schools</em> and <em>A Curriculum for Excellence</em> places an importance on personal and life skills. Guidance for schools which support this agenda are:</p>

  <p>The national review of guidance <em>Happy, Safe and Achieving their Potential</em>, sets out the standards of support for all school staff in pastoral care.</p>

  <p><em>Safe and Well</em>, a handbook for staff, schools and education authorities provides guidance on pupil safety and well-being.</p>

  <p><em>Better Behaviour &ndash; Better Learning</em>, provides a framework for promoting positive behaviour, respectful relationships, effective communication and emotional intelligence.</p>

  <p>Healthy Respect, the National Health Demonstration Project on young people&rsquo;s sexual health, funded by the Executive, aims to demonstrate how increasing young people&rsquo;s knowledge of sexual health issues through a multi-disciplinary approach to education, information and accessible services in a variety of settings can lead to improved sexual health and relationships. The learning from Healthy Respect will be shared across Scotland to enable other parts of the country to shape their own services according to local need.</p>

  <p>To promote healthy eating, a grant of over &pound;70 million for 2006&ndash;08 has recently been made available to continue the implementation of the recommendations of Hungry for Success. These measures will ensure that nutritious school meals are available to all children.</p>

  <p>We are also funding initiatives which promote physical activity in schools and this includes: Active Schools which aims to increase the range, frequency and quality of opportunity for daily physical activity in schools; working with Y Dance to provide in-service training for teachers to develop dance work in schools and encourage participation in dance as a contribution to increasing physical activity, particularly among girls; Scottish Out of School Care Network which provides development of training and provision of resources for after school clubs and Girls on the Move which provides girls-only opportunities for sports coach and leader training.</p>

  <p>The recent Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education report, <em>Improving Scottish Education</em> , highlighted that leadership is good or very good in over 80% of our schools. The Executive is determined to build on this successful performance to improve leadership in all schools and thereby increase pupil attainment and achievement.</p>

  <p>The Executive is undertaking a wide range of initiatives aimed at improving leadership in Scottish education. Some of the priority areas that we are addressing are:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>Designing and developing flexible approaches to meeting the Standard for Headship;<br />
              Supporting the development of leadership capacity at all levels of the education system;<br />
              Increasing the mentoring and coaching capacity in Scottish education;<br />

  <p>The Leader+(Scotland) Programme currently operates as a Community Initiative under the European Structural Funds and will continue to run through to June 2008 although has to be fully committed by 31 December 2006, project activity completed by 31 December 2007 and administration costs payable until 30 June 2008.</p>

  <p>From 2007 Leader will be mainstreamed in the Scottish Rural Development Programme and responsibility will transfer to Environment and Rural Affairs Department.</p>

  <p>At this moment it is not possible to say what the funding level for Leader 2007-13 will be as the European funding allocation for rural development to member states has not been finalised but leader will play a key role in the delivery of the Scottish Rural Development Programme and will be in place during 2007.</p>

  <p>Expenditure for the Scottish programmes is paid in arrears to the member state through the Treasury, which then remits in full to the Scottish Executive. As we are currently still within the 2000-06 programming period, the full allocation for all Scottish programmes has not yet been disbursed. At current exchange rates, the total funding package equates to &pound;1.156 billion, of which &pound;680 million has been disbursed for the period January 2000 to February 2006.</p>

  <p>New financial spend targets have been introduced in 2000-06, by which the full sum of any one year&rsquo;s allocations must be spent within two years of the allocation year or risk automatic de-commitment (referred to as &quot;N+2&quot;). Scottish programmes have met all their N+2 targets apart from under the Highlands and Islands Special Transitional Programme, where lack of spend by project beneficiaries led to automatic de-commitment of European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund monies in 2003 and Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance monies in 2004.</p>

  <p>Allocations establish the extent to which funds can be made available to individual projects. Satisfactory progress with projects, reported in individual grant claims, allows the Scottish Executive to pay grant to applicants. The Scottish Executive effectively acts as banker for the programme. When the programme was approved by the Commission in 2000, the Commission paid an advance to the Executive from which grant could be paid to projects. Project expenditure will continue into 2008. As claims are settled, the Executive seeks re-imbursement from the Commission &ndash; usually three or four times each year. This process will continue until the programme closes.</p>

  <p>Final payment is not made until the programme has been closed by the Commission. It is anticipated that final claim and closure statements will be submitted to the Commission by June 2009 and final payment will be made thereafter. This does not affect applicants. Allocations are made in full by the Commission to the programme. Payments from the Commission come to the Executive via HM Treasury and are automatically transferred in full to the Scottish budget on receipt.</p>

  <p>In 2003 a total of &euro;2,026,960.77 (&pound;1,380,461) was deducted from the European Agriculture Guidance and Guarantee Fund element of the Highlands and Islands Special Transitional Programme. In 2004 &euro;2,147,214 (&pound;1,462,360) was deducted from the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance element; it is also likely that a further &euro;9,009.82 (&pound;6,136) will be deducted from 2005.</p>

  <p>It would not be appropriate to provide details of individual cases. Failure to achieve spending levels is attributable to a range of factors including particular problems faced by the farming and fisheries sectors over the last few years affecting confidence and ability to fund applicants&rsquo; share of project costs.</p>

  <p>Although the level of European funding was reduced there was no loss to the programme or individual projects as the Environment and Rural Affairs Department increased the level of its funding to compensate.</p>

  <p>A number of steps have been taken to monitor financial progress. In 2003 the Programme Monitoring Committee adopted an N+2 (Annual Expenditure Target) Action Plan. This is updated annually. N+2 is a standing item for Programme Monitoring and Management Committees. In addition, the Scottish Executive and the Programme Management Executive monitor progress on a monthly basis, increasing to weekly if progress is slow and as the end of year deadline approaches. Officials also meet regularly to consider progress and take appropriate steps to expedite spend including contact with project applicants to ensure that claims are submitted regularly. Officials also provide progress reports to me on all structural funds programmes and I have written to a number of applicants encouraging them to submit claims timeously.</p>

  <p>Centrally held information can provide details for patients where cystic fibrosis is identified on their hospital records. These figures <em>ma</em> y represent an undercount of the true number of cases because cystic fibrosis could be an underlying reason for admission to hospital and, as such, will not always be recorded.</p>

  <p>Table 1 presents the number of patients discharged from acute hospitals in Scotland with a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis broken down by health board of residence and age group. Patients with more than one discharge in a year are only counted once in each health board and age group.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to count the number of patients prior to 1981 as individual hospital discharge records have not been linked before this date.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. These statistics are derived from data collected on discharges from non-obstetric and non-psychiatric hospitals (SMR01) in Scotland.</p>

  <p>2. Cases where the patient was not admitted to hospital are not included.</p>

  <p>3. Up to six diagnoses (one principal, five secondary) are recorded on SMR01 returns. All six diagnoses have been used to identify cystic fibrosis. The following code was used from the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Other Health Related Problems, tenth revision (ICD10): E84 for discharges from 1 April 1996, and ninth revision (ICD-9): 277.0 for discharges prior to 1 April 1996. However, it should be noted that the use of these codes may vary from hospital to hospital.</p>

  <p>4. Data for year ending 31 March 2005 should be treated as provisional.</p>

  <p>Patients with a minor illness or injury should make use of the high quality advice and support available from NHS 24. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will refer them to their local hospital-based Community Casualty Unit. These nurse or paramedic led community-based facilities will be able to treat them quickly and effectively and, should it be necessary, will obtain medical advice by telemedicine link to the area&rsquo;s main emergency site. These units will also be equipped to pass digital x-ray images to the area&rsquo;s emergency radiology team.</p>

  <p>Patients who have suffered a serious injury or trauma will be advised to go to, or be taken by ambulance to the area&rsquo;s main consultant-led Emergency Centre.</p>

  <p>Sites with Emergency Centres will also have Community Casualty Units and patients with a minor illness or injury will be treated in that unit.</p>

  <p>When a proposal for a service change is submitted to the Scottish Executive for approval, we expect the impact of the proposed change on the travel arrangements of patients, carers, visitors and staff to be fully assessed. Where this has been carried out inadequately, we will ask for further travel impact assessment work before a decision is reached.</p>

  <p>The numbers of applications assessed as homeless under the homelessness legislation by local authorities are shown in the following table. Due to local government re-organisation in 1996, there are problems of comparability with data prior to this date and the table therefore presents figures for 1996-97 onwards.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-19671 by Malcolm Chisholm, with which other public bodies, including UK Government departments, it is negotiating to develop framework agreements with a view to securing transfers of surplus land for affordable housing in areas where particular need has been identified; what stage negotiations have reached with each such body, and whether any body, including UK Government departments, approached in this connection has declined to conclude any framework agreement.</p>

  <p>The Executive and Communities Scotland are engaged in discussion with a number of public bodies and agencies about the use of surplus public sector land across Scotland for affordable housing. A national agreement is in place with Forestry Commission Scotland and we are currently pursuing discussions that seek to extend to Scotland an agreement that exists between English Partnerships and Defence Estates. Local agreements are also proving successful in some areas in delivering suitable land, such as the arrangement I announced on 13 March which sees former Ministry of Defence properties in Elgin being acquired for affordable housing. We intend to build on such arrangements and extend them to other areas wherever possible. We are, for instance, looking at ways to facilitate local agreements between local authorities and health boards. Our Regeneration Statement published earlier this month commits us to maximise the regeneration potential of public sector land and we will continue to examine all opportunities to secure more land for affordable housing in our most pressured areas. We are also streamlining the system that identifies surplus public sector sites and encouraging its use by a wider range of public bodies.</p>

  <p>No public bodies have declined to conclude framework agreements.</p>

  <p>In response to a query from a relative of a resident of a Viewpoint sheltered housing development, officials have been advised that, following consultation with tenants in February 2006, the association is reviewing the provision to meals in its developments. It is understood that the number of residents requesting meals had fallen and the association was incurring a substantial deficit. The association is now considering alternative arrangements with relevant local authorities and with private companies which provide meals that can be delivered to the tenant. The association also plans to upgrade some studio apartments to provide improved cooking facilities.</p>

  <p>It is not my intention to make the MacLeod reports public. They were commissioned by the Executive as part of its defence of the civil action brought by Shirley McKie. Publication of the MacLeod reports would undermine the basic principle of Scots law that neither party to a litigation is obliged to disclose reports commissioned for the purpose of the litigation. The Scottish Executive has commissioned one further report as part of its defence of the civil action which will not be published for the same reason. The Lord Advocate also commissioned reports in the course of criminal investigations linked to the Shirley McKie case. The Lord Advocate does not intend to publish these reports as they were prepared for the purposes of criminal investigations and as such are confidential.</p>

  <p>No. I am very concerned about the apparent leaking of part of the report by Tayside Police into the Shirley McKie case.</p>

  <p>The report is a confidential police report and relates to an investigation into allegations of criminal conduct by a number of individuals. The leaking of the report is a breach of the duties of confidentiality owed to the Crown and may involve contravention of the Data Protection Act.</p>

  <p>These legal obligations are put in place to protect individuals who are the subject of such reports, to enable the investigation, detection and prosecution of crime to function effectively, to enable witnesses to give statements confidentially and to allow police officers to make reports secure in the knowledge that they will not subsequently be made public.</p>

  <p>Where allegations of criminal conduct are made by a state against a citizen they should only be made in a court of law or other forum where the evidence can be tested and the rights of the citizen protected. The apparent leaking of the report has infringed the rights of individual citizens and subjected them to trial by media.</p>

  <p>I believe that it is a matter of grave concern that the protections which are afforded by law to the persons who were the subject of the report have been ignored.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally. The majority of funding for the music industry by the Executive is routed through the Enterprise Networks, the Scottish Funding Council and the Scottish Arts Council. The Executive does not hold details of their expenditure as this is an operational matter for them. In addition, other Executive Departments have, in this period, provided substantial funding towards various music initiatives. Examples of these are:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>The Health Department&rsquo;s National Programme for Improving Mental Health and Well-being funding to the Scottish Association for Mental Health (SAMH) to fund the <em>One in Four</em> booklet and music CD, plus an associated festival to promote its message, and</p>
<p>The Environment and Rural Affairs Department&rsquo;s Rural Challenge Fund funding for local initiatives to bring music and other cultural opportunities to rural communities, with particular emphasis on enabling young people to access facilities and events.</p>

  <p>Lanarkshire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust received &pound;2.7 million from the Capital Modernisation Fund for the upgrade of the accident and emergency department at Monklands Hospital in 2002. However, in 2002-03 the basis of funding capital expenditure changed from being a project by project bidding request to the Health Department to a system where NHS boards are given a single allocation based on an agreed formula. The application of this capital resource is prioritised by NHS boards themselves, having regard to national, regional and local priorities.</p>

  <p>NHS Lanarkshire received formula capital allocations of &pound;11.67 million in 2002-03, &pound;15.92 million in 2003-04, &pound;17.571 million in 2004-05, &pound;19.703 million in 2005-06 and &pound;23.644 million in 2006-07.

  <p>The final cost of implementing Agenda for Change on a board by board basis will not be known until such times as staff have gone though the job evaluation process and are assimilated to the new Agenda for Change pay bands.</p>

  <p>In terms of NHSScotland overall, the anticipated cost pressures associated with Agenda for Change were reported in <em>The Scottish Executive: Draft Budget</em> <em>2006-07</em>.

  <p>The Scottish Executive previously made available a total of &pound;3.5 million towards the administrative costs of Agenda for Change.

There are currently no plans to issue further dedicated funding to assist boards in implementing Agenda for Change.</p>

  <p>Agenda for Change is being implemented in partnership with trade unions and professional organisations in NHSScotland, and significant progress has been made. Just under 90% of posts which have been submitted to matching panels have been matched against national profiles. Around 67,000 staff in the nursing, midwifery, ancillary and AHP staff groups have been approved for assimilation to the new Agenda for Change pay bands, and the first groups of staff were paid on those new pay bands in January.</p>

  <p>A number of boards have completed the matching process for all staff who match national job profiles. However, not all of these staff have passed through the local consistency and national monitoring processes, which is required before assimilation to the new pay bands can take place.</p>

  <p>A plan for 2006 has been drawn up and agreed in partnership, which health boards are committed to delivering. Based on the plan it is anticipated that Agenda for Change will be introduced and operational by the end of 2006, with all staff assimilated to the new pay bands by October 2006.</p>

  <p>The Pay Modernisation Team, alongside the Scottish Executive Health Department, will monitor progress towards the plan for 2006, providing health boards with support and advice as necessary.</p>

  <p>The Executive expects the Big Lottery Fund to announce its new programmes for Scotland in the spring, which will bring a further &pound;257 million to Scotland between 2006&ndash;09.</p>

  <p>The continuation or closure of existing programmes of the New Opportunities Fund is a matter for the fund. Ministers set the strategic framework for lottery bodies, but operational matters and programme design are a matter for the lottery distributors themselves.</p>

  <p>Implementation of the standards in <em>A Scottish Framework for Nursing in Schools</em> is being undertaken locally by NHS boards. It is being done in co-operation with partner organisations such as Education Authorities, Community Health Partnerships and a wide range of health and educational professionals. Implementation is also being undertaken alongside the roll out of the New Community Schools approach.</p>

  <p>The Executive is monitoring the implementation of the standards. The majority of NHS boards across Scotland have made considerable progress in implementing the standards. Full implementation is expected to be achieved by 2007.</p>

  <p>The Executive believes that it is important to develop integrated teams matching the appropriate professional skill with the identified health need. For example, in some cases, it may be more appropriate to involve members from the health promotion team or other health professional, rather than a school nurse, in health education of children.</p>

  <p>Improvements in the health of children and young people can only be achieved by many professionals and agencies working in partnership with one another and with children, young people and their families.</p>

  <p>An option to introduce a half-hourly rail service between Motherwell and Stirling is included in the First ScotRail franchise. However, before such a service can be introduced track capacity issues on the route require to be resolved, which are the subject of current study through Network Rail&rsquo;s Route Utilisation Strategy. This is due to report by the autumn of 2006.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive awarded Falkirk Council &pound;450,000 from the Public Transport Fund to undertake a feasibility study to improve rail services along the A80/M80 corridor, including opening a station and park and ride site at Castlecary (now called Allandale). The study concluded in February 2006 and Transport Scotland is assessing the findings of the report.</p>

  <p>The investigation and prosecution of crime is a matter for the police, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service and the Lord Advocate. If there is credible and reliable information that a crime has been, or is to be committed, it is for the police to investigate. If they secure sufficient evidence for consideration of criminal proceedings, the police will report the result of their investigation to the procurator fiscal. If anyone has specific information concerning criminal activities which have taken place, are taking place, or are about to take place they should take that information to the police.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive why the cost of the new A8000 to M9 link road has risen from an estimated &pound;15.15 million, excluding VAT, identified in the 1999 strategic roads review, to &pound;35.6 million in 2005.</p>

  <p>The cost of A8000 upgrade was estimated in the Strategic Roads Review by the then Scottish Office at &pound;15.15 million excluding VAT, at 1998 prices. Responsibility for taking the project forward since that time, and for later estimates of costs, lies with the City of Edinburgh Council. The council&rsquo;s recent price estimates take account of more detailed design work, ground consolidation requirements and the upgrading of the original design to motorway standards, as well as price inflation since 1998.</p>

  <p>The Futurebuilders Scotland Fund has provided funding to support the development of the social economy sector which includes social enterprises.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers have committed to developing a specific strategy for social enterprise in Scotland.

  <p>In presenting statistics on suicides it is conventional to combine deaths classified as intentional self-harm (suicides) with those classified as events of undetermined intent. This is because the majority of the latter are likely to have been suicides. However, this assumption is known to be less valid for children, particularly those aged under 10. For this reason the following table shows the two categories separately and restricts the information on events of undetermined intent to deaths aged 10 to 17.</p>

  <p>Ministers established the &pound;13 million Scottish Strategic Timber Transport Fund to help pay for timber transport infrastructure projects which will benefit local communities and the environment. Forestry Commission Scotland has since been working with officials from the European Commission, and the Timber Transport Forum, to ensure that the scheme to disburse monies from the Fund complies with EC requirements.</p>

  <p>Forestry Commission Scotland has just this week received the go-ahead from the EC, and is now taking account of recommendations from the Timber Transport Forum which has been considering some initial project applications.

  <p>We do consider that the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman has sufficient resources to undertake her statutory functions. As part of the budgetary process, the SPCB invites the Ombudsman on an annual basis to prepare a budget submission which is scrutinised by the SPCB and which may include discussions between the SPCB and the Ombudsman prior to the bid being reported to the Finance Committee as part of the SPCB&rsquo;s overall budget submission.</p>
