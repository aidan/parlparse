  <p>Allan Wilson and Ben Bradshaw attended the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Luxembourg on 26 April 2004.</p>

  <p>On agriculture, after several hours of talks, the Irish Presidency concluded that it was not possible to identify a compromise proposal on the welfare of animals during transport which would command the support of a qualified majority of member states, and so the meeting concluded without agreement on that dossier. There are no plans to resume discussion of it. This outcome was disappointing for the UK Government, which had supported the Presidency&#8217;s efforts to find a compromise which represented a genuine improvement in animal welfare over the current rules.</p>

  <p>On the approvals process for genetically modified organisms, there was no qualified majority of member states, either in favour of or against, the approval of sweetcorn from Bt11 maize for consumption in the EU. Under the rules of procedure for such approvals, the Commission is now able to take a decision under its own responsibility from 1 May.</p>

  <p>Denmark reported on measures it has taken in response to dioxin levels in salmon fished in the Baltic Sea. Slovakia and Poland raised concerns about the rules on the carry-over of agricultural stocks on enlargement, which are designed to prevent speculation but which they consider to be over-bureaucratic. In response to a request from Denmark and Austria, the Commission indicated that it would bring forward a proposal within the next few weeks on thresholds for the adventitious presence of genetically modified material in seeds.</p>

  <p>No items of fisheries business were discussed.</p>

  <p>The Disclosures issued by Disclosure Scotland record the criminal record status of the applicant at the point in time the disclosure was produced. Standard and Enhanced Disclosures relate to specific types of post, namely those posts excluded by law from the provisions of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act. Additionally, Enhanced Disclosures relate to posts which involve regularly caring for, training, supervising or being in sole charge of children or vulnerable adults. The question of the validity of disclosures in relation to changes in employer has to be seen in this context.</p>

  <p>The report is published on 14 May 2004 and distributed to a wide range of interested groups and individuals as well as to every headteacher in Scotland. Copies are available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 32612) I am pleased with their broad conclusion which offers schools more flexibility, and I would encourage schools to consider how they can respond positively, adopting the approaches within the report. I believe these approaches can be achieved successfully within a broadly Christian community. I intend to commission Learning and Teaching Scotland to develop support materials with schools and to do this in discussion with key organisations. A revised circular will be developed and issued to schools in due course.</p>

This work has been carried out by four agencies: Union Advertising, Barkers Advertising, TNS System 3 and Corporate Edge.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the benchmark for non-completion of courses is for each university in each year, and has been for which figures are available, and what it will do to reduce non-completion rates.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2004-05-17.S2W-7715.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80123" speakername="Mr Jim Wallace" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-04/wa0517.htm#6">

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not set benchmarks for non-completion either for the sector as a whole or for individual institutions. However, the performance indicators published annually by the funding councils include calculations of benchmark figures for individual institutions on a range of measures, including for new entrants whose projected outcome at the end of their first year was neither an award nor a transfer to another higher education institute (HEI).</p>

  <p>The table shows the benchmark percentage per institution. The benchmark represents only the expected performance of each institution based on average actual performance across the sector, after taking account of some of the factors which contribute to the differences between institutions such as subjects of study available and the age and previous qualifications of entrants. The performance indicators, and their associated benchmarks, are not targets. They simply contribute to the range of information which is gathered on our HEIs and their students.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Higher Education Funding Council (SHEFC) introduced its Widening Access Premium in 2001-02. The premium is to support institutions in improving the retention and progression of students from under-represented areas. In 2004-05, SHEFC will allocate over &#163;5 million through the Widening Access Premium.</p>

  <p>We are at present working with the representative bodies in the sector and the funding council to set new sector-wide targets for improvement in access from the most economically disadvantaged groups and for the retention of students of all backgrounds, and will monitor performance against these.</p>

  <p>We are also supporting initiatives which will help those entering higher education to choose the most relevant course for them, and which will improve the quality of the student experience, both of which should have a positive impact on retention. To this end, we will improve the quality and consistency of information for all learners to ensure that they have a seamless service incorporating the provision of information and guidance. We are encouraging the development of more creative and flexible provision which recognises and responds to diverse needs. We are also supporting the new quality enhancement arrangements, under which HEIs will be expected to demonstrate that they have clear, well-managed strategies for promoting constant quality improvement across all aspects of learning and teaching. The Executive particularly welcomes the close involvement of students&#8217; representatives in designing and implementing this new system, and the recognition in the new arrangements of the importance of the overall quality of the student experience.</p>

  <p>The SPCB has no plans to commemorate the Centenary of Norway&#8217;s independence on 17 May 2005.</p>

  <p>It is open to members to propose a motion to mark the Centenary if they choose to do so.</p>
