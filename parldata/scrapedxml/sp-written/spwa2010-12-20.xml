  <p>The Scottish Government recognises the importance of foster care within the wider care sector and the critical role played by Scotland&rsquo;s foster carers. We have continued to fund national third sector organisations that support foster carers and promote the development of foster care and we are fully protecting funding for 2011-12.</p>

  <p>Additional financial support is provided to the fostering network to promote the recruitment and retention of foster carers. In particular, we have, since October 2008, funded a project that aims to build on the good practice already in place between fostering services. The project&rsquo;s current phase of work is intended to develop joint working and sharing of resources between authorities, particularly in relation to assessment, training and support for foster carers.</p>

  <p>NHS staff, ranging from cleaners to highly paid consultants, have benefitted financially from a sustained period of pay modernisation that includes the introduction of Agenda for Change for non-medical staff in 2004, the new consultant contract in 2004 and the new contract for staff grade and associate specialist doctors in 2008.</p>

  <p>This modernisation has ensured that staff receives equal pay for work of equal value; introduced standard terms and conditions, and facilitated new ways of working to take account of changing clinical practices. More recently, the Scottish Government has made clear its intention to make sure public sector pay settlements are tightly constrained in the current financial climate and remain affordable and sustainable. This is demonstrated by our public sector pay policy that has introduced a pay freeze for all staff earning less than &pound;21,000 per annum in 2011-12.</p>

  <p>The majority of the resources of the NHS in Scotland are allocated using the NHSScotland Resource Allocation Committee (NRAC) formula. This shows the target allocations to the territorial NHS boards in order to help deliver equal access to high quality healthcare according to the relative needs of their populations. Information on the latest NRAC formula target allocations is published at <a href="http://www.isdscotland.org/isd/5785.html" target="_blank">http://www.isdscotland.org/isd/5785.html</a></p>

  <p>Decisions on how NHS boards can best allocate their resources within each board area are made by NHS boards, taking into account local and national priorities, including the ambitions set out in the Healthcare Quality Strategy. Details of the quality strategy are available at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/NHS-Scotland/NHSQuality" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/NHS-Scotland/NHSQuality</a>.</p>

  <p>When Scottish ministers or a reporter from the Directorate for Planning and Environmental Appeals (DPEA) issue a decision on a planning application or appeal it should not be for more than was originally applied for to the planning authority, as this would generally be considered a material difference to the proposed development. Changes to planning legislation that came into effect in August 2009 make it clear that a development proposal cannot be varied on appeal. It is, however, open for an applicant to submit a fresh planning application seeking a larger number of houses on a site that already has planning permission. In these circumstances if the application or appeal came to Scottish ministers or a reporter from DPEA to determine, consent may be granted that has the effect of increasing the number of houses on a site. Scottish ministers do not hold information concerning how many times this may have happened.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-37186 by Alex Neil on the 8 November 2010, whether it will provide an estimated cost for collecting information and statistics regarding the coverage of residual current devices in domestic properties throughout Scotland.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-12-20.S3W-38209.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80370" speakername="Alex Neil" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa1220.htm#3">

  <p>The most appropriate way to collect this information would be through the Scottish House Condition Survey (SHCS).</p>

  <p>The costs relating to adding a question on residual current devices into the SHCS would relate to the preparation, piloting and training for this question. We estimate that it would cost about &pound;4,000 to introduce a question similar to the question included in the equivalent survey in England. The physical form would have to be revised to collect this extra information and may involve dropping or refining current items. The estimated cost also assumes that the time taken to carry out the physical survey will not increase, and so the SHCS surveyors will not get an extra fee for collecting this information. The next available opportunity to add a question on residual current devices into the SHCS would be in 2011 with the question being asked in the 2012 calendar year. The inclusion of a question on residual current devices will have to be balanced against the need for other questions in the survey.</p>

Some sheriff courts will deal with cases from more than one local authority area. 3. The reference year is the date that the person&rsquo;s case was disposed of. Data extracted from the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) database and the Scottish Government Court Proceedings database are not entirely consistent. The COPFS data are charge-based, while the Scottish Government data are persons-based, and while the COPFS data are based on the date that the case was reported to COPFS, the reference year in the Scottish Government data is the date that the person&rsquo;s case was disposed of. In addition, the COPFS data count charges reported to procurator fiscal offices in Dundee and Tayside, while the Scottish Government data use an approximation of persons proceeded against in courts within Dundee and Tayside local authorities.

  <p>It is for local authorities to determine, in consultation with families to whom they provide social work services, what type of services, including family group conferencing and other approaches, best meet their needs. The Scottish Government supports the use of family group conferencing and other supportive interventions, and has funded and published research about the impact of these in recent years.</p>

Family group conferencing has been highlighted in strategy documents and guidance, for example, in the guidance on the <em>Looked After Children (Scotland) Regulations 2009 and Adoption and Children (Scotland) Act 2007</em> published in June 2010.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government Resilience Room was activated on 25 November 2010 and has been liaising on a daily basis with the various agencies involved in responding to the consequences of the cold weather conditions, including the police forces. The resilience room remains active to co-ordinate the multi-agency effort to tackle the consequences of the weather conditions and is open 24/7.</p>

  <p>The Cabinet Sub-Committee on Scottish Government Resilience (Severe Weather) (CSC-SGoR) has met and discussed the 2010-11 winter conditions daily since 24 November 2010. There have been 23 CSC-SGoR meetings from 24 November 2010 to 15 December 2010 (inclusive). There have also been 15 ministerial resilience meetings with external organisations during this time. The CSC-SGoR meetings have been attended by ministers, officials and representatives of external organisations, representatives of Scotland&rsquo;s police forces and the strategic co-ordinating groups established under the Civil Contingencies Act 2004.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is in regular dialogue with Age Scotland, WRVS and other organisations that represent the interests of older people. Age Concern were one of the many key stakeholders contacted over the last few weeks to check what additional help could be given in communicating advice given the severe weather conditions.</p>
