  <p>Amey Infrastructure Services took over full inspection, management and maintenance responsibility for the bridge, as part of the trunk road network, when tolls were abolished on 1 April 2006. Decisions to close the bridge, solely for the safety of users, are taken in accordance with the severe weather procedures laid down in the Bridge Operations Manual. Amey receive Met Office five-day and 24-hour weather forecasts, specific to the Erskine area. When severe conditions are forecast these are supplemented by immediate &quot;Storm&quot; or &quot;Gale&quot; warnings to which Amey have the facility to seek &quot;real time&quot; updates. An anemometer located on the bridge deck transmits continuous wind-speed data to Amey&rsquo;s Operational Control Room. Amey&rsquo;s engineering and meteorological assessments are then subject to liaison with Strathclyde Police. The outcome may be a formal decision to close the bridge, wholly or in part, under the authority of the Chief Constable. Agreed wind-speed thresholds are 45mph for crosswinds and 60mph for head/tail winds.</p>

  <p>The traffic management for the closure process takes nearly two hours to implement fully and about one hour to remove, with priority given to the immediate approaches then the M8/M898 on the south side of the river. The police, Traffic Scotland and media are advised when a closure is imminent and when it is expected to be lifted and are regularly updated where an incident may be protracted.</p>

  <p>The criteria for weather-related closures have not changed since tolls were removed but new and more accurate wind measuring and data recording equipment became operational from early October 2006. Prior to then, there was no data record of actual wind speeds on the bridge and readings were noted manually from dial gauges showing speed and direction, located in the bridge administration offices. For this reason, no comparison can be made between closures, pre and post abolition of tolls. However, each closure can be directly related to independently documented (Met. Office) records.</p>

  <p>In order to minimise the disruption caused by closures of the bridge, strategic signs on approach routes are being installed. These will include warnings specific to high-sided vehicles which will allow the phased closure to certain classes of vehicles when appropriate.</p>

  <p>For 2007-08, a Grant Aided Expenditure assessment of &pound;44.556 million for the Childcare Strategy, including out-of-school child care was allocated to local authorities.</p>

  <p>We will continue to work in partnership with local government partners to drive forward our child care priorities. For future years, this funding will be included within the overall local government finance settlement. It will be the responsibility of each local authority, in conjunction with their Community Planning Partners, to allocate the funding on the basis of their local needs and priorities &ndash; taking into account their statutory obligations and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities, including the Scottish Government&rsquo;s key strategic objectives and manifesto commitments. Further details on these new arrangements can be found in the Scottish Budget Report and related Concordat with local government. Copies of both documents are available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. numbers 44076 and 44077 respectively).</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally. For the period 2007-08, a Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE) assessment of &pound;44.556 million was made to support the child care strategy, which includes out-of-school care and other forms of child care. Child care strategy GAE is not ring-fenced and therefore local authorities have discretion to vary expenditure to reflect local needs. Expenditure Information received from the local authorities does not include separate data on child care, including out of school child care.</p>

  <p>The Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001 (the act) established the Care Commission to register and inspect all services regulated under the act, including day care of children services. When registering and inspecting services it will take account of national care standards. These include ensuring services have in place an effective system for identifying and monitoring staff development needs.</p>

  <p>The act also established the Scottish Social Services Council (SSSC) as the regulatory body of the social service workforce. In order to register, workers must have, or be working towards specified qualifications for their role.</p>

  <p>The Childcare Strategy aims to ensure that there is sufficient child care available for children in all areas of Scotland. This strategy remains in place and will continue to support child care, including out-of-school care. In addition, the Early Years Strategy, to be developed jointly with local government partners and other interests, will cover pre-birth to age eight years and the majority of out-of-school services will therefore fall within its scope.</p>

  <p>A rolling programme of events and activities for Homecoming Scotland is currently being worked up by the Homecoming Scotland team and potential partner organisations. As the programme develops, information will be released, but the spring 2008 target for a full Homecoming programme will ensure that the Homecoming Scotland team will meet deadlines to deliver the message to the international market. The marketing campaign for Homecoming Scotland will gain momentum from Burns Night 2008.</p>

  <p>The eight strategic coordinating groups across Scotland have a crucial role to play in ensuring that the duties imposed by the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 are taken forward in their areas. The Scottish Government is committed to providing appropriate support to enable the groups to effectively co-ordinate the work of responders, including police, fire, health, local authority and other organisations. The Scottish Government will therefore continue to fund co-ordinator posts in each of the eight strategic co-ordinating group areas for the next three financial years.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to encouraging energy efficiency and energy conservation and supports a number of measures to achieve these aims.</p>

  <p>It intends to continue and improve programmes delivered under the previous administration, including: support provided by the Carbon Trust and the Energy Saving Trust across the domestic, public and business sectors; the energy efficiency fund for the public sector; the interest-free loan scheme for small and medium-sized enterprises; the fuel poverty programmes and revisions to the Scottish Building Standards.</p>

  <p>Over and above this work, specific new measures include:</p>

  <p>The introduction of a one-stop shop for domestic and small business consumers in Scotland covering energy efficiency, renewables and transport advice. The new network of advice centres will go live from April 2008 and will deliver a more strategic approach to customer engagement and will have more challenging targets: to reach three times as many customers and deliver a four-fold increase in carbon emission reductions compared to existing performance.</p>

  <p>Work to develop a strategy for attracting more funding and benefits in to Scotland from the UK Government&rsquo;s Energy Efficiency Commitment (EEC). An EEC Strategy Manager was appointed in August 2007 (based within the Energy Saving Trust) and their key role is to develop a more strategic and integrated approach to take-up.</p>

  <p>The establishment of an Expert Panel in August 2007 to advise the Scottish Government on a Low Carbon Building Standards Strategy. The key objective is to move construction of new buildings, including housing, to the rigorous energy performance levels imposed in Scandinavia. The panel&rsquo;s report will be published before the end of the year.</p>

  <p>Additionally, the Scottish Government wants to ensure that it has in place the right incentives to encourage energy efficiency. It is currently considering the results and recommendations of a recently commissioned independent review of energy efficiency support. This will help to inform future action for improving, simplifying and streamlining delivery whilst ensuring that support is effectively targeted.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will also be consulting on proposals to introduce a Scottish Climate Change Bill, which will set a mandatory target of cutting emissions by 80% by 2050. Discussions have already taken place with a number of key stakeholders from business, non-governmental organisations, public sector and research to discuss potential policy proposals and the consultation will seek views on further incentives to encourage energy efficiency. The Scottish Government intends to launch a public consultation on the bill in January.</p>

  <p>The planned budget for Highlands and Islands Enterprise is publicly presented in its Operating Plan which is issued annually. Its actual total expenditure is reported each year publicly through its Annual Report and Annual Accounts. Copies of these documents for 2005-06 and 2006-07 are available through the Highlands and Islands Enterprise website at <a href="http://www.hie.co.uk" target="_blank">www.hie.co.uk</a> .</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s Grant in Aid contribution is the major but not sole element of Highlands and Islands Enterprise&rsquo;s gross budget. For 2007-08 there has been an in-year adjustment to Highlands and Islands Enterprise&rsquo;s Grant in Aid allocation following the Autumn Budget Revisions. This increased the Grant in Aid budget by &pound;8.765 million from &pound;88.979 million to &pound;97.744 million.</p>

Where severances are being considered then under the terms of HIE&rsquo;s management statement, departmental approval must be sought.

  <p>The Scottish Government will be issuing a consultation in January on proposals for the Climate Change Bill which will include a target of reducing emissions by 80% by 2050. Whether the target will be based on a basket of greenhouse gases, or carbon dioxide emissions alone, will be decided after the public consultation.</p>

  <p>We are currently undertaking research to identify a range of options for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Scotland, including emissions from non-carbon dioxide gases. Measures already being taken forward that are expected to reduce non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gas emissions include our commitment to a Zero Waste fund that will support a number of measures such as waste prevention, community sector recycling, waste awareness and provision of advice and support for local authority recycling initiatives. In addition, we are funding initiatives by farmers and other stakeholders in the rural community to reduce climate change emissions from land management practices and to manage our rural environment more effectively, through the &pound;1.6 billion Rural Development Programme.</p>

  <p>The current road equivalent tariff (RET) study will provide an initial analysis of the potential impacts, especially in economic and social terms, of the introduction of the RET approach. The impact on local business will also be monitored during the pilot phase of the study. The third and final phase of the RET study will involve an evaluation of the pilot, making use of the information gathered through the baseline and monitoring exercises. In addition to assessing the impact of the pilot, the evaluation will attempt, as far as is possible, to quantify both the costs and benefits to residents and businesses which would arise should RET be applied on a permanent basis and rolled out to other ferry routes in the Clyde and Hebrides and Northern Isles networks. This evaluation will also consider the likely longer-term impacts of such a roll out.</p>

  <p>Capacity considerations is one of the issues the consultants engaged on the road equivalent tariff (RET) study have been asked to consider. The study will seek to identify any capacity constraints that would emerge during the pilot and from any permanent roll out of the RET approach. The consultants have been asked to quantify the cost of increasing the capacity to meet demand, through additional or larger vessels and new shore infrastructure.</p>

  <p>We want to achieve a simpler, more effective public sector for Scotland, which is good for Scotland's competitiveness and overall economic performance. Our focus is on getting rid of duplication, simplifying structures and stopping activities that do not contribute to the Government&rsquo;s objectives, to free Scotland&rsquo;s public servants to provide the services people need.</p>

  <p>We will look for efficiencies that are sustainable and have ruled out compulsory redundancies. Where our changes mean integrated or shared services, I would expect savings to be made.

The SLC protects the passenger&rsquo;s interest by specifying the frequency of service, early service, late service, calling patterns and maximum journey time for each route.

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to encouraging greater uptake of community renewables and microgeneration as demonstrated by the commitment to triple funding for community and microgeneration in our spending review.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government wants to ensure that, going forward, the support we provide for community and microgeneration achieves the best value for money, maximises carbon savings, whilst at the same time provides the right conditions for stimulating and transforming the market for microgeneration technologies. Work is currently underway to ascertain how future support will be targeted and I will announce plans early in the new year.</p>

  <p>As part of our commitment to introduce carbon impact assessments for policy options, we will aim to identify and quantify the likely carbon savings that will result from increasing spending on community and microgeneration.</p>

  <p>Local authorities, as Category 1 responders under the Civil Contingencies Act 2004, have a responsibility to assess the risk of emergencies occurring, and to use this to inform contingency planning. North Ayrshire Council believe their plans in this regard are robust and sufficient.</p>

  <p>For example, I understand that should severe weather, or any other reason, stop fuel getting to Arran, there is normally sufficient stock held at the Scottish Fuels depot in Brodick to last up to eight weeks. North Ayrshire Council also has substantial fuel storage facilities on the island.</p>

  <p>Under the concordat agreed between Scottish ministers and COSLA, the ring fence around the Cities Growth Fund will be removed from 1 April 2008, with the funding being absorbed into the main local government settlement.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will be providing local government in Scotland with record levels of funding over the period covered by the spending review 2008-11. The vast majority of the funding, including the funding previously provided from the Cities Growth Fund, will be provided by means of a block grant. It is the responsibility of each local authority to allocate the total financial resources available to it on the basis of local needs and priorities, having first fulfilled its statutory obligations and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities including the Scottish Government&rsquo;s key strategic objectives and manifesto commitments.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-5931 by Stewart Stevenson on 12 November 2007, what the projected traffic growth is for the two stretches of road from 2004 to 2014.</p>

  <p>The traffic growth rate between Mollinsburn to Auchenkilns is expected to be approximately 2.9% per annum, and at a rate of 2.3% per annum between Auchenkilns to Haggs. These rates of growth are based on projections to the year 2025 using local transport models that utilise estimates based on a national strategic model.</p>

  <p>Our decisions in the Scottish Budget recognise the existing contribution of third sector organisations, including voluntary and volunteer-involving organisations, and the potential for their entrepreneurial dynamism to contribute to transformational change across the Scottish Government&rsquo;s five strategic objectives. We fully recognise the vital role of individual volunteers. Over &pound;93 million is being invested in the third sector during the Spending Period and discussions on how organisations will be able to access these funds will begin shortly.</p>
