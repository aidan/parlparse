  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Net Farm Income (NFI) represents the return to the farmer and spouse for their manual and managerial labour and has been calculated on a tenant-type farming basis. As the majority of farms in Scotland are owner-occupied, NFI estimates ought to be treated with some caution as they do not represent all the income of owner-occupied farms.</p>

  <p>2. NFI results, which are generated from the Farm Accounts Survey, are representative of eight main farm types in Scotland. They do not include incomes from farm types such as pigs, poultry or horticulture.</p>

  <p>3. NFI results are only representative of farms in Scotland above an economic size threshold of 0.5 standard labour requirements.</p>

  <p>4. Methodological improvements were introduced to NFI estimates in 2002-03, so there may be a slight break in the NFI series in this period.</p>

  <p>There are two main sources of information on farm incomes :</p>

  <p>The Farm Accounts Survey provides results on average farm incomes at the national level, however the sample size of 460 farms is insufficient to provide reliable or representative results at the local authority level.</p>

  <p>The Total Income From Farming (TIFF) measure is compiled at a national level using a range of national data sources, as such TIFF estimates are not produced at a local authority level.</p>

  <p>The School Dental Service no longer exists.</p>

  <p>A limited range of functions of the former School Dental Service was transferred to the Community Dental Service in the 1970s and increasingly in recent years, the Salaried General Dental Service has taken on the dental care of patients previously treated by both the School and Community Dental Service.</p>

  <p>Two Inshore Fisheries Groups (IFGs)- the Hebrides Inshore Fisheries Group and the South East Scotland Inshore Fisheries Group - are presently active on a shadow basis. The second meeting of the shadow Executive Committee of the Hebridean Group will be held on 3 November. Discussions have begun in a number of other localities to prepare the way for establishing the next tranche of groups.</p>

  <p>Progress on establishing IFGs has not been as rapid as we would have hoped. A key factor has been difficulties with the appointment of IFG co-ordinators. But we are addressing the outstanding difficulties as a matter of urgency. We hope to be able to report progress to the next meeting of the Scottish Inshore Fisheries Advisory Group later in the autumn.</p>

  <p>Following the patient&rsquo;s absconcion in May 2006 from Ailsa Hospital, an investigation into the circumstances were undertaken. As a consequence a number of recommendations were made covering areas such as: the ward function, environment, and policies and procedures. The recommendations are being implemented and monitored through a supporting action plan.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will publish the risk management plan in relation to the care of Mark Biggley, a restricted patient at Ailsa Hospital, and indicate (a) who should have been involved in meetings to agree the plan and (b) whether the plan was followed by the responsible medical officer.</p>

  <p>Patient confidentiality precludes the disclosure of the risk management plan which contains clinical information.</p>

  <p>A risk management plan is normally prepared by the multi-disciplinary team which may include a Responsible Medical Officer, psychologist, social worker, nursing, and occupational therapist. The Scottish Executive, housing officials and the police may be invited to contribute to the risk assessment process if appropriate</p>

  <p>The Critical Incident Review being carried out by NHS Ayrshire and Arran will consider whether the plan was followed. Separately, we have appointed an inquiry panel to look at the robustness of the risk management plan, the lessons learned from the CIR following the abscond in May, and the decisions and events that led to the abscond and report to the Executive.</p>
