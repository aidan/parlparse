  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-39037 on 9 February 2011. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at:</p>

  <p><a href="../../../Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx</a>.</p>

  <p>Currently there is not 100% compliance for the submission of SMR25 forms in all statutory drug services, (b) all voluntary drug services, (c) the Scottish Prison Service and (d) all general practices.</p>

  <p>Statutory (includes all NHS and Local Authority Services) and Voluntary Drug Treatment Services:</p>

  <p>SMR25a forms are received from all statutory and voluntary drug treatment services in Scotland. Approximately 70% of these SMR25a submissions are completed electronically.</p>

  <p>In Greater Glasgow and Clyde and Aberdeen City approximately 65% and 75% respectively of statutory and voluntary drug treatment services currently submit SMR25a forms electronically to ISD Scotland.</p>

  <p>Outwith Greater Glasgow and Clyde and Aberdeen City, approximately 95% of statutory and voluntary drug treatment services currently submit SMR25a forms electronically to ISD.</p>

  <p>SMR25b forms are only submitted (electronically) by services who are also submitting electronic SMR25a forms. The vast majority of services that are submitting SMR25a forms electronically are also submitting SMR25b forms.</p>

  <p>ISD is working with data providers throughout Scotland to ensure that, as soon as possible, all services that provide a &quot;comprehensive or specialist assessment of a client&rsquo;s care/treatment needs in relation to drug misuse&quot; are submitting electronic SMR25a and SMR25b forms to ISD Scotland.</p>

  <p>Prisons:</p>

  <p>Since 1 April 2010, drug treatment services within all 13 publicly funded Scottish prisons make electronic SMR25a and SMR25b submissions. At present, the two private prisons in Scotland do not currently submit any SMR25a or SMR25b data to ISD.</p>

  <p>ISD will shortly be engaging with the drug treatment services in the two private prisons with the aim of reaching a point where they are submitting SMR25a and SMR25b data electronically.</p>

  <p>Primary Care Providers (including GPs):</p>

  <p>SMR25a paper form submissions are received from a limited number of primary care providers. No electronic SMR25a or SMR25b submissions are received from primary care providers.</p>

  <p>ISD will shortly be following up its initial contact with GPs with the aim of reaching a point where all relevant GPs are submitting SMR25a paper forms to ISD. After this has been achieved ISD will work with these GPs with the aim of reaching a point where they are all submitting SMR25a and SMR25b data electronically.</p>

  <p>Decisions on the future of Gaelic medium education in Edinburgh are for the City of Edinburgh Council. The Scottish Government recognises that there is strong support for a Gaelic school in Edinburgh from parents, from B&ograve;rd na G&agrave;idhlig, from other Gaelic interests and in an independent study commissioned by the council.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has supported Gaelic medium education in Edinburgh for many years with additional running cost support. In the course of this financial year the Scottish Government indicated that we would be keen to support the City of Edinburgh Council with capital support towards a Gaelic school and a specific offer was made in November and December 2010. This offer was limited to 2010-11. There will be a Gaelic Schools Capital Budget in 2011-12 and if required consideration can be given to support for the establishment of a Gaelic school in Edinburgh at that time.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government attaches a high priority to Gaelic teacher education. I have written to the Scottish Funding Council outlining that I wish to see the council continue to promote provision in this area, continue to pursue new avenues to increase the numbers of Gaelic teachers and to give consideration to initiatives which could improve effectiveness.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Government has provided financial support for the retention of a Gaelic Teacher Recruitment Officer who is based at B&ograve;rd na G&agrave;idhlig and is responsible for promoting the recruitment and education of Gaelic teachers.</p>

  <p>Yes. We believe that our children and young people&rsquo;s learning experiences can be enhanced by maximising the potential of the outdoors. To help achieve this, we invested in the production and promotion of guidance in the form of curriculum for excellence through outdoor learning to support opportunities presented by the new school curriculum for learning in the outdoors. The guidance makes it clear that the outdoor environment offers motivating, exciting, different, relevant and easily accessible activities from pre-school years through to college. In addition, we have allocated more than &pound;800,000 to support various initiatives to encourage the use of the outdoor environment to help deliver Curriculum for Excellence for all children and young people.</p>

  <p>Feedback from events to promote curriculum for excellence through outdoor learning emphasised that access to good quality continuous professional development opportunities is key to embedding outdoor learning in learning and teaching. While it is the responsibility of individual teachers, schools and local authorities to ensure access to appropriate continuing professional development (CPD) opportunities, we allocated funding of &pound;100,000 in 2010-11 to enable Learning and Teaching Scotland to develop and deliver a CPD programme for teachers and early years practitioners. Currently, more than 730 teachers and practitioners have registered for the 51 sessions on offer. In addition the curriculum for excellence through outdoor learning online resource provides easy to navigate advice, guidance and examples of practice and resources to provide ideas and inspiration for learning in the outdoors.</p>

  <p>Yes. We believe that the support we are providing through Learning and Teaching Scotland as noted in the answers to questions S3W-39689, S3W-39690 and S3W-39693 on 4 March 2011 is helping to build the confidence and competence of teachers to make effective use of the outdoors. This is reinforced through very positive feedback from the continuing professional development events.</p>

  <p>We are committed to our children and young people having positive, sustainable and progressive opportunities to participate in a range of outdoor learning experiences. To achieve this it is imperative that the momentum and interest generated by curriculum for excellence through outdoor learning is maintained and built upon. The Outdoor Learning Implementation Group and National Network referred to in the answer to question S3W-39693 on 4 March 2011 will play key roles in taking outdoor learning forward but individual teachers, educational settings and local authorities must work together to embed the use of the outdoors in learning and teaching to provide powerful learning experiences.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government allocated &pound;300,000 in 2010-11 to Learning and Teaching Scotland (LTS) to support the implementation of curriculum for excellence through outdoor learning. This enabled LTS to: deliver a series of six regional events to raise awareness of curriculum for excellence through outdoor learning <em> </em> and to consider implementation issues; establish and facilitate the Outdoor Learning Implementation Group to provide a strategic focus to implementation issues; establish and facilitate the Outdoor Learning Network to bring together local authorities and key partner organisations to share the benefits of outdoor learning and to provide national support to local networks; respond positively to feedback from the regional seminars by developing and delivering a continuing professional development (CPD) programme for teachers and early years practitioners.</p>

  <p>HMIE and the Scottish Teacher Education Committee support implementation as members of the Outdoor Learning Implementation Group and teacher education institutes have participated in the CPD programme for the benefit of their students.</p>

  <p>We will continue to provide support for implementation of curriculum for excellence through outdoor learning and we are discussing with Learning and Teaching Scotland and HMIE how this might be best achieved to ensure seamless ongoing support when the new Education Agency comes into being on 1 July 2011.</p>

  <p>I have made an announcement on 4 March 2011 to extend the current support provisions in line with the recently published <em>Contaminated Blood Review</em> report, to:</p>

  <p>Introduce an annual payment of &pound;12,800 for those living with hepatitis C who qualify for Stage 2 payments from the Skipton Fund;</p>

  <p>Allow posthumous clams for support to be made on behalf of people who died before 29 August 2003;</p>

  <p>Increase the one-off payment made to those who qualify for Stage 2 payments from &pound;25,000 to &pound;50,000 (whether the patient is alive or dead);</p>

  <p>Give access to discretionary fund for patients and/or their dependants suffering financial hardship;</p>

  <p>Relevant patients who develop hepatitis C-related B cell lymphoma to be eligible to claim for Stage 2 payment; and</p>

  <p>Increase the annual payment for those with hepatitis C/HIV in line with the consumer price index.</p>

  <p>I understand that patient representatives believe that payments to those in Stage 1 of the illness should also be increased. I am also therefore announcing that this issue, and the implementation of the measures confirmed today, will be reviewed when we consider the final report (and any recommendations) of the Penrose Inquiry.</p>

  <p>The cost of these new provisions is estimated to be around &pound;18 million over the next<br /> five years. Funding for the first year has been earmarked from the health budget for 2011-12 and, thereafter, funding will be provided through future health budgets.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has introduced the new community payback order so that low level offenders will be made to do work in the community backed by action to address the underlying causes which fuel the crime, such as alcohol, drugs and mental health issues, because the evidence shows these sentences are far more effective than those received by the 70% of individuals who are currently reoffending after serving short term prison sentences.</p>

This is an increase of 11% from the previous year. This increase is encouraging as it corresponds with the establishment of the National Sexual Crimes Unit and the approach to the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences in Scotland.

  <p>The Marine (Scotland) Act 2010 does not require Scottish ministers to have regard to any information about non-lethal measures in relation to licences granted under section 110 (1) (f).</p>

  <p>In respect of the single application in relation to fish farms under section 110(1)(g), Marine Scotland undertook no inspections specifically for this purpose.</p>

  <p>Marine Scotland did however, take account of available information on non-lethal measures before granting a licence in consideration of all licences under sections 110(1)(f) and 110(1)(g).</p>

  <p>This included the fact that almost all fish farms seeking a seal licence already employ at least one and many a number of non-lethal measures. The non-lethal measure that is generally accepted to be most effective against seals is tensioned nets and almost all fish farms have such nets installed. In addition to this, almost half of fish farms use acoustic deterrents, a third seal blinds and a fifth anti-predator nets. There are a range of views on the effectiveness of these other measures but none have entirely eliminated the risk of seal predation.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has already achieved the most significant advance in seal protection in 40 years through the introduction of the Marine (Scotland) Act 2010. This has made it an offence to kill any seal at any time unless under licence or to alleviate suffering.</p>

  <p>The number of seals permitted to be killed under licence is significantly less than any of the estimated figures previously offered by NGO&rsquo;s.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. For LMO, case numbers and value are for applications made.</p>

  <p>2. For LFASS, case numbers and value are for payments made. 2010 payments are ongoing.</p>

  <p>The Skills Development Scheme mainly awards grants to national bodies or bodies with a remit beyond a single region. Some of these projects may well benefit or involve Borders farmers, but we have not awarded any grants specifically in the Borders. There were no awards in the Borders under the Crofting Counties Agricultural Grants Scheme.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Resilience Development Service training materials and notes would be of considerable commercial advantage to private sector training providers. It would therefore not be appropriate to publish such material. In addition, the names, organisations and positions along with attendees&rsquo; evaluations could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.

  <p>There are no powers which enable Scottish Natural Heritage to gain access to land to capture beavers where landowners are not willing to give them permission.</p>

  <p>However, The Wildlife and Natural Environment (Scotland) Bill, which was passed on 2 March 2011, introduces a new regime of species control orders that would enable access to land to control invasive non-native animals or plants.</p>

  <p>Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) staff and volunteer trappers have conducted an informal assessment of the trapping sites and use local knowledge of the presence of otters and other protected species prior to making the decision to proceed with trapping. SNH does not conduct beaver trapping within 30 metres of otter holts.</p>

  <p>The licence application by Scottish Wildlife Trust/Royal Zoological Society of Scotland for the Knapdale Trial contains criteria for the success or failure of the beaver trial. If the Knapdale trial is judged successful these criteria could be used to inform the development of wider criteria relating to the possible establishment of beavers in the wild.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers will not only assess the results of the Knapdale Trial, but also take into account other relevant information such as experience from Europe and North America and information from the Beaver-Salmonid Working Group which reports to the National Species Reintroduction Forum.</p>

  <p>The licence application by the Scottish Wildlife Trust/Royal Zoological Society of Scotland contains an exit strategy for implementation during, or at the end, of the trial. The exit strategy contains four options for implementation. These are:</p>

  <p>Option 1: Repatriation of animals to the country of origin/transfer to other reintroduction programmes;</p>

  <p>Option 2: Housing of animals in zoological collections;</p>

  <p>Option 3: Capturing, neutering and returning animals to live their life span in the wild; and</p>

  <p>Option 4: Humane control of animals.</p>
