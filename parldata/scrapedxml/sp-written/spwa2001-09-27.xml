  <p>The Chartered Institute of Housing in Scotland has been commissioned by the Executive to undertake an annual exercise to determine the use being made of anti-social behaviour orders (ASBOs). In the period from 1 April 1999, when ASBOs came into force, to 1 December 1999, some 15 ASBOs had been applied for, of which nine had been granted.</p>

  <p>Figures for the period 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2000 were published in May 2001. They show that the number of ASBOs applied for had risen to 96; 52 of these were granted. The study did not break the figures down by local authority area. Copies of the report, entitled <i>Monitoring the Crime and Disorder Act 1998</i>, have been placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 14116).</p>

  <p>The UK Government in consultation with the Scottish Executive and other devolved administrations has today published a response to the report of the BSE Inquiry. This follows on from the publication of the interim response on 9 February on which a widespread public consultation was carried out. The consultation responses broadly welcomed the actions taken by government and suggested that the interim response was very much on the right lines. I welcome the fact that there were many extremely useful contributions from Scottish consultees, which have been reflected in the response. The document sets out what the Government has done to address the Phillips inquiry&#8217;s findings and conclusions. It also looks forward to further improvements in the near future.</p>

  <p>The Phillips inquiry underlined the importance of contingency planning and for the Government to be open and transparent about risks and uncertainty. This is addressed directly today through the publication of a draft contingency plan against the possibility that in the future BSE might be found in sheep. I welcome this step as part of the overall precautionary strategy in place for managing risk and protecting public health.</p>

  <p>Our policy is that private finance initiative (PFI) should only be used where it represents best value for money. To test for value for money, bids received are compared to a public sector comparator (PSC) which represents an estimate of the whole life cost of procuring of the specified services by conventional means. A study by Arthur Anderson on behalf of HM Treasury showed that average estimated saving against the PSC of the projects examined was 17 per cent.</p>

  <p>In the most recent two years for which cancer registrations are available (1997 and 1998) there were nine cases of breast cancer diagnosed in the Isle of Arran, an average of 4.5 cases per year. This compares with an average of 4.1 cases per year for the previous eight years (1989&#8211;96) when there were 33 cases.</p>

  <p>Available data suggest that incidence for females resident on the Isle of Arran is higher, but not statistically significantly higher, than for Scotland as a whole.</p>

  <p>Local intelligence makes an important contribution to the work of the Scottish Drug Enforcement Agency in tackling drug trafficking and other serious and organised crime. It helps provide a clearer picture of the extent of these activities and their impact on local communities, which in turn enables appropriate action to be taken against those responsible.</p>

  <p>No. The establishment of regional HM Customs and Excise detector dog teams will benefit Scotland. These are highly mobile and flexible units, each trained in a wider range of skills than was previously available in the smaller, local teams. This means that Customs operations in Scotland now have access to dog teams trained not only in illegal drug detection, but also, for example, in tobacco and cash detection.</p>

  <p>Expenditure on administering the Scottish Executive is subject to the same rigorous scrutiny and control as other areas of the budget. Details of the target to contain spending on the administration by the Scottish Executive relative to the total Scottish budget are presented annually to Parliament in the supporting budget documents which accompany the Budget Bill. The latest figures for 2001-02 and the plans for future years show that total spending on administration as a proportion of the total budget is about 1 per cent, the same as in 1997-98.</p>

  <p>In June 2000 the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) indicated that, while Liquid Based Cytology (Thin Prep Pap test) was effective, further evidence was required on the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of the technique and that a programme of pilots should evaluate this. Further information will be available once the pilot studies in England and Scotland have been completed and have been evaluated further by NICE. This is likely to be in 2002-03.</p>

  <p>The funding of individual higher education institutions and colleges of further education in Scotland is a matter for their respective funding councils. For 2001-02, grant-in-aid by the Scottish Executive to the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council (SHEFC) will amount to almost &#163;660 million. Grant-in-aid to the Scottish Further Education Funding Council (SFEFC) for 2001-02 will amount to &#163;410 million.</p>

  <p>This will support modest further growth in the higher education sector, increasing places to 120,700 (full-time equivalent), not including newly designated institutions and Open University places in Scotland, and will allow SHEFC to increase on the units of resource for teaching and research by 4 per cent, the first real terms increase in almost 20 years. The Executive&#8217;s increase in grant-in-aid allocation to SFEFC will support growth in college enrolments to over 460,000.</p>

  <p>Details of grant-in-aid allocated to individual institutions are available from the Scottish funding councils for further and higher education.</p>

  <p>Since April 1996, the amount set aside for improvement and repairs grants has been for each local authority to determine. The table sets out the actual expenditure by local authorities on improvement and repairs grants for private sector houses, for Scotland and Glasgow for 1996-97 to 2000-01. The figures for 2000-01 are based on provisional outturn figures. No estimates are available for the local authorities estimated expenditure for the next five years.</p>

  <p>By their nature, VIP visits tend to be arranged and confirmed at fairly short notice. Details of VIP visits and high profile events, however, are not normally made public until the arrangements have been finalised and have been agreed by the visitor or event organiser, ourselves and any other Government department involved.</p>

  <p>On 24 March 1998, the Government sold a portfolio of student loan debt with a value of &#163;1.022 billion to Finance for Higher Education Ltd and on 23 March 1999 sold a second portfolio with a value of &#163;1.030 billion to Honours Trustee Ltd. The loans were selected at random and included a representative proportion of loans to Scottish borrowers (approximately 10 per cent by value).</p>

  <p>All teacher education courses must be accredited by the General Teaching Council for Scotland and approved by Scottish ministers. In order to be given approval, courses must comply with the guidelines for courses of teacher education in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The guidelines do not prohibit distance learning courses. However, such a course would need to be developed and proposed by a higher education institution. No proposals have been received.</p>

  <p>However, I am interested to open up discussion on general issues of accessibility to teacher education with relevant partners and have asked my officials to take this forward. I hope to be able to provide information on our progress in this area in the near future.</p>

  <p>This is an operational matter for the East of Scotland Water Authority. I have asked Dr Jon Hargreaves, Chief Executive of ESWA to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>I have been asked by the minister to respond. A programme of meter installation to non-domestic properties is currently under way. East of Scotland Water undertake this work through our own internal contracting organisation and through external contractors.</p>

  <p>Meters are often installed inside the customer&#8217;s property as it is not physically possible to install a meter outside the property (due to the presence of other services or to avoid metering more than one customer&#8217;s water supply).</p>

  <p>East of Scotland Water have recently put installation procedures in place to ensure that an appointment is made with customers to both carry out the survey, and to install the meter. This procedure ensures that the customer is given at least 72 hours notice prior to the meter installation.</p>

  <p>East of Scotland Water does not have a policy of knowingly entering private premises without prior consultation and consent from the owner of the property.</p>
