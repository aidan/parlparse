  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Breast Screening year runs from 1 April to 31 March.</p>

  <p>2. In Scotland, women aged 50 to 64 years were invited for a routine screen once every three years until 2003-04, when the age range for invitation was extended to include women up to the age of 70 years. This expansion was phased in throughout the country over a three year round of screening. Women over 70 years are still screened three yearly on request.</p>

  <p>Local authorities take the lead in providing childcare services, working with partners in the voluntary and private sectors, to meet the needs of children, their parents and, where applicable, their other carers, including grandparents. Scottish Government financial support for childcare is included within the overall local government settlement. In addition, we support national childcare and parenting organisations in the voluntary sector and we have been able to protect that funding for 2011-12. The provision of accessible, affordable and flexible childcare remains a priority for the Scottish Government and we will continue to work with our partners to take this forward.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s website provides a wide range of information and access to statistics that may be of interest to parents. We also continue to support many of the national parenting and children&rsquo;s voluntary sector organisations which provide information on services they provide in Scottish communities.</p>

  <p>Information on local services can come from several sources, depending on the nature of the parental enquiry and where responsibility for the service lies. For example, local information on education and social work services is likely to be found on local authority websites or through local literature.</p>

  <p>Yes. We published the first <em>Cycling Action Plan for Scotland</em> in June 2010. That plan commits us to &quot;establishing a new Cycle Training Standards and Delivery Support Group to formulate a plan by end of 2010 to deliver a co-ordinated approach to training; an increase in the number of volunteers available to deliver training; a support network for the volunteers, and support for local authorities in offering the three levels of cycle training including on-road.&quot;</p>

  <p>Under that Cycling Action Plan, Cycling Scotland is now preparing to publish a specific plan to increase the number of children receiving cycle training, including on-road training. In 2010-11, &pound;300,000 is being allocated to enhance the delivery of cycle training. Future funding allocations will be made in due course.</p>

  <p>It is not the role of the Scottish Government to set up services for victims. However, we are fully supportive of appropriate services being available to support male victims of domestic abuse.</p>

  <p>Since April this year, we have been providing funding to Respect to extend the Men&rsquo;s Advice Line, a dedicated support for male victims, to Scotland. In addition, we have been working with Abused Men in Scotland to further our understanding of the needs of male victims.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how widely available support services are for families of drug addicts and those who misuse alcohol</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-12-16.S3W-38194.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80306" speakername="Fergus Ewing" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa1216.htm#11">

  <p>A range of support services for families of people who use drugs and misuse alcohol are available across Scotland. These services help individuals and families to recover from the harms caused by drugs and alcohol.</p>

  <p>Funding for alcohol and drug treatment and support services is allocated to NHS health boards. However, decisions on spend for alcohol and drug services are made at a local level by alcohol and drug partnerships, who have clear responsibilities to develop effective local alcohol and drugs strategies. We expect these partnerships to make sure there is access to a range of appropriate services based on the needs of the local community, including services to support families.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government provided &pound;28.6 million to health boards for frontline drug services in 2010-11; this represents an <strong>increase of over 20%</strong> since 2006-07, exceeding the manifesto commitment. In 2011-12, we are proposing to maintain funding for drug treatment services at the level of 2010-11. The Scottish Government has also made record investment of around &pound;100 million through NHS boards (2008-11) - a tripling of resources on the previous three years &ndash; to provide vital local prevention, support and treatment services for those affected both directly and indirectly by alcohol misuse, in line with local need as identified by local alcohol and drug partnerships (ADPs). Supporting children affected by parental substance misuse is one of four key priorities identified for local ADPs.</p>

  <p>The voluntary sector also plays an important role in supporting families of people who use drugs and misuse alcohol. The Scottish Government&rsquo;s Unified Voluntary Sector Fund (UVSF) provided &pound;70,266 in 2010-11 to Scottish Families Affected by Drugs, a national organisation that aims to support families across Scotland who are affected by drugs and raise awareness of the issues affecting them. Scottish Families Affected by Drugs aims to reduce the isolation and stigma felt by many families by representing them at local and national level; providing seminars and training events for family support groups, and providing access to support through the National Helpline services.</p>

  <p>There are also a number of mutual aid groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA) across Scotland that support individuals in their recovery and also help to catalyse the growth of recovery communities that support families and individuals to overcome the problems associated with drug and alcohol misuse.</p>

  <p>In addition, the National Directory of Drug Treatment Services, maintained by the Scottish Drugs Forum, lists national organisations where families can seek help. This is available at: <a href="http://www.scottishdrugservices.com" target="_parent">www.scottishdrugservices.com</a>.</p>

  <p>Information on support services for families of those who misuse alcohol is not held centrally. Alcohol Focus Scotland provide a search facility to identity support services throughout Scotland on their website. This is available at:<br /> <a href="http://www.alcohol-focus-scotland.org.uk/getting_help/where_can_i_get_help/" target="_blank">http://www.alcohol-focus-scotland.org.uk/getting_help/where_can_i_get_help/</a>.</p>

  <p>There are no national prescriptions for the number of subjects pupils should be examined for in S4. The precise number and range of qualifications on offer, as well as when they are taken, will be a decision for schools to take in consultation with learners and parents. Schools will take into consideration how they can provide a variety of options to suit the needs of the learner rather than treating all S4 pupils as a uniform cohort. Several models developed by schools to illustrate emerging thinking on how the senior phase (S4-S6) could be delivered are available on the Curriculum for Excellence website, including case studies that illustrate how five to eight subjects can be taken.

  <p>Universities are generally interested in higher level qualifications. The Scottish Government, Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA), UCAS, Supporting Professionalism in Admissions (SPA) and other agencies have undertaken a great deal of work to inform universities in England and Wales about Scottish Highers and Advanced Highers and their comparative tariff ratings. This work will continue as universities continue to consider both their admissions policies and learning at teaching in the light of the changes which Curriculum for Excellence will bring.</p>

  <p>Curriculum for Excellence is aimed at increasing achievement and attainment, thus enhancing and not limiting progression to higher education whether in Scotland, the wider UK or beyond.</p>

  <p>HMIE inspects pre-school centres across local authority, private and voluntary sectors. In each inspection, Inspectors consider the provision for outdoor learning which the service provides. They evaluate children&rsquo;s progress in physical development under the Curriculum for Excellence area Health and Wellbeing. Where services need to make improvements in outdoor learning, this will be reported to staff and parents. HMIE notes that centres are improving access to outdoor learning across sectors. Good examples of children making effective use of the local environment include &quot;forest pre-school&quot; developments.</p>

  <p>None. The Scottish Government works with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) on an ongoing basis on the development of legislation affecting the environment. A good number of environmental regulations are introduced to implement European legislation. We also have regular discussions with SEPA on its Better Environmental Regulation programme that focuses on options to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of environmental regulation and to reduce the regulatory impact on businesses. SEPA has recently issued a consultation paper on options for moving from separate environmental regulations for air, water, waste and radioactive substances to a simpler, integrated model.</p>

  <p>Technical breaches of the regulations, such as errors or omissions in record keeping are detected very regularly by inspectors. These are dealt with either on site with verbal recommendations, or are followed up with written advice. There is currently no easily searchable capture of all of these findings. No serious breaches of the regulations, which have led to the issuing of an enforcement notice or of formal prosecution proceedings, have occurred in any of the last five years.</p>

  <p>The Healthier Fish Working Group was established by the Scottish Government in order that it could make recommendations to the Ministerial Group on Aquaculture (MGA), which it did in June of this year. Officials have been considering the recommendations and I intend to further discuss the recommendations with the industry at the next meeting of the MGA in February. On the specific question of unannounced visits to fish farms, I can confirm that the Fish Health Inspectorate is currently considering the practical aspects of carrying out such inspections with a view to their commencement in 2011.</p>

  <p>The development of clinical guidelines in Scotland is the responsibility of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN). We understand it has no current plans to develop a guideline on thyroid conditions.</p>

  <p>Guidelines on the diagnosis and management of conditions affecting the thyroid have been produced by the Royal College of Physicians, London, and the Society for Endocrinology, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists. These are based on the advice of expert clinicians, but are also informed by voluntary sector support groups, such as the British Thyroid Association.</p>

  <p>The Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) of the GMS contract includes a domain on hypothyroidism. The second indicator, which relates to ongoing management of the condition, requires a blood test.</p>

  <p>The safety of medicines is reserved and is the responsibility of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are collected by the MHRA and the Commission for Human Medicines (CHM) through the spontaneous reporting scheme, the Yellow Card Scheme. The scheme collects ADR reports from across the whole United Kingdom and includes all medicines, including those from prescriptions, over-the-counter or general retail sales. The scheme relies on the voluntary reporting of suspected ADRs by health professionals and patients. There is also a legal requirement for pharmaceutical companies to report.</p>

  <p>It is important to note that the reporting of a suspected adverse reaction does not necessarily mean it is related to the drug. The MHRA asks reporters to send &quot;suspicions&quot; of adverse drug reactions however, these are not proven. Many factors have to be taken into account in assessing causal relationships including temporal association, the possible contribution of concomitant medication and the underlying disease being treated.</p>

  <p>As of 8 December 2010, the MHRA has received a total of six UK spontaneous &quot;suspected&quot; ADR reports associated with thyroxine (active substance: levothyroxine) where the reporter stated that the reactions occurred upon switching between different brands of thyroxine. These ADR reports were received during the time period 1989-2010. A breakdown of the reaction terms reported is shown in the following table:</p>

  <p>The regulation and control of medicines are reserved and is the responsibility of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The MHRA&rsquo;s primary aim is the protection of public health that includes assessment of medicinal products to ensure that they are of satisfactory safety, quality and efficacy and that they have a positive balance of benefit:risk. The following information has been provided by the MHRA.</p>

  <p>Thyroxine (Levothyroxine) is used to treat patients with underactive thyroid glands (hypothyroidism). It has been established on the UK market for over 50 years.</p>

  <p>The following levothyroxine products are currently authorised in the UK:</p>

  <p>Levothyroxine Tablets 25, 50 and 100 micrograms</p>

  <p>Levothyroxine Oral Solution 25, 50 and 100micrograms in 5mL.</p>

  <p>The tablets are marketed by six different licence holders and the oral solution is marketed by one licence holder.</p>

  <p>The stability issues associated with levothyroxine are known and as part of the procedure for granting an authorisation, the MHRA would have assessed the applicant company&rsquo;s data to ensure satisfactory quality standards are maintained during manufacture and for the duration of the approved storage shelf life.</p>

  <p>With respect to levothyroxine tablets, the drug substance is present in very low quantities and finished product manufacture may be considered complex. The product&rsquo;s quality specification will, as a minimum, be required to conform to the British Pharmacopoeia monograph for levothyroxine tablets BP. Due to known stability issues with levothyroxine, it is expected that a proportion of the drug will be lost during its shelf life. The monograph for levothyroxine tablets in the British Pharmacopoeia (which publishes quality standards for a range of products) has been revised for the 2011 edition, to tighten the limits for levothyroxine content from 90% to 110% of the declared content to 90% to 105% that reduces possible variability, between products and between batches of the same product.</p>

  <p>With respect to Levothyroxine Oral Solution, there is no pharmacopoeial monograph; nevertheless, the approved quality specification of the authorised product is in compliance with current general Pharmacopoeial requirements for oral liquid preparations.</p>

  <p>As is the case for any medicinal product, the MHRA will investigate and take appropriate action in relation to any reported defect of a product marketed in the UK.</p>

  <p>Licensing and safety of medicines is reserved and is the responsibility of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The MHRA has provided the following information.</p>

  <p>Eltroxin is the only branded form of Levothyroxine Tablets that is used to treat patients with hypothyroidism. The tablets are available in strengths of 25, 50 and 100 micrograms. A number of generic products are also available. There are a total of six Marketing Authorisation holders for levothyroxine tablets.</p>

  <p>Currently all Levothyroxine Tablets (branded and generic) must conform to the minimum quality standards set by the British Pharmacopoeia monograph for Levothyroxine Tablets BP. These quality standards are applied throughout the shelf life of the product thus ensuring its quality in use. Thus, the quality of these products is considered to be equivalent and therefore in terms of patient outcome, they are expected to have the same clinical efficacy and safety.</p>

  <p>There is no evidence to suggest that the branded levothyroxine products have a more positive outcome than the generic levothyroxine products.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has no evidence of the benefits of the combined use of triiodothyronine and levothyroxine compared with patients receiving only thyroxine.</p>

  <p>Clinicians are expected to follow agreed national clinical guidelines when diagnosing and managing conditions affecting the thyroid. These guidelines, are based on the advice of experts in the field, including the Royal College of Physicians, and the Society for Endocrinology, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, and informed by voluntary sector support groups, such as the British Thyroid Association. The British National Formulary also provides information to clinicians to support them in prescribing thyroid medication.</p>

  <p>All those who apply to the scheme receive assistance to find a job, although some newly qualified staff secure a job through their own efforts.</p>

  <p>We continue to make progress in our discussions with a range of stakeholders to secure employment opportunities for newly qualified nurses and midwives in 2010-11. In the current financial context that is clearly very challenging, but our commitment to the One Year Job Guarantee and to support the transition to employment remain as solid as ever.</p>

  <p>The majority of the smoking-cessation related activity budget relates to specific funding made available for the provision of NHS smoking cessation services. There has been no reduction in this level of funding which has remained the same in 2009-10 and 2010-11 (&pound;9,000,000 to NHS boards and about &pound;3,700,000 for the Community Pharmacy Scheme).</p>

  <p>The main reason for the budget difference is that the short-term funding allocated to NHS Tayside&rsquo;s &quot;Quit 4 U&quot; smoking cessation pilot project came to an end in 2009-10.</p>

  <p><em>The National Strategy for Self-directed Support</em> , published on 23 November, makes it clear that local authorities should allow people who need support the right to choose how that support is provided and to take as much control of managing that support as they wish. Self-directed support options include taking an individual budget as a direct payment, choosing how the individual budget is allocated, or a combination of these. People may also choose to leave the local authority to arrange their support. Our draft Self-directed Support Bill includes a duty on local authorities to give people assessed as needing support the opportunity to direct their own support.</p>

  <p>Winter of 2009-10 was the coldest in Scotland since 1962-63 and the second coldest since records began in 1914. However, by working together central and local government ensured that Scotland kept moving. In doing so, a number of lessons were learned which were taken into account by public service providers in preparing for this winter.</p>

  <p>Earlier this year, the Scottish Salt Group undertook a review of the resilience of the Scottish road network, building on the experience of last winter. Its findings were published in August and included 11 short-term recommendations and further medium and long-term suggestions for improvement.<br /> <a href="http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk/strategy-and-research/publications-and-consultations/j13001-00.htm" target="_blank">http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk/strategy-and-research/publications-and-consultations/j13001-00.htm</a>.</p>

  <p>Following the publication of the report, action was taken by Transport Scotland to develop the short-term recommendations. Monitoring of salt restocking by road authorities commenced during the summer that resulted in confidence being high in the autumn that Scottish roads authorities would have sufficient salt supplies for the start of the high winter maintenance season. Monitoring has continued during the winter to assess usage levels. In addition to this monitoring, Transport Scotland procured an additional amount of salt to provide a strategic salt supply if stocks fell to critical levels this winter. Guidance has been provided to local authorities on the arrangements for accessing this reserve of 27,000 tonnes of salt should they require it.</p>

  <p>Scottish Flood Forum</p>

  <p>Government funding for the Scottish Flood Forum will increase from &pound;70,000 to &pound;99,000 in 2010-11, and from &pound;36,000 to &pound;70,000 in the first six months of 2011-12. The Scottish Flood Forum is an independent voice, representing the interests of people and communities affected or &lsquo;at risk&rsquo; from flooding. This funding will help the Forum provide support to communities, local authorities and individuals about the proactive steps they can take to understand flood risks and to take sensible and proportionate steps to protect themselves.</p>

  <p>Flood Warning Schemes</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has improved Scotland&rsquo;s flood warning schemes by:</p>

  <p>delivering an improved, more accurate flood warning service to almost 20,000 properties and businesses. Investments have been made in major improvements to flood warning across Scotland, including new schemes covering the Esk, Dee, Don, Deveron (March 2010) which have resulted in around 2000 homes and businesses within at-risk communities in North East Scotland benefitting from Scottish Environment Protection Agency&rsquo;s (SEPA) flood warning service;</p>

  <p>providing SEPA with &pound;8.6 million to enhance their flood warning service by implementing Floodline Warnings Direct. This new state-of-the-art service will launch in March 2011 and will mean that members of the public and businesses will soon be able to sign up for free flood warnings that are sent directly via land lines or mobile phones - a vital first defence to those at risk of flooding;</p>

  <p>investing in new flood protection schemes across Scotland, such as the Mosset Burn flood protection scheme in Forres protected around 350 homes from flooding last winter; and</p>

  <p>providing &pound;750,000 funding to support the Scottish Flood Forecasting Service. This joint initiative between the Met Office and SEPA will provide improved accuracy of flood forecasts and allow SEPA to issue timely warnings to the public to allow them to prepare themselves and their property from potential flooding.</p>

  <p>SGoRR</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government Resilience Room (SGoRR) is now working 24 hours a day to provide support and co-ordination to cope with the current spell of severe weather in order to ensure that the necessary information is in place to underpin decisions about communication and to enable Ministers to maintain a dialogue with key agencies and other governments.</p>

  <p>Ready Winter</p>

  <p>Ready Winter is a new section of the Ready Scotland website published on 9 November, and provides practical advice on the simple practical precautions people can take to mitigate the worst effects of winter weather while going about their daily lives. In keeping with the rest of Ready Scotland, the site provides a single point of entry for winter advice and information, linking to other official sources of information and advice including those provided by Transport Scotland, SEPA and the Met Office.</p>

  <p>Ready Business</p>

  <p>Ready Business is a sub-section of Ready Scotland that provides generic advice for businesses to follow in preparation for all forms of emergencies, and is particularly relevant during winter. The Scottish Government has also engaged in a number of activities to promote the uptake of business continuity measures over the past few months, including sponsorship of a major conference in Edinburgh in October and arranging discussions with the CBI and the Federation of Small Businesses.</p>

  <p>Winter Planning for NHS Health Boards</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government hosted a National Winter Planning Conference on 15 June, where the key findings of the 2009-10 winter review were presented and discussed.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government also hosted two regional winter planning events on 21 and 23 September, which gave NHS boards, and their partners, an opportunity to illustrate how they were enhancing their 2010-11 winter planning arrangements.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government issued winter planning guidance, which emphasised the importance of planning from a whole systems perspective, to all NHS boards on 7 October.</p>

  <p>Winter Planning Guidance for NHS Health Boards</p>

  <p>The 2009-10 NHSScotland winter review confirmed that, in spite of the most severe winter weather for 30 years, H1N1 pandemic flu, and increased levels of norovirus circulating in the community, NHSScotland performed well, with performance levels for key indicators comparable with previous years, and in many areas exceeding previous year&rsquo;s performance.</p>

  <p>This year&rsquo;s winter planning guidance has been developed in consultation with policy areas across the Health Directorate, and key partners, including the Emergency Access Delivery Team, NHS Territorial Boards, COSLA, Health Protection Scotland, and NHS 24.</p>

  <p>The guidance focuses on the main areas that NHS boards identified through the 2009-10 winter review that could be further improved to help them prepare for winter 2010-11:</p>

  <p>Reduce levels of in-patient boarding</p>

  <p>Increase the effectiveness of escalation planning</p>

  <p>Improve patient discharge levels over the four-day festive public holidays</p>

  <p>Improve the management of norovirus.</p>

  <p>The guidance re-emphasises the importance of planning from a whole systems perspective, including access to Out-of-Hours and mental health services, and in implementing the recommendations made in the 2008-09 winter review that helped boards successfully manage last year&rsquo;s winter pressures.</p>

  <p>The importance of NHS board resilience and business continuity is also highlighted in this year&rsquo;s guidance.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government shared geographic information with NHS boards on the number of emergency admissions that were due to falls and fractures across last year&rsquo;s period of severe weather, to help facilitate discussion with local authorities around local contingency planning. Boards were also advised to make sure that they had agreed priorities in place for gritting arrangements to make sure that services are not adversely affected this winter.</p>

  <p>Improving Delayed Discharge Performance</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government are investing &pound;70 million in a change fund that will help local partnerships redesign their services for older people. This service redesign will see the balance of care for older people move from institutional to primary and community settings, and in particular will help to reduce the level of avoidable admissions and further drive performance on delayed discharge</p>

  <p>Be Ready for Winter Media Campaign</p>

  <p>NHS 24 is leading a winter media campaign and is focusing on three key messages:</p>

  <p>Restock Medicines for winter ailments</p>

  <p>Order and collect repeat prescriptions</p>

  <p>When GP surgeries are closed.</p>

  <p>As well as announcements in the national, regional and local press, these messages are being communicated through radio and television campaigns. A range of promotional posters and leaflets, have also been sent to NHS territorial boards, health venues, such as GP Practices and Community Pharmacies, and Local Authority venues, such as local libraries.</p>

  <p>The <em>Be Ready for Winter </em>leaflet also signposts a number of services that the public can access for advice and information, such as NHS Minor Ailments Service, Immunisation Scotland, and the Ready Scotland portal.</p>

  <p>NHS boards has also been advised to issue local press releases to inform both the public and NHS staff, of prevailing local conditions around issues such as severe weather, norovirus, and changes in procedures.</p>

  <p>NHS Inform</p>

  <p>NHS 24 has recently launched &quot;NHS Inform&quot;, which is a new health information service designed to give the public access to the health related information, such as:</p>

  <p>General information on medical conditions.</p>

  <p>Answers to commonly asked health questions.</p>

  <p>Information on health and welfare topics.</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.healthinmylanguage.com" target="_blank">www.healthinmylanguage.com</a> &ndash; for translated health information.</p>

  <p>A behind the headlines feature &ndash; looking at the health issues making the news.</p>

  <p>Links to local information across NHSScotland.</p>

  <p>Information on your rights.</p>

  <p>An online enquiry service.</p>

  <p>NHS inform is still developing and the service will be continually updated to ensure that the public are provided with the most relevant and up-to-date information currently available.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to the second supplementary to question S3F-2698 by the First Minister on 11 November 2010 ( <em>Official Report</em> , c. 30366), whether it will consider the establishment of a national helpline for older and vulnerable people in the event of severe weather.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-12-16.S3W-38215.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80396" speakername="Nicola Sturgeon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa1216.htm#34">

  <p>There are already established helplines in operation that are funded by the Scottish Government providing information and advice to older and vulnerable people.</p>

  <p>For example, Care Information Scotland is a helpline and website providing information on all aspects of community care for older people. During the recent severe weather, Care Information Scotland was able to direct people to local sources of help and support.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government also provides funding to Age Scotland for the Scottish Helpline for Older People. This is a telephone helpline service for older people ensuring that both they and their families/carers are provided with high quality, relevant information for their needs. It also gives appropriate signposting to other helplines and organisations.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Home Energy Scotland Hotline is in place to provide a one-stop shop where households can get all the help and advice they need to cut their fuel bill and keep their homes warm during a cold winter spell.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government also published a new section of the Ready Scotland website called &quot;Ready Winter&quot;, which provides practical advice on the simple practical precautions that people, including the elderly and vulnerable and their families, carers and communities can take to mitigate the worst effects of winter weather while going about their daily lives.</p>
