  <p>Ultimately the interpretation of whether the European territory referred to in Article 11 of the EU Directive on Conservation of Wild Birds (79/409/EEC) refers to the territory of any member state or the territory of the individual member state implementing the directive is a matter for the courts. In the absence of any court judgement, the Scottish Government would take a pragmatic view, based on the bird species in question and its potential for harm to the environment.</p>

I have subsequently discussed broadcasting with Ed Vaizey, the UK Government Minister for Culture, on 7 June. On both occasions I emphasised the importance of maintaining a choice of Scottish news for viewers in Scotland. I also made it clear that I intend to engage with the UK Government on broadcasting issues as fully and constructively as possible over the coming months.</p>

  <p>The Energy Assistance Package (EAP) is assisting the rural fuel poor by providing energy savings advice; offering income maximisation referrals to the Pensions Service and Citizens Advice Direct; offering referrals to electricity suppliers for checks on social tariffs or cheaper ways to pay; extending Stage 4 assistance to families as well as pensioner households; providing higher levels of Stage 4 grant for homes where it is most difficult to raise the energy performance rating; offering solid wall insulation as well as loft insulation; offering a variety of heating technologies in areas off the gas grid, including where appropriate, air source heat pumps.</p>

  <p>The area-based Home Insulation Scheme generates many referrals to the EAP that, for instance in the Western Isles, will see heating systems and improvements to the building fabric carried out under Stage 4 of EAP.</p>

  <p>The activity which colleges are funded to deliver is the responsibility of the Scottish Funding Council, not ministers. The key consideration in any funding decision is the interests of learners and the quality of the education they receive. The funding council has made clear that, should courses be transferred from Stow, it wishes to work with the college to plan an effective transition and to ensure that Stow College remains viable.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether an appropriate assessment has been carried out regarding the marina developments in Inverness, Whiteness and Avoch, each of which are within the EU Habitats Directive designated bottlenose dolphin special area of conservation.</p>

  <p>The marina developments at Inverness, Whiteness and Avoch were approved under separate applications, under various consenting procedures and on differing timescales.</p>

  <p>The development at Inverness Harbour was enabled by a Harbour Revision Order in 2005. An appropriate assessment was not completed as Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) advice indicated that the proposed development, subject to mitigation measures identified by SNH, was not likely to have a significant effect on the special area of conservation (SAC). The Scottish Government understands that the mitigation works have been carried out.</p>

  <p>A Harbour Revision Order was made in November 2008 to enable Whiteness Marina Company to carry out physical works to the harbour and operate as a Statutory Harbour Authority. An appropriate assessment of the Whiteness development was carried out in January 2010 as part of the planning application approval process which specifies the number of berths permitted.</p>

  <p>Avoch Harbour works were authorised by consent under Section 34 of the Coast Protection Act in August 2009. Advice from SNH relating to the increased number of berths proposed was that these would not have an adverse effect on the integrity of the SAC. This advice was used as our Appropriate Assessment prior to issuing the consent.</p>

  <p>The information that we hold on this subject is limited to bridges on the Scottish trunk road network. Local authorities may hold information pertaining to their own areas for non-trunk roads. Network Rail, as owner of Britain&rsquo;s main line rail infrastructure may also have more information on this.</p>

  <p>There is also some information available on the Rail Safety and Standards Board&rsquo;s website that answers the question in part. This relates to total numbers of bridge strikes GB-wide and is in the public domain. For ease of reference we attach the relevant information below:</p>

  <p>This table gives number of bridge strikes in 2009 and in each of the preceding years at a GB Level. We have added the corresponding numbers for Scottish Trunk Roads as a comparator.</p>

  <p>Network Rail would need to be contacted for cost of repairs.</p>

  <p>In respect of the Scottish trunk roads network we have been working closely with Network Rail to tackle the incidence of bridge strikes at road/rail interfaces across Scotland. Following completion of investigations instigated by our Operating Companies in early 2009, we have identified several sites where improvements to road lining, bridge markings, signing and lighting can be carried out to reduce the risk of overheight vehicles striking low rail bridges crossing the trunk road network.</p>

  <p>Works at several sites are already underway as part of a programme of improvements identified. The remainder are being programmed for completion within this financial year, subject to the availability of funding and the competing demands for improvements across the trunk road network.</p>

  <p>We are currently finalising details of our media strategy targeting the freight community. This will roll-out in July this year and will link with other Scottish Government Agencies, freight associations, private industry, etc. with the Transport minister&rsquo;s approval.</p>

  <p>We do not hold any information on activities that local authorities might be carrying out to reduce the incidences of bridge strikes on non-trunk roads. This is a matter for the relevant authorities and Network Rail.</p>

  <p>We require special consideration to be given for cyclists in all new trunk road schemes and within improvements to existing trunk roads. The new Scottish Planning Policy also requires that the needs of cyclists and the promotion of sustainable modes of transport are fully considered in land use development proposals that impact on trunk roads.</p>

  <p>We have been absolutely clear since we first announced the new school building programme a year ago that the Scottish Government will be directly funding the school building programme. The Scottish Futures Trust is co-ordinating, facilitating and managing the programme on our behalf, working alongside local authorities. The SFT will develop, recommend and implement approaches that will secure a better schools programme across Scotland, and better value for money than could be achieved through each authority working separately.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. 2009 figures are provisional</p>

  <p>2. In 2005, the Office for National Statistics changed the methodology of the International Passenger Survey by adding Prestwick and Liverpool airports as survey sampling points. This did not change the total UK estimates, but had a significant effect on the Scottish figures. For this reason, Scottish figures for 2005 onwards cannot be directly compared to earlier data.</p>
