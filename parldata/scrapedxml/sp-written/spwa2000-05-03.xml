  <p>The Scottish Executive has received no specific approach from Crew 2000 for assistance. I visited them on 21 March and no mention was made of their present difficulties.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive wrote to Crew 2000 on 1 March confirming its continuing financial support of &pound;26,136 under section 10(1) of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968, and this has been accepted and welcomed by the organisation. Crew 2000 has also applied for funding under section 16b of the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978 and this is presently receiving consideration. We expect to announce our decisions soon.</p>

  <p>I understand that the local Drugs Action Team (DAT) approached Crew 2000 in April suggesting a way forward. The DAT decided on 20 April to offer funding assistance of &pound;30,000 and this has been welcomed by Crew 2000.</p>

  <p>Arrangements are being developed in collaboration with the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council, the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education, Higher Education Institutions, the General Teaching Council, education authorities, schools, teachers' associations and HMI to introduce a more consistent wide-ranging approach to internal and external review of initial teacher education. Following a pilot external review in 2001-02, a programme of external reviews which will cover all teacher education institutions will begin in 2002-03.</p>

  <p>In the interim, I have asked HM Inspectors of Schools, in terms of the Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998, to undertake a review of the preparation given to student teachers to teach literacy. They will report on current good practice and also make recommendations for improvement. That review will take place in 2000-01 and will be undertaken by HMI in partnership with other key partners in initial teacher education. I will request other such reviews as necessary.</p>

  <p>One of the primary functions of the SPCB is to provide property, staff and services for the Parliament&#8217;s purposes. Provision of a logo is the provision of property for the Parliament&#8217;s purposes and so it was considered by the SPCB that ratification by the Parliament was not a requirement. However, as stated in the written answer to PQs 5764&#8211;5766, consultation with business managers took place during the selection process.</p>

  <p>The SPCB has copyright in the logo and there is no requirement for an application for copyright as such. If any third party were to breach the SPCB&#8217;s copyright, infringement proceedings under the Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988 could result.
