  <p>Local response teams have been established across Scotland and are currently working on contingency plans for improving their dealings with companies. On Tuesday 25 July, I launched the PACE website, (www.scotland.gov.uk/pace) which will make available a range of reference material and other information, including recent publications and contact details that will assist the public sector approach to companies in difficulty. The website will permit local agencies and all interested parties (including businesses themselves) to access information and advice on dealing with company difficulties and to identify key local contacts. The site also offers the opportunity to share experience and good practice via a discussion forum, where views, information and examples of best practice can be easily exchanged.</p>

  <p>For council tax information for years 1996-97 onwards, I refer to the answer given to question S1W-8670. Council tax and community charge figures (in cash terms) for years prior to this are given in Appendix 1 of successive editions of <i>Scottish Local Government Financial Statistics</i> (formally published annually by the Scottish Office and now by the Scottish Executive), copies of which are available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 7132). Prior to local government reorganisation in 1996-97, the data are presented for Scotland and the former Scottish Regions and Islands Areas. Information on domestic rates is not held centrally.</p>
