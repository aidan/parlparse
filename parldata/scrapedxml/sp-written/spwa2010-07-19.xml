  <p>Scotland&rsquo;s Road Safety Framework to 2020, launched in June 2009, sets out our national road safety priorities and a range of commitments which we shall deliver in partnership with our key stakeholders to improve road safety.</p>

  <p>The Framework seeks to inform local authorities&rsquo; road safety delivery plans to ensure that we have a joined up approach, whilst allowing flexibility for them to determine their own local priorities and solutions. All local authorities in Scotland publish their own local road safety plan, however copies are not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is making available almost &pound;12 billion in funding for local authorities this year. Our concordat with COSLA has given local authorities more freedom than ever before to invest in local priorities such as local roads. Decisions about local road safety are therefore a matter for individual councils.</p>

  <p><em>Scotland&rsquo;s Road Safety Framework to 2020</em> , published in June 2009, contains a number of commitments which we shall deliver in partnership with internal colleagues and external stakeholders to address the needs of children and young people and drivers aged 17-25.</p>

  <p>These include continued funding for Road Safety Scotland to develop far-reaching road safety educational resources; continuing to support the use of school travel plans fully involving the local community; and looking for innovative ways to target young drivers with appropriate messages about safe driving.</p>

  <p>In late summer 2010, we also intend to conduct a national public debate with young drivers, their parents and guardians and representative groups in order to explore with them the road safety issues for young and newly qualified drivers and potential solutions.</p>

  <p>A representative from the Scottish Youth Parliament also sits on our Road Safety Strategic Partnership Board which was established to govern the delivery of the commitments in the road safety framework.</p>

  <p>We have no plans at present to make representations to the UK Government to review the standard driving test.</p>

  <p>The Driving Standards Agency conducted a consultation exercise in 2008 asking for views on overhauling the Driver Training and Testing Regime, for which they are responsible, including a proposal to include additional steps prior to fully qualifying as a driver. We provided a full response to that consultation including asking for elements of Pass Plus to be included in the training regime pre-test. We believe that the Driving Standards Agency are currently reviewing Pass Plus in light of contributions to the consultation.</p>

  <p>We are responding through implementation of Scotland&rsquo;s Road Safety Framework to 2020, published last year. This includes specific commitments on trunk roads and local roads, including engineering measures and work, through route safety groups, to reduce casualties along routes which are shown to have the highest incidences of road casualties. These route safety groups include representation from local authorities, the police and others, working together to provide innovative joined up solutions to reduce casualties. Transport Scotland assesses the safety performance of trunk roads every year to identify specific locations on the network which might benefit from localised engineering improvements.</p>

  <p>Interim reported road casualty statistics for Scotland 2009, published on 16 June, show that we now have the lowest road casualties in Scotland since records began in 1949, a welcome drop that continues a downward trend in recent years.</p>

  <p>The Annual Population Survey (APS) is the official source for data on people not in education, employment or training. Table 1 shows the latest estimates from the APS, covering each year since 2007, of the numbers of people aged 16 to 19 not in education, employment or training in Scotland. It has not been possible to break these estimates down by local authority area because the sample sizes are too small to provide reliable estimates.</p>
