  <p>The information requested is detailed in the table below and has been broken down by year and region. As many of these cases are closed relatively quickly some cases reported during 1997 will already have been purged from the Crown Office computer system and are therefore not reflected in the figures given. Similarly the figures for the year 2000 represent only those cases reported thus far. The figures in respect of 1998 and 1999 however reflect the total numbers of cases reported in those years.</p>

  <p>Due to the very low incidence of puerperal psychosis (limited to around two cases per 1,000) treatment is not always available on a local basis. Where a case is deemed to be too severe for treatment through the local inpatient psychiatric service, arrangements are made to transfer the patient to the nearest specialist unit.</p>

  <p>Greater Glasgow Health Board has recently agreed with the Glasgow Primary Care NHS Trust to establish a special five-bedded unit for mothers and babies. This development will be commissioned during 2001-02 and will result in a significantly enhanced service for mothers with puerperal psychosis within a safe and supportive environment for their babies.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Office was involved with the Department of Health in England in the process of re-tendering the contract for the helpline, in 1998.

  <p>We have not invited local authorities to submit plans for advocacy services for mental health service users, and have no plans to do so. Eight local authorities in Scotland presently provide advocacy projects from funding provided under the Mental Illness Specific Grant.</p>

  <p>The 1997 <i>Framework for Mental Health Services in Scotland</i> provides a template for the care agencies in the organisation of integrated and responsive mental health services, including advocacy mechanisms. Specific guidance to care agencies <i>Advocacy: A Guide to Good Practice,</i> was published at that time, and further guidance will be published later this year.</p>

  <p>Advocacy now plays an increasingly important role in the development of modern and responsive mental health care. The Millan Committee, in its review of the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984, is considering what place advocacy should have in mental health legislation. We expect to receive their recommendations later this year.</p>

  <p>Guidance was issued to the NHS and local authorities in 1996 and remains relevant. That guidance includes advice on the need to keep patients, their families and carers informed and involved at all stages where a transfer from hospital to alternative care in the community is under consideration.</p>

  <p>That process is underpinned by a two-stage appeal process allowing patients or their families the right to a review of any recommendation made for continuing care. Appellants can refer any concern in the first instance to the Director of Public Health at the health board, and if continued, appellants can request a second opinion involving a clinician from a health board area of their choice.</p>

The process is carried out automatically without the need, in general, for manual intervention. It may, however, produce a local atmosphere of a hazardous nature. The Health and Safety Executive has published general guidance for both employers and employees on the health hazards of working with sewage.

  <p>Waste water from the outlet of sewage works is used in some plants to wash screens in screen houses using an automated process. However potable water is used in most cases. Waste water (sewage works effluent) is used at 10 sewage works to wash screens in screen houses:</p>

  <p>North Of Scotland Water Authority - Biologically treated wastewater is used at Persely, Halkirk and Tain.</p>

  <p>East Of Scotland Water Authority - Settled wastewater is presently used at Edinburgh and Dunfermline. Biologically treated wastewater will be used later this year, following commissioning of the works.</p>

  <p>Screened wastewater is presently used at Kirkcaldy and Tayport. Biologically treated wastewater will be used when works are complete at the end of this year and 2005 respectively.</p>

  <p>Biologically treated wastewater is used at Galashiels.</p>

  <p>West Of Scotland Water Authority - Screened wastewater is presently used Meadowhead and Stevenson. Biologically treated wastewater will be used when works are complete in summer next year.<br /></p>
