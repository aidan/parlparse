  <p>The consultation paper did not comment on the research report in such terms, but only noted inconsistencies between older and more recent court decisions. The relevant consideration is that the Commission recommended in its final report published on 25 March 1998 that it was not necessary to introduce legislation either to reform or restate the existing law on boundary walls. Ministers considered the recommendation at that time and also concluded that no legislation was necessary on boundary division walls. The Executive agrees with that conclusion.</p>

  <p>The formation of classes in schools is a matter for education authorities taking account of local circumstances. Class formation is likely to be influenced by a number of factors including pupil numbers, class size maxima, the capacity of rooms and the staff available. No projections are made centrally of the numbers of composite classes likely to be formed.</p>

  <p>A decision to ban or limit industrial fishing must be based on scientific evidence. We are working with colleagues in DEFRA to establish the impact of the industrial fisheries on the marine ecosystem, both in terms of bycatch of other fish and the importance of sandeels as a food source for other species. We have had useful discussions with Danish fisheries managers. We have also placed observers on Danish vessels and at Danish ports. We are currently analysing the collected data and we intend to meet again with Danish managers in due course.</p>
