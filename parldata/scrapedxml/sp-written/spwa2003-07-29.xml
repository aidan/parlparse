  <p>The formula used to distribute financial support for capital expenditure to local authorities takes account of a wide range of factors, including relative deprivation. It is up to each council to decide how best to direct its resources according to local needs and priorities.</p>

  <p>From 2004-05 onwards, the existing limits on council&#146;s capital expenditure will be replaced by a new prudential system. This will allow local authorities to set the level of capital borrowing they consider they can afford, within the limits of prudential indicators.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is continuing to taking forward work to implement the recommendations in the Scottish Transplant Group&#146;s <em>Organ Donation Strategy for Scotland</em> , published in July 2002, which set out a range of initiatives to help increase organ donation rates. These include:</p>

  <p>the development of a major national publicity campaign to raise awareness of organ donation issues, aimed at encouraging people to add their names to the NHS Organ Donor Register, as well as making sure those closest to them are aware of their wishes; and</p>

  <p>the preparation of a teaching resource pack on organ donation and transplantation to be made available to schools as a teaching aid which explores the complex range of ethical and moral issues surrounding organ donation and transplantation. Over time, this should raise public awareness of the subject, discussion within families and boost the number of names on the Organ Donor Register.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-829 by Nicol Stephen on 27 June 2003, whether it has requested, or will request, any information from the Royal Mail about the basis, assumptions and projected impact of the proposal to cease rail operations and what the reasons are for its position on the matter; what information it has received on these issues, and what steps it will take in order to determine the impact on road traffic and road maintenance.</p>

  <p>I intend meeting the Royal Mail shortly to discuss its proposal to cease rail operations. Until then, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how long the proposed study of the pattern of services provided by voluntary organisations that support families in transition, as referred to in Parents and Children, will take from design to conclusion and whether, in order to facilitate as a matter of urgency the stable and adequate funding of voluntary organisations, it will initiate this study in advance of the introduction or passing of any family law bill, as referred to in <em>A Partnership for a Better Scotland</em> .</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is strongly committed to supporting families in transition and values the role of the voluntary sector in providing marriage and relationship support. Funding in this area has doubled since 2000 and in 2003-04, the family organisations will receive grants totalling &#163;1.188 million. Three-quarters of this funding goes to family mediation organisations. An on-going external consultancy review is considering the funding arrangements and corporate governance of Family Mediation Scotland and affiliated local mediation services. The review is due to conclude in the autumn. A recent consultation on merging voluntary sector funding for services for children and young people sought views on whether grants for marriage and relationship support should be included in an integrated fund. The consultation responses are currently being analysed. The continued development of the role of the voluntary organisations in supporting families in transition will be informed by the family mediation review, the consultation responses on merging funding streams, and the regular discussions which take place between the family organisations and the Scottish Executive.</p>
