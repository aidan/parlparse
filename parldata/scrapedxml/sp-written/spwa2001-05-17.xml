  <p>Responsibility for sampling and monitoring scallops for toxins transferred to the Food Standards Agency in April 2000. From April this year the agency began publishing results for whole animal tests as well as the roe. However, in common with previous years, action continues to be assessed on the basis of the test result from the gonad, though where toxin levels in the whole animal test exceed EU action levels, fishermen are being advised not to market whole animals from affected areas. On the proposals to move to a tiered system, the FSA advise me that a Scottish consultation letter is expected to be issued in the next few weeks.</p>

  <p>Almost 13,900 children attended out-of-school care clubs in 1997. In addition, in the same year, over 7,300 children attended playschemes providing a range of activities during the school holidays. These are the latest available figures from the national survey of daycare. Given the enhanced profile of childcare, the Executive is now closely monitoring numbers. A new integrated Census of Children&#146;s Daycare and Pre-School Education Centres will later this year update statistics in this area, and will be repeated annually.</p>

  <p>But we know that the numbers will have increased substantially since 1999 with the introduction of funding from the New Opportunities Fund (the fund) for new out-of-school places. It is estimated that awards from the fund have already created places for around 24,000 children. Further awards will be made until 2006 under the current and new programmes.</p>

  <p>A number of the latest plans produced by Childcare Partnerships include targets for growth in out-of-school care services.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to promoting social inclusion and equality of opportunity for all the people of Scotland. The <i>Equality Strategy</i> published last year, set out our plans for mainstreaming equality into policy development and service delivery. It includes plans for raising awareness and promoting best practice. We have established a Framework Group to develop standards for translation, interpreting and communication support across the public sector. In addition, a British Sign Language and Linguistic Access Working Group has been established to develop a strategic approach to BSL issues.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to ensuring that all patients are enabled to be full partners in making decisions about their own care. NHS boards and Trusts are expected to ensure that arrangements are in place to meet the communication needs of people who are deaf or hard of hearing.</p>

  <p>Guidance, which included sections to raise awareness of the communication needs of deaf and hard of hearing patients, including the use of interpreters, was issued to the NHS in 1999. A training video about the needs of deaf and hard of hearing people using hospital services was issued with the guidance.</p>

  <p>Standards developed by the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland are designed to ensure that all patients are provided with a clear explanation of, and relevant information on their condition and any treatment, investigation or procedure proposed, including risks and alternatives. A national review of the local delivery of these generic standards is now under way.</p>

  <p>More generally, as part of work on the Executive&#146;s <i>Equality Strategy</i>, a Framework Group has been established to develop standards for translation, interpreting and communication support across the public sector, this includes the needs of those who are deaf and hard of hearing. In addition, a British Sign Language and Linguistic Access Working Group has been established to develop a strategic approach to BSL issues.</p>

The Executive confirmed in discussions with the operator and Orkney Islands Council before the service was withdrawn that a TRS allocation continued to be available for 2001-02, at the same assistance rate of 50% of shipping costs. This assistance will now be available to alternative operators.</p>

  <p>The Executive continues to liaise with the Islands Council and other operators on options for providing sufficient capacity for the export of livestock from Orkney on this or alternative routes.</p>

  <p>In the case of Campbeltown-Ballycastle, Sea Containers Ltd operated a summer season-only service on this route between 1997 and 1999 but the company decided early in 2000 not to continue with its operation due to mounting losses. As this route extends beyond Scotland the imposition of a PSO is a reserved matter. The Scottish Executive is in discussion with the Scotland Office on options for progress.</p>

  <p>Only historical census figures and the numbers of animals culled to date are available. These are shown in the table below. It is impossible to predict how many will eventually be culled.

  <p>In March I announced the establishment of an Impact Assessment Group to inform the Executive about the effect which the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak is having across all areas and sectors. To date the majority of the assessment has been qualitative and has helped to inform the work of the Ministerial Group on FMD in its decisions on hardship relief and thinking about recovery. The Impact Assessment Group recently commissioned a survey of businesses to provide greater quantification of impact. The survey is based around Local Enterprise Company areas such as Ayrshire and the results will be shared with local organisations. I look forward to seeing the results in the near future.</p>

  <p>I am advised by the Intervention Board Executive Agency, who operate the scheme on behalf of GB Agriculture Departments, that Matheson Jess, Brechin were unable to commence slaughter under the LWDS prior to 6 April as confirmation was awaited that the onsite incineration plant had obtained the necessary Scottish Environmental Protection Agency authorisation to process LWDS material. At the time there was no other disposal route in Scotland available as the renderers were processing foot and mouth contiguous cull material and had no spare capacity for LWDS material.</p>

  <p>G D Vivers &amp; Son were unable to slaughter under the LWDS prior to 10 April, because they were dealing with foot and mouth contiguous cull animals.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2001-05-17.25.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80155" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-01/wa0517.htm#17">

  <p>The foot-and-mouth disease situation in Scotland continues to improve and up to midnight last night only five cases of the disease have been reported this month. While continued vigilance is necessary, I have decided to authorise the following relaxations in animal movement and other controls.</p>

  <p><u>Provisionally Free Area</u></p>

  <p>- Veterinary certification will no longer be required for longer distance movements.</p>

  <p>- Collection Centres which, on the mainland, are approved to deal in fatstock only, will now be permitted to cover store stock. This will bring the mainland PFA into line with existing arrangements on the islands.</p>

  <p>- Cattle will be permitted to move direct to slaughter from the ARA into the PFA. These movements will be subject to strict veterinary and other controls.</p>

  <p><u>At Risk Areas</u></p>

  <p>- Longer Distance Movements will be permitted in the areas of Dumfries and Galloway and Borders outwith Infected Areas, so extending existing ARA rules to these districts.</p>

  <p>- The need for supervision of Longer Distance Movements will be dispensed with and replaced by a system of spot checks.</p>

  <p>- Deer Stalking will also now be permitted in Dumfries and Galloway and the Borders with the exception of those parts which fall within the Infected Areas.</p>

  <p>- Collection Centres will be approved to deal with fat and store stock.</p>

  <p><u>Infected Areas</u></p>

  <p>- The road network has been used as the means of delineating the Infected Areas. This has encompassed farms which fall outwith the regulatory 10km Surveillance Zones. Officials are looking at ways in which the areas might be redefined to release farms on the South Ayrshire/Galloway border and to the north of the Moffat Surveillance Zone.</p>

  <p>- Outwith the 3km protection zones, local and occupational licences will be granted without any need to demonstrate a welfare requirement. Trading will be permitted under these arrangements. In exceptional circumstances, longer movements within the Infected Areas can now be authorised by the Divisional Veterinary Manager in order to resolve any particularly serious welfare problem.</p>

  <p>- Animals from the PFA and ARA will also be allowed to move into the Infected Area. This will cover the movement of bulls and the return of over-wintered hoggs, for example. Vehicles carrying these animals will be cleansed and disinfected at an official C&amp;D Centre prior to returning to the ARA/PFA. Once the animals enter the Infected Area they will not be permitted to move outside it.</p>

  <p>- I am aware that there are substantial numbers of finished cattle which the Scottish meat trade would like authorisation to have moved from the Infected Areas for slaughter in the ARA. I am sympathetic to their case which is still being considered. There are, however, legislative and other considerations which will need to be weighed carefully in the balance before I decide whether this can be permitted.</p>

  <p>The recording of the cause of death is a matter for the certifying doctor with guidance from the General Register Office for Scotland (GROS). In coding causes of death for statistical purposes, GROS uses the World Health Organisation&#146;s <i>International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (Tenth Revision)</i> known as ICD 10. The ICD codes are based on medical conditions and not on where the patient obtained the illness. As such, there is not a specific ICD 10 code for hospital-acquired infection (HAI) and I am not aware of any plans to expand classification of causes of death to include HAI.</p>

  <p>There are, in any case, considerable clinical uncertainties about the degree to which a hospital-acquired infection contributes to death, especially in very ill patients with a number of concurrent conditions, and there can also be uncertainty about the source of infections which cause or contribute to death. The Scottish Executive and NHSScotland are committed to reducing the incidence of HAI in Scottish hospitals. Preventing and controlling HAI is an important part of the responsibilities of every NHS Trust.</p>

  <p>The consents required for an offshore wind or water driven generating station are as follows:</p>

  <p>Section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 (consent under section 36 is only required if installed generating capacity is in excess of 50 megawatts, with an application fee of between &#163;5,000 and &#163;20,000 depending on size);</p>

  <p>Section 5 of the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985, and</p>

  <p>Section 34 of the Coast Protection Act 1949.</p>

  <p>Applications for these consents must be made to the Scottish Ministers via the relevant departments. In addition, an application to the Crown Estate is required for the lease on an offshore site, and the Crown Estate will consider granting a lease only when, amongst other things, it is satisfied that the developer has obtained all the necessary statutory consents.</p>

  <p>There is no maximum time taken to issue such consents, although the relevant departments would always aim to process these as quickly and efficiently as possible.</p>

  <p>As a matter of best practice, we advise developers to speak with the relevant planning authority, Scottish Natural Heritage and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency before submitting an application under section 36 of the 1989 Electricity Act. These are the statutory consultees defined by the Act, although the views of other interested bodies are also sought. Experience with previous renewable energy projects shows that most developers undertake extensive discussions and briefings for local residents prior to submitting their actual applications.</p>

  <p>Developers seeking to construct an offshore station of any description will also require a site lease, and should approach the Crown Estate to discuss this.</p>

  <p>Scotland&#146;s only existing wave energy power station is Wavegen&#146;s LIMPET (Land Installed Marine Power Energy Transformer) built on the shoreline at Islay, which began generating late last year. The station secured planning consent from the local authority before construction commenced.</p>

  <p>The same company also developed an offshore device which it planned to install off the coast at Dounreay. The device, called OSPREY (Ocean Swell Powered Renewable Energy) was destroyed by bad weather in August 1995 before it could be properly installed. Prior to the aborted installation, the company had applied for and received consent under the Coast Protection Act 1949, and under section 5 of the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985.</p>

  <p>Work on school buildings is funded mainly by the local authorities themselves and the Scottish Executive does not generally make money available directly to authorities for that purpose. The level of capital expenditure by local authorities is subject to broad annual limits which is expressed as an annual allocation of consent to incur capital expenditure on their non-housing capital programmes, including education. The consent is distributed amongst authorities on the basis of a formula agreed with COSLA, and is neither programme nor project specific. Within that framework, it is for Renfrewshire and Inverclyde Councils to determine their detailed expenditure priorities for school building.</p>

  <p>For the years 1999-2000 and 2000-01, the net formula allocations of capital consent were &#163;7.075 million and &#163;8.086 million for Renfrewshire and &#163;5.565 million and &#163;6.216 million for Inverclyde, and both will have allocated, and spent, sums from that consent on schools.</p>

  <p>Authorities are given some resources by direct capital grant through a separate arrangement under the New Deal for Schools. These resources are intended to assist authorities to tackle the backlog of repairs to school buildings and improve facilities for ICT. Grant of &#163;0.923 million was paid to Renfrewshire and of &#163;0.529 million to Inverclyde in each of the years 1999-2000 and 2000-01.</p>

  <p>Following an announcement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his pre-budget statement in November 2000, further grant of &#163;536,745 was paid to Renfrewshire and &#163;288,805 to Inverclyde in 2000-01 to deal with immediate repairs, maintenance and equipment problems in schools.</p>

The final agreed completion date was 12 February 2001 with a total cost of &#163;46,706.25. The company carrying out the survey was System Three Social Research.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. European law requires that public contracts for goods and services exceeding given thresholds (currently &#163;93,896 for central government and &#163;144,456 for most other public bodies) are advertised in the <i>Official Journal of the European Communities</i> .</p>

  <p>In response to representations from MSPs, Highland Council and others last year, I asked officials to explore the possibility of ending date stamping of books of discount vouchers for Skye Bridge. Following discussions, the Concessionaire, Skye Bridge Limited, have made it clear that they are not willing to change the present arrangements. The discount vouchers already offer generous benefits to frequent users of the bridge, most of whom are local people, but I will discuss this matter further with the company later this year.</p>

  <p>This matter is kept under constant review, although we have no plans at present to implement a direct system of funding.

As part of the recently announced eight point plan for Scottish tourism, VisitScotland will engage with all Area Tourist Boards to begin implementation of the action plan to establish the integrated VisitScotland local area network.

  <p>There is no comprehensive monitoring of water abstraction levels in Scotland at present. We will be required to introduce such a system in order to implement the EC Water Framework Directive. However, there is already some monitoring as follows:</p>

  <p>the Scottish Environment Protection Agency monitors river flows and abstraction levels in certain areas for example where there is particular pressure from abstraction for aquaculture or irrigation;</p>

  <p>information on amounts of water supplied for public use is collected from the water authorities by the Scottish Executive.

  <p>Jackie Baillie and I met representatives of the SCVO on 10 May. Following that discussion, we have responded positively to concerns that were expressed and decided that the phased withdrawal planned to start this year will be delayed. Instead it will begin with effect from 1 April 2002, at which point the value of individual reliefs will be reduced by 40%, with the remainder being progressively phased out by April 2005. This will provide all water authority customers affected by the original decision, including a range of charitable and voluntary bodies, with an extra year in which to plan to meet the costs arising from phased withdrawal and to enable free meters to be installed.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive on what evidence the briefing by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency to MSPs on 1 May 2001 that there is &quot;anecdotal evidence&quot; which suggests that 20% of whisky distilleries have a negative impact on the environment was based, who produced such evidence and which distilleries were involved.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer <a name="QuestionText">whether he will provide details of the occasions since May 1999 when he or other Members of the Scottish Parliament have represented the Parliament on overseas visits, stating for each visit what the cost involved was, who or what body met the cost, who the participant members were, and what steps have been taken or will be taken to report back to the Parliament on the purpose and achievements of all such visits.</a></p>

  <p>Details of overseas visits since May 1999 by the Presiding Officer or Deputy Presiding Officers representing the Parliament, and members and parliamentary staff accompanying them, are set out in the attached table.</p>

  <p>Members of the Parliament other than the Presiding Officer or Deputy Presiding Officers do not represent the Parliament and details of any overseas visits made by other members, for example on committee or Commonwealth Parliamentary Association business, are not listed in the table.</p>

  <p>The table indicates where costs associated with the travel and accommodation for the visits listed have been met by outside organisations. The Corporate Body does not have details of these costs.</p>

  <p>It has become normal practice for a report of each overseas visit by the Presiding Officer or a Deputy Presiding Officer representing the Parliament to be made to the Parliamentary Bureau. A site is being established on SPEIR on which reports of visits will be made available.</p>
