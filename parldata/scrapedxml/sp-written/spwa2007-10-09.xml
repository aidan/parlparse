  <p>We have received preliminary details from Aberdeen City Council for regeneration proposals in the city, including the transfer of some of its housing stock. I have informed the council that, until we have completed the forthcoming consultation on social housing and the spending review, it would not be sensible for the Scottish Government to consider any application for transfer that requires funding beyond the available treasury debt support.</p>

  <p>As was clearly set out in the Independent Scrutiny Panel (ISP) terms of reference, the panel will need to take account of local circumstances and the views of individuals and communities affected by effectively engaging with local people, in liaison with the Scottish Health Council. It is for the panel to determine how they will carry out this task in light of its terms of reference. The ISP has not been charged with undertaking formal public consultation.</p>

  <p>As I pointed out in my statement to Parliament on this matter on 6 June 2007, it is important to recognise that the original review of services proposals were subject to extensive formal public consultation. That consultation highlighted the overwhelming strength of public opinion against the proposals to close the accident and emergency department at Ayr Hospital. In reversing these proposals - which were endorsed by the former Executive - the Government has charged the ISP with carefully considering NHS Ayrshire and Arran's plans for retaining accident and emergency services at Ayr Hospital together with the supporting evidence; and to provide a commentary on these.When I made my statement to Parliament on 6 June, I also recognised that we must be careful not to set back or slow down the board&rsquo;s service plans any more than is absolutely necessary to fulfil the commitment on accident and emergency services. That is why we have agreed with the board that their proposals - having been scrutinised and evaluated by the ISP - should be with me for a final decision by the turn of the year.This timescale will achieve the necessary balance between effective public engagement and independent scrutiny, and the need to move forward swiftly to minimise uncertainty and the impact on service development.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-5008, on 9 October 2007, and confirm that I am content that the adopted process is consistent with the spirit of the HM Treasury Green Book guidance, which recognises that the level of detail in any process undertaken should be commensurate with the scale of the proposal in hand.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what additional resources have been allocated to police forces to tackle internet fraud in each year since 1999, broken down by force, and what information it has on the additional resources similarly allocated to trading standards offices, broken down by local authority.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2007-10-09.8.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80341" speakername="Kenny MacAskill" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-07/wa1009.htm#6">

  <p>It is for chief constables to decide how to allocate resources to meet policing priorities in their force areas, including tackling internet fraud. Police forces are funded by a combination of police grant from the Scottish Government and from local authorities. As a result it is not possible to identify the overall police resources allocated to tackling internet fraud.</p>

  <p>However, the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency (SCDEA) has an E-crime unit, which provides specialist support to the Scottish police service for those areas of serious organised criminality involving or facilitated by computer or information technology. The costs of this are included within the budget of the SCDEA, although the costs of tackling internet fraud are not separately identifiable in the agency&rsquo;s budget.The Scottish Government provides general financial support for Scotland&rsquo;s local authorities&rsquo; net revenue expenditure on core services, including trading standards. This funding is, in the main, provided by means of a block grant and it is not possible to identify the level of funding for individual services. It is the responsibility of each individual local authority to allocate its total resources, including the locally collected council tax, on the basis of local needs and priorities.In 2007-08 the core local government funding provided by the Scottish Government will amount to over &pound;8.7 billion.</p>
