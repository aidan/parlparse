  <p>No representations have been made as the Scottish Executive was involved in the decision to undertake a review of anticholinesterase compounds. The review was announced in May 1998. Approval holders were invited to submit data in support of their products by September 1999. They chose not to submit data on products containing carbofuran and chlorfenvinphos and consequently existing approvals were revoked with effect from late 1999. The phase out period for the revoked products expires on 31 December 2001. Carbosulfan was supported by the approval holders and is under evaluation.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive when it will announce the outcome of the recent consultation on the report of the working group on a replacement for poinding and warrant sale, <i>Striking the Balance: A New Approach to Debt Management</i> , and how it intends to proceed.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2001-12-19.7.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80252" speakername="Mr Jim Wallace" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-01/wa1219.htm#5">

  <p>I have today placed a summary analysis of the results of the consultation process on the Scottish Executive website. Copies have also been sent to the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>The consultation revealed very widespread support for the approach recommended by the group. Its main recommendations were ensuring the provision across Scotland of user-friendly advice and information for debtors; creating a statutory debt arrangement scheme; creating new incentives for debtors and creditors to reach negotiated settlements; reforming the enforcement procedure to improve debtor protection where legal action is necessary, but also providing for a final sanction against those who can pay their debts but won&#146;t pay.</p>

  <p>In the Executive&#146;s view, the group&#146;s proposals are balanced and forward-looking, and would bring about a sea-change in the way that debt issues are handled in Scotland. That view was confirmed by the welcome for them expressed in the consultation responses. We therefore propose to implement the group&#146;s recommendations. In particular, we will:</p>

  <p>Invest an additional &#163;3 million a year in advice services across the country. This is over and above existing local money advice provision</p>

  <p>Produce a new information and advice pack to be issued by the courts whenever legal action for debt is proposed</p>

  <p>Consult on proposals for a debt arrangement scheme to allow people to pay debts in a managed way, without the threat of enforcement action, and</p>

  <p>Bring forward legislative proposals for a new, less intrusive court procedure, which will give debtors much greater protection, while still allowing appropriate action to be taken against the few who can but refuse to pay their debts.</p>

  <p>A more detailed announcement will be made in due course.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#146;s first <i> Annual Report on Drug Misuse</i> , published on 23 November, highlights a wide range of actions to help young people stay away from drugs. Some examples are:</p>

  <p>(a) in 2000-01, 97% of Scottish schools provided drug education;</p>

  <p>(b) the publication of the School Drug Safety Team&#146;s Guidelines for the Management of Incidents of Drug Misuse, and the provision of &#163;3 million over three years from 1 April 2001 to 31 March 2004 to implement the recommendations of the team&#146;s second report;</p>

  <p>(c) the allocation of around &#163;18 million over the same three-year period as above to support the Changing Children&#146;s Services Fund, which includes the provision of prevention and treatment facilities for under 16s as a priority area;</p>

  <p>(d) through Scotland Against Drugs, we have supported many community-based projects designed to divert young people away from drug misuse, towards healthy and positive lifestyles, and</p>

  <p>(e) the Health Education Board for Scotland &quot;Think About It&quot; campaign, aimed at raising awareness of the risks of heroin to young people.</p>

  <p>The Annual Report also records progress on other aspects of our drug strategy, including enforcement work, which will help to stifle the availability of drugs to young people in Scotland. In addition, statutory and voluntary bodies across Scotland are engaged in local prevention initiatives.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how much was spent per head of population in the financial years 1999-2000 and 2000-01 on measures to prevent young people becoming involved with drugs in (a) Inverclyde and (b) throughout Scotland.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2001-12-19.9.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80238" speakername="Dr Richard Simpson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-01/wa1219.htm#6">

  <p>We estimate that around &#163;22.6 million per annum was spent on prevention throughout Scotland, in 1999-2000 and 2000-01. On a per head of population basis, this equates to &#163;4.42 per person per annum. However, if the calculation is based on 0 to 16-year-olds, the figure rises to &#163;21.27 per person.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to provide a breakdown of these figures for Inverclyde. To do so would require a specific study, which would be time-consuming and costly. Prevention work includes not only direct expenditure for tackling drug misuse, but also generic expenditure, where a proportion of service time is related to additions work covering drugs, alcohol and tobacco.</p>

  <p>The operation of the 20 day movement restriction in Scotland is a matter for the Scottish Executive and was introduced on veterinary advice as a necessary part of our foot-and-mouth disease control strategy. The Executive is currently reviewing this measure in consultation with the Scottish livestock industry interests.</p>

  <p>There is no requirement to put a time limit on the Foot and Mouth Disease Declaratory (Controlled Area) (Scotland) (No 3) Order. The restrictions have been reviewed regularly and a number of relaxations have been made. These relaxations have been made as soon as veterinary advice has indicated that it was safe to do so.</p>

  <p>This restriction is still necessary to ensure that any disease which may be latent and undetected in livestock, which could be introduced onto a holding by an animal movement will have time to incubate and be identified before any animal leaves that holding and thus greatly reduces the risk of the disease spreading to other farms.</p>

  <p>The current foot-and-mouth disease movement and other restrictions are under review. When Scotland ceases to be designated as a controlled area the existing movement control regime will be relaxed. However, veterinary advice is that some form of animal movement restriction will still be required in the short term. Discussions and negotiations are currently taking place with the industry on how this can be implemented and industry practices adapted.</p>

  <p>The 20 day rule on livestock movements was one of a range of measures introduced to control the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. Whilst we continue to relax a number of measures the 20 day rule is one of the licence conditions under which animals are allowed to move between farms, and to and from markets, and continues to be an essential part of our successful disease control strategy.</p>

  <p>It is for the courts to determine the appropriate sentence taking into account the circumstances of each individual case. The maximum penalties available for drink driving are a fine of up to &#163;5,000 and/or imprisonment for up to six months. Convicted drivers are also liable to mandatory disqualification for at least 12 months (the average in 2000 being 22 months). The combination of these sanctions &#150; particularly disqualification &#150; does make for a significant deterrent.</p>

The contractual performance of the Operating Companies on all four contracts is monitored on an on-going basis by Halcrow in association with PricewaterhouseCoopers (the Performance Audit Group) and the Scottish Executive. There are a range of corrective measures and financial sanctions within the contracts which the Scottish Executive can consider in the event of unsatisfactory performance by the Operating Company. Having exhausted these, the Scottish Executive can terminate the contract if serious non-performance continues to be identified.

  <p>&#163;1.2 million was paid in EC school milk subsidy to primary schools in Scotland in year ended August 2001. The UK has member state discretionary powers to apply for subsidy under the EC School Milk Subsidy Scheme in respect of schoolchildren in secondary schools. It is not possible to give accurate figures on how much subsidy could be paid as this would depend on take-up levels of the scheme both by education authorities and individual schools. However, 100% take-up by secondary schools in Scotland could result in an estimated total subsidy of &#163;2.5 million.</p>
