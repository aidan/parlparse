  <p><i>A Guide to Scottish Executive Grants for the Voluntary Sector</i> was published on 24 July, giving information on Executive schemes for 2001-02. Copies have been placed with the Scottish Parliament Information Centre. Closing dates for applications to the various schemes do vary, but generally applications have to be received by September or October each year in order that grant offers can be sent out well in advance of the start of the funding year.</p>

  <p>The Executive published <i>The Scottish Compact Good Practice Guides</i>, including one on funding, to its departments, agencies, and NDPBs on 13 June. We are now conducting a strategic review of Executive funding for the voluntary sector and we will be looking at ways of harmonising scheme procedures and minimising bureaucracy.</p>

  <p>The Executive is developing a database of direct and indirect grants to voluntary organisations. A copy of the database will be sent to the Scottish Parliament Information Centre as soon as possible and I will write to the member to inform her when this has been done. <br /></p>
