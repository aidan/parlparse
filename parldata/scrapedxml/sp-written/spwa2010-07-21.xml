  <p>NHS boards in Scotland are responsible for providing NHS services in accordance with national and local priorities and in line with the health needs of the population.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises that complementary or alternative therapies, including chiropractic, may offer relief to some people suffering from a wide variety of conditions, and it is open to NHS boards in Scotland to make such services available based on an assessment of needs within their respective areas.</p>

  <p>Guidance issued to NHS boards in August 2005 sets out the framework for the provision of these services in the NHS. This guidance is available from:</p>

  <p>Latest official statistics on the defined daily dose per capita for antidepressants, prescribed in Scotland that were dispensed by community pharmacists or dispensing doctors anywhere in the UK can be found on the ISDScotland website at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.isdscotland.org/isd/3671.html" target="_blank">www.isdscotland.org/isd/3671.html</a>.</p>

  <p>Information is presented by NHS board for financial years up to 2008-09.</p>

  <p>Provisional statistics for financial year 2009-10 are planned to be published on <br /> 28 September 2010.</p>

  <p>We do not anticipate that any NHS board will meet the target to level off the annual rate of increase of defined daily dose per capita of antidepressants which was due to be achieved by 31 March this year.</p>

  <p>However, the HEAT target has driven a much better understanding of the issues that impact on anti-depressant prescribing across Scotland. As our understanding has improved, it has become clearer that we can not be sure that implementing evidence based prescribing behaviour will lead to a reduction in antidepressant usage. We have therefore reviewed the target and are committed to developing an access to psychological therapies target for inclusion in HEAT in 2011-12. We will continue to track antidepressant prescribing across Scotland to see what impact improving access to psychological therapies has on prescribing behaviour.</p>

  <p>Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) Guideline 48 on the Management of Early Rheumatoid Arthritis which was published in December 2000 and updated in October 2004 is due to be replaced by a revised Guideline this autumn. The revised Guideline will address diagnosis, pharmacological treatment, and the role of the <br /> multi-disciplinary team in improving care of the rheumatoid arthritis patient. It will also include issues for discussion with patients. Clinicians in NHSScotland are expected to follow the recommendations in SIGN Guidelines.</p>

  <p>As is now its practice, SIGN will be preparing an implementation programme to accompany publication of the revised Guideline.</p>

  <p>Our national strategies relate to the clinical priorities of NHSScotland, as set out in <em>Better Health, Better Care</em> , and the Government has no plans to expand these.</p>

  <p>However, the Government recognises rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as a serious condition which profoundly affects the lives of many people in Scotland. A wide range of work is therefore in hand to address it, including:</p>

  <p>The exploration of a Managed Clinical Network approach to RA services;</p>

  <p>The revision of Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) Guideline 48 and the associated implementation programme being developed by NHS QIS;</p>

  <p>The commissioning of the Scottish Public Health Network to undertake an update of the needs assessment for RA published by the Scottish Needs Assessment Programme in 2002;</p>

  <p>Consideration of the approach to the management of RA that has been developed in the East of England;</p>

  <p>Our general work on developing a musculo-skeletal programme based on integrated multi-disciplinary teams within community settings, incorporating the service model for pain management services that we are also developing; and</p>

  <p>The work of the Orthopaedics Task &amp; Finish group set up as part of the 18 weeks referral to treatment programme.</p>

  <p>People living with RA will also benefit from our generic work on long-term conditions, including in particular our work on promoting self management.</p>

  <p>GP practices are entitled to receive additional funding when they produce a register of patients aged 16 and over with a body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 30 in the previous 15 months.</p>

  <p>There are no similar cash incentives for GPs dealing with patients who are underweight. However, we would expect GPs to use their professional judgement and take the appropriate action for any patient showing signs or suffering from anorexia or bulimia or who are generally underweight using current BMI scales. Anyone with a BMI under 20 is classified as being underweight.</p>

  <p>The management of patients in these categories include diet, change of life style, healthy eating, nutrition, exercise, detailed health plans etc. Apart from GPs who are normally the first point of contact for patients, dieticians, nutritionists and other healthcare professionals may also be involved in the management of such patients.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not available centrally. On the basis of previous population surveys it is estimated that there are approximately 10,500 people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The national MS register, which ISD and the Multiple Sclerosis Society Scotland have been developing, with some start-up funding from the Scottish Government, began to collect information on new cases of MS in January 2010. The register should, in time, provide more accurate data on the incidence and prevalence of the condition in Scotland. The clinical standards for neurological services published at the beginning of this year by NHS Quality Improvement Scotland will also promote the gathering of better data on conditions such as MS.</p>

  <p>No. Premises licence application fees and annual fees are set by licensing boards in line with the Licensing (Fees) (Scotland) Regulations 2007. These fees are linked to the rateable value of the premises concerned. This approach was agreed by licensing boards and most of the licensed trade and was based on independent research which recommended that while some anomalies would arise, a link to rateable value was the fairest approach overall. We do not consider that a further and full review of fee arrangements should be taken forward in the short term, nor do we consider it desirable to return to the fee arrangements under the 1976 Act where a small gift shop paid the same as a large supermarket.</p>

  <p>I have asked John Ewing, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service, to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The SPS has no current plans to review the terms of the contract for HMP Kilmarnock.</p>

  <p>There is a mechanism for change which is specified in the contract which can be invoked to take account of changes in legislation or the requirements of the SPS or the Scottish Government.</p>

  <p>I have asked John Ewing, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service, to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Both contracts have been drawn up to deliver value for money and each contributes to the Scottish Government and Scottish Prison Services strategy to reduce re-offending. Each is contributing towards those goals albeit in different ways.</p>

  <p>The information that would be needed to calculate, by pupil numbers, an average cost of building a school is not held by the Scottish Government. Therefore, we are not able to provide an average cost for building a primary school with between 400 and 450 pupils.</p>

  <p>This is an operational matter for the Scottish Funding Council (SFC) and I will ask the Chief Executive to write to you. Please note that as SFC provide funding to colleges and universities on an academic year basis the information for 2009-10 will not be available until the end of December 2010.</p>

  <p>Core funding for colleges and universities is provided through the Scottish Funding Council (SFC). The Financial Memorandum between the SFC and the institutions it funds, requires the SFC to ensure that colleges and universities are making proper arrangements for governance, financial management and accounting. As Accountable Officer, the SFC Chief Executive is ultimately accountable to Parliament for ensuring that institutions are utilising the funds they have been given in a manner consistent with the purpose for which they were allocated.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Further and Higher Education (Scotland) Act 2005 provides that the Auditor General for Scotland may inspect the accounts and accounting records of all institutions funded by the SFC.</p>
