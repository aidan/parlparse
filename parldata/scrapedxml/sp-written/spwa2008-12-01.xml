  <p>Scottish Ambulance Service call handlers follow strict protocols to ensure that patients receive the most appropriate response. Their primary focus is to ascertain what the patient&rsquo;s condition is at the time of the call and to carry out pre-dispatch instructions. This will not routinely include questions about personal care plans for specific conditions.</p>

  <p>Under the concordat, the Scottish Government is providing local government with &pound;34.9 billion over the next three years, an increase of 13.1% across the period. Significant controls and flexibilities have been devolved to better enable local authorities to respond to local needs and priorities. This includes the need to meet local training requirements to ensure that they have a range of suitably qualified staff in place to support all pupils.</p>

  <p>Through the continuing professional development (CPD) framework, the Scottish Government fully expects all teachers to be able to recognise and know how to support pupils with additional support needs, including those with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Additionally, a national CPD team is in place to support a network of local authority CPD co-ordinators to help share best practice. The team has particular expertise in additional support needs.</p>

  <p>Following talks with the Scottish Government, the General Teaching Council for Scotland has now added five new areas to their professional recognition framework, one of which is Additional Support Needs - Autism.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is also undertaking a number of other initiatives to help ensure that trainee teachers, qualified teachers and support staff receive the necessary training to ensure that they have the necessary knowledge and confidence to work with all children, including those with ASD. For example:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Teacher Education Committee (STEC) Action Plan &ndash; <em>Framework for Inclusion, </em>a two year action plan to take forward inclusive education in Initial Teacher Education and Continuous Professional Development.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will soon publish The Autism Toolbox, an autism resource for Scottish local authorities and schools. The toolbox will draw on a range of practice experience, literature and research to support education authorities, and school staff to develop innovative and individualised approaches to teaching pupils with ASD.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3F-1200 on 20 November 2008:</p>

  <p><a href="../../../business/officialReports/meetingsParliament/or-08/sor1120-02.htm#Col12616">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/officialReports/meetingsParliament/or-08/sor1120-02.htm#Col12616</a>.</p>

  <p>I believe the vast majority of Scotland&rsquo;s children and young people are making a meaningful and positive impact within their communities. This report raises the gap that currently exists between reality and perception. The reality being:</p>

  <p>99% of head teachers believe that all or almost all pupils are generally well behaved in class.</p>

  <p>Over 185,000 young people are actively engaged with voluntary youth organisations across Scotland.</p>

  <p>And less than 1.5% of young people commit crime.</p>

  <p>To show his personal commitment to this issue the First Minister recently hosted a dinner with opinion-formers in the public and private sector. The aim of this was to move forward an ambitious agenda for our young people through Young Scot Active, an element of which will specifically target unfair and negative reporting on young people. This work is being further echoed in the development of the Youth Justice Framework and the Anti Social Behaviour review.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what systems are in place to ensure children with learning difficulties are identified and supported.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-12-01.S3W-17989.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80400" speakername="Maureen Watt" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa1201.htm#4">

  <p>The identification of children with learning difficulties can happen at different stages of a child&rsquo;s life. Therefore, a number of systems exist to identify and support these children.</p>

  <p>Health for All Children (Hall 4) guidance was issued in 2005 and introduced a core programme of screening, surveillance and health promotion activity for every child. The universal core programme of contacts forms the basis of a holistic assessment enabling health professionals to identify the nature of any additional support required on the basis of need.</p>

  <p>The Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 places duties on education authorities to ensure that the additional support needs of all children and young people are addressed. Education authorities are required to identify, meet and keep under review the additional support needs of all pupils.</p>

  <p>Through the continuing professional development (CPD) framework, the Scottish Government fully expects all teachers to be able to recognise and know how to support pupils with additional support needs. Teachers should know where to go for specialist support and advice with regard to the educational provision for pupils to ensure that the appropriate assessments, interventions and strategies can be put in place. There is no single best approach.</p>

  <p>Later this year the Scottish Government will publish an early years framework in partnership with COSLA (Convention of Scottish Local Authorities). Within the context of the concordat it will be for local authorities and their community planning partners to deliver the outcome that &quot;our children have the best start in life and are ready to succeed&quot;. It will also highlight the need for high quality pre-school and early school education provision and support.</p>

  <p>Credit unions have important roles in encouraging members to save in times of financial difficulties and in providing them with access to affordable credit, particularly for those who may not be able to access mainstream financial services and products. Many credit unions allow members to save through payroll deductions as well as paying in cash and benefits direct. Additionally, a number of them promote financial capability by facilitating budgeting skills workshops for members.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is taking a significant number of steps to help support children with dyslexia including the following:</p>

  <p>We are developing The Early Years Framework with COSLA, which is about moving from intervention when a crisis happens towards prevention, building resilience and providing the right level of support before problems materialise. The framework will also highlight the need for high quality pre-school and early education provision and support. We are looking to publish the Early Years Framework later this year.</p>

  <p>We are supporting the Scottish Teacher Education Committee (STEC) Action Plan &ndash; <em>Framework for Inclusion, </em>a two year action plan to take forward inclusive education in Initial Teacher Education and Continuous Professional Development.</p>

  <p>We are currently in discussions with Dyslexia Scotland to undertake work to identify and provide advice on the most effective assessment tools/techniques that would help teachers plan appropriate programmes of support for the learner.</p>

  <p>We launched and disseminated last year, the Scottish Government funded University of Edinburgh interactive training DVD to promote dyslexia awareness in secondary schools and help facilitate the transition from primary to secondary school.</p>

  <p>Curriculum for Excellence identifies literacy skills as a key theme across the curriculum with all teachers having a role in promoting language and literacy development; it also puts the learner at the heart of everything that we do.</p>

  <p>Finally, I would be happy to meet with Ms Baillie to discuss this issue in more detail.</p>

  <p>The principal advisor to the UK Governments on the health effects of radiation, including the low frequency electromagnetic fields from power lines, is the UK Health Protection Agency. In 2004 the Agency published a <em>Review of the Scientific Evidence for Limiting Exposure to Electromagnetic Fields</em> and related <em>Advice on Limiting Exposure to Electromagnetic Fields</em> . The conclusions of this review are in keeping with related health advice from the World Health Organization.</p>

  <p>The public inquiry into the proposed Beauly to Denny 400kV transmission line heard evidence from a number of expert witnesses on the issue of potential health hazards. This evidence, and the reporter&rsquo;s conclusions, will be reported to ministers who will take all material considerations into account when making a determination on the application.</p>

  <p>From 1 May 2005 new build construction, conversions and alterations to buildings in Scotland must comply with the Building (Scotland) Regulations 2004. These new regulations contain a mandatory requirement for the installation of automatic fire safety suppression systems in enclosed shopping centres; residential care buildings; high rise domestic buildings, or where it forms the whole or part of a sheltered housing complex.</p>

  <p>In projects approved for grant funding since the implementation of this requirement, costs of sprinkler systems where required by the Building Regulations (e.g. Sheltered Housing) would be considered by Scottish Government Investment Division as grant eligible and they would be included when assessing individual projects. We do not hold information on how many projects have had systems included within approved costs.</p>

  <p>The standard does not apply retrospectively. We have not provided any grants to Registered Social Landlords for the installation of sprinkler systems in existing developments.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to involving the whole of Scottish society in its work, and does so through mechanisms such as public consultation and by drawing on the specialist knowledge and expertise which particular individuals with experience of the private, public and third sectors have to offer.</p>

  <p>This approach to government is exemplified not only by the National Conversation, which has reached out to citizens and communities across Scotland, but also by the work of independent bodies such as the Scottish Broadcasting Commission (both Henry McLeish and Chris Ballance served as members of the Scottish Broadcasting Commission, as did two former MPs - Lord Fraser of Carmyllie and the late Baroness Michie of Gallanach) and the Scottish Prisons Commission (chaired by Henry McLeish).</p>

  <p>In my statement to Parliament on 5 March 2008, I explained that I could not give an exact cost for the railway, because to announce a headline number would prejudice commercial negotiations. Inflation forecasts are subject to especial uncertainty in the current economic circumstances. For these reasons it would not be prudent to provide any further cost information on the Borders Railway project at this stage.</p>

  <p>The Baillie wind farm application is being considered in accordance with the Environmental Impact Assessment (Scotland) Regulations 2000. The statutory consultation exercise, provided all parties with the opportunity to make representations. We have received 28 consultee responses and 1083 public representations.
