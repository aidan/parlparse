  <p>The Scottish Executive is aware of a substantial volume of research on meat, vegetables and dairy produce. I understand, however, that Mr Hamilton is interested in the use of edible protein in dealing with waste from creameries. The Scottish Executive is not aware of any research on the development of edible protein for this purpose, but whey and other by-products from creameries are already permitted for use as animal feedingstuffs.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what areas of Scotland are not at risk of groundwater contamination from sheep dip and pesticide disposal and why the risk is greater in some areas than in others.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-09-04.S1W-8750.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80134" speakername="Sarah Boyack" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa0904.htm#8749">

  <p>Spent sheep dip and pesticides are potentially dangerous, even at very low concentrations. Groundwater, once polluted, can remain contaminated for many years. Groundwater is particularly at risk from illegal disposal and poor operational controls during sheep dipping and the handling of pesticides. The information on which to base an estimate of the percentage of groundwater supplies at risk from such activities is not held centrally. However, as groundwater is ubiquitous and there are few areas of Scotland where neither sheep farming nor arable farming is practised, there is potentially a risk that these dangerous chemicals could enter groundwater in most areas if adequate precautions are not taken.</p>

  <p>The disposal of these and other waste agrochemicals to land requires an authorisation to be sought from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency under the Groundwater Regulations 1998. This process is designed to ensure that suitable areas of land are selected to receive waste sheep dip and agrochemicals. Provided an authorisation is granted and farmers comply with the conditions specified therein, the risk to groundwater should be minimal.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the next European Union Structural Fund programme can be used to provide funding for investment in information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure, equipment and initiatives in Scotland and, if so, how will it ensure that each of the programme areas invests in ICT.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-09-04.S1W-9026.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80201" speakername="Mr Jack McConnell" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa0904.htm#9026">

  <p>Generally, investment in information and communication technology is a matter for the private sector in line with regulatory and commercial considerations.</p>

  <p>However, the Special Transitional Programme for the Highlands &amp; Islands includes provision for limited support to ICT development, including infrastructure in remote areas, where the needs of the area cannot be met by commercial interests alone. The programme sets specific targets for all activities and the Programme Monitoring Committee is charged with ensuring that these are met.</p>

  <p>Promoting ICT development is also embedded in the plans for the three Objective 2 areas in terms of business development and innovation, particularly focused on schemes of support for SMEs. Support will also be available for the development of community ICT provisions. Direct costs of infrastructure development will not be met through the Objective 2 programmes.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Objective 3 Operational Programme includes as a horizontal theme across all of its vertical priorities the promotion and development of the information society, particularly in the context of access to the labour market and information and communications technology skills in the workforce.</p>

  <p>Of the extra &pound;12 million for rough sleeping and homelessness initiatives, &pound;8 million came from the end-year flexibility central reserve and the remaining &pound;4 million from the additional money allocated to Scottish Assigned Budget as a consequence of the UK Budget announced in March 2000.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what resources will be allocated to rough sleeping as a result of the &pound;34 million central reserve spending on health-related initiatives announced on 4 July 2000 and whether any such resources will be additional to, or part of, the extra &pound;12 million funding for rough sleeping and homelessness initiatives announced on 1 June 2000.</p>

  <p>A sum of &pound;8 million from the central reserve was allocated to rough sleeping and homelessness initiatives and was included in the &pound;12 million announced on 1 June. None of this money comes from the &pound;34 million which was the subject of an announcement on 4 July 2000. Some &pound;10 million was announced on 4 July to assist long-term care of the elderly. The remaining amount will go into health related spending, but no firm decisions have yet been made on this.</p>

  <p>The Executive is funding courses to equip teachers to deliver their specialist subject through the medium of Gaelic. Nine teachers attended the course in 1999.</p>

  <p>Education authorities have indicated that they would wish to employ more teachers for Gaelic-medium education.</p>

  <p>In September 1998 there were an estimated 195 full-time equivalent secondary school teachers who regarded Gaelic as their main subject qualification. Primary school teachers are not categorised by subject.</p>

  <p>The Leirsinn survey, <i>The Availability of Gaelic-speaking Teachers (summer 1997)</i> found that in 1997 there were 101 primary school teachers in Gaelic-medium education, 25 secondary school teachers, and 38 supply teachers (21 primary and 17 secondary).</p>

  <p>No estimates of requirements for teachers of Gaelic have been made centrally. Education authorities have estimated the numbers of additional teachers, including replacements, for Gaelic-medium education required over the next seven years. These estimates amount to:</p>

  <p>Primary 150</p>

  <p>Secondary 70</p>

  <p>Two thirds of the notified demand was from the Highland Council and Comhairle nan Eilean Siar.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Higher Education Funding Council (SHEFC) is responsible for setting student intake levels to courses of initial teacher education (ITE). Each year the Executive provides guidance to SHEFC on ITE, setting out our strategic objectives for teacher education and supply. We have indicated to SHEFC that the supply of teachers able to teach in Gaelic medium education is a priority and have asked SHEFC to assist in promoting provision in this area. To help SHEFC consider how the need for Gaelic medium teachers might be met, the Executive has asked local authorities to identify their requirements. Last year authorities indicated a need for around 150 newly trained teachers for primary Gaelic medium over the next seven years and around 70 for secondary Gaelic medium over the same period. We are at the moment collecting updated information from authorities about their requirements in order that this can be provided in guidance to SHEFC for session 2001-02. It will be for SHEFC to consider how these future requirements for newly trained teachers can be met.</p>

  <p>Comunn na Gaidhlig with funding from the Executive is conducting a publicity campaign, including leaflets, a video and a Gaelic careers conference, to attract potential recruits into Gaelic medium teaching; it has also discussed with the Teacher Education Institutions their admissions policies.</p>

  <p>The removal and retention of organs and tissues from children who died in Yorkhill Hospital has raised questions which are both complex and distressing. I recently met senior representatives of the Yorkhill NHS Trust who are currently checking and validating information on retained organs and tissue.</p>

  <p>For the parents concerned, the matter is extremely distressing and our overwhelming concerns must be for them. I shall be meeting bereaved parents and their representatives this week. All staff concerned now recognise that previous procedures in relation to the removal and retention of organs were unsatisfactory and that widespread grief and distress resulted. Following these meetings, I expect to make a further announcement about the steps to be taken to support parents and address their concerns.</p>

  <p>The Mineworker&#8217;s Pension Scheme is a reserved matter.</p>

  <p>The Department for Trade and Industry, as guarantor, receives half of any valuation surplus in the scheme. In return, the DTI guarantees that pensions will always rise in line with inflation and will never fall in cash terms. As a result of the most recent MPS valuation, 27,000 or so members resident in Scotland will enjoy a pension increase of approximately 9% above and beyond inflation.</p>

  <p>I understand that the DTI has no statutory powers to hypothecate its coal pension receipts for the purposes of regenerating former mining areas. However, the Scottish Executive is committed to regeneration and in addition to the programmes tackling the problems of deprived areas and to promote social inclusion, the Coalfields Regeneration Trust in Scotland has been allocated &pound;4.5 million over three years.</p>

  <p>Scottish Ministers have wide powers of entry, inspection, control of movement and slaughter with associated compensation - all of which can be used at an early stage to prevent the disease taking a hold in Scotland.</p>

  <p>As regards the current outbreak in England, the reassessment by the Standing Veterinary Committee of the situation in the UK is reassuring. Accordingly the danger of spread to Scottish pig producers is now very much contained and we can rely on the existing statutory controls.</p>

  <p>These arrangements would of course be reviewed in the event of any further outbreak to protect the Scottish herd from infection.</p>

  <p>Scottish Borders Council has submitted an application to the third round of the Public Transport Fund for the cost of securing the necessary permissions for reinstating the railway between Edinburgh and the Central Borders. I will consider that carefully alongside other applications to the fund. Thereafter the promoters of the railway would be able to seek additional public and private funding from various sources for the capital costs of the project itself. The Scottish Borders Railway Feasibility Study, funded by the Executive and other key stakeholders in the project, provides a wealth of information to underpin any such application.</p>

  <p>We will shortly be consulting on strategic priorities for Scotland&#8217;s railways as part of the process of developing directions and guidance to the Strategic Rail Authority on the franchise for passenger rail services that start and end in Scotland. During this process we will give consideration to a wide range of issues, including proposals for additions to the passenger rail network such as the reinstatement of the Borders railway.</p>

  <p>The Education (Scotland) Act 1980 permits student support payments to be made only in respect of persons attending courses of education. Therefore to be eligible for support from the Student Awards Agency for Scotland, students must be registered as attending a course of higher education. Students who are only temporarily absent from their courses because they are too ill to attend or for some other reason as agreed with the academic authorities, including pregnancy or caring for a sick relative, can continue to receive support through the student support system. This includes Access Funds and the Hardship Loan as appropriate. Support can be continued in such cases until the student is able to resume or, in the case of a sick student, until they have been absent for 28 weeks at which time sick students become eligible for income support.</p>

  <p>The situation is different where a student temporarily withdraws from the course for whatever reason. In these circumstances the student has taken a decision to temporarily cease his or her studies. As he or she is no longer a registered student in attendance on a course, support under the student support arrangements cannot continue.</p>

  <p>Students who have to interrupt their studies either because of illness or caring duties are eligible to claim Job Seekers&#8217; Allowance from the date of recovery from illness or from the date the caring responsibility ends.</p>

  <p>In determining whether student support can continue, the Awards Agency considers each case individually.</p>

  <p>Representatives from the Students Awards Agency for Scotland meet with members of the higher education sector on a regular basis. Issues such as this have been raised during these discussions.</p>

  <p>Students are responsible for informing the agency of any change in their circumstances. This responsibility is highlighted in the agency&#8217;s annual booklet <i>Student Support in Scotland - A Guide for Undergraduate Students</i>. It is also included in the Letters of Award which are issued to all students supported by the agency. Once advised of change, the agency will explain to the student the consequences for their entitlement to support.</p>

  <p>In order to make the position as clear as possible for students and their representatives from next year, the booklet <i>Student Support in Scotland - A Guide for Undergraduate Students</i> will provide a detailed explanation of the support available to those who have to take a break from full-time study.</p>

  <p>The only discrete transport allocations (capital grants and loans) are those made available from the Public Transport Fund and ongoing commitments from the previous Government&#8217;s Transport Challenge Fund. The table below shows the total awards announced for the years in question to authorities in the Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive area, and the percentage of those allocations of the total available from the fund. No percentage is shown for 2001-02 since the allocations shown for this year relate only to those awards announced in earlier years that run into 2001-02. Bids to the next round of the Public Transport Fund for projects commencing in 2001-02 are currently being considered and announcements on successful projects will be made in due course.</p>

  <p>When the application for Transport Challenge Fund support was submitted to the Scottish Office in June 1996, the council envisaged that the private sector contribution would be &pound;28.5 million. The precise amount of private sector investment in any contract agreed is a matter for City of Edinburgh Council.</p>

  <p>Funding for the City of Edinburgh Rapid Transit Scheme has been made available from the Transport Challenge Fund. The resources from this fund form part of the local authority non-housing capital allocation provision. The council has therefore been issued with consent under section 94 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973.</p>

  <p>This is a matter for the City of Edinburgh Council. The Scottish Executive is represented alongside the City of Edinburgh Council and Scottish Enterprise Edinburgh and Lothians on the Edinburgh Waterfront Monitoring Group. This group has identified traffic and transport issues as key aspects of the comprehensive area redevelopment proposals.</p>
