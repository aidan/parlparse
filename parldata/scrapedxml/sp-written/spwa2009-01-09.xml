  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, with reference to the Accounts Commission report <em>The impact of the race equality duty on council services</em> , what steps are being taken to address the recommendation that the Scottish Government should ensure the availability of more up-to-date and useful social and demographic data on minority ethnic communities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has work underway to improve the range and quality of equality information across the public sector. This work includes promoting the use of harmonised questions on ethnic groups which will allow for comparison of data from different sources. The Scottish Government is currently investigating the possibility of ethnic minority boosts to large scale social surveys. Work on this project is likely to start in spring 2009.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is aware of the increase in men reporting domestic abuse to the police and whether perpetrated by men or women, domestic abuse is never acceptable.</p>

  <p>Men who contact the Scottish domestic abuse helpline as a victim of domestic abuse will be listened to and referred onto a service dedicated to supporting male victims of domestic abuse.</p>

  <p>There are many professional agencies that can be accessed by victims of domestic abuse, regardless of gender, such as police and other legal services, NHSScotland and local authority social work and housing services etc.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the Scottish Government undertook research in 2002 which indicated that there was no demand for specialist services for men and that men were not making use of existing services.</p>

  <p>However, we continue to keep this matter under review and should the situation change with regard to need for specialist services for men, then we will consider what response is appropriate.</p>

  <p>The drop in the use by the courts of DTTOs in 2007-08 is disappointing, although fluctuations from year to year are to be expected. The position across Scotland also varies significantly from area to area and we are therefore asking the Chief Officers of the Community Justice Authorities to assess the situation within their own areas with a view to identifying what steps may be needed locally to encourage courts to make greater use of this order.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-18729 on 9 January 2009. Our commitment to Drug Treatment and Testing Orders (DTTOs) remains strong. We are contacting the Chief Officers of the Community Justice Authorities to ask them to assess what measures are needed in their areas to encourage courts to make greater use of this order. In addition, we are piloting the use of DTTOs for lower tariff offenders in the majority of the courts in Lothians and Borders. The pilot, which started in June 2008 for a two year period, will be subject to independent evaluation.</p>

  <p>Drug Treatment and Testing Orders (DTTOs) are high tariff disposals, which make stringent demands on a very challenging client group. Offenders on DTTOs are subject to monthly review hearings by the court, which provides opportunity for issues of non-compliance, where these occur, to be dealt with at an early stage. Where a breach is formally reported to the court, it is for the court to determine what sanction should be applied.</p>

  <p>As we indicated in our strategy for the management of offenders <em>Protecting Scotland&rsquo;s Communities</em> we are currently piloting the use of DTTOs for lower tariff offenders, and will revisit the current sentences for drug related offending after that pilot is complete in 2010.</p>

  <p>More generally, and in line with the new national drugs strategy <em>The Road to Recovery</em>, we are seeking to ensure that all services providing treatment and rehabilitation for people with problem drug use, including those subject to DTTOs, have the individual&rsquo;s recovery as their explicit aim. As stated in the strategy, this requires that a range of appropriate treatment and rehabilitation services must be available at a local level. In the longer term, services which more effectively promote recovery should make a positive contribution to the successful completion rate of DTTOs.</p>

  <p>Information on the average waiting time of clients for drug treatment interventions at hospital level is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>A national waiting times information framework was implemented in April 2004 to enable Alcohol and Drug Action Teams (ADATs) and local services, NHS, local authority and voluntary sector, to monitor waiting times for drug treatment and care in their local area. ADATs send aggregated data to Information Services (ISD) on a quarterly basis, and ISD submit reports to the Scottish Government each quarter (these may be viewed on <a href="http://www.drugmisuse.isdscotland.org/wtpilot/reports.htm)" target="_blank">http://www.drugmisuse.isdscotland.org/wtpilot/reports.htm)</a>.</p>

  <p>NHS Lothian is covered by (1) East Lothian ADAT, (2) City of Edinburgh ADAT (3) Midlothian ADAT and (4) West Lothian ADAT.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Time between date care plan is agreed/decision on treatment is made/date client ready for treatment and the first appointment date offered for any intervention (for those offered an intervention date during the reporting period).</p>

  <p>2. Time between date care plan is agreed/decision on treatment is made/date client ready for treatment and the end of the reporting period (for those still waiting to be offered an intervention date).</p>

  <p>3. The interventions include: structured preparatory and motivational intervention, prescribed drug treatment, community support/rehabilitation and residential detoxification/rehabilitation.</p>

  <p>4. Caution is recommended when interpreting these statistics as the number of services submitting data varies significantly from area to area.</p>

  <p>5. Data was not provided from Edinburgh City for the quarter July to September 2008 due to data quality issues.</p>

  <p>The member may also wish to note that the Scottish Government recently announced that there would be a measure in the NHS HEAT system for 2009-10 to offer drug misusers faster access to appropriate treatment to support their recovery.</p>

  <p>The specific factors contributing to this increase are not easy to identify, although there was an increase in 2007-08 in the overall number of orders given. Breach rates fluctuate from year to year and also from order to order. Criminal justice social work practice in relation to breach applications is determined by the framework set out in National Objectives and Standards for the service.</p>

  <p>We are taking further steps to reduce breach by more pro-active sentence management. The proposals we announced on 17 December in response to the report of the Scottish Prisons Commission set out our plans for regular sentence review as part of the new Community Payback Sentence. In addition the aim is to speed up and simplify how breaches are handled.</p>

  <p>It will not be possible to eliminate breach but the intention is to send strong signals to offenders who fail to comply with the terms of their sentence that such behaviour will not be tolerated.</p>

  <p>There are many factors behind breach rates as recorded in the statistics, including more stringent reporting of breaches. Many breaches relate to failure to observe exactly the terms of the order - for example, turning up late to a work placement or failing to notify a change of address. In 2007-08, the courts revoked an order and imposed a custodial sentence in relation to only 17% of reported breaches.</p>

  <p>In 2007-08 the number of breach applications made in respect of Supervised Attendance Orders increased by 17%. However, this was against the backdrop of a 46% increase in the number of such orders that same year, which suggests that the overall breach ratio of breaches to orders made reduced.</p>

  <p>We announced on 17 December our intention to replace the existing sentences of Community Service, Probation and the Supervised Attendance Order with a single Community Payback Sentence. Judges will have power to set review hearings to monitor progress on the new sentence, so that problems can be picked up and dealt with as early as possible.</p>

  <p>None. How investigations are carried out is a matter for the police, and it would be inappropriate for ministers to seek to influence the way in which an investigation is conducted.</p>

  <p>The operational independence of the police is enshrined in law. I believe that we have the right level of checks and balances in place in respect of that independence, through the role of procurators fiscal and their power to direct the police in specific investigations where circumstances dictate that to be appropriate, and the power of the Lord Advocate to issue instructions to chief constables with regard to the reporting of offences alleged to have been committed.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Prisoners coming into custody are assessed for Substance Misuse issues, which include alcohol-related problems. Prisoners with an identified need are offered medical intervention, groupwork and one to one motivational support.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Prison Service (SPS) offers an Alcohol Awareness Programme at Aberdeen, Barlinnie, Cornton Vale, Edinburgh, Glenochil, Greenock, Inverness, Perth, Peterhead, Polmont and Shotts prisons. While this can be delivered in open prisons the SPS believes it is better that prisoners&rsquo; needs are addressed prior to being transferred to an open prison. SPS also operates a Substance Related Offending Behaviour Programme for offenders with either alcohol and/or drug issues that consists of around 120 hours of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. This is for very high, high and medium risk offenders and is currently being delivered in Aberdeen, Cornton Vale, Barlinnie, Edinburgh, Glenochil, Polmont and Shotts prisons.</p>

  <p>Access to Alcoholics Anonymous and other community agencies providing services in prison are also available.</p>

  <p>Regulation 14 of the Education (Student Loans) (Scotland) Regulations 2007 effectively provides that that the interest rate applied to Income Contingent Loans is to be the lower of:</p>

  <p>(i) a rate equal to the annual percentage increase in the retail price index (RPI)</p>

  <p>(&quot;the RPI rate&quot;), or</p>

  <p>(ii) the highest of the base rates used by a pool of banks (including the Bank of</p>

  <p>England) plus 1% (&quot;the Base Rate&quot;).</p>

  <p>The recent reduction in the base rates of all of the banks in the pool to 2% has resulted in the RPI rate of 3.8% (for the year from 1 September 2008 to 31 August 2009) exceeding the Base Rate of 3% (2%+1%). This means that the interest rate applied to Income Contingent Loans has reduced from 3.8% to 3% as of 5 December 2008.</p>

  <p>Mortgage style loans are governed by different regulations than ICR Loans. These regulations which are made under the Education Student Loans Act 1990 do not require or allow the interest rate applied to mortgage style loans to change in line with any reductions in the Base Rate, so the RPI rate (3.8%) will still apply for the rest of the financial year.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to announce the new rates of support for students in further and higher education for academic year 2009-10. I am today placing in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre details of the rates of those loans, bursaries and grants, which will be available to eligible undergraduate and postgraduate students in full-time higher education.</p>

  <p>A general uprating factor of 2.6%, in line with inflation, will be applied to the existing schemes of support in 2009-10, thus maintaining their value in real terms.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Funding Council (SFC) has also agreed to maintain the alignment between the further and higher education sectors by, where appropriate, uprating the support available to further education students by 2.6%.</p>

  <p>A copy of these rates is also being placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 47190).</p>
