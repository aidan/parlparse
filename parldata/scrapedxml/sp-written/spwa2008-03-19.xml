  <p>The Scottish Government does not intend to meet the full costs of refurbishment of the Royal Commonwealth Pool (RCP).</p>

  <p>When Scotland submitted its bid document for the 2014 Commonwealth Games, it was necessary for the Scottish Government to give a guarantee that the diving competition facility would comply with the regulations set out by the Commonwealth Games Federation. The RCP is listed in the bid document as the venue to host the diving event.</p>

  <p>I understand that Edinburgh Council&rsquo;s independent review suggested that the Scottish Government should pay for the total cost of redeveloping the Commonwealth Pool if the council cannot find the funds. It should not be assumed that the government will meet these costs given that the proposal to develop the pool was planned prior to the Glasgow bid. It would be unrealistic to expect Government to support the full cost of any one project.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is currently committed to the &pound;4 million allocated against the RCP development through Stage 1 of the National Regional Facility Strategy.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has provided the Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) with a revenue allocation of &pound;183.4 million for 2008-09, an increase of 3.15% over the equivalent 2007-08 allocation. Decisions on funding levels for 2009-10 and 2010-11 have yet to be made.</p>

  <p>The SAS is allocated capital resources based on their approved financial plans. They have been given a capital allocation of &pound;15.18 million for 2008-09 and notified of indicative capital allocations of &pound;13.2 million and &pound;12.35 million for 2009-10 and 2010-11 respectively. Funding for vehicles and equipment programmes over &pound;5 million (such as defibrillators) are allocated in addition to basic allocations following approval of required business cases by the Capital Investment Group.</p>

  <p>The service replaces one seventh of it&rsquo;s accident and emergency units and one tenth of its patient transport units each year at an annual capital cost of &pound;8 million. Increasingly, the service is investing in fast response units, which are typically cars or Standard Utility Vehicles (4x4&rsquo;s) staffed by paramedics. This allows quicker face to face assessment and if necessary quicker treatment at scene. Over the next year the SAS intends to invest in a further 70 fast response units.</p>

  <p>We have signed a historic concordat with local government that provides record levels of funding of &pound;34.9 billion over the spending review period. This represents an increase of 13.1%.

  <p>In July 2007, we announced an additional &pound;40 million of capital grant across Scotland for financial year 2007-08 linked to future capital expenditure arising from possible implications for buildings of class size reduction. Glasgow City Council&rsquo;s share was &pound;2.174 million.</p>

  <p>Our concordat with local government provides record levels of funding over the next three financial years, including significant growth in the capital resources being made available to local authorities. In 2008-09, local government capital increases by &pound;115 million or 13% and that increase is then held up to 2010-11. In total, almost &pound;3 billion is being provided over the three year period to secure investment in schools and other local authority infrastructure.</p>

  <p>This Scottish Government and local government have a joint commitment to the reduction of primary 1 to primary 3 classes to a maximum of 18 as set out in our historic concordat. The concordat exemplifies the new relationship we have with local government based on mutual respect and partnership.

  <p>Most behavioural change programmes for men who perpetrate domestic abuse in Scotland are delivered as part of an integrated criminal justice response to engage offenders made the subject of a probation order.</p>

  <p>Development work has been underway for some time to design a court-mandated domestic abuse perpetrator programme (known as the Caledonian System) which meets the standards set by the Scottish Accreditation Panel for Offender Programmes.</p>

  <p>Building on the accreditation process of the Caledonian System, we will support the development of a non court-mandated perpetrator programme manual, which will draw on the Manual for the Caledonian Programme and on findings from the evaluation of the Working with Men pilot project in Edinburgh.</p>

  <p>This work, which will support effective practice development across Scotland in relation to non-court mandated programmes for men, will be taken forward as part of the National Domestic Abuse Delivery Plan for Children and Young People.</p>

  <p>The Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 1995 would require an employer to report certain categories of accidents to the relevant enforcing authority, in this case the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). In the case of a person at work this includes:</p>

  <p>(a) any fatality arising out of his/her work,</p>

  <p>(b) a major injury as defined,</p>

  <p>(c) an injury requiring that person to be taken to hospital for treatment, and</p>

  <p>(d) an injury resulting in that person being unable to do his/her normal work for three days.</p>

  <p>For a person not at work, which includes pupils or students, then it is reportable if a person receives an injury requiring that person to be taken to hospital for treatment.</p>

  <p>Although the HSE collate statistics on accidents at work, it would not be possible to identify the numbers of accidents caused by the use of hoisting equipment in schools.</p>

  <p>I am today publishing the Scottish Government&rsquo;s response to the Gould Report, and a consultation paper on decoupling the Scottish Parliamentary and local government elections. They are available on the Scottish Government&rsquo;s website <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/216411 and http://www.scotland.gov.uk/216422" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/216411 and http://www.scotland.gov.uk/216422</a> .</p>

  <p>The Gould Report demonstrates that the Scottish electoral system is fragmented and antiquated, with no clear lines of accountability for its management or to the people of Scotland. The Scottish Government believes that the Gould Report represents a unique opportunity to introduce the radical reforms necessary to address these underlying problems.</p>

  <p>With this Parliament, the Scottish Government believes that the key step would be for clear and coherent responsibility for legislation and management of elections in Scotland to rest with the Scottish Government and the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Government believes this is the most practical way to improve the management of elections, and would provide democratic accountability to the people of Scotland in line with the principles of devolution.</p>

  <p>As well as this fundamental recommendation, the Scottish Government plans to take forward the other recommendations of the Gould Report. Today we are publishing a consultation paper on decoupling the Parliamentary and local elections. Further consultations will follow on the role of the Chief Returning Officer and on the design of ballot papers and other issues. The Scottish Government is determined that all decisions will be taken in good time for the next elections, and the problems experienced last May will not be repeated.</p>

  <p>It is the responsibility of each local authority to decide on its own budgetary requirements and, as a result, the information requested is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>This government is, however, investing record levels of funding in local government, as well as giving them more freedom and flexibility to spend their resources as they decide, to meet the national priorities and individual local needs and circumstances under our shared framework of national outcomes as set out in the jointly signed concordat. This means that local government should have sufficient resources not just to maintain, but also improve, the front-line services their constituents need and deserve.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) has powers under the Environment Act 1995 to carry out research and related activities into matters relevant to its functions. SEPA may use its resources to procure these services from other organisations or individuals with the necessary skills and experience. SEPA also has a general power to do anything which, in its opinion, is calculated to facilitate or is conducive or incidental to, the carrying out of its functions. SEPA does not routinely distribute funds for other purposes.</p>

  <p>We recognise the valuable services wardens provide in sheltered housing schemes around Scotland, but also that there are other ways of providing support to residents of sheltered housing. In response to a number of developments, notably the EU Working Time Directive, sheltered housing providers and those commissioning services are considering other methods of supporting older people in sheltered and mainstream housing. Telecare services and visiting support are becoming more widespread alternatives. Local authorities and other providers are best placed to determine which services will provide the best and most cost effective way of supporting older people to maintain independent living in their areas.</p>

  <p>Local authorities should consider the housing and support needs of older people when drawing up their Local Housing Strategies to ensure there is sufficient suitable housing and provision of support to enable older people to maintain independent living. Support may be provided in a number of ways, including through warden services, visiting support and the provision of telecare and community alarm systems. It is for local authorities to decide which forms of support will provide the best ways of helping older people in their local areas.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government published research on sheltered housing <em>Review of Sheltered Housing in Scotland</em> in January 2008. This can be viewed at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/01/11131906/28" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/01/11131906/28</a> .</p>

  <p>The research provides a comprehensive picture of sheltered housing provision in Scotland and an evidence base for further work on older people&rsquo;s housing which is now being taken forward. No further research on sheltered housing is planned at this time.</p>
