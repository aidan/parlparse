  <p>The Scottish Government has not provided direct financial support to the campaign to retain the Moray bases. Scottish Government ministers and officials have worked very closely with the task force and other public sector partners to ensure the best outcome for Scotland. In addition, we are taking steps to address the impact of the planned closure of Kinloss. The First Minister announced a &pound;300,000 package of skills and training support for Moray on 22 December 2010. This will provide alternative training opportunities for individuals made redundant or at threat of redundancy following the announcements made in the Ministry of Defence Strategic Defence and Security Review. The Scottish Government will continue to work closely with the Moray Task Force to respond effectively to the planned withdrawal of the RAF from Kinloss and to ensure that robust representations are made to the UK Government for securing the future of RAF Lossiemouth.</p>

  <p>Decisions on elective time in the school week for specific learning activities are the responsibility of curriculum planners at the local level.</p>

  <p><em>Building the Curriculum 3: A framework for learning and teaching </em>supports curriculum planning at the local level, providing a framework within which schools and their partners have autonomy and responsibility for planning a programme which meets the needs of each learner. It sets out the experiences which contribute to learning and expectations on outcomes for young people, rather than detailed definitions of prescribed hours of study. However, the framework does stress the expectation that young people are entitled to two hours of quality physical education per week.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-14190 by Maureen Watt on 25 June 2008, what further action has been taken to encourage global citizenship in schools and ensure that children&rsquo;s education has a European and international dimension.</p>

  <p>Since June 2008, considerable progress has been made to encourage global citizenship in schools and ensure that children&rsquo;s education has an European and international dimension. Global citizenship is encouraged and promoted in a variety of ways and many outstanding examples of practice are detailed in HM Inspectorate of Education&rsquo;s guide, <em>International Education: Responsible, Global </em> Citizens, published on 4 February 2010.</p>

  <p>Global citizenship is now fully embedded across the curriculum and ensures that our young people are ready to play a full and active part in society - politically, socially, economically, environmentally and culturally. Learning and Teaching Scotland (LTS) and partners have provided a range of support materials, resources and continuing professional development opportunities for this work.</p>

  <p>The Year of Homecoming in 2009 successfully used Scotland&rsquo;s history, culture and heritage to enable young people to build a sense of pride in their identity and develop an understanding of Scotland&rsquo;s place in an increasingly globalised world. Global citizenship is also being encouraged as part of the Commonwealth Games Legacy for Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government continues its support for the Scottish Centre for Information on Language Teaching and Research (SCILT). SCILT provides continuing professional development opportunities for all languages practitioners and works in conjunction with other bodies, such as the Scottish European Education Trust and cultural organisations, to promote European language and culture learning and teaching.</p>

  <p>LTS is also promoting a knowledge of Chinese language and culture through the development of the Confucius Classroom Hub programme, of which there are now 10 hubs covering 15 local authorities.</p>

  <p>The distribution formula for the 2011-12 local government finance settlements has already been agreed with COSLA. It includes a floor to limit the year-on-year change in councils&rsquo; allocations. The change suggested would cost around &pound;120 million a year to implement and that would either have to be found by cutting funding to other councils or by reducing budgets of other portfolios. However, we are always open to suggestions for improving the formula as part of the consultation process for future settlements.</p>

  <p>Turbine selection is a matter for developers and technical information on the parameters within which specific models are designed to operate is not held centrally by the Scottish Government. This may vary from model to model. Turbine manufacturers can generally supply this information on request. It should be noted that large wind turbines have been deployed successfully in cold climates including Alaska.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally by the Scottish Government, which does not monitor the performance of individual wind turbines. Energy statistics for the United Kingdom are collated and published by the Department of Energy and Climate Change. Research into wind energy in cold climates has been carried out by the International Energy Agency and suggests that severe wintry weather has only a minimal impact on the performance of appropriately designed turbines.</p>

  <p>Local roads authorities, and Transport Scotland, have a statutory duty to manage and maintain all roads within their area. For Transport Scotland, this responsibility is for the trunk road network. The statutory duty is outlined in Section 1 of the Roads Scotland Act 1984 and these duties are intrinsic to the overall road safety effort.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has not issued guidelines on matters which are best judged and decided locally. In a letter of 2 December 2010 to Directors of Education, I drew local authorities&rsquo; attention to areas of good practice regarding such decisions. A copy of the letter is available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 52270).</p>

  <p>It is for schools and/or authorities to decide on the opening or closure of schools, in consideration of the health and safety of staff and pupils, in light of locally prevailing or forecast conditions.</p>

  <p>The armed forces have made a valuable contribution to Scotland&rsquo;s winter resilience, assisting a number of Scottish communities during the recent period of severe weather. Whilst the Scottish Government assisted responder organisations by providing them with guidance on the process to be followed in making a request for military assistance, requests were not made by the Scottish Government and the assistance itself was approved by the UK Government. Therefore, the information sought is not held by the Scottish Government and is a matter for the UK Government.</p>

  <p>Individual responder organisations are responsible for training and preparing their own staff, and therefore information on emergency planning simulation exercises carried out by transport planning authorities and the NHS is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does however provide (largely through the Scottish Resilience Development Service) multi-agency training and exercising opportunities for responders. Scottish emergency planning and response is based on the principles of integrated emergency management which focuses on the effects of events rather than their causes. Since 1 February 2010, the Scottish Resilience Development Service has co-ordinated numerous training events and exercises for responders, which will support agencies in planning for, and responding to, to a range of major incidents (including adverse weather) and their consequences.</p>

While there is no legal responsibility for them to do so, we would encourage people to take this kind of practical step to contribute to the winter resilience of their communities.</p>
