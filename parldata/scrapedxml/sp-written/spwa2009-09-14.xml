<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-09-14.S3W-26671.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80396" speakername="Nicola Sturgeon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa0914.htm#1">

  <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service is committed to developing clinical services to patients. This starts from when the caller is connected to the Emergency Medical Dispatch Centre (EMDC) through the on-going enhancement of clinical triage and advice, through to the treatment at scene and onward conveyance to the most clinically appropriate secondary care centre. Specific examples of development include the development of integrated clinical pathways for primary clinical conditions such as Acute Coronary Syndromes (chest pain and heart attack) and stroke.</p>

  <p>The use of &quot;see and treat&quot; protocols continues to develop, allowing some patients to be given treatment and information relevant to their condition and then remain at home when it is clinically safe and appropriate for them to do so. For such patients being taken to hospital is not in their best interests. The service has also produced a variety of patient leaflets for patients and carers following &quot;see and treat&quot;, where it is has been safe to treat patients at home but where additional information is of use. These cover topics such as lower than normal blood glucose levels, nosebleeds, minor wounds, seizures, asthma, fainting and panic attacks.</p>

  <p>In some parts for the country, the service have successfully developed the role of the Community Paramedic; their role is to deliver high quality treatment and care to patients, associated duty of care to other members of the public including the provision of health advice (see and treat) and transportation to appropriate medical facilities, generally in emergency situations, using a range of paramedic skills. In addition to this they may also diagnose, discharge or refer suitable minor injury and/or acute illness patients whilst working on behalf of the ambulance service, GP out-of-hour&rsquo;s service or within a minor injury clinic setting.</p>

  <p>Ambulance staff at all levels are more highly trained and educated than ever before. Ambulance staff training is now aligned to the Paramedic Career Framework and this allows skills to be mapped across the various professional bodies within the NHS. More training is delivered in a multidisciplinary setting for example on the National Education for Scotland course, &quot;Caring for the Acutely Ill child&quot;. The skills and training of ambulance service staff plays an increasing role in the out-of-hours service; this includes greater use of Extended Role Paramedics in unscheduled care, working with colleagues using the professional to professional support line and closer working between ambulance staff and their colleagues in NHS 24.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are responsible for ensuring the provision of safe, sustainable and high quality health care that meets the needs of their patients. They must do so in line with strategic national priorities, ensuring they achieve the annual performance targets that are set out within their Local Delivery Plan and agreed with the Scottish Government. Decisions about the deployment of their resources are operational matters for the Scottish Ambulance Service.</p>

  <p>Following the issue of the Refreshed Strategy for Volunteering within NHSScotland in February 2008 we expect that NHS boards (including the Scottish Ambulance Service) should be doing all they can to attract volunteers to ensure that services of benefit to patients can be maintained. We have given a commitment to keep the mileage rates payable to volunteers under review.</p>

  <p>The Civil Service Code makes it clear that civil servants in the Scottish Government are accountable to Scottish ministers and the role of Civil Servants is to support Scottish ministers in developing and implementing policies and decisions that Scottish ministers judge to be in the best interests of Scotland and its people. There are occasions when Scottish ministers disagree with and would wish to challenge decisions or positions taken by the UK Government, particularly where these appear to Scottish ministers to impact adversely on their devolved responsibilities. They would rightly expect the support of civil servants in presenting and pursuing their views and objectives.</p>

  <p>The process of drafting comprehensive and clear guidance on a national framework for access and entitlement to services has been complex and time consuming. Draft guidance was issued to local authorities and key stakeholders on 26 May. To meet the agreed implementation date of 1 December 2009 it was necessary for comments to be submitted by 17 July; that allowed almost eight weeks consideration by those consulted. The responses to the consultation are currently being considered and will be published on the Scottish Government web pages by the end of September. The Scottish Government and COSLA will jointly issue the final guidance to the same timescale.</p>

  <p>The membership of the Access and Entitlement to Services Working Group is:</p>

  <p>Laura Bannerman, Association of Directors of Social Work (Chair)</p>

  <p>Mike Brown, Association of Directors of Social Work</p>

  <p>Ron Culley, Convention of Scottish Local Authorities</p>

  <p>Jim Pearson, Community Care Providers Scotland</p>

  <p>Kirsty McGrath, Scottish Government</p>

  <p>Peter Knight, Scottish Government</p>

  <p>Jane Arroll, Scottish Government</p>

  <p>Gillian Barclay, Scottish Government</p>

  <p>Shaun Eales, Scottish Government</p>

  <p>Jenny Stevenson, Scottish Government.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is also developing guidance for local health and social care partnerships on measuring outcomes for people with learning disabilities to inform the planning and delivery of services. This will be issued in October.</p>

  <p>Yes. The <em>Better Heart Disease and Stroke Care Action Plan</em> sets out our intention to continue to highlight, on an annual basis, NHS boards&rsquo; performance towards achieving the NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS) standards for stroke. NHS boards are therefore expected to gather the appropriate Scottish Stroke Care Audit (SSCA) data to support this, and to ensure that the SSCA findings are addressed.</p>

  <p>To help this process, the Information Services Division (ISD) of NHS National Services Scotland will integrate audits of pre-hospital and hospital-based stroke care, building on SSCA work, to provide a minimum dataset to reflect performance against NHS QIS stroke standards by December 2009.</p>

  <p>We expect NHS boards to make progress as quickly as possible towards achieving the NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS) stroke standards. I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-26944, on 14 September 2009, which indicates that we will continue to monitor, on an annual basis, NHS boards&rsquo; performance against the standards. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website; the search facility for which can be found at <a href="../../../Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx</a> .</p>

  <p>The <em>Better Heart Disease and Stroke Care Action Plan</em> also recommends that a short life working group of the National Advisory Committee on Stroke should be established to explore the implications of developing a HEAT target relating to stroke unit admissions.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether provisions in the Public Services Reform (Scotland) Bill enable the modification of the Private Rented Housing Panel to allow it to consider other housing issues, such as tenancy deposits.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-09-14.S3W-26854.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80370" speakername="Alex Neil" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa0914.htm#7">

  <p>Where appropriate, the power in section 10 of the Public Services Reform (Scotland) Bill could be used to confer new or modified functions on the Private Rented Housing Panel and committees provided these functions remain broadly consistent with the existing general objects and purposes of the panel and Committees. However, before approving any such proposal, Parliament will need to be satisfied that the provisions will improve the exercise of public functions having regard to efficiency, effectiveness and economy, and that it meets the various pre-conditions. As with any other legislative proposal, Parliament would also need to consider how much such a function would cost and how it might be funded.</p>

  <p>Current work on tenancy deposits considered by stakeholders in the Tenancy Deposit Working Group has shown that the cost of determining tenancy deposit disputes by the committees in their current form is likely to be considerably higher than other approaches. The group has agreed it wishes to examine the appropriate future wider role of the panel in relation to rented housing more generally.</p>

  <p>No formal or informal guidance has been given to the Police regarding enforcement of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005. I wrote to all licensing boards on 3 September stating that, it is particularly important that those responsible for enforcement approach their task with pragmatism and common sense.

  <p>The Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005 provides a framework which gives licensing boards the flexibility to tackle the local problems which effect their communities.

  <p>No specific assessment was made for the new licensing regime as the previous regime provided for the possibility of local variations to be applied by licensing boards to meet local circumstances. The government continues to support the concept of local solutions to local problems and those who wish to sell alcohol in those communities should be prepared to accept their responsibilities to these community. As with the previous licensing regime, licenses issued under the 2005 act are issued in respect of individual premises rather than parent companies.</p>

  <p>We are currently considering new waiting times targets for areas where individuals are not always currently able to access mental health services within 18 weeks.</p>

  <p>We are working to establish by April 2010 a referral to treatment waiting time target for specialist child and adolescent mental health services, and we are also currently giving consideration to establishing a waiting times target for access to psychological therapies.</p>

  <p>In most cases individuals requiring access to mental health services receive treatment well within 18 weeks.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has invested &pound;3 million per year for three years in the Mental Health Collaborative which is specifically tasked to support the NHS to deliver its four mental health HEAT targets.</p>

  <p>This money funds a national team which works with boards on improvements needed to meet the targets, and additional time within boards to enable key board staff to focus on delivering these improvements</p>

  <p>A formal performance management structure is also in place to support delivery of the targets, including a risk assessment process; a regular management board meeting, and performance review visits.</p>

  <p>The detailed information requested is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>Research studies suggest there are around 10,000 people in Scotland with multiple sclerosis (MS). The national MS register which the Information Services Division (ISD) of NHS National Services Scotland has been developing with the MS Society Scotland, with some government funding, will in time provide more accurate data on the incidence and prevalence of the condition.</p>

  <p>There is no specific guidance as to how far people with multiple sclerosis (MS) or other long-term conditions that cause fatigue should have to travel to gain access to specialist services.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is however committed to providing services for long-term conditions such as MS which are fully responsive to the totality of people&rsquo;s needs and are delivered as locally and as speedily as possible, but with ready access to specialist services when needed. We made clear in <em>Better Health, Better Care</em> our support for a Managed Clinical Network (MCN) approach to these conditions, since MCNs balance the need for specialisation with local delivery of services wherever possible.</p>

  <p>This approach is echoed in the development of the &quot;obligate networks&quot; concept in the 2007 report <em>Delivering for Remote and Rural Healthcare</em>. These networks are intended to link Rural General Hospitals with larger centres to support local delivery of care by reducing to a minimum onward referral and travel for patients in remote and rural areas. This work is being taken forward by the Remote and Rural Implementation Group of the North of Scotland Planning Group.</p>

  <p>We expect this overall approach to be encouraged through implementation of the clinical standards for MS which NHS Quality Improvement Scotland expects to publish in final form next month. Regional neurology centres are expected to develop contacts with Community Health Partnerships to facilitate the management of people with MS in the community.</p>

  <p>Information on the number of patients who did not attend (DNA) a first out-patient appointment at a consultant-led clinic in 2007-08 and 2008-09 is provided below. The average cost of a first out-patient appointment in 2007-08 was approximately &pound;110 - the latest available figure.</p>

  <p>To address this issue a HEAT target was introduced in 2008-09 to reduce first outpatient DNAs to 9% as part of the HEAT efficiency saving targets which are due to be delivered at the end of March 2011.</p>

  <p>We would expect the introduction of the New Ways of Defining and Measuring Waiting Times which was implemented on 1 January 2008, to have a positive impact in reducing DNA&rsquo;s. Under the New Ways rules patients will be made a reasonable offer of appointment which must consist of two offers with seven or more days notice. As patients are being offered a choice of appointments they will be more likely to attend on the agreed date.</p>

  <p>Official statistics revealed that on 30 June there were already 17,278 police officers in Scotland, the highest number ever on record. This means that the Scottish Government has reached its target of having 1,000 more police officers in Scotland compared to the 16,234 officers when we came to power.</p>

  <p>The Police Force Projection Study which was published on 18 March modelled the likely officer numbers as at March 2011. This shows that officer numbers in March 2011 are likely to be between 17,275 and 17,484. The central point in this range is 17,391.</p>
