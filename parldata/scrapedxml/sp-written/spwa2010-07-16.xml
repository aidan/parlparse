  <p>The development of online BSL/English interpreting services is a matter for the service providing agencies (such as health boards and local authorities) and for the deaf sector. The service providers are responsible for funding interpreting services in order to communicate with their customers, and there is evidence of an increasing number of service providers establishing contracts with deaf organisations to provide online services. The deaf sector which wishes to provide the service has agreed that it is a highly competitive market and is best left to market forces to develop.</p>

  <p><strong>Alex Neil MSP: </strong>The Scottish Government funded a small pilot of online interpreting services in 2007-08 to see if an online interpreting service could be delivered successfully. From the pilot and our knowledge of other services which are being developed, we believe that online services will undoubtedly continue to develop and this will be led by market forces.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-34319 by Stewart Stevenson on 18 June 2010, what the terms of reference are for the review into the exact need for new capacity for generating electricity from non-renewable sources.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-07-16.S3W-34742.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80347" speakername="Jim Mather" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa0716.htm#3">

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s Climate Change Delivery Plan, published on 17 June 2009 sets out at a high level the options available to meet the statutory targets in the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009. This includes a largely decarbonised electricity generation sector by 2030 using renewables complemented by fossil fuelled plants with carbon capture and storage.</p>

  <p>As part of their obligations under s.38 of the Climate Change (Scotland) Act (2009), Scottish Ministers are required to lay a report outlining the impact on emissions of the exercise of their electricity generation related functions. To fulfil this obligation, and in light of recent developments in our renewables potential, the Scottish Government is currently conducting an internal study on the extent of the need for new thermal generation. This will take account of our clear policy on CCS and CCS retrofit which requires demonstration of CCS for new coal plants on a minimum of 300MW net from day one, retrofitting by 2018 following a review of the technical and economic viability of CCS, and full CCS on new builds from 2020, and will reflect the competitive and dynamic nature of the electricity market.</p>

  <p>The report will include an assessment of energy demand and supply projections &ndash; including the current electricity supply base, projected rates of renewables deployment and planned retirement of existing baseload plants. It will also be informed by the energy storage and demand management study.</p>

  <p>The outcome of the study will provide a high level assessment on the extent of need for new thermal generation capacity and an evaluation of the potential security of supply issues that may occur in Scotland during the expected transformation towards a decarbonised electricity supply sector by 2030. This assessment will be one of the factors taken into account in considering policy on future generation options, alongside environmental, social and economic criteria.</p>

  <p>The initial findings will be presented to the Thermal Generation and CCS Industry Advisory Group for its consideration and advice before the report is published in the autumn.</p>

  <p><strong>Alex Neil MSP: </strong>The Scottish Government is currently undertaking an interim review of the Home Report which aims to establish whether any alteration is required to improve its effectiveness and operation.</p>

  <p>The review, which was commissioned in December following the Home Report&rsquo;s first year of operation, will also comment on any effect the Home Report has had on the property market in Scotland. After publication this summer, Ministers will consider any recommendations arising from the review. However, there is no question of Home Reports being abolished.</p>

  <p>The review is focused on continuous improvement of the operation of the Home Report in Scotland, and draws on evidence and feedback from buyers, sellers and housing professionals who have used the Home Report system. The Home Report is very different to the Home Information Pack (HIP) and therefore the interim review will not consider the early impact of the removal of HIPs on the housing market in England and Wales.</p>

  <p>The variation in the offence rate can be explained in some part at least by variations in the number of temporary residents and the number of vehicles passing through the area in relation to the number of permanent residents. Areas, such as Dumfries and Galloway, which has a low permanent population but a high number of temporary residents (tourist) and a high volume of through traffic from both tourism and commerce, will tend to have high offence rates when compared with other areas, such as Strathclyde, which has a high permanent population with relatively small numbers of temporary residents and relatively low through traffic volumes. Temporary residents and through traffic will contribute to the overall number of offences but, as the offence rates are calculated on the basis of permanent resident numbers, there will inevitably be an associated variation in the offence rates between areas.</p>

  <p>In 2006, Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary underwent an inspection by HMICS. Following the outcome of this report, Dumfries and Galloway Safety Camera Partnership moved their focus to more rural roads where there were a higher number of collisions but a smaller number of offenders.</p>

  <p>Young drivers are identified as a priority group in Scotland&rsquo;s Road Safety Framework, published by the Government in June 2009.</p>

  <p>The Government has already been involved in discussions with the Police and the Crown Office on the introduction of a pilot scheme in the Grampian Police Force area which would allow young drivers the opportunity to take additional training to address their unsafe driving behaviour as an alternative to prosecution.</p>

  <p>The Government, Police and the Crown Office have also been working together for some years to deliver the Driver Improvement Scheme in Scotland. Under this initiative, drivers who have been charged with careless driving may be offered the opportunity to attend additional training as an alternative to prosecution. The scheme covers drivers of all ages and is available throughout Scotland including the islands.</p>

  <p>NHS boards across Scotland recognise the importance of smooth transition with clearly defined pathways to support children and young people with life limiting and long term conditions moving from child to adult NHS services.</p>

  <p>It is recognised that transition arrangements can and should be improved as identified in the National Delivery Plan which highlights that at present adult medicine is not configured to meet the needs of young people moving from paediatric services.</p>

  <p>Various work streams involving multiprofessional, multiagency, service users and the voluntary sector are currently underway to address this important issue.</p>

  <p>For example, a working group has been established to develop proposals for the long-term care of children with complex and life-limiting conditions. Models of effective transition will be identified and reproduced.</p>

  <p>Managed Clinical Networks are also considering transition on a specialty basis and are in the process of developing protocols and pathways. For example, the cancer network CATSCAN has established a Teenagers and Transition Working Group, which is mapping existing services for teenagers and young people in Scotland. A sub Group of The Children with Exceptional Healthcare Needs MCN is currently reviewing care pathways.</p>

  <p>The Guidance <em>Hospital Services for Young People in Scotland</em> which was published on 5 May 2009 emphasises the need for good transition arrangements for young people moving into the adult care sector across all specialities. This report expects NHS boards to have the following in place for young people with long term conditions:</p>

  <p>Incorporate well-structured transition arrangements that accord with best-practice guidance;</p>

  <p>Take advantage of the flexibility offered by the revised age limits to defer formal transfer to adult services until the most appropriate developmental stage for the young person; and</p>

  <p>Give consideration to the benefits of identifying a key worker to support each young person through the transition process.</p>

  <p>The Guidance is available at:</p>

  <p>Children with additional and complex support needs require care services according to their specific needs, these are led by the Community Dental Service in each Board area who has staff trained in treating children with complex medical conditions and developmental issues. There is however a universal element of the Childsmile programme (for example dental practice programme and nursery toothbrushing programme) which children should receive if they are in mainstream schools and nursery.</p>

  <p>There are two separate purchasing cards in use by Scottish Government staff: Government Procurement Cards, issued to designated staff in business areas where there is a need to make low value, non-recurring purchases; and Travel and Subsistence Charge Cards, issued to staff required to travel and stay overnight away from home on a regular basis according to official business need.</p>

  <p>Cards are allocated to staff on a rigorous and systematic basis and the use made of the cards is kept under regular review.</p>

  <p>As Scotland will be the next host of the Commonwealth Games both the First Minister and the Minister for Public Health and Sport will attend part of the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, although not concurrently. At this point it is not possible to calculate the total cost of sending our representatives but we are working to ensure the best possible price.</p>
