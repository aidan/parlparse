  <p>Following representations received about different dates set in different areas, officials wrote to authorities in February last year to ask how holidays were currently co-ordinated between authorities and what could be done to improve liaison in the future. In response, most authorities indicated that they held discussions with their neighbours with a view to securing a consistent approach although complete consistency could not always be achieved because of local circumstances and local holidays. I am considering the detailed responses further.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive and its partners, Glasgow, South Lanarkshire and Renfrewshire Councils, are currently working together with Strathclyde Passenger Transport, in the Executive&#8217;s Central Scotland Transport Corridor Study, and through the Public Transport Fund and other funding mechanisms. They plan to deliver public transport improvements in the M74 corridor to provide a genuine choice for transport users.

  <p>From the traffic analysis undertaken to date it is expected the M74 scheme will achieve a significant reduction in traffic flows on a number of busy parallel local roads over a wide area within Glasgow and South Lanarkshire. The contribution that public transport can make to reducing car usage will be fully explored in the Central Scotland Transport Corridor Studies. I have already undertaken to Parliament that the Executive will implement the decisions flowing from this study.</p>
