  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-24398 by Roseanna Cunningham on 9 June 2009, what its most recent timescale is for laying before the Parliament secondary legislation regulating the use of snares.</p>

  <p>I hope to be able to lay an order amending legislative provisions on snaring before the Scottish Parliament before the end of the summer recess.</p>

  <p>Elaine Murray (Dumfries) (Lab): To ask the Scottish Executive whether it intends to make compulsory the fitting of ID tags on snares allowing the operators to be identified and, if so, how the operators of snares without ID tags will be identified and prosecuted.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government intends to make ID tags on snares compulsory. It will be the responsibility of individual police forces to determine how to investigate any contraventions of the law.</p>

  <p>Elaine Murray (Dumfries) (Lab): To ask the Scottish Executive whether it intends to make failing to check the action of a snare before setting it an offence and, if so, how the failure to check the action of a snare can be proved.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government intends to make failure to check the action of a snare before setting the snare an offence. It is intended that this new offence will assist in prosecuting the offence of setting a snare which has a self-locking action by removing the defence that the person who set the snare was not aware that the snare had a self-locking action.</p>

  <p>: The most recent information held by NHS Information Services Division indicates that in 2007 NHS Lothian had one full-time equivalent specialist nurse for skin cancer and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has 0.5 whole-time equivalent skin cancer nurse. It is important to note that the specialist nurse role is seen in the wider context of a multi-professional team that includes medical staff and allied health professionals in caring for those with a range of conditions. NHS boards are asked to consider the role of both specialist nurses and nurses with a broader remit working in the community, as part of their plans to make sure that services meet the needs of their resident population.</p>

  <p><em>Better Cancer Care: an Action Plan,</em> published in October 2008, outlines the Scottish Governments&rsquo; commitments to improving cancer care and outcomes for all those with a cancer diagnosis, including lung cancer. The Scottish Cancer Taskforce has been established to oversee and coordinate all of the commitments outlined within <em>Better Cancer Care</em> .</p>

  <p>Early detection of lung cancer is crucial in improving patient outcomes. The Scottish Government has provided significant support and funding for the development of new &quot;quick-reference&quot; guidelines to support more effective referrals by GPs. We are also supporting the delivery of a range of local and national campaigns which communicate messages about preventative measures and improve symptom awareness.</p>

  <p>Stopping smoking is the single most important thing that people can do to significantly reduce their risk of lung cancer and the Scottish Government has led the way in taking action here. Scotland was the first UK country to ban smoking in public places and the publication of <em>Scotland&rsquo;s Future is Smoke-free: A Smoking Prevention Action Plan</em> will continue to lead the way in ensuring the vision of a smoke free Scotland is made a reality.</p>

  <p>At 31 December 2008, 68.7% of children and 61.1% of adults were registered with an NHS dentist within the Clydesdale parliamentary constituency.</p>

  <p>This does not represent the percentage of people in the Clydesdale parliamentary constituency who are registered. Registration (numerator) are based on the postcode of the practice where the patient has registered with a general dental practitioner. The population (denominator) is based on where the patient resides.</p>

  <p>The General Register Office for Scotland (GROS) report that there were 17 deaths in 2008 as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning. No deaths in 2008 were due to gas explosions being mentioned on death certificates.</p>

  <p>According to Information Services Division (ISD) Scotland, part of NHS National Services Scotland, there were 29 patient discharges from hospital during year ending 31 March 2008 where the main diagnosis was &quot;toxic effect of carbon monoxide&quot;. No information is available on hospital admission following a gas explosion.</p>

  <p>: Callers to NHS24 present their symptoms in the first instance. These are recorded and then assessed by clinical staff for onward referral to the relevant service, when required. Callers presenting with the potential symptoms of rotavirus would therefore not be diagnosed by NHS24 and, as such, there are no figures available as to the number of calls taken by the service in relation to this infection. Callers may present with one, or some, of the symptoms of rotavirus, for example diarrhoea, but it would be inaccurate to record these as rotavirus as they may be as a result of another illness or infection.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-07-08.S3W-24967.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80301" speakername="Roseanna Cunningham" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa0708.htm#7">

  <p>Forty-five community bodies have successfully registered an interest in buying land since the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 was implemented on 14 June 2004. The number of community bodies registering in each calendar year is five in 2004; eight in 2005; nine in 2006; 10 in 2007; 14 in 2008; and two in 2009. Within the above figures, one body registered separate interests in 2004, 2006 and 2008. A second body similarly registered separate interests in 2005 and 2007. Two community bodies are currently in the process of registering their interest and their applications are being considered by ministers.</p>

  <p>These 45 community bodies have made some 74 registrations in the Register of Community Interests in Land. Some community bodies have more than one registration (a registration is made in respect of land owned by one landowner).</p>

  <p>As the community right to buy requires a willing seller (it does not involve a compulsory purchase of registered land), there is no certainty that a landowner will want to sell the land during the period when a community body has registered its interest. The purpose of these provisions in the act is to provide communities with the opportunity of a pre-emptive right to buy the land in which it has a registered interest should the right to buy be &quot;triggered&quot;. Community right to buy was never intended as the only way that communities achieve ownership of land.</p>

  <p>The right to buy has been &quot;triggered&quot; in respect of 22 parcels of land relating to registrations held by 15 communities. While five registered communities have acquired their desired land using the full provisions of the act, an additional two have negotiated a successful purchase after having their interest registered. Beyond that, eight further community bodies had the opportunity to acquire registered land when it was offered for sale (i.e. triggering the right to buy) but failed to purchase. One community body has also successfully purchased, by negotiation, two pieces of land following approval of their application for registration under the act.</p>

  <p>Experience of the practical operation of the community right to buy provisions led to revised guidance being published on 15 June 2009, which provides more hands-on advice on the required processes and procedures for community bodies, landowners, heritable creditors and third parties who may be affected by the provisions. A revised application form with provisions for re-registration, also came into force on that date.</p>

  <p>The Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 has only been in effect for a relatively short period of time and we are continuing to monitor the community right to buy provisions. If there is evidence that the provisions are not working as Parliament intended then a review of the act will be considered.</p>

  <p>Provisions of the Destructive Imported Animals Act 1932 only apply to a species which is included in an order made under section 10 of the 1932 act. The present obligation to determine whether additional species could be subject to such an order requires lengthy consideration of documentary evidence to establish whether or not the species was established in the wild in Great Britain before 1882. The Scottish Government has included proposals to amend the operation of those provisions and has also indicated those species which it would propose should be subject to the controls available under the 1932 act in the recent consultation paper on a proposed Wildlife and Natural Environment Bill, which is available at:</p>
