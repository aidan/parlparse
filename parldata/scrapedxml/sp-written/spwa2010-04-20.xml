  <p>As part of the process of introducing primary legislation, a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) is undertaken in order to assess the potential impacts of a policy proposal on those sectors and groups likely to be affected. The RIA relating to the Alcohol etc. (Scotland) Bill, which includes the proposal to introduce a minimum price per unit of alcohol, can be found at the following link <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/924/0092060.pdf." target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/924/0092060.pdf.</a></p>

  <p>Minimum pricing will only apply to the retail price of alcohol sold in Scotland. The Scotch Whisky Association&rsquo;s claims that a minimum price introduced in Scotland would damage Scotch whisky exports are based on speculation about further discriminatory action being taken by foreign governments against imported spirits. No evidence has been provided to support these assertions.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not hold the value or the number of grants paid by Parliamentary constituency under the CashBack for Communities scheme. The following table sets out the total number of grants and value administered by Youthlink Scotland since 2007 within each local authority.</p>

  <p>To date, the Scottish Government has invested over &pound;14 million in the CashBack for Communities programme which includes diversionary and participatory projects for young people across Scotland, and in am wide range of projects.</p>

  <p>This includes &pound;2.5 million to Scottish Football Association, &pound;4 million to Youthlink, &pound;1.4 million to Scottish Rugby Union, &pound;1.7 million to Scottish Sports Futures and Basketball Scotland, &pound;2 million to Scottish Screen and the Scottish Arts Council for the Creative Identities initiative. The most recent projects launched are a multisport project funding of &pound;1.5 million, &pound;500,000 to YouthScotland to administer a grant project for uniformed and small organisations, and The Junction project with &pound;1.6 million allocated to the project.</p>

  <p>So far over 100,000 young people have participated in CashBack for Communities activities.</p>

  <p>We have regular discussions with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency on its Better Regulation work which aims to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of environmental regulation while reducing the burden on businesses which are regulated, consistent with the need to safeguard the environment and human health. We are considering with SEPA whether streamlining or integration of the separate regulatory regimes covering waste and pollution activities would be feasible and effective in achieving that aim.</p>

  <p>In addition there is a further &pound;6.2 million of consequentials in AME in respect of additional student loans but this will ultimately depend on the take up of such loans in Scotland and should be viewed as a notional figure at this stage.</p>

  <p>The application of the &pound;76 million DEL consequentials in Scotland will be determined by Scottish ministers and announced in due course.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-32206 on 16 March 2010. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <u><a href="../../../Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx</a></u> .</p>

  <p>In December 2008, NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS) published its report on a clinical audit of care in rheumatoid arthritis (CARA), to help implement key SIGN Guideline recommendations, and to identify any significant variations in the provision of care. The Scottish Society for Rheumatology&rsquo;s web-based audit programme, supported by NHS QIS, is now undertaking further audit work relating to newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis, to help inform improvements in care.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government Health Directorates are in the process of developing a national Musculoskeletal Programme to improve the delivery of musculoskeletal and chronic pain services. The re-design focuses on how both access to services and assessment procedures can be managed by a multi-professional team working in a community setting. It builds on examples of good practice, such as the Glasgow Royal Infirmary Day Service, which enhances staff capabilities to meet the needs of rheumatology patients at an earlier stage in their journey, and to provide case management for those with complex needs.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally. It is the responsibility for each local Community Service scheme to monitor and record performance in accordance with the national guidance which forms part of the National Objectives and Standards for Social Work Services in the Criminal Justice System. The latest Scottish Government guidance on Community Service, which was issued in February 2009 and came into operation from 1 June 2009, states that &quot;The overall intention is for the offender to commence work within 7 working days of the Order being made by the Court&quot;.</p>

  <p>A sample audit to assess the impact of the new guidance on the time taken to commence and complete orders is in progress. This will use as a baseline the report <em>Community Service Audits 2009-10</em> published on the Scottish Parliament Information Centre in April 2009 (Bib. number 47783). The findings of the follow up audit will be published on SPICe as <em>Audit of Community Service in Scotland &ndash; Comparative Study</em> (Bib. number 49886) during May 2010.</p>

  <p>Single outcome agreements set out the ambitions of a Community Planning Partnership, in the form of local outcomes, and describe how progress towards these local outcomes will be measured. Single outcome agreements are not expected to set out how local services will be provided or purchased.</p>

  <p>There is no central record available of the number of procurement officers that have been trained in the use of community benefit clauses. The Scottish Government is however keen to support development and to raise awareness of such clauses and in the six awareness seminars which have recently taken place, over 200 procurement officers have attended. We published the <em>Community Benefits in Public Procurement Report </em> and accompanying guidance for buyers in February 2008. The report and guidance provides practical information on how and when to use the clauses including case studies, model clauses and lessons learnt.</p>

  <p>We are continuing to work with the wider public sector, including local authorities, health boards and regeneration organisations, to roll out Community Benefits clauses. These have now been used in a variety of public contracts and contractors have committed to around 2,000 placements for new entrant trainees and to small and medium-sized enterprises and social enterprise development.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has committed, over two years until March 2011, &pound;82,000 to the Business on Board programme, delivered by the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations. The Business on Board programme includes encouraging and supporting people with business skills to join the boards of third sector organisations. To date over 50 third sector organisations have signed up and 42 business contacts have been identified and are being carefully matched to third sector organisations.</p>

  <p>Each of the funds is delivered by a different body, each of which has put in place specific monitoring mechanisms.</p>

  <p>(a) The Social Entrepreneurs Fund is delivered by Firstport who are measuring the journey travelled by awardees against five indicators: governance, leadership, business planning, operations, and marketing.</p>

  <p>(b) The Third Sector Enterprise Fund is delivered in-house by Scottish Government. Each awardee is asked to provide a regular monitoring report and a final report at the end of the funded period, covering the following areas: what the investment has been used for; the difference it has made; progress achieved towards meeting expected outcomes, and any unexpected outcomes.</p>

  <p>(c) The Scottish Investment Fund is delivered by Social Investment Scotland, who are using Social Return on Investment (SROI) to measure the social impact of the investment.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Government has recently commissioned EkosGen to carry out an evaluation of the three third sector funds and business support package. The main focus of this work is to look at the needs of the sector going forward but it will also give some initial indications of the impact of the funds. However, much of the money has only recently been allocated so it is a little early to measure fully the impact of the funds.</p>
