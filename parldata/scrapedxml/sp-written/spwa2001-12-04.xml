  <p>I published the Adult Literacy Team&rsquo;s report in July. It provides a comprehensive strategy for raising levels of adult literacy and numeracy in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Funding of &#163;22.5 million between now and 2004 will enable an initial 80,000 people to be helped.</p>

  <p>&#163;18.5 million of this is being allocated through local authorities to Community Learning Strategy Partnerships where all providers can access the funding. The remainder will be used to establish a national &quot;Development Engine&quot; or centre of excellence, eight pathfinder projects and a national training programme.</p>

  <p>Scotland participated in the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment in 2000, which assessed the reading, mathematics and science attainment of 15-year-olds. The results will be published on 4 December 2001. We have agreed to participate in the second phase of PISA in 2003. It reports in late 2004. We are also participating in the Progress in Reading Literacy Study, run by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Attainment, which assessed the reading attainment of nine-year-olds in 2001. It will report late in 2002. We have decided to participate in the IEA Trends in Mathematics and Science Study which will take place in 2003 and will report in late 2004.</p>

  <p>Learndirect scotland, the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s flagship lifelong learning initiative can help people to gain the skills they need to pursue the career of their choice.

  <p>The Executive received a funding consequential of &#163;3.5 million as a result of money being allocated in England for the support of pilots of Government General Practitioners and Internet Learning and Access Points. All funding consequentials contribute to a block allocation to the Executive which was part of the Strategic Spending Review. The outcome of this process was that specific funding was not allocated for support of the Post Office network in Scotland, which is a reserved matter.</p>

  <p>The Executive is keeping in touch with the pilots in England and is keen to learn the lessons from these pilots and their likely impact in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive aims to provide information to the public through a broad range of media and is monitoring closely the development of the Post Office led Government General Practitioner (now known as Your Guide) project which is at pilot stage. Officials have visited the pilot to see the project first hand. No decision has yet been taken, but a further meeting with the Post Office and DTI will take place later this year to discuss the potential for rolling out this project in Scotland.</p>

  <p>There are already 700 Public Internet Access Points in Scotland. The New Year will see the launch of the Executive&rsquo;s Public Internet Access Point Initiative which aims to create over 1,000 new access points in areas of Scotland where internet provision is currently poor.</p>

  <p>The Executive is also supporting, through the Modernising Government Fund, a separate trial of public information points using kiosks with touch screen technology. This trial is based on simple to read information and contact details supplied by StartHere and Dumfries and Galloway Council and kiosks will be housed in a number of urban and rural locations across the council&rsquo;s area.</p>

  <p>The recent Teacher Recruitment Advertising Campaign has the twin objectives of improving the public perception of teaching as a worthwhile and rewarding career, and increasing the numbers of talented people entering the teaching profession.</p>

  <p>Neither this campaign, nor any of the Executives teacher recruitment activity, is specifically aimed at attracting mature entrants to the profession. There have been no costs associated solely with attracting mature students. The overall cost of the Teacher Recruitment Advertising Campaign is &#163;1.56 million over the two years.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that 70% of callers responding to the recent adverts and requesting further information on teaching and entry requirements were in the 25 to 44 age group.</p>

  <p>We have received a number of presentations from concerned students and others on this issue. We have also received a letter from the Deans of the Faculties of Education, and have been in dialogue with the National Union of Students.</p>

  <p>We are convinced that the improvements we are implementing through the agreement are of significant benefit to probationer teachers and the profession, both now and in the long-term.

  <p>Teachers pay and conditions are agreed through the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers (SNCT). The Scottish Executive, COSLA and the teacher organisations are all represented on the SNCT and all parties all contribute to collaborative decisions.

Since the full SNCT have not yet considered this proposal no final decision has been taken. The full SNCT will consider the proposal at its next meeting in December.</p>

  <p>Currently there are some 400 users enabled to connect to the Parliament&rsquo;s network remotely. A number of constituency and local offices successfully use this service regularly. As part of on-going service enhancement, an end to end review of the remote access service has been initiated.</p>

  <p>Phase 1, aimed at identifying improvements that can be made from the Parliament site is complete and the recommendations are currently being implemented. Phase 2 concerns the suitability of external telecomm equipment and services currently used to access the Parliament&rsquo;s network remotely, this study is in progress following on-site inspection of some constituency offices and recommendations are in preparation. Phase 3 will concern the provision of user guidance and training to assist remote users in utilising the service to best advantage.</p>
