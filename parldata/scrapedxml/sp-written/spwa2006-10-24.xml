  <p>The learning network will be used to develop communities of practice covering a wide range of issues and topics of which nutrition is one. The network which will be a combination of a web based and face to face contact will allow practitioners to have easy and timely access to evidence based knowledge, share good practice, offer peer support to those working in isolation and support continuing professional development.</p>

  <p>Key elements are a renewed philosophy for care of older people which emphasises respect, dignity and values based care and the importance of seamless care between the NHS and other providers.</p>

  <p>The Nurse Consultant is also working with other agencies e.g. Alzheimers Scotland to develop a programme for care home staff in palliative care for people with dementia, and with The Dementia Centre in Stirling to develop and deliver a leadership programme.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many central heating systems provided under its heating programmes have been installed in households with children in each year since the inception of the programmes and how many of these households were removed from fuel poverty as a result.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Since 2001, the number of households with children in local authority and housing association properties, which received central heating systems, is shown in the following table:</p>

  <p><table width="75%" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#CCCCCC">
<tr>
<td width="16%" valign="top">Year</td>
<td width="47%" align="center" valign="top">Number of Central Heating Systems Installed in Households</td>
<td width="37%" align="center" valign="top">Number of Households Containing Children</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="16%" valign="top">2001-02</td>
<td width="47%" align="right" valign="top">4,948</td>
<td width="37%" align="right" valign="top">822</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="16%" valign="top">2002-03</td>
<td width="47%" align="right" valign="top">5,720</td>
<td width="37%" align="right" valign="top">568</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="16%" valign="top">2003-04</td>

<td width="37%" align="right" valign="top">1,275</td>

<td width="47%" align="right" valign="top">2,185</td>
<td width="37%" align="right" valign="top">410</td>
</tr>
</table></p>

  <p>The programme in the private sector is targeted at those over 60. There is no data available on the number of households with children in the private sector who have benefited from the programme.</p>

  <p>Research estimates that in the first year of the central heating programme nearly nine out of 10 of those who were fuel poor when they entered the programme were lifted out of fuel poverty after participating in it. In the second year of the programme this figure was 72.5%. The figure is not broken down by household composition.</p>

  <p>The Secretary of State for Health in England and the University of Edinburgh have an agreement to continue funding the National CJD Surveillance Unit (NCJDSU) until at least 31 March 2010, with an option to extend for three years. The Scottish Executive Health Department contributes to this funding and is represented on the Management Board for NCJDSU. It has been agreed between officials from the NCJDSU and the Department of Health in England to review in 2008 the nature and scope of future work required of NCJDSU, so that agreement can be reached by March 2009. It is likely that the UK Health Departments will require some form of CJD surveillance activity for the foreseeable future.</p>

  <p>The main Scottish Executive support for local authority expenditure on education, including educational advocacy services, is provided through the core local government finance settlement. The settlement contains grant aided expenditure (GAE) provision for education that amounts to &pound;4.091 billion in 2006-07. This funding is paid as a largely unhypothecated block grant. Expenditure on individual areas is a matter for each authority taking into account local needs and priorities.</p>

  <p>In addition, &pound;402,513 project funding, has been awarded to voluntary organisations over the period 2005-07 specifically to encourage the development of educational advocacy services for young people and parents of children with additional support needs.</p>

  <p>I am informed by the Food Standards Agency that it is not aware of the consignment mentioned in the member&rsquo;s question. Tests by the Dutch authorities showed the presence of GM rice in samples from two barges they had in Rotterdam at the end of August on a ship from the United States of America, and that had been certified as free from GM rice. Neither of these was destined for the UK. Seven further barges of American long grain rice destined for rice mills in England, certified to be free from GM rice, were among the same shipment. Rice from six of these seven barges was detained and tested by the local authorities, and later released when no GM rice was found to be present. Rice from the seventh barge will be tested on arrival before it is released on to the market.</p>

  <p>I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that it has not instructed local authorities to test for unauthorised GM LL601 rice. Such testing may be undertaken as part of the local authority&rsquo;s own sampling programme.</p>

  <p>The agency has reminded food business operators that they are responsible for ensuring that the products they sell do not contain unauthorised GM ingredients.</p>

  <p>The business is responsible for sampling and analysis and therefore the costs incurred. The issue of cost reimbursement for sampling and analysis is a matter for the business and their supplier.</p>

  <p>The review, in the form of a questionnaire, was sent out to all boards for completion by 31 August 2006. Certain boards failed to meet the deadline due to holidays but all boards have completed the questionnaire.</p>

  <p>Health Department officials are currently putting together a full report from the information received and I expect to receive this in due course. There are currently no plans to publish the report.</p>

  <p>The review was carried out by officials as part of their normal duties and accordingly there were no project costs. There were administrative costs but as the questionnaire was issued and responses were returned electronically, these were minimal.</p>

  <p>NHS boards that charge for parking are NHS Grampian, NHS Highland, NHS Tayside and NHS Lothian.</p>

  <p>Assurance statements were received from all NHS boards who charge and were also received from NHS Ayrshire and Arran, NHS Borders, NHS Forth Valley, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and NHS Lanarkshire. The boards which did not respond to the request to confirm whether or not they complied with HDL (2004) 19 were NHS Dumfries and Galloway, NHS Fife, NHS Orkney, NHS Shetland and NHS Western Isles. None of these boards charge for parking, and hence no follow up action was taken on assurance statements.</p>

  <p>I will send, under separate cover, the nine assurance statements we have on file.</p>

  <p>The assurance statements are not deemed to be legally binding as they are statements of a state of affairs whereas the term legally binding usually refers to an undertaking or commitment.</p>

  <p>The Health Department Letter (HDL), as guidance, does not have the same legal effect as regulations or Directions. It is not mandatory but NHS boards are obliged to have regard to it and are generally expected to act in accordance with it.</p>

  <p>No actions can be taken against NHS boards as an action can only be taken if it can be established that the NHS board has in fact breached a statutory duty and this is not the case in this instance.</p>

  <p>The Scottish ministers can take action to terminate the appointments of the chairman and/or other members of the board. As a last resort they could use the power in section 77 of the 1978 act to hold an inquiry and (if appropriate) make an order declaring the board to be in default. The members of the board would have to vacate office and new appointments would be made. This power however could only be exercised if the board has failed to comply with any &quot;regulations, schemes, proposals or directions&quot;, not guidance.</p>

  <p>The Executive does not hold information on the costs of house buying over time. Research conducted in 2002 suggested that the average cost of house buying in Scotland, excluding Stamp Duty was &pound;1,377 at that time. Average solicitors&rsquo; costs were just over &pound;1,000 and total average spend on valuations was &pound;299. Although valuation and survey costs were a small component of overall buying costs, costs rose substantially when a series of valuations/ surveys were required. An average of &pound;340 was spent on valuations/ surveys that did not lead to purchase.</p>

  <p>The full report is available on the Scottish Executive website at:</p>

  <p>The following table gives the total number of sales, median and mean price for house sales within the City of Edinburgh local authority area in each year between 1997 and 2005. The analysis uses information provided by the Land Value Information Unit (LVIU) at Paisley University. LVIU in turn source their data from Registers of Scotland. The mean value excludes all sales with a value of less than &pound;20,000 and over &pound;1 million with the aim of excluding non market sales and non residential sales.</p>

  <p>The following income estimates are based on the Family Resources Survey. As such, year-on-year changes should be treated with caution due to sampling variation. Identification of trends must be based on data for several years. The Scottish Executive has funded a doubling of the Scottish sample since 2002-03; estimates from 2002-03 should be less prone to fluctuation than those for earlier years.</p>

  <p>The information requested is set out in the following two tables. The proportions in the tables are estimates derived from (a) the Family Resources Survey (FRS) and (b) the FRS&rsquo;s Individual Incomes Analysis.</p>

  <p>Due to the small sample sizes in the FRS in Scotland, the latest three years of data have been used to derive the proportions. However, the resulting sample was still too small to allow disaggregation for each of the higher income bands requested; the higher bands have therefore been grouped together.</p>

Total household income is the total income from all sources and from all members of the household, before deductions of income tax and National Insurance, and including tax credits and some benefits in kind. Total household income can not be used as a proxy for living standards as it has not been adjusted (equivalised) to take account of household size and composition.</p>

  <p>The following figures should be interpreted with caution and is not regarded as a reliable proxy for living standards. A non-working person, or a person on a low income, living with a high income partner may have a high standard of living despite a very low individual income.</p>

  <p>The key principle of Modernising Medical Careers (MMC) is to ensure that service delivery is maintained. In accordance with <em>Delivering for Health</em> , MMC will provide suitably skilled doctors for the services that the NHS Scotland needs. It is a UK-wide long-term programme, aimed at improving the training of doctors, to improve patient care and better meet service needs in the future. It does this by introducing a more focussed, competence based training, which is not time based.</p>

  <p>The Executive supports local authority core revenue expenditure through its block grant. In distributing this block grant, the Executive provides support of approximately &pound;365 million per annum through the roads maintenance, winter maintenance, road lighting and road administration Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE) lines. As part of Spending Review 2004, the Scottish Executive provided local authorities with an additional &pound;60 million in GAE for each of 2006-07 and 2007-08 for road maintenance, winter maintenance and street lighting. It is for each local authority to decide how best to allocate its block grant, based on its local needs and priorities.</p>

  <p>The provision and maintenance of street lighting is a matter for local authorities.

  <p>All students can apply to the Students Awards Agency for Scotland (SAAS) for support before they are firmly accepted on their course. This includes both their main support, which consists of tuition fees and student loan, as well as any supplementary grants to which they are entitled, including the Disabled Students Allowance (DSA).</p>

  <p>The SAAS is aware, however, that sometimes there will be situations which result in an individual application being particularly urgent (e.g. students with complex requirements who would be severely disadvantaged on a course without an immediate assessment of their needs). In such cases, Disability Advisers are asked to outline why such applications should be given priority treatment. Following receipt of the application, the SAAS deals with these cases as a priority.</p>

  <p>SAAS is also able to make advance payments of DSA one month before the start of the course, to enable students to purchase and familiarise themselves with any new equipment before starting their course.</p>

  <p>Students studying a course of further education are not eligible to apply for the Disabled Students Allowance. However, these students can apply for additional support towards personal study and travel related expenses arising through their disabilities from the Additional Support Needs for Learning Allowance, which forms part of the non-advance bursary. This allowance is not means tested, nor are there any pre-set limits on the means or levels of funding by which these needs may be met. The allowance is paid on a discretionary basis by colleges to eligible students.</p>

  <p>Scotland will be receiving 1.3 million doses of flu vaccine this year, 200,000 doses more than we did last year. The delivery of this vaccine for September, October, November and December is as follows:</p>

  <p>September 8%; approximately 104,000 doses</p>

  <p>October 52.8%; approximately 686,400 doses</p>

  <p>November 23.2%; approximately 301,600 doses</p>

  <p>December 15.6%; approximately 202,800 doses.</p>

  <p>Due to problems growing one of the flu vaccine&rsquo;s virus strains, delivery of the flu vaccine for this season has been slightly delayed by approximately one month across Europe.

  <p>*2006-07 figures are provisional and based on the manufactures best estimates. 1.3 million doses ordered for Scotland.</p>

  <p>**2005-06 1.1 Million doses ordered for Scotland.</p>

  <p>Due to problems growing one of the flu vaccine&rsquo;s virus strains, delivery of the flu vaccine for this season has been slightly delayed by approximately one month across Europe. The initial delay in production means that deliveries of vaccine will be spread over a longer period. Flu vaccine will now be delivered throughout October (over half in October), November and December.</p>

  <p>The UK Health Departments sought the advice of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) who recommended prioritisation as shown in the following table. This information was cascaded to General Practitioners in the Chief Medical Officer&rsquo;s (CMO) letter of 29 June 2006 available at <a href="http://www.sehd.scot.nhs.uk/cmo/CMO(2006)08.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.sehd.scot.nhs.uk/cmo/CMO(2006)08.pdf</a> .</p>

  <p>Vaccine should be used for all those in Priority Group 1 first, and then the following groups in order as vaccine becomes available.</p>

  <p>There is not a shortage of flu vaccine; only a possible delay.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive alerted General Practitioners (GPs) to a possible delay, as a result of vaccine production problems encountered by manufacturers, in June 2006. Thereafter updates have regularly been sent to health professionals by the Scottish Executive, Health Protection Scotland and professional bodies.</p>

  <p>In order to plan clinics effectively and ensure maximum uptake, we have asked General Practitioners to liaise closely with their Community Pharmacist colleagues. GP clinics will therefore be arranged around confirmed vaccine deliveries. Patients will be prioritised in terms of clinical need, as advised by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).</p>

  <p>Due to problems growing one of the flu vaccine&rsquo;s virus strains, delivery of the flu vaccine for this season has been slightly delayed by approximately one month across Europe. The initial delay in production means that deliveries of vaccine will be spread over a longer period. Flu vaccine will now be delivered throughout October (over half in October), November and December.</p>
