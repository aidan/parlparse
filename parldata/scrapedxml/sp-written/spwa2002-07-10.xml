  <p>The Scottish Executive is not currently undertaking any research into the causes of autism.</p>

  <p>The Medical Research Council, which has a UK-wide remit, has committed &#163;7.5 million to research into autism. The research findings, when available, will inform the policies and clinical practices of NHSScotland.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how Communities Scotland&#8217;s regional and area committees determine allocations and how much each local authority area has received from them in each year since 1999.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-07-10.2.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80144" speakername="Ms Margaret Curran" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0710.htm#2">

  <p>I have asked Mr Bob Millar, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Communities Scotland&#8217;s programme allocations reflect ministerial priorities and link the national distribution of resources to area teams, based upon the measurement of social exclusion. The area programme allocation is then developed in close consultation with partners, reflecting a broad range of existing partnership arrangements and leading to locally devised programmes and decision making. Programmes are based upon local housing market and needs analysis to identify, consistent with our strategy, the demands, needs and opportunities for housing investment.</p>

  <p>Communities Scotland&#8217;s allocation by local authority area since 1999 is as follows:</p>

  <p>The National Review Group considered various ways of anticipating increases in care home costs. Rather than suggest any specific formula they concluded that an increase in real terms should be applied annually to take account of various pressures, including water rates. We will, in consultation with local authorities and the independent sector, determine the most appropriate means of uplifting care home fees shortly.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not directly support any organisations, which support male victims of domestic abuse. It does, however, provide core funding under section 10 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 to Family Mediation Scotland and 10 of its local services. NCH Family Mediation Fife, Family Mediation Central Scotland and Family Mediation Tayside, which operate, though not exclusively, within the Mid Scotland and Fife parliamentary region, receive over &#163;178,000 between them. The aim of mediation is to enable divorced or separated parents to come to negotiated agreements about practical arrangements such as contact with children.</p>

  <p>No. Teacher education institutions must ensure that student primary teachers with the interest and aptitude are trained to teach modern languages in the primary school. The number and variety of languages offered is dependent on the resources available to the institution.</p>

  <p>All institutions provide French either as a core module of the course or as an elective. The Universities of Dundee and Aberdeen also provide German tuition. The University of Aberdeen hopes to offer Spanish this year as does the University of Glasgow, however the uptake of Spanish at Glasgow has been too low for it to be viable in recent years.</p>

  <p>The inspection evidence to inform the report on <i>Standards and Quality in Scottish Pre-school Education 1997-2001</i> was drawn from two different types of inspection. HMIE used all the performance indicators in their regular inspections of established nursery schools and classes. This included local authority nursery schools and classes and nursery classes attached to independent schools.</p>

  <p>Evidence about provision in the private and voluntary sectors was drawn from registration inspections. Registration inspections were designed to make an initial assessment of quality using a limited set of indicators, which did not include those on children&#8217;s progress in development and learning.</p>

  <p>The &#163;5 million for environment initiatives announced by my colleague Andy Kerr, on 26 June has to be seen in the wider context of the total end year flexibility allocation of &#163;76 million for the Environment and Rural Development portfolio, which includes &#163;30.2 million for environment programmes. Full details of how this funding will be allocated are provided in the answer given to question S1W-27441 today.</p>

  <p>Specifically on recycling, Andy Kerr also announced that an additional &#163;95 million was being allocated to local authorities this year for supporting children and young people and improving the local environment. Although it will be for local authorities to propose exactly how this allocation is to be spent, the Executive has asked that they give consideration to certain issues, one of which is the provision of recycling banks. It is clear that providing easy access to facilities such as bottle and can banks or separate household collections of recyclable materials are the best ways to encourage more recycling of waste.</p>

  <p>The Seville European Council on 21 and 22 June 2002 agreed to reduce the number of Council formations from 16 to 9. The Danish Presidency has indicated it will apply these new Council formations with immediate effect, and is working on a wholesale revision of its presidency programme. This means that the dates and Council meetings referred to may no longer exist. Decisions on Scottish Executive attendance at Council meetings will be made when this situation becomes clearer and the agendas for the meetings are available.</p>

  <p>Individuals who have been assessed as being clinically ready for discharge from hospital but who thereafter experience a delay in moving into the next stage of their care are classified as "delayed discharges" from the moment their discharge is delayed. Information and Statistics Division of the NHS&#8217;s Common Services Agency has used this definition in its <i>Patients Ready for Discharge</i> census since the first quarterly census of September 2000. This census also collects information on those who have been delayed for longer than the accepted discharge planning period of six weeks.</p>

  <p>We have no such plans.

Where it is clear that a local partnership is not working jointly to deliver on these and other targets, we will send a specialist Support Team into the area to resolve difficulties.</p>

  <p>Also as part of our Delayed Discharge Action Plan commitment, we have appointed a secondee team to develop joint discharge protocols for national application; these protocols will include a benchmarking component and set out minimum requirements for local authorities and the NHS to meet in the discharge process.</p>

  <p>Action is being taken on a number of fronts:</p>

  <p>We recently announced that the Scottish Executive Health Department would fund additional student places in 2002-03 available to Allied Health Professions (AHPs) including speech and language therapists.

  <p>We will be hosting a careers convention in the autumn to promote the AHPs and assist in recruitment and retention. This will be targeted at schoolchildren and those who might want to return to their profession.</p>

  <p>In addition a new Professional Officer for the AHPs will be appointed to take forward <i>Building on Success - Future Directions for the Allied Health Professions</i>, the first ever action plan for the Allied Health Professions in Scotland which sets out a programme of work to address recruitment and retention issues for this group.</p>

  <p>I have made an additional &#163;16.5 million available to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service in 2002-03, to take forward their modernisation plans. As part of the current spending review, I will be setting budgets for 2003-04 to 2005-06. The results of the spending review will be announced in September.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has considered the Race Equality Advisory Forum report, <i>Making it Real: A Race Equality Strategy for Scotland</i> , and, in particular, the section on ethnic origin classification and what action has been taken to ensure that the report&#8217;s recommendations are reflected in every area of its work.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive published <i>Committing to Race Equality, a response from the Scottish Executive to the report from the Race Equality Advisory Forum (REAF)</i> on 12 March this year.</p>

  <p>Chapter one, "Building a Solid Statistical Base" discusses the issues raised in REAF on ethnic classifications, and highlights the need for a partnership approach to taking this work forward. The chapter sets this work in the context of fulfilling two key objectives: first, the need for service users and others to be able to define their own ethnicity; and second, a meaningful and consistent approach for those who need to use the data.</p>

  <p>More generally, the REAF report will be used to help develop the Executive's Race Equality Scheme as required by the amended Race Relations Act</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what plans it has to increase the resources available to local authorities to assist them in improving the current situation in which 39% of young people in care receive a planned throughcare programme and, of those who have left care, 40% have had a formal leaving care review, as highlighted in its Central Research Unit report, <i>Scotland's Children: Children (Scotland) Act 1995 Research Findings No.3 - A Study of Throughcare and Aftercare Services in Scotland.</i></p>

  <p>The Children&#8217;s Services Development Fund in 2000-01 and 2001-02 made up to &#163;1 million available each year to local authorities to help develop throughcare and aftercare services.

  <p>In January of this year we launched Scotland&#8217;s Action Programme to reduce youth crime. This has already delivered multi-disciplinary youth justice teams in each area which have been supported by &#163;25.5 million to identify offending young people in their areas and roll-out effective programmes to address their behaviour. On 27 June, we announced a 10-point action plan which sets out the Executive&#8217;s action to tackle the problem of persistent offending, enhancing community safety and improve the effectiveness of Scotland&#8217;s youth justice system.</p>
