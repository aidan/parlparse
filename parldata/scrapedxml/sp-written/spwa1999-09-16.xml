  <p>The Scottish Executive does not hold the information requested. The A801 is a local road and the costs of upgrading it are a matter for the local authorities concerned. There are currently no plans to extend the trunk road network.</p>

  <p>There are 12 miles on the A77 around Kilmarnock without safety barriers. Subject to the availability of funding, safety barriers will be installed by 2000-01.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to improving the quality of provision for the throughcare and aftercare of children and young people looked after by local authorities.</p>

  <p>My Department is issuing today a consultation paper proposing the transfer of resources from DSS to local authorities. This would enhance the resources already available to authorities and allow a vulnerable group of young people to access advice, guidance and assistance on a one-stop basis. Comments on the proposals are sought by 29 October. A copy of the consultation paper has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe).</p>

  <p>The SPCB has cleaning contracts in place for the Parliamentary complex which specifically incorporate arrangements for the removal of graffiti. When incidents arise, immediate steps are taken to mobilise the relevant contractor to remove the offending graffiti as quickly as possible. If necessary, specialist contractors will be consulted if the graffiti proves to be of a more intensive nature and initial efforts to remove it are not successful. <br /></p>
