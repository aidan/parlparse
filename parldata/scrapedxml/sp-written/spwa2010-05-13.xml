  <p><strong>Frank Mulholland: </strong>The following table shows the number of charges reported to procurators fiscal under section 23 of the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006 in each financial year since the act was implemented in October 2006.</p>

  <p>Of the 22 charges reported in 2009-10, 19 are still being prosecuted in court.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The information for this question has been extracted from the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service&rsquo;s Case Management Database. The database is a live, operational database used to manage the processing of reports submitted to procurators fiscal by the police and other reporting agencies. If a Procurator Fiscal amends a charge submitted by a reporting agency the database will record details only of the amended charge.</p>

  <p>2. The database is charge-based. The figures quoted therefore relate to the number of charges rather than the number of individuals charged or the number of incidents that gave rise to such charges.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what support it provides to playgroup workers to acquire the qualifications that they need for registration with the Scottish Social Services Council as early years and childcare workers.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-05-13.S3W-33499.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80331" speakername="Adam Ingram" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa0513.htm#2">

  <p>A range of support is available both locally and nationally. Local government, through their childcare partnership and early years teams, provide advice and support on access to training courses, continuous professional development, and funding for qualifications to meet registration requirements. This support has been in place since 2000.</p>

  <p>Nationally, we are working with the Scottish Social Services Council to ensure the registration requirements are as flexible as possible, whilst maintaining progress to achieve a competent, confident and valued workforce. Practitioners and Support Workers registering today, if not already qualified, will have three years to achieve an appropriate qualification. Managers requiring to gain the new SCQF level 9 qualification will have up to eight years to achieve this.</p>

  <p>Qualifications are work-based, part-time and recognise prior learning, significantly reducing the time needed to complete a qualification for most workers.</p>

  <p>In addition to funding opportunities through local government, the Scottish Government recently changed the eligibility criteria for Individual Learning Accounts. This will ensure much wider access, particularly for those working in the private and voluntary sectors, to &pound;500 per year towards the cost of a qualification. An information pack on all available funding has been produced by the SSSC and is available on their website at<a href="http://www.SSSC.uk.com" target="_blank"> www.SSSC.uk.com</a>.</p>

This will allow us to present a robust and inclusive Scottish view of these issues to the incoming UK government.</p>

  <p>The first meeting of the group took place on 10 May 2010, and representatives from the key Scottish public sector agencies and main business organisations with Digital Britain interests were invited to participate. Representatives from the following organisations attended this meeting: Communications Consumer Panel; Consumer Focus Scotland; Federation of Small Businesses; Highlands and Islands Enterprise; Ofcom; Royal Society of Edinburgh; Scottish Council for Development and Industry, ScotlandIS; Scottish Enterprise, and, Scottish Trades Union Congress. The group does not include any bodies (such as telecoms companies or ISPs) which may have a direct commercial interest in Digital Britain.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how the 38% increase in expenditure on ferry services since 2007 has been spent, as referred to by the First Minister in the chamber on 11 March 2010 ( <em>Official Report</em> c. 24519).</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-05-13.S3W-32402.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80393" speakername="Stewart Stevenson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa0513.htm#6">

  <p>In 2007-08, the Scottish Government spent &pound;68.6 million to support the ferry services provided by CalMac Ferries Ltd (Clyde and Hebrides services), NorthLink Ferries Ltd (Orkney and Shetland) and Cowal Ferries Ltd (Gourock to Dunoon).</p>

  <p>Since May 2007, the government has allocated additional money year-on-year to support:</p>

  <p>the rising costs of supporting the network of ferry services: although carryings and therefore revenue have risen, this has not kept pace with the costs of providing services: primarily crewing, fuel, ship charters and harbour dues;</p>

  <p>the costs of a new contract for the Clyde and Hebrides services, awarded to CalMac Ferries Ltd and which commenced on 1 October 2007 following a procurement process initiated by the previous Administration, and</p>

  <p>the rising costs of vessels chartered from Caledonian Maritime Assets Ltd (CMAL) reflecting the long-term transition from a grant-funded fleet to a predominantly loan-funded fleet.</p>

  <p>The 38% increase previously quoted was based on a like-for-like comparison, in cash terms, of the &pound;68.6 million outturn in 2007-08 with the expenditure forecast for 2010-11 given contractual and other commitments.</p>

  <p>In addition, since May 2007, the government has further increased spending on ferry services by:</p>

  <p>awarding a new contract to Shetland Line 1984 Ltd for the provision of lift-on lift-off freight services to Orkney and Shetland, and</p>

  <p>launching a pilot of Road Equivalent Tariff (RET) fares to the Western Isles, Coll and Tiree.</p>

  <p>For details of spending outturns and budgets, see the answer to question S3W-32401 on 13 May 2010. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at:</p>

  <p>In 2007-08, the Scottish public sector delivered &pound;1,316 million cash-releasing efficiency savings and a further &pound;839 million in 2008-09. The November 2009 Efficiency Delivery Plan identified potential savings of &pound;1,111 million in 2009-10 and &pound;1,609 million in 2010-11.</p>

  <p>Once the incoming UK Government confirms its intentions for the spending review and the future of the public finances, the Scottish Government will consider the detail of what that will mean in terms of the next phase of efficiencies.</p>

  <p>The First Minister met, respectively: the Chancellor of the Exchequer and relevant HM Treasury officials; George Osborne MP, David Mundell MP and Philip Hammond MP, and Vince Cable MP.</p>

  <p>The meetings were arranged in order to seek clarity about the implications for the Scottish Government&rsquo;s 2010-11 budget of the public spending proposals outlined by the chancellor and shadow chancellors, and to make them aware of the impact that any further reductions in the Scottish Budget would have on the spending programmes approved by the Scottish Parliament on 3 February and on Scottish public services more broadly. As the meetings related to government business, the First Minister undertook them in his ministerial capacity and was supported by appropriate Scottish Government officials.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will continue to pursue the best interests of Scotland in its relationship with the UK Government. As the First Minister set out in his letter to the new Prime Minister yesterday, we would expect our working relationship to be based on widely accepted principles of mutual respect and parity of esteem.</p>

  <p>Our key focus is on protecting the recovery and we will therefore press the UK Government to honour the plans in place for Scotland&rsquo;s budget, in particular for 2010-11, and Scotland&rsquo;s public services. We will look for progress on releasing the Fossil Fuel Levy Fund and on releasing Barnett consequentials to Scotland arising from regeneration-related spending on the Olympics. We will also seek agreement that no change would be made to the current system of financing devolved government without consultation and agreement with the devolved administrations.</p>

  <p>We are committed to evaluating and monitoring the impact the Act is having. In the immediate term, we are using the Criminal Justice and Licensing Bill to strengthen some provisions and put right some problems identified during implementation. In the longer term the findings from the comprehensive monitoring and evaluation process being led by NHS Health Scotland will allow us to look at the wider effect the Act is having.</p>

  <p>While it is far too early to draw any firm conclusions about the impact on promoting the licensing objectives, it is encouraging that, in the first few months of operation, we are seeing the police and licensing boards taking tough action against problem premises, particularly in relation to underage sales where a number of licences have already been suspended.</p>

  <p>This government is committed to making our communities safer and stronger places to live. That is why we are delivering on our commitment to provide 1,000 additional police officers in our communities. But there would be no point in having these extra officers unless they were making a real difference on the streets across Scotland. That is why I very much welcome Chief Constable Colin McKerracher&rsquo;s initiative for Grampian Police to have a renewed focus on community policing: to make local police officers more accessible and visible; to listen to the needs of local people and keep them informed, and to work with partner agencies to encourage people to take responsibility for their own behaviours and actions.</p>

  <p>I know from speaking to chief constables across all of the Scottish forces that they are making maximum use of the extra resources provided by this government by focussing on the need to take policing into the heart of our communities.</p>

VisitScotland uses a range of channels including new media and websites, cinema, TV and radio, direct mail and PR to reach potential visitors at home and abroad.</p>

  <p>Particular examples of marketing campaigns which help attract visitors to the Western Isles include: A Perfect Day; Autumn Moments, Meet the Scots and of course the visitor guide for the Outer Hebrides which is available in over 100 visitor information centres across Scotland.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what further consideration it has given to the provision of a cross-Forth ferry or hovercraft service; what arrangements are in hand, and whether it will make a statement.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government strongly supports the principle of cross-Forth ferry travel, and remains keen to see progress. Any proposals, however, remain a matter for local government to take forward - principally Fife and City of Edinburgh Councils, as well as SEStran. Most recently, the application by Fife Council for European Regional Development Funding (ERDF), to provide the harbour infrastructure to support a new service, was not successful.</p>
