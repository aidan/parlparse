  <p>None.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Climate Change Programme recognised the need for the water authorities to integrate climate change issues into their business strategies and to take account of climate change in future investment programmes. <i>Water Quality and Standards, Investment Priorities for Scotland&#146;s Water Authorities 2002-2006</i>, copies of which are available in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 15676), recognised the need to use available knowledge on climate change to address a number of possible specific problems in their long-term investment plans.</p>

  <p>The three Scottish water authorities have jointly produced a set of 10 sustainability indicators, based on the set published by Water UK, to provide a measure of progress towards sustainability in the Scottish water industry.</p>

  <p>The Scottish water authorities publish annually environment and quality reports, and these are available on their websites.</p>

  <p>No expenditure has yet been made on supply side projects. The programme requires that the partners commission an independent study to make recommendations on the best use of funds to enhance physical infrastructure. This is complete.

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no direct control over the provision of broadband services by telecoms operators. This is a commercial matter for the companies concerned and will largely depend on demand.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has been working with the enterprise agencies to develop demand stimulation proposals under the UK broadband fund for innovative broadband projects.</p>

  <p>This approach is part of the Executive's wider broadband strategy, <i>Connecting Scotland: our broadband future</i>, launched in August 2001<i>. </i>The aim of the strategy is to make affordable pervasive broadband connections available to citizens and businesses across Scotland.</p>

  <p>The strategy also includes two further strands:</p>

  <p>A programme that will progressively aggregate public sector demand for broadband infrastructure. This approach is being taken forward initially in two pathfinder areas - the Highlands and Islands and South of Scotland. The Executive, taking account of both the experience in the pathfinder areas and developments in the telecoms sector, will consider how broadband services should be procured for the public sector in other rural areas.</p>

  <p>The number of junior doctors, defined as doctors in training, required in the short, medium and long term is affected by a variety of major factors, making for a very complex situation.</p>

  <p>In the short term, in response to the requirements of the European Working Time Directive and of the new contract arrangements for junior doctors, action is being taken to reduce working hours and achieve compliance with those requirements, and we have committed central funding for 375 more junior doctors to support that effort. The bulk of that funding comes on stream in the next two financial years.</p>

  <p>In the medium to long term, the numbers of junior doctors required are affected by changes in the demands of service provision, the way in which service delivery is organised, patterns of work for senior doctors, patterns of training for junior doctors and the composition and outlook of the workforce.</p>

  <p>The current fundamental review of medical workforce planning by Professor John Temple which Susan Deacon announced on 20 June 2001 is gathering and examining evidence on these short, medium and long term issues and will be reporting to ministers shortly.</p>

Such advice is continuing to be provided.</p>

  <p>Within the Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) area, awareness raising activity have been undertaken by HIE and the European Information Centre (EIC).

  <p>It has always been possible for Scottish individuals to go abroad for treatment under a standing arrangement which is named after the relevant EC documentation, E112. Policy on E112 is reserved to Westminster. The prior consent of the referring and receiving clinicians, the local NHS board and the Department of Health, (London) is required before a person can be treated abroad. The vast majority of approved cases involve those where the care need is not available in the home country.</p>

  <p>The Secretary of State for Health is considering revising the E112 arrangements once the European Court of Justice decisions in these and further pending cases have been fully evaluated, and the Executive will be keeping in close touch with developments.</p>

  <p><i>Patient Focus and Public Involvement</i> , published in December of last year, reported on steps taken to develop the actions identified in the <i>Involving People</i> section of <i>Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change</i> . It also set out more detailed proposals for work over the coming three years to develop the capacity of the NHS to involve patients, the public and local communities in the development of health services.</p>

  <p>Work with local health services has shown that effective public involvement can:</p>

  <p>act as a catalyst for change;</p>

  <p>help achieve a major improvement in the health of the public, and</p>

  <p>help strengthen public confidence in the NHS.</p>

  <p>Local health councils have been supported to clarify their role and to identify the scope for increased public involvement in local services. <i>Patient Focus and Public Involvement </i>sets out how we will take this work forward by the proposed development of a Scottish Health Council - a national body with a local presence - and by establishing a Health Service Users Forum in each NHS board area.</p>

  <p>Each NHS board is required to have a designated director with responsibility for public involvement and a key part of their role is to ensure that public involvement is embraced by the whole organisation. A number of different approaches and methodologies have been piloted or developed nationally to improve the way in which local services engage with, listen to and respond to local people. These include Designed to Involve, an Executive funded project which initially supported the development of public involvement in primary care. It is now being rolled-out across NHSScotland. Other innovative programmes, such as Allies in Change, Partners in Policymaking and Partners in Change, have shown how local service users can be supported to become more confident in their dealings with the services they use and contribute effectively to their development.</p>

The nomination of Lord Mackay of Drumadoon does not supersede normal procedure.</p>

  <p>It is expected that the additional judicial input into these cases through Lord Mackay will expedite progress focusing parties attention on issues that are barring or delaying settlement or other progress. Appropriate priority will continue to be given to those few cases that proceed to proof.</p>

  <p>We have no such plans. The 21-day time limit for lodging appeals (in non-criminal matters) with the sheriff court is set by the Act of Sederunt (Summary Applications, Statutory Applications and Appeals etc. Rules) 1999. Under these rules courts have the discretion to waive this time limit for whatever reason and frequently do so.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is developing a national programme to improve the mental health of the Scottish population. To drive that process, I am chairing a National Advisory Group, consisting of a range of stakeholders across health, education, social justice, business and other sectors. The advisory group will oversee various projects and initiatives, which is likely to include work with young people.</p>

  <p>A range of services is also being developed to meet the needs of people suffering from depression, including psychological interventions, which were added to the <i>Framework for Mental Health Services</i> in October last year.</p>

  <p>The Executive has already commissioned the Public Health Institute for Scotland to conduct a national review of child and adolescent mental health services. Their report is due later this year. In addition separate studies of adolescent psychiatry out-patient services, depression among adolescents and adolescent psychosis have been funded. Together, the findings will inform future decisions on the best organisation of services for this important care group.</p>

  <p>Our expert Child Health Support Group has been visiting NHS boards to offer support in strengthening local services for children and young people. Their national conference later this month will include examples of good practice in child and adolescent mental health services.</p>

  <p>Figures for social workers specialising in childcare should not be considered in isolation, as many local authorities also have generic social workers who provide services to more than one client group, including children. Table 1 therefore shows the number of social workers in Scotland by client group in each of the years 1996, 1999 and 2000. Comparable figures for 1997 and 1998 are not available because they were not collected on a consistent basis due to classification changes.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Includes Senior Social Workers and Main Grade Social Workers.</p>

  <p>2. Generic provision represents staff who provide services to more than one client group.</p>

  <p>3. &quot;Other&quot; client groups covers services for adults and services for offenders.</p>

  <p>Table 2 shows the figures for social workers specialising in childcare by local authority for each of the three years. The differing patterns reflect the extent to which social workers are identified by local authorities as specialist or generic. Some councils have changed their approach to classification over the period covered by the statistics. The proportion of generic provision which relates to children&#146;s services is not known.</p>

  <p>Sportscotland operates a number of programmes through the Lottery Sports Fund which are shaped around the needs of sport in Scotland as set out in <i>Sport 21</i> and reflected in the lottery strategy Levelling the Playing Field. These programmes are application based and are open to basketball clubs in the same way they are open to other sports. Applications are considered on their individual merits and involve the applicant committing partnership funding.</p>

  <p><strong></strong>Sportscotland also operates an Exchequer-funded Governing Body Development Initiative Programme. The amount of grant-in-aid received by the Scottish Basketball Association under this programme in the years since 1997 is set out in the table.</p>

  <p>The Sportsmatch Programme is operated in England, Scotland and Wales in a similar fashion although the level of resources available in each country differs. In Scotland, the programme is also linked to the priorities and targets set out in <i>Sport 21</i>.<i> </i>In England the programme is seen almost as a stand alone programme.

  <p>The Awards for All Programme has been operating since 1998 and is a joint programme set up to help small groups seeking Lottery awards. It involves <strong></strong>sportscotland, the Heritage Lottery Fund, the Scottish Arts Council and the National Lottery Charities Board, Scotland. As with the Sportsmatch Programme, the main difference in operation is the level of resources available under the programme. The funds contributed by <strong></strong>sportscotland to the Awards for All Programme are set out in the table below. Information on the actual awards made under the programme is held by the Awards for All Office and you should contact the office direct for details on individual awards.</p>

  <p>In 2001 the Scottish Executive mounted the first ever major national teacher recruitment advertising campaign, with the twin objectives of improving the public perception of teaching as a worthwhile and rewarding career and increasing the number of talented people entering the profession.</p>

  <p>The agreement <i>A Teaching Profession for the 21st Century</i> introduced the new Chartered Teacher grade to provide an alternative career progression route. The Chartered Teacher programme will enable teachers to pursue a challenging and rewarding career without having to leave the classroom.</p>

  <p>A sub-group of the Ministerial Strategy Committee for Continuing Professional Development is drafting guidance to ensure school leaders and managers at all levels are fully supported and equipped to meet the demands of their posts.</p>

  <p>Education authorities and headteachers are responsible for the quality of courses and standards of attainment in individual schools. In support of this, the Scottish Executive is taking a range of actions which will improve the quality of provision and raise attainment levels nationally. We have published revised curriculum guidelines, advice on curriculum flexibility and a clear statement of National Priorities for education. We are developing the schools/education Improvement Framework as the basis for improvement within individual schools and education authorities. We have provided support and resources for a range of key aspects of education, including literacy, numeracy and science, and through a number of initiatives such as the New Community Schools initiative. We have established the Assessment Development Programme, and are implementing the recommendations of the Discipline Task Group.</p>

  <p>The A81 is a local road and as such the responsibility of East Dunbartonshire and Stirling Councils as the local roads authorities for the sections of the road that lie within their areas. This is therefore a matter for the councils to address.</p>

  <p>This is a matter for West of Scotland Water and I have asked the Chief Executive to respond. His reply is as follows:</p>

  <p>The replacement Milngavie water treatment works is located to the north of the existing Mugdock and Craigmaddie raw water reservoirs and is fed by a new raw water pumping station. Based on the maximum design flow the estimated energy usage of the pumping station is calculated as approximately 8.5 million kWh/annum.</p>

  <p>This energy usage is off-set by a similar reduction in energy usage within the Loch Lomond Supply System, reflecting the efficiency of the proposed scheme.</p>

  <p>Alternative sites were considered that had a different energy profile. However, in all options pumping was required, whether this was raw water pumping at the treatment works inlet or treated water pumping on the treatment works outlet.</p>

  <p>This is a matter for West of Scotland Water and I have asked the Chief Executive respond. His reply is as follows:</p>

  <p>This issue is addressed in pages 2-20 to 2-21 of the Environmental Statement included in the authority&#146;s planning application.</p>

  <p>During the construction of the new works the Katrine Water Project will develop and implement an Environmental Management System (EMS) which will be integrated with the construction quality and health and safety management systems. Amongst other issues, it will address the procedures to be adopted to minimise environmental risks from noise and vibration. The EMS will also include procedures for appropriate noise monitoring. The EMS will be developed in detail once all planning conditions have been agreed. Environmental monitoring information will be made available to the local community through the recently established Community Forum.</p>

  <p>This is a matter for West of Scotland Water and I have asked the Chief Executive to respond. His reply is as follows:</p>

  <p>The latest estimate of the Stage 1 expenditure is &#163;5.1 million. As well as the three items in the question, this phase also included:</p>

  <p>extensive Value Management exercises, and</p>

  <p>the construction, commissioning and running for a 12 month period of a substantial Pilot Plant to confirm the water treatment processes necessary for the new works.</p>

  <p>An independent review was undertaken by PricewaterhouseCoopers which indicated positively on both the methodology and particularly the robustness of the contract delivery process. In addition, independent cost consultants EC Harris have reported comprehensively on the commercial costing of the project.</p>

  <p>The allocation of sufficient resources to stage 1 of the project is crucial to the success of the project. Tight definition of outputs and resources at an early stage plus rigorous assessment of options ensures value for money by limiting the scope for cost and time over-runs.</p>
