  <p>There are no statistics held centrally on the number of alcohol confiscations in Scotland in any given year. Only confiscations that subsequently lead to an offence under section 61 of the Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Act 1997 are recorded.</p>

  <p>Section 61(1) of this act provides powers for the police to confiscate alcohol from under 18s in a public place and dispose of it. Where this happens, it is not an offence and is not included in the centrally collated Police Recorded Crime statistics. It only becomes an offence if the young person refuses to comply with the requirement, e.g. by failing to hand over the drink or by failing to give his name and address.</p>

  <p>Information on whether alcohol was a contributory factor is only routinely reported for homicide cases. Information for 2006-07 indicates that 65 persons (39%) accused of homicide were under the influence of alcohol at the time of the offence.</p>

  <p>The only data available for other crimes related to alcohol is where the involvement of alcohol is implicit in the offence.</p>

  <p>The data recording systems in NHS24, out-of-hours services and GP practices are not currently able to provide the statistics to inform the European Commission Child Safety Action Plan project.</p>

  <p>The focus of the Child Safety Action Plan is the prevention of unintentional injuries. The out-of-hours service (OOHS) can record injuries and this information is forwarded to the GP practice the following working day. If NHS24 refers a patient to the OOHS the data will be recorded by the OOHS and be available to GP practices.</p>

  <p>It is for NHS boards to decide which of the injury data standards they collect and record for childhood injuries. ISD Scotland and the Scottish Government are consulting with NHS boards to consider options for national recording of injury data.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-15294 by Nicola Sturgeon on 22 August 2008, whether the NHS boards that are not using the nationally procured EDIS system for accident and emergency information have systems that are compatible with it for recording injuries in children.</p>

  <p>There is no requirement for A&amp;E (accident and emergency) systems from NHS boards, who do not use the nationally procured EDIS, to be compatible with any version of EDIS which may be in use.</p>

  <p>It is for NHS boards to decide which of the injury data standards they collect and record for childhood injuries. The collection of data is not dependent on the system used. ISD Scotland and the Scottish Government are consulting with NHS boards to consider options for national recording of injury data.</p>

  <p>The National Clinical Dataset Development Programme (NCDDP) recently carried out a survey across NHS boards to ask which of the 15 injury data standards had been implemented.</p>

  <p>Further work is currently being carried out to ascertain which of the A&amp;E core data standards have been implemented by NHS boards.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is involved in two feasibility studies which aim to help to make the business case for future commercial investment in offshore electricity grid connections.</p>

  <p>The Irish-Scottish Links on Energy Study (ISLES) explores potential grid links to exploit the offshore renewables resource in the Atlantic coasts of Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. A pre-scoping study has been completed, and funding for a full feasibility study has been agreed by the European Commission. We currently await a formal grant offer from the Commission in order for the feasibility study to be carried out with our Irish and Northern Irish partners.</p>

  <p>Another pre-scoping study has been completed, examining the potential for grid connections across the North Sea, off the coasts of the north and east coasts of Scotland and the west coasts of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands and the north coast of Germany. The Scottish Government is now seeking potential partners for a full feasibility study to take place.</p>

  <p>We believe that the availability of support for marine energy in other countries, as well as in Scotland, is a positive development. Additional support for these technologies across the world will create tremendous opportunities for companies to export their devices from Scotland - as some are already doing.</p>
