  <p>The provision of these services is the responsibility of each NHS board and local authority from the resources provided over the three year spending review period.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is providing funding of &pound;1 million each year in 2007-08 and 2008-09 through the National Strategy for Adult Survivors of Childhood Sexual Abuse to help address the needs of adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse. &pound;1.7 million of this has been allocated to 25 statutory and voluntary organisations to develop a wide range of services for survivors, including preventative work, support and counselling for male survivors and homeless young women. Further details can be found at <a href="http://www.survivorscotland.org.uk" target="_blank">www.survivorscotland.org.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>The overarching aim of the strategy is to increase knowledge of issues faced by survivors and to improve information and access to appropriate health and social care services. It is hoped that increased awareness can lead to earlier intervention resulting in a lesser burden on primary and mental health services.</p>

  <p>The terms of the concordat between central and local government commit to a reduction in central government monitoring of local government spending lines &ndash; this is reflected in the removal of ring-fenced resources for a significant amount of activity.</p>

  <p>Funding to support youth justice activities, such as intensive support and monitoring, will therefore not be ring-fenced from 1 April 2008, it will be included in the overall local government settlement.</p>

  <p>Every local authority area will have the flexibility to make decisions about what will best achieve good outcomes.</p>

  <p>We expect all agencies charged with achieving better outcomes for children and young people to work together in partnership and to reach collective decisions about what will best achieve those aims.</p>

  <p>When conflict occurs, children&rsquo;s panels have the option of asking the principal reporter to use local authority accountability powers, as set out in the Antisocial Behaviour Act 2004, to ensure the needs of children and young people are met.</p>

  <p>Under the concordat agreed between Scottish ministers and COSLA, the Supporting People fund and an element of the Violence Against Women Fund will from 1 April 2008, be absorbed into the main local government settlement. This decision to remove ring fencing from these funds will not be postponed.</p>

  <p>Removing the ring fencing from these funds will reduce unnecessary administrative and accounting burdens, freeing up more resources for front line services, as well as promoting more integrated and efficient planning and delivery of services, and allow more flexibility in how support packages for individuals are funded.</p>

  <p>Both national and local government recognise the importance of tackling violence against women. The Scottish Government will be providing local government in Scotland with record levels of funding over the period covered by the spending review 2008-11. It will be the responsibility of each local authority to allocate the resources available to it on the basis of local needs and priorities, to fulfil its statutory obligations and meet the Scottish Government&rsquo;s key strategic objectives and national outcomes, which were set out in the concordat and agreed with COSLA.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the Scottish Government has shown its on-going commitment to the work to tackle violence against women, including domestic abuse through the allocation of more than &pound;40 million over the next three years to this agenda. For example, both the Violence Against Women Fund and the Children&rsquo;s Services Women&rsquo;s Aid Fund will continue, as well as funding for Scottish Women&rsquo;s Aid.</p>

  <p>I have decided that a comprehensive and labour-intensive independent review which can take years to produce results was not appropriate in this case. I have deliberately restricted membership of the taskforce to university Principals and Scottish Government to ensure a short, sharp exercise that produces tangible results within a short timescale.</p>

  <p>Representatives of the STUC, trades unions and NUS all contributed to the higher education futures project in 2006. Their views were recorded and will be taken into account by the taskforce as appropriate.</p>

  <p>I will also continue to have a dialogue with these and other stakeholders on issues relating to higher education. I have invited the STUC to meet me to discuss the challenges facing the sector. I am also planning to hold a student summit in March to hear the views of students.</p>

  <p>I have asked James Hynd, Acting Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The average unit cost of an affordable home in 2006-07 was &pound;115,071. Building cost inflation is currently sitting at 7% which will affect the cost of providing an affordable home in the current year and 2008-09. However, the actual costs cannot be predicted at this point.</p>

  <p>As set out in the government&rsquo;s current consultation: <em>Firm Foundations:</em> <em>The Future of Housing in Scotland</em>, in order to meet growing demand for increased housing supply, the Scottish Government will be consulting shortly on changes to Housing Association Grant from April 2008 and, in due course, on introduction of a competitive approach to investment.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Some activity for emergency nurse practitioners is recorded as nurse-led activity from 2004-05 onwards.</p>

  <p>2. Some information for 2005-06 and 2006-07 is estimated, this is mainly due to the implementation of the new Emergency Department Information System.</p>

  <p>3. There is a substantial change in accident and emergency activity for some boards for 2006-07. This is due to re-classification of medical admissions units from in-patient to accident and emergency. The four hour accident and emergency waiting time now applies to these units.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-01-16.S3W-7723.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80379" speakername="Shona Robison" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa0116.htm#15">

  <p>NHS Wheelchair and Seating services provide wheelchairs to those with impaired mobility arising from clinical conditions. However, wheelchair provision also includes input and interventions from a broad spectrum of agencies such as social care, housing and education services in addition to health. To successfully address the issues raised by the review, engagement with and agreement from all agencies in taking forward proposed actions is essential.</p>

  <p>The patient focussed approach is central to the development of redesigned services to address the recommendations from the review and continue the elimination of excess waits. Some of the improvements already underway are referred to in the answer to question S3W-7724 on 16 January 2008. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="/Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx">Questions &amp; Answers Search</a>.</p>

  <p>The project team will assess the recommendations from the review as part of the development of an action plan and ensure that changes proposed are evidence based and cost effective to NHS Scotland and its partners.</p>

  <p>Producing a fully costed, robust and realistic action plan that will underpin the provision of modern and sustainable NHS wheelchair and seating services in Scotland will require until December 2008. This time period includes 12 weeks for public consultation on the draft action plan prior to finalisation.</p>

  <p>Support for local authority roads, including winter safety measures, will be provided through the core local government finance settlement and it will be for the local authorities themselves to determine the level of spending for roads in their area.</p>

  <p>Generally it is the responsibility of each local authority to allocate the total financial resources available to it on the basis of local needs and priorities, having first fulfilled its statutory obligations and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities including the Scottish Government&rsquo;s key strategic objectives and manifesto commitments. It is, therefore, for local authorities to make any contingency arrangements for dealing with winter roads maintenance from within their allocated resources.</p>

  <p>The chief planner made three telephone calls to the chief executive of Aberdeenshire Council on the afternoon of 4 December. David Ferguson, Head of Planning Decisions was present during these conversations. The first of these calls was to request an update on the status of the council&rsquo;s consideration of the application. The chief planner advised the chief executive that representatives from the Trump Organization were present in the room. At the request of the chief executive those representatives of the Trump Organization left the room for the duration of the call. The second call to the chief executive was to advise that the chief planner would be recommending to Scottish ministers that the planning application should be called in. The third call to the chief executive was to confirm that the planning application was to be called in by the Scottish ministers. The chief planner and the Head of Planning Decisions were the only people in the room during those telephone calls.</p>

  <p>The terms of the concordat between central and local government commit to a reduction in central government monitoring of local government spending lines &ndash; this is reflected in the removal of ring-fenced resources for a significant amount of activity.</p>

  <p>Funding to support youth justice activities, such as intensive support and monitoring, will therefore not be ring-fenced from 1 April 2008, it will be included in the overall local government settlement.</p>

  <p>Every local authority area will have the flexibility to make decisions about what will best achieve good outcomes.</p>

  <p>The Art Advisory Group was first established in 2005. Its membership included MSPs and three experts. The three experts have agreed to be members of the new group. The SPCB invited expressions of interest from MSPs on 8 October 2007 for the remainder of positions but did not require members to provide details of background or expertise in design or fine art.</p>

  <p>The following members expressed their interest:</p>

  <p>Labour (4): Patricia Ferguson MSP, Ken Macintosh MSP, Frank McAveety MSP, Cathy Peattie MSP</p>

  <p>SNP (4): Roseanna Cunningham MSP, Christine Grahame MSP, Ian McKee MSP, Mike Russell MSP</p>

  <p>Liberal Democrats (3): Alison McInnes MSP, Jeremy Purvis MSP, Jamie Stone MSP,</p>

  <p>Conservative (1): Ted Brocklebank MSP</p>

  <p>Other (1): Robin Harper MSP.</p>

  <p>The matter was considered by the SPCB on 7 November 2007 and given the level of interest in membership SPCB asked officials to discuss membership of the group with the parties to establish a practical number of members. The outcomes of these discussions with parties was presented to SPCB and approved by them at their meeting on 19 December 2007. There was no formal communication back to individual members who were not selected in advance of the confirmation of membership by the SPCB.</p>
