  <p>Education policy is set by ministers. We work with others, local authorities, teachers organisations and many others, including philanthropic foundations who are committed to improving the quality of Scottish education, to deliver these policies. The precise contribution of other bodies varies according to each circumstance, but philanthropic foundations have already shown they can bring new ideas as well as financial resources, which help achieve educational improvements.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally. In my response to the PE Review Group report of June 2004, I outlined a 10 point action plan for taking forward the group&rsquo;s recommendation. This work includes the gathering of baseline data, against which we will monitor the delivery of two hours quality PE in schools, and officials are exploring how this might be best achieved.</p>

  <p>In their 2003 strategy for physical activity, the Physical Activity Task Force defined physical activity as &quot;a broad term to describe movement of the body that uses energy&quot;, which can refer to any activity involving movement including walking, housework, manual labour and so on. This strategy was fully accepted by ministers, and has provided the basis for work in this area since then.</p>

  <p>The Doctors and Dentists Review Body (DDRB) have today published their <em>Thirty - Fourth Report of the Review Body on Doctors&rsquo; and Dentists&rsquo; Remuneration</em> . I am grateful to the chairman and members of the review body for their hard work.</p>

  <p>This year&rsquo;s report deals primarily with general dental practitioners, doctors and dentists in training, non-consultant career grade doctors and medical and dental consultants who have chosen not to take up new contracts. For consultants taking up new contracts, general medical practitioners and the salaried primary dental care services, 2005-06 will be the third year of a three-year pay deal agreed as part of NHS pay modernisation.</p>

  <p>The review body has recommended with effect from 1 April 2005 general increases in remuneration of 3% for doctors and dentists in training and for consultants who remain on the old contract; 3.225% for non-consultant career grade doctors; and an increase of 3.4% per cent in gross fees for general dental practitioners.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to announce that the Scottish Executive is accepting the DDRB&rsquo;s recommendations for 2005-06 in full and without staging. Copies of the DDRB report will be placed in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 35368).</p>

  <p>When implemented, the recommendations from the Review of Marches and Parades will apply to all processions. A number of the recommendations require legislation to implement and we are consulting on these in <em>Supporting Police, Protecting Communities </em> (ISBN 0-7559-4512-3), published on 9 February <em>.</em></p>

  <p>While we intend to legislate to require all organisers to give 28 days&rsquo; notice to local authorities of their intention to hold a procession, we recognise that it might be appropriate to exempt some organisations from some of the other requirements to ensure that the process is not overly onerous. For recommendations which do not require legislation, we will be working with local authorities, the police and organisers to ensure they are implemented in a practical way.</p>

  <p>The information is not available centrally in the form requested. Information obtained from a sample of Scottish general practices whose population is broadly nationally representative suggests that approximately 7,400 patients with multiple sclerosis were seen by GPs, practice nurses, district nurses and health visitors in the year ended March 2004. However, the Executive recognises that this may be an underestimate since some people with MS may not need to visit their GP surgery in the course of any given year.</p>

  <p>The information requested for 1945 to 1975 is given for Scotland in table 1. During 1975, 20 Scottish police forces were reorganised into the eight current police forces. Figures for police force areas comparable with those after 1975 are therefore not available. The requested information for 1985 and 1986 is given in table 2. For the years from 1987, the data has been published annually in the Recorded Crime Statistical Bulletin. Table 3 details the table number and Bib. number for each publication, copies of which are available in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>The percentage of recruits who leave before the end of their training is not held centrally but is likely to vary from year to year. In 2003-04 there were 966 recruits to the Scottish Police Service. In the same year, 34 recruits (equivalent to 3.5% of the number joining in that year) left through voluntary resignation.

  <p>The percentage of recruits who leave before the end of their training is not held centrally but is likely to vary from year to year. In 2003-04 there were 15 ethnic minority recruits to the Scottish Police Service. In the same year, one ethnic minority recruit left through voluntary resignation. However, because the initial training period for new recruits lasts for up to two years, the information held centrally does not indicate whether this leaver was recruited in 2002-03 or 2003-04.</p>

  <p>Information relating to those who may have been required to resign or who may have transferred to other forces outside Scotland is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The air change rate in the smoking room is 32 litres/second/person and is in line with recommended rates for smoking rooms as specified by the CIBSE (Chartered Institute of Building Services Engineers). Improvements are currently being addressed by RMJM who are designing two additional filters, a carbon filter and an electrostatic filter. The carbon filter will reduce the smell of smoke outside the room and the electrostatic filter will improve air quality within the smoking room.</p>
