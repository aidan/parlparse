  <p>This is an operational matter for the Scottish Ambulance Service. I can, however, advise you that the service regularly reviews its operational performance addressing all of the factors which influence that performance. These include demand on the service, staffing levels generally and specifically covering relief requirements, training demands and sickness levels.</p>

  <p>There are no rostered single crewed ambulance shifts. Where single crewed ambulances are operating it is because of short notice unplanned absences. Across Scotland the incidence of such responses last year was 0.69% of all calls.</p>

  <p>In those circumstances where a single crewed accident and emergency ambulance provides the first response to an emergency call, staff in the operations room ensure that this is backed up by a double crewed resource at the first available opportunity. The single crewed response is only recorded against the response times target if the follow up resource reaches the patient within 14/18/21 minutes (depending on population density) of the call being received.</p>

  <p>This information is not available for the Lothian NHS Board area for the periods in question. The manpower planning system used in other parts of Scotland to provide this detail has only recently been installed in this area.</p>

  <p>The roles of policy analysts vary. All will be team leaders and most will be responsible for a discreet policy area. Their duties are likely to include developing, implementing or evaluating policy, preparing briefing and speeches for ministers, giving evidence to Parliamentary Committees, and representing the Executive at meetings and in exchanges with a wide range of organisations. Some policy analysts may also be called upon to manage substantial projects or to be responsible for significant numbers of staff and large-scale financial resources.</p>

  <p>Successful applicants from the Policy Analyst recruitment exercise could be assigned to work in any part of the Scottish Executive. Decisions on the posts to which successful applicants are to be assigned will take account of the skills and experience of the applicants and the vacancies available at the time they are able to take up appointment. The Executive&rsquo;s vacancy position changes over time as a result of internal movement.</p>

  <p>Financial responsibility for the disposal of all household waste, including domestic refrigerators and freezers, currently lies with local authorities. That will continue to be the case until the manufacturers and distributors of such equipment become liable under the producer responsibility provisions of the prospective Directive on Waste Electric and Electronic Equipment (probably during 2005-06).</p>

  <p>Financial responsibility for the disposal of commercial refrigeration equipment currently lies with the owner or holder of that equipment. The draft directive provides that manufacturers and distributors should bear an element of these costs.</p>
