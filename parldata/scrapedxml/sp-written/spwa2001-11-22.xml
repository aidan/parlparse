  <p>The Executive has made &#163;1.845 million available through central budgets in this financial year to support local and national action to tackle alcohol problems. Funding for services addressing alcohol problems is also provided within resources allocated to NHS boards and local authorities but is not specifically identified. The Health Education Board for Scotland alcohol specific budget for this year is a further &#163;490,000.</p>

  <p>There is no standard definition of severe or chronic misuse. The Scottish Health Survey identifies heavy drinking. In the 1998 survey, 15% of men aged 16-74 drank more than 35 units per week and 6% of women aged 16-74 drank more than 21 units.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The numbers of infested apiaries in the table are following detection of <i>Varroa destructor</i> in samples submitted by SEERAD bees officers and findings of the mite in samples of bee debris submitted for analysis at SASA by beekeepers. Some apiaries in the table may have been recorded as infested in previous seasons.</p>

  <p>All bee movements to non-infected islands from within the Statutory Infected Area (SIA) are prohibited. As a result, on 8 December 2000 the SIA was extended to cover the whole of mainland Scotland and the Isle of Bute. By this action it is hoped that we will maintain a source of varroa free bees.</p>

  <p>In addition, we continue to monitor the varroa situation throughout Scotland by testing samples submitted by beekeepers for signs of varroa. However, it is generally accepted that the spread of varroa throughout mainland Scotland is inevitable.</p>

The review is due to report next summer.

  <p>Local authorities currently have a statutory duty to carry out an assessment for any carer who requests it, when they are assessing the person the carer looks after. Official guidance makes clear that authorities are expected to ensure that they make carers aware of their right to assessment as a routine part of assessment of the person they care for. New provisions in the Community Care and Health Bill currently before Parliament will extend carers' entitlement to an assessment by giving them the right to request an assessment at any time. We intend to issue clear guidance to local authorities and other agencies to ensure carers are aware of their new independent right to assessment.</p>

  <p>We are committed to improving access to dental services in Scotland and increasing our targeted output of dental graduates is only one of several options. We are aware that further increases to the record number of dentists currently working in Scotland will not in itself ensure equal access to treatment across all parts of the country. This is why we are looking to expand the contribution that can be made by the professions complementary to dentistry and are also considering further ways to attract dentists to Scotland, particularly to work in remote and rural areas.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Advisory Committee on the Dental Workforce will continue to monitor the situation regarding the provision of the dental workforce in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not issue guidelines on how computers should be deployed in schools or on the associated support arrangements.

  <p>The money will go to practices in support of a contract, agreed locally, which will deliver enhanced services to the practice population. We have provided &#163;18.5 million of additional investment over three years for Personal Medical Services pilot sites. This is enabling GPs and their teams to focus on the clinical needs of their patients, by testing out more flexible ways of providing existing and additional services, and the best use of professional skills. Personal Medical Services pilots are being used to improve access to primary care services, reduce inequalities and address recruitment and retention problems, particularly in remote, rural and deprived areas.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>The applications received include applications withdrawn/rejected; this explains the difference between the number of applications received and the combined payments issued and applications under consideration figures.</p>

  <p>BSPS applications received figures reflect the fact that producers can submit more than one application per year. However, payments are consolidated and paid per producer rather than per claim.</p>

  <p>No figures are given for EPS 1999 because applications and payments were combined with the Suckler Cow Premium Scheme and the Beef Special Premium Scheme.</p>

  <p>The 2000 EPS applications under consideration figures will not be available until significant program changes are made. We have no plans to introduce these changes.</p>

  <p>I believe that changes to Animal Health Legislation will be necessary in the light of experience gained during the recent foot-and-mouth disease outbreak. However, a Scottish Bill will not be introduced before industry and other interests have been consulted fully about its possible content.</p>

  <p>We are committed to recruiting more nurses to NHSScotland. Over the next five years 10,000 more nurses and midwives will qualify in Scotland, 1,500 more than previously planned.</p>

  <p>The Nursing and Midwifery Convention held on 19 November 2001 provided an important springboard for a renewed national effort to secure the nurses needed for NHSScotland - both now and in the future. The Executive has made available &#163;1.5 million of immediate investment specifically dedicated to ideas generated by this convention.</p>

  <p>Information in the form requested could be provided only at disproportionate cost. In the light of the provisions of the Parliament's Standing Orders, ministers aim to answer parliamentary questions for written answer within 14 days (or 28 days for those lodged in the seven days before, or during, a period of recess of more than four days). The Executive publishes regular audits of performance which are available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre. The latest published audit, which covers the period April to June 2001, showed that the proportion of questions answered ahead of, or on time, was just over 70%. For the equivalent period in 2000 the proportion was 51%.</p>

Revenue funding is the responsibility of the local authorities and bids under the programme were required to indicate sources of such funding. Twenty-four local authorities have submitted bids and all have complied with this requirement. We have the full support of CoSLA for this programme.</p>

  <p>Under the Renewables Obligation Scotland, our objective is that renewable energy sources in Scotland will increase their share of the electricity market from around 12% now to 18% by 2010. We expect a range of renewable energy technologies to contribute to this increase, including wind, hydro, and biomass and, in the longer term, wave power.</p>

  <p>Police Road Traffic Accident Reports often contain sensitive information, most notably those involving fatal accidents. Such reports, if made available generally to the public, can cause great distress to victims&#8217; families and others. Therefore, it is not appropriate that Police Road Traffic Accident Reports are made available generally to the public.</p>

  <p>However, the Crown Office recognises the importance of making such reports available in private to those with a legitimate interest, for example victim&#8217;s families, and this practice will continue. Of course, this will be subject to consideration of prejudice to any proceedings, either in contemplation or pending.</p>

  <p>The protection of children is the responsibility of a range of services including social work, education and health. The Scottish Executive is currently leading a multi-disciplinary review to promote the reduction of abuse or neglect of children, and to improve the services for children who experience abuse or neglect. The review team will report and make recommendations to improve professional working and the regulatory framework in which professionals operate. It is premature to judge whether the recommendations are likely to include the production of guidelines on the allocation of cases to social workers.</p>

  <p>The Scottish water industry must become substantially more efficient over the next four years, with inevitable cuts in staffing levels, whether Scottish Water is created or not. I understand that under existing water authority redundancy schemes there have been so far over 1,100 expressions of interest from employees, although it is unlikely that all of these will lead to actual redundancies. The approach under Scottish Water will be a matter for its management to consider if and when it comes into being.</p>
