  <p>I can confirm that payments under the 2008 Single Farm Payment Scheme will start to arrive in bank accounts from 1 December. This means that we will have paid 13,800 producers a total of &pound;223 million from the first date possible. With this good start to the settlement of this year&rsquo;s claims, my officials estimate that by Christmas Day, we will have paid approximately 16,600 producers (84%) equating to around &pound;334 million (75%). The Scottish Government does publish further details of its payment performance, as the payments, are made on our website and this can be found at:</p>

  <p>The significance of paying 96.14% of Single Farm Payment expenditure is that we must reach that figure by 30 June 2009 in order to avoid late payment penalties being levied by the European Commission. I think Scottish farmers will find it more relevant to know, however, that my standing aim is that the Scottish Government should settle these claims from the earliest point possible and in full. You will be aware from my answer to S3W-17853 that payments are due to start appearing in farmers and crofters bank accounts from 1 December so my officials can only estimate at this point that we will reach the 96.14% target by 28 February 2009 or earlier, bearing in mind that payment is dependant on claims being eligible.</p>

  <p>The Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005 puts in place provisions which will prevent licensed premises taking part in irresponsible promotions. Furthermore, Licensing Boards will be able to review the premises licence on any ground relevant to one or more of the licensing objectives. The licensing objectives include preventing public nuisance and protecting and improving public health. We will encourage and support Licensing Boards to use their powers under the 2005 act to crack down on irresponsible practices and irresponsible retailing once the act comes fully into force on 1 September 2009.</p>

  <p>The government has made clear that is it not anti-alcohol and we are proud of our distillers and the premium products they make. Issues concerning the promotion of alcohol and potential measures under the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005 are being considered in light of the responses to the Scottish Government&rsquo;s consultation Changing Scotland&rsquo;s Relationship with Alcohol, but we are clear that we do not propose to ban promotions that explain the method of production, history and heritage of Scotland&rsquo;s quality products. We have already given the Scotch Whisky Association an assurance that we will discuss these matters with them before proposing any regulatory action to end the irresponsible promotion of alcohol. We have also made clear that there is no question that distilleries will be prevented from offering drams as part of a distillery tour.</p>

  <p>In respect of displays at trade fairs and exhibitions, the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005, which comes fully into force on 1 September 2009, requires that alcohol cannot be sold except under and in accordance with a premises licence, or an occasional licence. We would envisage occasional licences being used in most cases for alcohol sales at exhibitions and trade fairs.</p>

  <p>The government has made clear that it is not anti-alcohol. However, Scotland&rsquo;s relationship with alcohol is out of kilter and we need to rebalance it and that means adopting an innovative and imaginative approach to addressing the problem.</p>

  <p>Our consultation paper specifically sought views on the criteria that should be applied in determining which types of premises should be subject to any such arrangements. Proposals arising from <em>Changing Scotland&rsquo;s Relationship with Alcohol &ndash; a discussion paper on our strategic approach </em>will be published early in 2009.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government provided funding for the setting up of one-stop-shops in Glasgow and Lothian for adults with high functioning autism or Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome. These pilot projects have been very successful and we are now encouraging other local authority areas to develop similar advice centres.

  <p>Autism initiatives has been funded to co-ordinate an approach to the development of social firms specifically for people with autism spectrum disorders in Scotland. This will help them into real jobs compatible with their unique skills and support needs.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises the importance of carer assessments in identifying carers&rsquo; needs for support and as a gateway to accessing this support. As the member will be aware, under the Community Care and Health (Scotland) Act 2002, &quot;regular and substantial&quot; carers have the right to an assessment of their ability to care, independent from any assessment of the person they are caring for. However, I am aware that at present uptake of these assessments across authorities is low.</p>

  <p>To improve this, the Scottish Government, working with partners, has developed new National Minimum Information Standards for carer&rsquo;s assessments as part of the National Outcomes Framework for Community Care. These standards should support the delivery of uniform carers assessments across local authorities. These standards focus on securing positive outcomes for carers.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the User Defined Service Evaluation Toolkit (UDSET) and Carer Defined Service Evaluation Toolkit (CDSET) enable staff working in health and social care to capture valuable data for planning and improving services that are personalised and appropriate to individual users and carers, respectively.</p>

  <p>The tools described above are in the process of being adopted by partners around Scotland, and development continues in response to feedback. Early indications are that their use contributes positively to achieving good outcomes for individuals.</p>

  <p>Note: *South of Scotland.</p>

  <p>There are a variety of factors than can affect referral rates, such as pre-referral screening. Different local authorities are taking different approaches and it is for each local authority to decide what is most appropriate for their local area. Work with all relevant partner agencies is continuing, thus ensuring, as far as possible, that the right children - those who require compulsory measures of supervision - are referred to the reporter.</p>

  <p>It is encouraging to note that nationally there has been a 10.5% decrease in the number of children referred to the reporter in 2007-08 when compared to 2006-07.</p>

  <p>As planned at the outset, an external evaluation of the full Cultural Pathfinder programme was commissioned earlier this year, and the evaluation report will be made widely available after publication in February 2009. It will be disseminated to local authorities which were not in the programme.</p>

  <p>On 19 August 2008, a series of initiatives was announced by the First Minister to support the Scottish economy through the global economic downturn. Since then, the Scottish Government has continued to set out the actions as part of its economic recovery programme. I presented the Scottish Government&rsquo;s approach and specific actions as part of the debate on the Scottish economy in the Parliament on 12 November 2008.</p>

  <p>The draft Scottish Budget was published on 16 September 2008. It lays out how all government spending will help to deliver our purpose of delivering greater prosperity and opportunity for the people of Scotland.

  <p>Between 14 September and 12 October 2008, the Scottish Government did not bring forward any infrastructure projects.</p>

  <p>We have a very significant capital investment programme set out in our <em>Infrastructure Investment Plan 2008</em> (Bib. number 45134) amounting to &pound;35 billion over the next 10 years which is being reviewed to identify areas for acceleration.

  <p>Today I am announcing that the specifications for the Scottish Science and Language Baccalaureates will be as follows:</p>

  <p>Both the Baccalaureates will comprise two Advanced Higher courses, one Higher course and an Interdisciplinary Project, which will comprise 80 hours of study at Advanced Higher level. Copies of the specification are available from the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 47002). A Distinction will require A in one Advanced Higher, one other A in any component and at least B in all other components.</p>

  <p>This announcement follows discussions between the Scottish Government and SQA who have been engaging with representatives from schools, college, HE and business sectors on the proposed specification for the Baccalaureates since June. SQA have taken account of feedback from these key stakeholders and have recommended a revised specification for these awards. Last week I met with SQA and agreed the specification for the award.</p>

  <p>The aims of the Baccalaureates as initially announced on the 5 June are to encourage uptake in science and language courses in the upper secondary school; raise the status of S6 and motivate learners in their last year of school; assist young people in making the transition from school to further and higher education (FE/HE) and employment, and encourage collaboration between schools and FE/HE institutions.</p>

  <p>This is an exciting development, which I believe will be challenging and rewarding for both pupils and teachers.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is investing in a range of activities that help create and safeguard jobs. The specific reference in the news release of 12 November 2008 was to Regional Selective Assistance funding. In the three months to the end of September 2008, 25 businesses in Scotland accepted Regional Selective Assistance grant offers totalling over &pound;8 million. These offers relate to projects with planned investment of over &pound;36.9 million, aimed at the planned creation and safeguarding of over 1,000 jobs.</p>

  <p>However, the vast majority of our investment in the development and acquisition of skills directly relates to building and sustaining a flexible skilled workforce. Over and above the wide range of activity within our universities, further education colleges and programmes such as modern apprenticeships, we also provide specific support for employers who are about to make staff redundant, pooling our collective resources from across the government to ensure those most in need receive it.</p>

  <p>Currently the Business Gateway only operates in the Scottish Enterprise (lowland Scotland) area. 12 contracts for the local delivery of Business Gateway services were let by Scottish Enterprise in October 2007. Responsibility for the management of these existing local contracts was transferred to 12 lead local authorities across the area in April 2008.</p>

  <p>The contractual conditions applicable at the time of the transfer continued to apply thereafter and as such, no additional measures pertaining to the existing contractors were required.</p>

  <p>It is our intention that Business Gateway services will be available across Scotland and that local delivery will lie with local authorities. This will follow a national model but with scope for local variation in delivery. Work is therefore underway to develop the Business Gateway model for the Highlands and Islands Enterprise area and local delivery of this new service is expected to be operational during 2009.

  <p>In the Scottish Enterprise area, local business advice services provided by the Business Gateway are delivered by contractors (private sector and private/public sector consortia) under contracts let by Scottish Enterprise in October 2007. The management of these contracts was transferred to 12 lead local authorities from 1 April 2008.</p>

  <p>The Business Gateway is not currently available in the Highlands and Islands but in order to provide consistency of service, it is our intention that it should be introduced to the area within the next 12 months. Responsibility for local delivery of this new service will also lie with local authorities in the Highlands and Islands who will determine the most appropriate delivery vehicle for their individual areas. In some cases this may be in-house delivery, in others delivery may be contracted out. Whichever approach adopted will however, be subject to national standards to ensure consistency of service across the country.</p>

  <p>The transfer of responsibility for Business Gateway local delivery to local authorities provides for an holistic service and builds on local authorities&rsquo; links with business in their statutory role as licensing and planning authorities.</p>

  <p>We aim to introduce the Business Gateway as a new service for businesses in the Highlands and Islands in 2009, and local authorities will be responsible for determining appropriate models for its local delivery.</p>

  <p>Yes. The transfer of the Business Gateway contracts to the 12 lead local authorities in the Scottish Enterprise area in April 2008 has been very successful.</p>

  <p>Local authorities in the Highlands and Islands will take responsibility for local delivery of the Business Gateway service when it is introduced to that area in 2009. The service will be subject to national delivery standards but the approach determined by individual authorities will reflect their extensive knowledge of their area and local businesses.</p>

  <p>This is a matter for the 12 lead local authorities in the Scottish Enterprise area who from April 2008, have had responsibility for the management of the Business Gateway contracts. All local authorities have a statutory duty of best value in the discharge of their functions and this is supported by existing statutory guidance.</p>

  <p>This will also be the case when the Business Gateway is introduced to the Highlands and Islands and local authorities in that area assume responsibility for its local delivery.</p>

  <p>The transfer of responsibility for the local delivery of the Business Gateway in the Scottish Enterprise area to local authorities, was a transfer of the management of 12 extant and continuing Business Gateway contracts to 12 lead local authorities.</p>

  <p>The Business Gateway does not operate in the Highlands and Islands and we intend to introduce it to the area during 2009. This will be a new service and therefore, unlike the position in lowland Scotland, there are no extant delivery contracts to be transferred or continued.</p>

  <p>Highlands and Islands Enterprise currently provides advice to businesses, with some aspects of this service delivered by a supply partner. The terms of that contract are a commercial matter for Highlands and Islands Enterprise.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government received an additional &pound;11 million as a result of the Chancellor&rsquo;s Pre-Budget Report announcement on 24 November. These additional resources will become part of the total funding available to us to meet the commitments and priorities set out in our spending plans in the <em>Draft Budget 2009-10</em> published last September. In addition, we have the opportunity to bring forward up to &pound;260 million of capital expenditure in 2008-09 and 2009-10 to stimulate the economy. However, this funding will be offset by a corresponding reduction in expenditure in 2010-11.</p>

  <p>Our 2010-11 allocation is also due to be cut by around &pound;129 million as a consequence of changes to the UK Department of Health&rsquo;s budget and we face a further cut based on our Barnett share of a &pound;5 billion reduction in UK departmental spending in 2010-11 and 2011-12. Taken together there is therefore the potential for a &pound;1 billion reduction in Scottish spending, of which &pound;500 million is likely to fall in the current spending review period.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The table shows the number of GPs working in East Dunbartonshire practices, by electoral ward, as at 30 September 2007. The allocation of GPs to wards is based on the postcode of the main general practice address and does not take account of instances where practices run branch surgeries in other locations. It should also be noted that people resident in one ward area can often be registered with a general practice in another ward area, subject to them living within the relevant practice boundary. The figures do not include out-of-hours services and GPs doing only locum work.</p>

  <p>2. One practice in Campsie and Kirkintilloch North ward runs a branch surgery at Twechar.</p>

  <p>3. GP numbers for 2008 will be published at local authority level on 27 January 2009 at:</p>

  <p>The Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 does not introduce new powers relating specifically to derelict buildings. New powers to deal with sub-standard housing, including work notices, maintenance orders and the designation of Housing Renewal Areas are due to come into force from early 2009.</p>

  <p>In the meantime local authorities have powers under the Building (Scotland) Act 2003 to deal with defective and dangerous buildings and under the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 to deal with houses in serious disrepair.</p>

  <p>While there is no central source of data specifically on the number of accessible houses built in Scotland there is information on the number of houses built by local authorities and Registered Social Landlords. As all Scottish Government funded new build is required to comply with Housing for Varying Needs standards this provides some information on the number of new housing which is accessible.</p>

  <p>There is a requirement for Scottish Government funded new build to comply with Housing for Varying Needs standards, which ensures the housing can continue to meet the changing needs of it occupants. This builds upon the concept of barrier free principles, which state that housing and its environment should meet the needs of almost everyone.</p>

  <p>Individual crofters are not eligible to participate in the subsidised bull hire arrangements operated by the Crofters Commission. In the years in question, eligibility was normally confined to groups representing at least three cow owners. These requirements were designed to prevent the possibility that a group might be formed to support a single business/enterprise.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to announce that Scotland will be granted executive devolution of marine planning and nature conservation out to 200 nautical miles. This follows the First Minister successfully pressing for the resurrection of the Joint Ministerial Committee as a formal mechanism for taking forward issues involving the UK Government and devolved administrations. Agreement has been reached on a framework for marine planning and nature conservation.</p>

  <p>This will involve a coherent system of marine planning involving all parts of the UK. Scotland will participate in the development of a UK Marine Policy statement, which will provide a framework for the sustainable development of the UK Marine area. The Marine Policy Statement will guide marine planning and there will be a mechanism for Scottish ministers to decline to adopt a Marine Policy Statement. Additional marine planning and nature conservation powers including the powers to designate Marine Protected Zones will be executively devolved to Scottish ministers beyond 12nm to 200nm bringing these responsibilities into line with existing fisheries responsibilities. Scottish marine plans after agreement by the UK Government will be binding on UK bodies and departments exercising reserved functions. This provides the basis for a coherent system of marine management for the seas around Scotland joining up with the UK Government to provide an integrated framework to achieve a good outcome for Scotland&rsquo;s seas.</p>

  <p>Only schemes that comply with the definition of an efficiency saving would be accepted. The definition of a cash-releasing efficiency saving is where the organisation delivers the same service at a reduced cost, demonstrated by delivering the same outcome(s) or output(s) for a reduced input or delivering a reduced unit cost allowing an increased volume of service for the same cost.</p>

  <p>Potential efficiencies are considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has agreed a wide-ranging package of improvements to support planning reform, which were announced on 28 October 2008. Copies of <em>Delivering Planning Reform </em> have been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 46980). The reforms will ensure planning is more effectively geared towards supporting increased sustainable economic growth. Planning modernisation is a live and on-going project that will be fully implemented next year.</p>

  <p>The health care management of prisoners is undertaken on an individual needs basis, informed by the presenting needs of each prisoner. Any prisoner with diabetes would be provided with appropriate care, dependent on their specific need. Establishments have well developed links with community partners to access specialist advice and treatment.</p>

  <p>The appropriateness of providing specific diabetes clinics at each establishment is dependent on the number of prisoners requiring such services within each prison at any given time.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to making its information available to all, including disabled people. Public bodies have responsibilities under the Disability Discrimination Act to make reasonable adjustments to enable access to services. Under the Disability Equality Duty, they are also required to have due regard to the need to promote equality for disabled people. We take our duties under the Disability Discrimination Act and Disability Equality Duty seriously, and expect other organisations and public bodies to do so too.</p>

  <p>We are currently providing the Scottish Accessible Information Forum (SAIF) with funding of &pound;80,021 per year until March 2011.</p>

  <p>This funding will allow SAIF to continue to carry through the recommendations of <em>Enabling Information,</em> a report on improving access and raising standards in information services for disabled people and their carers in Scotland, one of the conclusions of the Scottish Working Group on Information Services for People with Disabilities.</p>

  <p>Traffic survey work of this nature is the responsibility of local authorities. However, I understand that some survey work has been undertaken by Strathclyde Partnership for Transport as part of their Regional Transport Strategy and I would refer the member to the answer to question S3W-17930 on 27 November 2008.</p>

  <p>I see no need for action by the Scottish Government given that the matter is currently being addressed by Strathclyde Partnership for Transport (SPT) and their member councils of South Ayrshire, East Ayrshire and South Lanarkshire. SPT have already identified access to the M74 via the A70 and A71 as a key priority forming part of their Regional Transport Strategy.</p>

  <p>I understand that SPT have funded developmental work by East Ayrshire Council on improvements to the A70 in 2007-08, and have received a bid from them for the 2008-09 SPT Capital Programme for improvements to the A70. The aim of this is to improve journey times, reliability and safety, in the context of improving the attractiveness of East Ayrshire, and improving access to the M74.</p>

  <p>East Ayrshire Council has funded further work this year looking at the whole route of the A70/A71 to examine opportunities for future phased improvements. This is likely to form the basis of future bids for funding to SPT to determine future, long-term plans for the route.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is monitoring developments with the Aberdeen 3Rs school project closely in light of the current situation. Scottish Futures Trust is in regular contact with Aberdeen City Council. The council has taken steps to ensure that work will continue on site while the private sector consortium seeks to secure funding for the project. Responsibility for delivering the schools and securing necessary finance remains solely with the consortium.</p>

  <p>As at end-November 2008, the VisitScotland.com website ( <a href="http://www.visitscotland.com" target="_blank">www.visitscotland.com</a> ) lists 7,190 quality assured accommodation providers. Approximately 1,000 of these have chosen to have an online booking facility through the VisitScoland.com&rsquo;s booking engine and more than 600 are small businesses that have purchased the Web-In-A-Box tool.</p>

  <p>Data on the number of hotels and guest houses listed on VisitScotland.com who have chosen to offer an online booking facility through the VisitScotland.com&rsquo;s booking engine are listed at table 1 and 2. Table 3 provides a breakdown of all types of accommodation providers.</p>

  <p>The total number of tourist beds available through these online booking facilities can vary depending on the season and how many beds individual providers offer via this particular booking method.</p>

  <p>Information is not available broken down by local authority area, but is shown by each of the marketing regions used by the website.</p>

  <p>VisitScotland.com re-launched the website in April 2008, providing direct access for consumers to the individual accommodation providers on the Visitors Guide and opening new booking enquiries channels through the Travel Shop. Substantial growth has been achieved on the overall number of e-mail enquiries and also direct enquiries to accommodation providers.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what priority will be given to applicants for funding for Gypsy/Traveller sites in local authority areas that do not have residential or transit sites.</p>

  <p>The invitation to local authorities to apply for funding from the Gypsy/Traveller Site Grant 2008-09 to 2009-10 indicated that bids for new residential or transit sites would be particularly welcome. It also indicated that where strong bids for these purposes were received they may be given priority for funding. The decision to encourage bids for new sites responds to evidence of unmet demand in some areas and that investment in recent years has been dominated by refurbishing existing sites.</p>

  <p>In assessing bids, a number of criteria will be taken into account including evidence of need and demand level, the suitability and sustainability of the proposed site and whether it represents good use of money rather than whether a local authority already has other residential Gypsy/Traveller sites (there are currently no transit sites in Scotland).</p>
