  <p>The figures requested are listed in the following tables. The Scottish Ambulance Service rolled out a priority based dispatch system during 2002-04, so the figures from 2000-03 relate to all accident and emergency (A&amp;E) incidents and the figures from 2003-06 relate to Category A (life-threatening) and Category B (serious but not life-threatening) calls. Category B responses include calls transferred from GPs, hospitals or NHS 24 where the patient has already received clinical intervention and requires to be taken to hospital or, in some cases, to another hospital. The current average response time across Scotland for Category A calls is 8.4 minutes.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is taking forward a number of actions, in both education and health, to improve the lives of children of children with ASD. These actions include the formation of the ASD Education Working Group, which is carrying forward the recommendations of the report of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education, which examines the educational provision for children with ASD and the NAS <em>make school make sense </em>report. The Scottish Executive Health Department has set up the ASD Reference Group, which is taking forward the recommendations in the Public Health Institute of Scotland&rsquo;s <em>ASD Needs Assessment Report (2001).</em> The Scottish Executive also provides significant funding to a number of projects, all aimed at improving the lives of children with ASD.</p>

  <p>While the Executive has not carried out any formal assessment of the potential for deep geothermal energy production in Scotland, we are committed to developing a Renewable Heat Strategy by the end of 2007. The potential for geothermal energy will be considered as part of this work.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the publication in November 2006 of Communities Scotland&rsquo;s research report 72, &quot;Local housing need and affordability model for Scotland &ndash; Update&quot;, whether it or Communities Scotland plans to commission further research into the impact on housing demand and supply of recent and projected in-migration to Scotland from EU countries and elsewhere.</p>

  <p>There are currently no plans to commission further national research into the impact of recent and projected in-migration to Scotland on housing demand and supply. However, following on from the publication of Communities Scotland research report 72, the Executive and Communities Scotland are undertaking work examining the consistency of housing needs assessments at local authority area level. This will include attempting to collect information on the level of in-migrants into each local authority area who are unable to afford suitable housing.</p>

  <p>Locally Communities Scotland are supporting two housing need studies, &quot;Exploring the Housing Needs of Minority Ethnic Communities in Forth Valley&rsquo; and &lsquo;Accommodation Needs Assessment for Gypsy Travellers (Edinburgh, Scottish Borders, East and Mid Lothian)&quot;. These studies will further our understanding of the impact of recent in-migration in these areas.</p>

  <p>Nationally, the General Register Office for Scotland will be involved with work improving migration data sources in the UK, following a recent report of the Migration Task Force. This will improve the evidence on which projections of the future population, and therefore the number of households, are based.</p>

  <p>There are currently no such plans. Local authorities have a number of mechanisms open to them at present for acquiring housing land. Such acquisitions are a matter for local authorities and their partners to consider within their Local Housing Strategy delivery frameworks, taking account of value for money considerations.</p>

  <p>The contractually agreed costs to be recovered by the concessionaire were expressed in 1991 prices discounted at six per cent a year to 1991 base year. The amounts received by Skye Bridge Limited include more than &pound;33 million in toll revenues and compensation payments, and &pound;26.75 million to end the tolling concession.

  <p>Decisions regarding the Stone of Destiny rest solely with Her Majesty The Queen as advised by Her Commissioners for the Safekeeping of the Regalia, whose duties are set out under the Royal warrant issued on 12 November 1996 immediately prior to the Stone&rsquo;s departure from Westminster Abbey and return to Scotland. Historic Scotland officials have advised the Commissioners on technical matters relating to the care of the stone (and the Honours of Scotland) but they have no locus in any decision-making regarding the location of the stone.

  <p>It is not possible to estimate fully the impacts arising from changes to EU funding as the programmes have not been approved by the European Commission. However, changes to the administration to the funds would not directly lead to job losses in any sector. Any changes that will be introduced would be designed to ease administration burdens on project sponsors.</p>

  <p>It has been claimed that the delay to the start of the new programmes would see EU-funded projects close and redundancies ensue. Through a combination of operating a &quot;shadow&quot; European Structural Fund (ESF) round of &pound;12 million of Executive funding from January and recycling more than &pound;6 million funding from the existing ESF programmes to prolong current projects, the Executive has worked to ensure that this would not happen.</p>
