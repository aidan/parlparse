  <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service&rsquo;s objective was to have a paramedic on board every frontline ambulance by the end of March 2005.</p>

  <p>The Health Department has been monitoring the implementation of the service&rsquo;s paramedic training programme. The objective of the programme has been to increase and alter the frontline staffing mix to provide for between 55% and 60% of frontline emergency staff being paramedics (the balance technicians). As at the end of March 2006, out of 2,146 frontline staff across Scotland there were 1,204 paramedics (56.1% of frontline staff). The comparable March 1999 figures were 1,750 front-line staff of whom 597 (34.1%) were paramedics.Whilst this staffing mix should enable the ambulance service to deploy a paramedic to all calls that require such a response, it has in recent months introduced nearly 100 additional technicians in Glasgow and Lanarkshire. This influx of staff has skewed the ratio of technicians to paramedics meaning that currently there are seven technicians out of a staff of 30 who may be deployed on rapid response units, while other technicians are being trained up to paramedic level. The ambulance service plans to regain the appropriate skill mix by December 2007.The ambulance service deploys the most appropriate resource to an emergency call, and in relation to Category A (life-threatening) calls, the policy provides for this to be a paramedic response, whether that paramedic is in a single manned rapid response unit or is part of a double crewed ambulance. There may however be exceptional circumstances when, owing to short notice sick absences or other situations, the choice is whether to deploy a rapid response unit manned by a technician or to run with one less emergency resource for that particular shift.</p>

  <p>The operational and financial performance of the Scottish Ambulance Service is the subject of continuous monitoring both by the service itself and by the Health Department. The Local Delivery Plan and specifically the health, efficiency, access and treatment objectives provide a key focus for performance management.</p>

  <p>The quality of service provided by the Scottish Ambulance Service is also reviewed by NHS Quality Improvement Scotland. Each Emergency Medical Dispatch Centre has gained ISO 9002. The Scottish Ambulance Service College is accredited by the Institute of Healthcare Development. Patient surveys are undertaken and an annual assessment is carried out using the European Foundation Quality Model.</p>

  <p>Prime responsibility for planning and consulting on acute services reorganisation lies with NHS boards. In doing so, they are guided by the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s health care policies, including <em>Delivering for Health</em> , which aims to ensure that the service anticipates and responds strategically to changing demands and to longer term developments in care and treatment.</p>

  <p>Boards are statutorily required to collaborate with neighbouring boards and with relevant special health boards such as the Scottish Ambulance Service when developing plans to reorganise services. Where such plans might impact on ambulance service provision then boards will discuss the implications, including issues such as the current levels of ambulance services and the prospective levels expected to be in place when the service change takes place.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive allocates funding to NHS boards for blood-borne virus prevention work. These funds are used in a number of ways, including the provision of needle exchange facilities to prevent the spread of blood-borne viruses through the sharing of dirty injecting equipment.</p>

  <p>In addition to the blood-borne virus prevention funding outlined above, NHS boards will receive an additional &pound;4 million over a two year period to support implementation of the Hepatitis C Action Plan for Scotland which includes measures aimed at preventing injecting and helping injectors cease their injecting behaviour.</p>

  <p>NHS boards may provide additional monies to support the provision of needle exchange facilities, but this information is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>Cathy Jamieson:</p>

  <p>Scottish Ambulance Service</p>

  <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service has eight Special Operations Response Teams strategically located across Scotland to provide a swift response to major incidents including terrorist incidents involving the use of a &quot;dirty bomb&quot;.</p>

  <p>Each unit is capable of decontaminating 24 ambulant persons per hour. All the equipment was purchased in 2003.</p>

  <p>Fire and Rescue Service</p>

  <p>Since the introduction of the New Dimension programme, eight dedicated mass decontamination units have been provided to seven of the eight Scottish Fire and Rescue Services on a risk and population basis. Each mass decontamination structure is designed to decontaminate a maximum of 200 ambulant persons per hour.</p>

  <p>These are currently distributed on a Fire and Rescue Service (FRA) basis as follows:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has to date not undertaken specific research in relation to the use of short-term funding initiatives and the subsequent mainstreaming of such funded activities. There is however external research by Audit Scotland (2005) and the UK Strategy Unit (2003) which have considered the use of these initiatives by the Executive. Both reports are available at: <a href="http://www.audit-scotland.gov.uk/publications/pdf/2005/05pf08ag.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.audit-scotland.gov.uk/publications/pdf/2005/05pf08ag.pdf</a> . <br /> <a href="http://www.policyhub.gov.uk/docs/rop.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.policyhub.gov.uk/docs/rop.pdf</a> .</p>

  <p>The Audit Committee of the Scottish Parliament also considered this issue. The Executive&rsquo;s response to their report is available at: <a href="../../../business/committees/audit/reports-06/aur06-01.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/committees/audit/reports-06/aur06-01.htm</a>.</p>

  <p>Finally it is Executive policy to evaluate all new spending commitments and any new funding initiatives or pilots would be part of that commitment. Published Executive research is available at the following website:<a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Research/Research/17692/SocialResearchPubs/Introduction" target="_blank"> http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Research/Research/17692/SocialResearchPubs/Introduction</a>.</p>

  <p>Note: 1. For 2005-06 returns, all police forces agreed to identify weapons where possible, based on evidence such as type of damage caused, even if the weapons were not recovered. This has resulted in a considerable increase in the alleged use of identified weapons, particularly air weapons, and a decrease in the alleged use of unidentified firearms.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. These figures include:</p>

  <p>- Unoccupied dwellings that are exempt from council tax.</p>

  <p>- Dwellings subject to second home or long-term empty property discount.</p>

  <p>- A small number of dwellings occupied entirely by adults who are &quot;disregarded&quot; for the purpose of paying council tax, such as adults who are severely mentally impaired.</p>

  <p>2. The figures may fluctuate for two main reasons:</p>

  <p>- Self-catering holiday accommodation available to let for less than 140 days per year may be recorded either as an unoccupied dwelling (and included in these figures) or as a business.</p>

  <p>- There can be delays in updating the information on council tax.</p>

  <p>The Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directive impacts on a number of activities within the agricultural sector. This includes the treatment of animal and vegetable matter and milk processing. The largest impact is in the intensive farming sector.</p>

  <p>A Regulatory Impact Assessment, completed in 2000, estimated in general terms the cost to industry of complying with IPPC. A separate UK study jointly funded by the Scottish Executive in 2006 reviewed the costs associated with obtaining PPC permits. While this did not estimate the total cost to the agricultural sector, typical costs per intensive farming unit in Northern Ireland were found to range between &pound;500 and &pound;1,000 for one-off application preparation costs, &pound;500 to &pound;10,000 for capital investment, and &pound;500 to &pound;1,000 for one-off management time costs. However, these findings were based on a very small sample size and the figures may not be representative of all intensive farming sites under IPPC. In addition, operators are required to pay charges to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency which vary depending on the size of the installation.</p>

  <p>Prior to 1984 claims for damages for personal injury were subject to both the three year limitation period and the 20 year long negative prescription. The effect of prescription is to extinguish totally a potential claim so that it no longer exists, whereas limitation imposes a time limit of three years for bringing an action for compensation for personal injury. However, the court has discretion to allow an action to proceed even though it is raised over three years after the incident giving rise to the claim where it thinks it would be equitable to do so. The Prescription and Limitation (Scotland) Act 1984 removed personal injury actions from the scope of long negative prescription. When the Act came into force on 26 September 1984, all claims where the cause of action arose prior to 26 September 1964 ceased to exist. We have asked the Scottish Law Commission (SLC) to consider certain aspects of the law in relation to both limitation and prescription. The SLC Discussion Paper (Scot Law Com No.132) is available on their website at <a href="http://www.scotlawcom.gov.uk" target="_blank">http://www.scotlawcom.gov.uk</a> . The Executive will carefully consider the SLC Report when it is received before taking decisions on future action.</p>
