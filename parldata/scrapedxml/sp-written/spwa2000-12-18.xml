  <p>Subject to planning consent, it is intended that the Scottish Agricultural Science Agency&#8217;s Headquarters should be relocated to Gogarbank Farm, some five miles west of Edinburgh, where the agency&#8217;s field trialling work takes place. Gogarbank Farm was considered along with a number of other options, with the assessment process being undertaken by external consultants. The principal criteria taken into account were the capital and running costs associated with each site, assessed over a 25-year term, the travelling distance from the site to the agency&#8217;s experimental field trialling land, and the planning restrictions relating to each of the locations.</p>

  <p>A scientific review was also undertaken to investigate the feasibility of transferring the agency&#8217;s extensive field operations to a site adjacent to the Scottish Crop Research Institute at Invergowrie, Dundee. As announced by Mr Angus MacKay in his answer of 1 December (question S1W-11704), the results indicated that the ground conditions would not be compatible with those necessary for the agency&#8217;s work on the certification of seed potatoes. Accordingly, planning of the relocation of the agency&#8217;s headquarters to Gogarbank Farm is now being taken forward.</p>

  <p>Bullying of any kind is unacceptable and should be addressed quickly and firmly whenever it arises. The Scottish Executive has issued a range of guidance to assist schools and local authorities to tackle it effectively. We are funding the national Anti-Bullying Network to help schools across Scotland share good practice in tackling bullying and provide training and consultancy services to support schools and local authorities in developing anti-bullying strategies. We also provide funding to Childline to secure the continued operation of their Bullying Helpline.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive why Scotland accounts for only 3.9% of UK service sector exports, as reported in the Scottish Council for Development and Industry&#8217;s May/June 2000 Indicator, and what steps it is taking to address this situation.</p>

  <p>It is difficult to make detailed comparisons between SCDI service sector export figures and those collected by the Office for National Statistics on a UK basis, and there is also the considerable influence of the City of London to consider. However, it is generally acknowledged that there has been a weaker performance in tradeable services.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive, through Scottish Trade International, is committed to helping Scottish exporters from all sectors to access new markets and compete effectively. The current Export Development Strategy for Scotland identifies a number of priority industries, two of which are from the service sector.</p>

  <p>According to SCDI&#8217;s last annual survey, for 1998-99, Scottish service sector reached a record &pound;2.357 billion, a 14.2% increase on the previous year. The 3.9% figure represented a slight increase as a percentage of the UK total. In the same survey, SCDI also reported that some 40% of exporters in this sector expected to see future growth.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-11236 by Mr Sam Galbraith on 29 November 2000, whether it assesses flood prevention needs on a strategic basis or responds to bids by individual councils and, if the former, how this is done.</p>

  <p>In order to review and develop its flood prevention policy and to assess the resources required to meet flood prevention needs, the Executive is informed by its bilateral contacts with councils, the biennial reports published by councils under the Flood Prevention (Scotland) Act 1961 and the outcome of its research programme. The information available from these sources was taken into account in the recent Spending Review when significant additional resources for local authority expenditure on flood prevention were set. Allocations of these resources for major confirmed flood prevention schemes are considered subsequently on request by councils.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-11237 by Mr Sam Galbraith on 29 November 2000, what the extent is of the increased high flows in the River Clyde in the last 25 years; where these occurred; whether they pose any potential flooding problems, and what steps are being taken to prevent any such flooding problems.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-12-18.S1W-11724.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80158" speakername="Mr Sam Galbraith" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa1218.htm#8">

  <p>Further to my previous reply, information on flows in the River Clyde is not held by the Executive. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency do, however, hold such information and I have asked the agency&#8217;s Chief Executive to provide you with the information requested.</p>

  <p>Any potential flooding problems and preventative action associated with high flows in the River Clyde is a matter for the local authorities and landowners concerned. Under the Flood Prevention (Scotland) Act 1961, councils have powers to protect non-agricultural land from flooding and, since 1997, are required to publish biennial reports which specify the measures which they consider they require to take to prevent or mitigate flooding of such land in their areas. I understand from their reports that Glasgow City Council intend to carry out flood studies at Carmyle and Richmond Park and that Renfrewshire Council have identified the need for a flood prevention scheme on the River Clyde.</p>

  <p>Information on the total number of allergy clinics across Scotland is not collected centrally. However, specialist allergy services are available in Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Dundee and Glasgow.</p>

  <p>On 13 November 2000, I announced publication of a major review of immunology and allergy services in Scotland, the main recommendation from which is for an increase in the number of consultant immunologists. The Executive is providing funding to allow the creation of two new consultant immunologist posts, to increase our ability to identify and treat those patients most at risk from potentially fatal disorders.</p>

  <p>There is a variety of sources of data which we are monitoring to gauge progress on widening access. These include socio-economic data provided by UCAS on applicants and accepted applicants to higher education institutions; the annual Performance Indicators published by the funding councils which provide data on entrants from socio-economic groups IIIM-V, low participation neighbourhoods and retention; the Age Participation Index and the numbers and characteristics of people participating in higher education from statistics collected by the Higher Education Statistics Agency. We have included a milestone in the Social Justice Plan relating to the Performance Indicators.</p>

  <p>I am very pleased to announce that, as part of the recent spending review, we have made available &pound;27 million over three years to meet the costs of implementing the legislative provisions to address homelessness which will be included in the forthcoming Housing Bill.

  <p>The Pay Review Body for Doctors and Dentists (DDRB) has recommended a general pay increase of 3.9% both for salaried doctors and dentists and for pay elements of fees for general medical and dental practitioners. The Pay Review Body has also recommended an increase of 7% in seniority payments to general medical practitioners from April.</p>

  <p>The Pay Review Body for Nurses, Midwives, Health Visitors and the Professions Allied to Medicine (NPRB) has recommended a general pay increase of 3.7% for nurses, midwives, health visitors and the professions allied to medicine. In addition, the NPRB recommended that one discretionary point should be consolidated within pay ranges for F, G, H and I Grade nurses and Senior I, II, Superintendent/Head/Chief III and Chief IV Grade PAMs. The NPRB also endorsed an agreement reached on midwifery grading.</p>

  <p>For the third year, pay increases for NHS staff are above inflation. The Scottish Executive firmly believes that an investment in staff is an investment in patient care. The successful delivery of the wide-ranging service improvements set out in the <i>Scottish Health Plan</i> will largely be dependent upon these staff. We believe that pay for NHS staff must be fair and affordable, based on the contribution they make. I am therefore pleased to confirm that the Scottish Executive has decided to accept in full the recommendations of the DDRB and NPRB for 2001-02, with no staging.</p>

  <p>These increases will be met from the allocations made to health boards for 2001-02 and which were announced on 21 September 2000.</p>
