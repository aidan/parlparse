  <p>Alastair Darling, Secretary of State for Transport launched the consultation process for a UK white paper <i>The Future Development of Air Transport in the United Kingdom</i> by a statement to the House of Commons on 23 July. The consultation period runs until the end of November. The white paper is to be published next year and will provide a sustainable long-term policy framework for the future of aviation across the UK.</p>

  <p>Aviation matters are partly reserved and partly devolved. The UK Government and the Scottish Executive are working closely together to ensure that the white paper meets Scotland&#146;s needs. The Scottish consultation document was issued jointly by the Department for Transport and the Executive. Officials from the Department for Transport and the Executive&#146;s Development Department are organising a programme of consultative events that will engage stakeholders in a detailed debate regarding the key issues highlighted in the consultation document.</p>

  <p>The 23 applicants concerned contacted Eaga by telephone and the information they gave led Eaga to believe that they were eligible for the central heating programme. However, applicants must sign a declaration attesting that they meet all the conditions for free central heating. Fifteen of the applicants did not return signed declarations and it must therefore be assumed that, on reflection, they found themselves to be ineligible. Three of the eight remaining applicants have had free central heating installed and the other five will soon do so.</p>

  <p>The conclusions reached by the Central Heating Working Group were set out in the enclosure to a letter of 23 February 2001, from the then Minister for Social Justice to the Convenor of the Social Justice Committee. It was copied to all MSPs and copies were placed in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre. It records that priority for free central heating will be given to (a) those aged over 75; (b) the elderly living alone, and (c) the disabled and the long-term ill. These cases are prioritised against other applications received at the same time.</p>

  <p>This information is not available because of the way information on salaried dentists is supplied to the Common Services Agency. We are working with the agency to improve the accuracy of the data received on salaried dentists but the agency will continue to be unable to provide information relating to whole-time equivalent salaried dentists since none of the information received allows them to determine whole-time equivalents. This is because a number of salaried dentist posts are not filled by a single dentist but are shared by a number of dentists.</p>

  <p>I very much regret the announcement by Sanmina SCI, of its intention to close its Irvine plant. Our immediate priority is to provide support and assistance for those facing redundancy. I have instructed the local PACE (Partnership Action for Continuing Employment) team to ensure a rapid response to help those affected into new jobs or training opportunities. Support will be provided by the range of public agencies involved in the PACE team in terms of retraining, upskilling and guidance on employment opportunities.</p>

  <p>I met with representatives of Scottish Enterprise Ayrshire (SEA) and local MSPs on 1 August to outline the action to be taken, and am provided with regular updates on PACE activity by SEA. I am confident that Sanmina SCI will work closely with the PACE team to best ensure that the needs of its employees are identified, and addressed, at the earliest possible date.</p>

  <p>The Treasury Taskforce&#146;s <i>Technical Note No. 6: How to Manage the Delivery of Long-term PFI Contracts</i> refers to contract monitoring in the development (award of the contract to the commencement of delivery of the services) and delivery (the provision and use of the contracted services during the remaining life of the contract) stages.</p>

  <p>Of the three Scottish Executive private finance initiative contracts, the technical professional consultant which monitors the M6 DBFO on behalf of Scottish ministers had its procedures audited by the Scottish Executive in December 2001, with a follow up in January 2002. An audit of the contract monitoring procedures in relation to Kilmarnock Prison will be included in the strategic audit plan covering the period 2003-06. Monitoring of the Skye Bridge contract is the responsibility of a unit within the Executive, and its procedures have been checked through internal audits over the period.</p>

  <p>The information requested is as follows:</p>

  <p>(a) There are no standard membership criteria set for organisations who are working towards registration. Membership criteria will vary depending on individual steering groups, and their local communities.</p>

  <p>(b) If a local housing organisation (LHO) is registered with Communities Scotland, the constitution and rules governing the organisation will set out criteria for membership, and members will sign a code of conduct. If the LHO is not registered with Communities Scotland, the same principles will apply as with a steering group. LHOs which have not yet achieved registration can also adopt rules on membership, or ask members to sign a code of conduct.</p>

  <p>(c) A person may be excluded from membership of a housing association if their application does not meet an association&#146;s membership policy or rules or if a committee member does not agree by its code of conduct.</p>

  <p>Significant work has been progressed already in relation to those recommendations aimed both directly at the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) and those which are aimed at the COPFS and the police jointly. A detailed action plan which charts the work progressed to date, and that which is necessary to complete the job, is available on the departmental website of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service <a href="http://www.crownoffice.gov.uk/" target="_blank">www.crownoffice.gov.uk</a> . A copy of this action plan has been provided to the bereaved relatives and partner of Surjit Singh Chhokar and to the Conveners of the Justice 2 and Equal Opportunities Committees.</p>

  <p>In particular, the Lord Advocate issued guidelines to Chief Constables in February this year which dealt with a number of matters: (1) the investigation and reporting of racist crime by the police to procurators fiscal; (2) the need for the police to assess language needs of accused persons, victims, witnesses and bereaved relatives and to provide procurators fiscal with this information, and (3) the information which procurators fiscal require of the police to allow liaison to take place with bereaved relatives in an appropriate way. The Commission for Racial Equality were consulted in relation to the drafting of the guidelines, which will be consistently monitored.</p>

  <p>The Commission for Racial Equality and the Racial Equality Councils have also been provided with a copy of the action plan and we are committed to completing the work required by the plan and to regularly updating the plan to demonstrate progress.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive welcomes the fact that local agencies involved in Sexual Abuse Awareness Month are planning a range of events and publicity. We recognise the importance of raising awareness of sexual abuse. We recently issued a research report <i>Beyond Trauma: Mental</i> <i>Health Care Needs of Women Who Survived Childhood Sexual Abuse</i> to health and social care agencies asking them to respond positively to its recommendations for service improvements. In addition we have awarded funding of &#163;120,000 over three years to the Moira Anderson Foundation to help raise awareness of sexual abuse.</p>

  <p>It is not our intention to publish either the strategic assessment of drug-assisted sexual assault or the guide for investigators produced by the working group led by the Scottish Drug Enforcement Agency. Both documents contain sensitive information inappropriate for the public domain.</p>

  <p>We will, however, draw upon the information in these documents to assist us with the development of new public information materials on drug-assisted sexual assault, as part of our Know the Score Drugs Communications Strategy. Copies of these materials will be sent to the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>Bursaries were introduced in academic year 2001-02 for both young and mature students entering higher education for the first time or returning to higher education after a gap of a year or more. Thirty-nine thousand, eight hundred and nine students applied to the Student Awards Agency for Scotland (SAAS) for maintenance support in 2001-02. Of these, 33.6% (13,385) received a Young Students' Bursary.</p>

  <p>Many of the remainder would have been eligible to apply for the Mature Students' Bursary Fund (MSBF), which is administered by individual colleges and universities. It is not possible to say how many students may have received payments from MSBF since figures on uptake are not yet available.</p>

  <p>In addition, 974 (2.4%) students received funding under separate arrangements for courses that attract a Scottish Executive Health Department bursary.</p>
