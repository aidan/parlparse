  <p>According to research on the use of civil antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) undertaken by DTZ Pieda and Heriot-Watt University, 13 ASBOs were issued in Aberdeen City in 2003-04, 14 in 2004-05 and 11 in 2005-06.</p>

  <p>Since this research has now reported, figures on the use of ASBOs for subsequent years are obtained directly from Aberdeen City. According to their records there were 14 ASBOs issued in 2006-07 and 21 issued from April to September 2007.</p>

  <p>These figures include interim ASBOs that were later granted as full ASBOs (as well as those that were still in force as interim ASBOs at the end of the reporting period).</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is currently considering the most appropriate action in relation to the restrictions placed on the provision of trustee indemnity insurance under the Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005.</p>

  <p>I am clear that the restrictions placed on the provision of indemnity insurance were an unintended consequence of the legislation.

  <p>Raising attainment is an important part of school improvement. However, we have concerns from previous experience that narrow attainment-based targets can encourage teaching to the test and can narrow the curriculum. Teaching and assessment should focus on supporting pupils&rsquo; learning and should not be driven by performance targets.</p>

  <p>Local indicators which, alongside the published national indicators, will form the basis of individual single outcome agreements for each local authority are currently being developed. It is too early in this process to comment on the focus of specific indicators, but we look forward to working with authorities to ensure that performance information in single outcome agreements is of a high quality and supports good learning and teaching.</p>

  <p>Whilst local government had flexibility to allocate other resources for work on the school estate, the specific amounts allocated to local government for the Schools Fund from 2003 to 2007 were as follows:</p>

  <p>2003-04: &pound;36.7 million</p>

  <p>2004-05: &pound;76.7 million</p>

  <p>2005-06: &pound;96.7 million</p>

  <p>2006-07: &pound;151.35 million.</p>

  <p>Some spending on children and young people will have been subsumed within budgets that covered services to people of all ages - e.g. community health &ndash; and as such, it is not possible to identify the total budget for children and young people over this period. It is not therefore possible to present this as a percentage of the budget for children and young people.</p>

Of this, &pound;371,600 was spent on a publicity campaign for both elections (carried out jointly with the Electoral Commission) with the balance spent on opinion research and research on media coverage specific to local authority elections.</p>

  <p>There are a number of risk factors associated with aneurysms, including smoking and raised blood pressure. All health improvement measures which encourage smoking cessation and reducing raised blood pressure will reduce the risk of an aneurysm. In addition, we are considering introduction of a screening programme for abdominal aortic aneurysm following the advice of the UK National Screening Committee.</p>

  <p>The data requested is not held centrally in the form requested.</p>

  <p>The latest Scottish Stroke Care Audit monitors performance against the NHS Quality Improvement Scotland clinical standards for stroke. Its national report includes data describing the quality of stroke care in each acute hospital grouped by NHS board during 2005 and 2006. These show that 15 out of 21 hospitals and 12 out of 14 boards now meet the standard of &quot;80% of patients having a CT or MRI scan within 48 hours of admission&quot;. The report also found that 79% of all Scottish stroke patients received a brain scan within 48 hours of admission, an improvement of 5% on 2004.</p>

  <p>Yes, we announced our intention to set up this inquiry on 1 October 2007. Lord Gill, the Lord Justice Clerk, was formally appointed as chair on 21 January 2008 and the inquiry has been set up from that date. There will be no other appointments to the inquiry panel.</p>

  <p>The inquiry is a joint inquiry but as it is taking place in Scotland it is appropriate that the Scottish rules should apply.</p>

  <p>The agreed terms of reference for the inquiry are:</p>

  <p>To inquire into the circumstances leading up to the incident on 11 May 2004 at the premises occupied by the ICL group of companies, Grovepark Mills, Maryhill, Glasgow.</p>

  <p>Yes, we would prefer to see a trade in meat rather than live exports.

  <p>Since 2005 the Scottish Government has provided almost &pound;3 million in additional interim funding to improve NHS wheelchair waiting times. The funding has been used to purchase additional wheelchairs and to employ additional staff in the five rehabilitation centres in Scotland. It is planned to spend a total of &pound;16 million over the next three financial years (2008-09 to 2011-12) to modernise NHS wheelchair and seating services.</p>

  <p>Following the independent review of NHS wheelchair and seating services, a project board has been established and a project manager has been appointed. The project team will assess, prioritise and implement the recommendations of the review, including those recommendations that relate to the provision of wheelchairs that meet users&rsquo; medical, postural and social needs.</p>

  <p>The Chief Planner regularly receives telephone calls from MSPs about planning matters. Information about the number of calls is not held by the Scottish Government because a formal record is not routinely produced for every call received, as many involve simply the provision of factual information to MSPs about planning processes. The Chief Planner has given information to the Local Government and Communities Committee on a range of contacts he has had with MSPs. The official report is available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website at:</p>

  <p>Specific amounts to repay PFI/PPP contracts form part of broader allocations in the spending review for public services and investment. For example, in the case of local authorities, as agreed through the Concordat, the local government settlement is now all-embracing and individual project costs are not ring-fenced.</p>

  <p>Public bodies which have entered into PFI/PPP contracts are responsible for payments to their private sector partners from within the total resources available to them. The total amount of unitary charges for PPP projects that are either operational or reached financial close to date for the spending review years (2008-09 to 2010-11) is &pound;2.0 billion covering 80 projects. Unitary charges are the amounts paid by the public sector procuring body to the private sector consortium for the services it provides over the length of the contract.</p>

  <p>Following a telephone discussion with the Chief Planner on 4 December 2007 I agreed to call in the planning application for the proposed golf resort at Menie Estate. During that call the Chief Planner informed me that he had ascertained from Aberdeenshire Council that it was unlikely that the council&rsquo;s standing orders would allow the planning application to be reconsidered by the council.</p>

  <p>As a result of the unusual amount of public interest in the First Minister&rsquo;s travel to this meeting, the Permanent Secretary has considered what use was made of the Government Car Service on this occasion. He has noted that it is commonplace for civil servants, including special advisers, to travel with ministers in government cars, in order to assist ministers to use time spent travelling to progress government business. He is satisfied that the use made of the Government Car Service in this case was consistent with such general practice and was both appropriate and pragmatic.</p>

  <p>However, Mr Salmond has made clear in earlier statements that the Trump Organization had called his constituency office on 3 December 2007 to request a meeting, which was held in Aberdeen for convenience, as he was already due to be travelling to Aberdeen to conduct government business with his special adviser and prepare for government business in Aberdeen the next day.</p>

  <p>The Permanent Secretary has made clear, as part of his consideration of the behaviour of civil servants, that he received an assurance from the Chief Planner that he has, at no time, been instructed by any party to act improperly and that he feels he has applied the same rigour in this particular case, in terms of following due process and having regard to the expected standards of conduct, as he would do in any other planning case.</p>

  <p>Consequently, there would be no reason for the Permanent Secretary to consider the behaviour of any minister in this matter, even if it were not the case that the terms of the Ministerial Code make clear that the Permanent Secretary has no role in making judgements about the behaviour of ministers in relation to the code.</p>
