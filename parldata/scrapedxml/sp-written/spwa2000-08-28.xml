  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it keeps comparative statistics on major flooding incidents throughout Scotland and, if so, whether it will publish details for each of the last ten years for which figures are available and whether there is any national monitoring conducted centrally of such incidents.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-08-28.3.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80134" speakername="Sarah Boyack" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa0828.htm#9071">

  <p>Statistics on flooding incidents are not held centrally and therefore the details requested are not available.</p>

  <p>Whilst national monitoring is not undertaken, the Flood Prevention (Scotland) Act 1961, as amended in 1997, placed a duty on local authorities to publish biennial reports on flooding and flood prevention measures. These reports are required to include all incidents of flooding of land (other than agricultural land) in their area.</p>

  <p>To date, I understand that all bar three local authorities have published their second biennial report as required by the 1961 Act. Of those which have not yet complied with their statutory duty to publish a report, Highland Council and Stirling Council are looking to publish their reports after the summer. No information has been received from the remaining authority, Falkirk Council, about their plans to publish their second report.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The Clinical Standards Board was only established on 1 April 1999.</p>

  <p>2. The Scottish Ambulance Service was an NHS Trust in 1998-99 and therefore received its resources through contracts with Health Boards and other NHS Trusts.</p>

  <p>3. Allocations for 1998-99 and 1999-2000 included funding for an additional ward. Discussions are still ongoing with the State Hospital regarding the level of funding for the additional ward in 2000-01.</p>

  <p>Actual allocations for 2001-02 have yet to be determined.</p>

  <p>This is primarily a matter for the industry regulator and therefore is a reserved matter. In view of the importance placed by both the UK Government and the Scottish Executive in the promotion of renewable energy, the Department of Trade and Industry last year published a consultation paper containing proposals to facilitate access to distribution networks by all embedded generation including renewables. A DTI/Ofgem Working Group involving all the industry interests is now considering these issues for England and Wales. The Scottish Executive is represented on that working group and is consulting Ofgem&#8217;s Scottish Office with a view to developing a Scottish solution to these issues. In the meantime, as part of its review of Scottish electricity trading arrangements, Ofgem has proposed changes to generator connection charges.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has decided to withdraw the designation of nine High Natural Dispersion Areas around the Scottish coast, as set out in the table below. This means that water authorities will provide secondary treatment at all discharges to coastal waters in these locations for communities with population equivalents of greater than 10,000. Where discharges are to estuarial waters, water authorities will provide secondary treatment for communities with population equivalents greater than 2,000. This is a significant step to further improving the quality of Scottish coastal and estuarial waters, including bathing waters.</p>

  <p>* Estuarial water. In accordance with the requirements of the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive the estuary of the River Ythan will be designated as a &quot;sensitive area&quot; as its waters are or in the near future may become eutrophic. This will require tertiary treatment (phosphorus and/or nitrogen removal) at qualifying discharges within the river catchment. Earlier this year I designated the catchment of the River Ythan as a Nitrate Vulnerable Zone also on the basis that the estuary was or in the near future may become eutrophic.</p>
