  <p>Notes</p>

  <p>1. Includes non-salaried principal dentists, GDS salaried dentists, assistants and vocational trainees.</p>

  <p>2. Data for years prior to the year ending 31 March 2006 have been revised. Double/triple counting within the General Dental Service (GDS) has been eliminated.</p>

  <p>3. Due to improvements in the collection of information on GDS salaried dentists, figures from September 2005 include some GDS salaried dentists not previously recorded.</p>

  <p>There are a number of cases where a salaried post will be recorded under a generic name and not under the name of a specific dentist. Numerous dentists may work in this post at any given time. For years prior to September 2005 it was assumed that, since there was no named individual recorded, a permanent dentist was not in post. As a result, all posts recorded without a named individual were previously excluded from GDS salaried dentist counts. However, information is now available on the individuals who fill these posts. These dentists can now be included in the GDS salaried dentist count, which has resulted in a significant increase in the number of salaried dentists.</p>

  <p>Along with my Cabinet Secretary and Ministerial colleagues, I will be in dialogue with a range of stakeholders over the summer to gather evidence and views on how we can use the strategic spending review to set plans that will enable us to fulfil our purpose and achieve our strategic objectives.

  <p>There are no plans to make any specific funding available to assist local government in settling their equal pay claims. The 2007 Strategic Spending Review, which is currently underway, will be an opportunity for the Scottish Government to consider all the pressures facing local government over the next three years.</p>

  <p>The proportion of new, wheelchair-accessible, barrier-free homes that will be built over the next five years will depend on the pattern of public and private house building and conversions.</p>

  <p>From the 1 May 2007, building regulations require that all new homes are significantly more accessible, without many of the barriers to use that are present in older properties. This applies irrespective of additional provision for accessibility required by Communities Scotland for houses which it funds, or by local authorities&rsquo; planning requirements.</p>
