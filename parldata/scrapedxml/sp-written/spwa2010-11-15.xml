  <p>A short life working group was established in 2008 to undertake a review of both free school meal and school clothing grant provision across Scotland. The working group comprised a partnership involving the Scottish Government, COSLA and the third sector. The group produced a final report which is being considered by ministers.</p>

  <p>Issues such as level and standardisation of school clothing grants will form part of this deliberation.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government and its partners have been taking forward work on recognising achievement as an integral part of Curriculum for Excellence (CfE). In order to explore the issues involved with recognising achievement at a local level, the Scottish Government, in partnership with Learning and Teaching Scotland and local authorities, set up 12 collaborative enquiry projects which took place in schools across Scotland during 2008-09. An evaluation of these projects was commissioned from Edinburgh University which was published on 26 February 2010 and is available on the Scottish Government website.</p>

  <p>In 2009 a sub-group of the CfE Management Board was convened to lead the development of guidance on recognising achievement, profiling and reporting. The guidance is expected to be published on-line in December 2010, with paper copies distributed to schools early in 2011.</p>

  <p>No such assessment has been made. Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) is available throughout Scotland and is not geographically targeted. EMA Is a means tested allowance based on household income. This is the fairest way to ensure we are targeting our most vulnerable young people from the lowest income families.</p>

  <p>This government is committed to raising the employability and skills of young people. Through the provision of tailored work-based opportunities, where the mentoring dimension is usually a key component, national training programmes such as Get Ready for Work perform a vital role in that regard and have been shown to have a positive impact on young people&rsquo;s employability skills and their ability to sustain positive destinations.</p>

  <p>There is currently one specialist myasthenia gravis nurse post in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde which is funded by the Myasthenia Gravis Association on a two year fixed-term contract. There are also 11 neuroscience/neurology specialist nurses, three in NHS Lothian, three in NHS Tayside and five in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde.</p>

  <p>It is for NHS boards to determine their workforce requirements, including specialist nurses, based on the clinical needs of the population and service developments in their area. The role of clinical nurse specialists must be seen in the context of a multi-professional team, that includes medical staff and allied health professionals, in caring for those with specific conditions such as myasthenia gravis.</p>

  <p>A decision on the future work of the Technical Advisory Group on Resource Allocation (TAGRA) on the NHSScotland Resource Allocation Committee (NRAC) formula is due to be made at TAGRA&rsquo;s next meeting on 30 November 2010. As the NRAC formula is designed to inform funding across all areas of Scotland, all aspects of TAGRA&rsquo;s work have the potential to impact on rural areas. Decisions on the formula will continue to be made with regard to TAGRA&rsquo;s core criteria, to ensure that funding of services in rural areas, and elsewhere in Scotland, continues to be fair and appropriate.</p>

  <p>The Technical Advisory Group on Resource Allocation (TAGRA) will consider its work plan for 2011-12 at its next meeting on 30 November 2010, and this will include the recommendations of the report. It would be wrong to prejudge the outcome of this decision. However, I have asked TAGRA to prioritise the recommendation relating to GP out-of-hours services, to begin early in the coming financial year.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>NHS boards in Scotland are responsible for providing NHS services in accordance with national and local priorities and in line with the health needs of the population. The planning and provision of NHS services is a matter for NHS boards. NHS boards are expected to take account of relevant evidence based advice and guidance in the delivery of NHS services.
