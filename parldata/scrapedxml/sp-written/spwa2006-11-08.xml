  <p>It is expected that eligible householders who applied to the programme before 31 October 2006 will have received a central heating system or Warm Deal insulation measures before March 2007.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the Crown Office is required to act in the broader public interest and not only as a prosecution service.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-11-08.10.r0" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Elish Angiolini QC" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa1108.htm#6">

  <p>The Crown Office is the head office of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS). The COPFS is a department of the Scottish Executive, headed by the Lord Advocate, whose position as the head of the systems of criminal prosecution and investigation of deaths in Scotland is enshrined in the Scotland Act.</p>

  <p>It is a key objective of the COPFS to ensure that all crimes made known to the Procurator Fiscal are investigated &quot;in the public interest&quot;.</p>

  <p>As well as being the sole public prosecution authority in Scotland, the COPFS has the duty to investigate, in the public interest, all sudden, suspicious or unexplained deaths throughout Scotland.</p>

  <p>COPFS adopted the International Association of Prosecutors&rsquo; <em>Standards of Professional Responsibility</em> in 1999. This states that &quot;the use of prosecutorial discretion&hellip; should be exercised independently and be free from political interference&quot; and requires prosecutors to &quot;perform their duties without fear, favour or prejudice.&quot;</p>

  <p>The factors relevant to a Procurator Fiscal&rsquo;s assessment of the public interest are described in the <em>Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service&rsquo;s Prosecution Code</em>, at Section 6 (page 8) &quot;Public Interest Considerations&quot;. A copy of the Code is available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 37201) and on the COPFS website at:</p>

  <p>Funding is used to promote an integrated approach to the delivery of services and support for children and families. Expenditure on individual areas is a matter for each authority taking into account local needs and priorities. Examples of expenditure include: appointment of integration co-ordinators; employment of additional staffing; interagency training and dissemination of good practice; development of joint assessment and action planning frameworks, and support for learning within and out with the school.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not have direct responsibility for cleaning up contaminated land but provides financial assistance to local authorities who have a duty under Part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 to identify contaminated land and secure its remediation. This can be done through voluntary agreement, the serving of notices on the appropriate persons, as defined in the legislation, or the local authority carrying out the work at its own hand. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency has similar powers to bring about the remediation of special sites, defined in the legislation as those likely to cause serious harm or serious pollution of the water environment.</p>

  <p>Glasgow City Council has submitted a bid for a share of the &pound;5 million being made available in 2007-08 for specific remediation projects targeted towards cleaning up contaminated land that is creating a risk to public health or the wider environment.

  <p>We have no plans to do so. Part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 gives local authorities powers to identify contaminated land within their areas and to secure its remediation.

  <p>The Scottish House Condition Survey for the year from October 2003 to September 2004 estimates that around 109,000 households in rural Scotland are living in fuel poverty. This represents about 25% of households residing in rural Scotland, compared to 13% of households in the rest of Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Food Standards Agency has no powers to withdraw food from sale. I am advised that it has reminded food businesses of their responsibility to ensure that the food they sell complies with the law, and of the need to withdraw any products from sale that are found to contain unauthorised GM material.</p>

  <p>I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that the European Commission has been liaising with Greenpeace and the Chinese authorities regarding reports of unauthorised GM material being found in a survey of rice products imported from China. This survey was carried out by Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth and it covered imported products purchased from specialist stores in London, and in Germany and France. I understand that details of the analytical methods used in the survey are not available, and that the Community Reference Laboratory for GM analysis is developing and validating a testing method that would be suitable for use by enforcement authorities.</p>

  <p>Further details on the 2005 Awards Round and on the number of women and ethnic minorities who receive awards can be found in the seventh Annual Report of the Scottish Advisory Committee on Distinction Awards which was published in March 2006. The report is available in the Scottish Advisory Committee on Distinction Awards (SACDA) section of the Scottish Health on the Web (SHOW) website at <a href="http://www.sacda.scot.nhs.uk/" target="_blank">www.sacda.scot.nhs.uk/</a>.</p>

  <p>I have recently set up a review group to carry out a fundamental review of both the distinction awards and discretionary points schemes. The group is in the process of hearing evidence from key stakeholders and expect to report back to me early next year.</p>

  <p>There are currently two statutory schemes covering the reimbursement of travelling expenses incurred by patients travelling to hospital for treatment. A non-means tested Highlands and Islands Scheme for patients resident or working in the former Highlands and Islands Development Board area and a means tested scheme covering the rest of the country. In addition, NHS boards also have discretion to reimburse such expenses to patients who may not be eligible under the statutory schemes. Guidance to NHS boards from the Executive sets out details of those patients who are eligible for reimbursement of travelling expenses under the statutory schemes and also states that boards are expected to exercise their discretion sympathetically and to reimburse reasonable costs, particularly where patients are referred to hospitals outwith their own board area.</p>

  <p>All racist incidents are fully investigated by the police. Where sufficient evidence exists, these matters are reported to either the Procurator Fiscal or the Reporter to the Children&rsquo;s Panel.</p>

  <p>The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) is committed to ensuring that all racially motivated crimes are treated seriously.</p>

  <p><em>The Lord Advocate&rsquo;s Guidelines to Chief Constables</em>, published in 2002, set out guidance for the investigation and reporting of racist crime. They include a direction to the police that in cases of racist crime, accused persons should be held in custody and reported by the police from custody where that is consistent with the <em>Lord Advocate&rsquo;s Guidelines on Bail</em>. Where accused persons are not held in custody they should not simply be released but should be subject to an undertaking to appear at court unless there is a good reason not to proceed in this way. In cases of racist crime where an early arrest is not possible the police should ensure that an early report is submitted to the Procurator Fiscal in order that consideration may be given to an application for a warrant to arrest.</p>

  <p>The decision as to whether to grant bail in individual cases is a matter for the judiciary, and is not an issue in which ministers can intervene. The court should reach an independent and impartial decision on bail in relation to a particular offence, based on the facts and circumstances of the case. In reaching that decision the court is entitled to take into account a range of factors, including the previous criminal record of the accused and any outstanding charges against the accused, particularly those in respect of which bail has already been granted.</p>

  <p>The Criminal Proceedings etc (Reform) (Scotland) Bill, which is currently before Parliament, seeks to strengthen the bail system as a whole and contains a range of measures aimed at ensuring that bail decisions taken in Scotland&rsquo;s courts are more consistent and transparent. The bill will require that judges provide reasons for every bail decision made in future. It also specifies that bail should only be granted in exceptional circumstances to an accused with a previous conviction for serious, violent or sexual offences, or drug dealing, who has previous convictions for those offences.</p>

  <p>The mental well-being of children and young people is a cross-Executive priority with action underway in a range of areas of policy and practice. Getting it Right for Every Child is the Executive&rsquo;s over-arching programme of reform for children&rsquo;s services which will ensure that all agencies working with young people will join up, plan together and meet all the needs of the child. Many schools involved in the Schools of Ambition programme are tackling improvements in pupil confidence and self-esteem as part of their whole-school transformation.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Health Promoting Schools Unit (SHPSU) is working to ensure that every school works toward becoming a health promoting school by 2007. The Schools (Health Promotion and Nutrition) (Scotland) Bill, currently being considered by parliament, is intended to build on this work and go further by placing health promotion - including the promotion of positive mental health - at the heart of all schools&rsquo; activities.</p>

  <p><em>Children and Young People&rsquo;s Mental Health: A Framework for Promotion, Prevention and Care, </em>which was published in 2005, established an integrated approach to positive mental health promotion, prevention of mental illness and early care and treatment of mental health problems amongst children and young people in health, education and social services.</p>

  <p>Improving the mental health of children and young people is one of the six priority areas for action under the Executive&rsquo;s <em>National Programme for Improving Mental Health and Well-being.</em></p>

  <p>These key interventions designed to promote the mental health and wellbeing of children and young people are supported directly and indirectly by a range of other initiatives, funded by the Executive.</p>

  <p>Figures for 2005-06 will be available when VisitScotland publishes its accounts later this year.</p>

  <p>VisitScotland&rsquo;s marketing strategy in the US is to concentrate consumer marketing on states which provide the greatest opportunity to attract visitors to Scotland. Factors include predisposition to travel to Europe and the UK, access to international airline services, and access to direct airline services to Scotland. Based on these factors, VisitScotland&rsquo;s marketing has for some time focussed on the areas around New York, Washington, Philadelphia and Chicago, and since 2004 on Los Angeles, San Francisco, and the Atlanta area including working closely with Continental and Delta airlines. In addition, the Boston area will be included in collaboration with FlyGlobespan from May 2007. However, VisitScotland makes extensive use of online marketing channels, which by their nature ensure that its message does not only reach target markets, but is accessible across the US as a whole.</p>

  <p>VisitScotland&rsquo;s US marketing strategy does not include regular TV advertising, although it does include winning coverage for Scotland on TV programmes targeting particular market segments such as golf and touring. The primary channels are print and online marketing, including direct marketing to VisitScotland&rsquo;s US online databases and those of its airline partners. PR is an important part of the strategy, and VisitScotland retains a PR agency in the US to maximise publicity for Scotland. Event marketing is also a feature, not least the major programme of activities around the Scottish Village during Tartan Week.</p>
