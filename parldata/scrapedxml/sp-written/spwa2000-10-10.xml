  <p>The Water Industry Act 1999 provided for the appointment of a Water Industry Commissioner, who was appointed on 1 November 1999. The Ethical Standards in Public Life etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 provides for the appointment of a Standards Commission for Scotland consisting of not fewer than three members. The Regulation of Investigatory Powers (Scotland) Act 2000 provides power for the Scottish Ministers to appoint a Chief Surveillance Commissioner and such number of other Surveillance Commissioners as they think fit.</p>

These permanent arrangements, which will replace the transitional arrangements under which the temporary Scottish Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration has investigated such complaints since 1 July 1999, could include the appointment of a new Commissioner or Ombudsman.</p>
