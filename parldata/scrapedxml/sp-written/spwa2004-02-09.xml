  <p>I am pleased to announce the issue today of a consultation document on proposals for a new Great Britain strategy on bovine TB. This seeks views on both long term measures aimed at achieving a sustainable control policy in Great Britain and on short term measures which would limit the spread of the disease from high to low incidence areas. Responses to this consultation will help inform the drafting of a strategy which will then itself be subject to consultation.

  <p>A fixed penalty notice issued under the proposals will not be a criminal conviction if the notice is paid.</p>

  <p>Previous fixed penalty notices will not be quotable in future legal proceedings, although they will be recorded and the police and the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service will have access to this information. The Lord Advocate has the power to direct the police about in what circumstances a FPN should be used. Guidance will take into account handling of cases where FPNs have been used previously.</p>

  <p>The policies, legislation and practice of the Scottish Executive plays an important role in implementing the objectives and principles of Part II of the European Charter on Regional and Minority Languages, with regard to Scots and Gaelic.</p>

  <p>In addition the Executive has adopted two partnership commitments which will further strengthen its role in implementing the objectives and principles of Part II of the charter. These are the commitment to a National Languages Strategy in support of Scotland&#8217;s languages and securing the status of Gaelic by means of a Gaelic language bill.</p>

  <p>The implementation of many of the objectives and principles in Part II of the Charter are for other public bodies and institutions. The Scottish Executive would expect that due recognition would be given to these objectives and principles at these levels.</p>

  <p>The Council of Europe&#8217;s Committee of Experts are due to report soon on the UK&#8217;s record on the charter. Following this the Executive will write to local authorities, public bodies and other institutions reminding them of the UK&#8217;s treaty obligations with regard to Scots and Gaelic.</p>

  <p>Support for all of the traditional arts is a key part of the Executive&#8217;s cultural strategy. The Scottish Arts Council (SAC) gives traditional music priority across its various funding strands: education through organisations such as Feisan nan Gaidheal and Feis Rois and also through cultural co-ordinators and the Youth Music Initiative; a national tutor training network; professional development and performing opportunities; composition classes; traditional music officer posts in local authority areas; festivals such as Celtic Connections and Hebridean Celtic Festival; promotion through events such as Showcase Scotland. In addition, SAC Lottery awards to this sector include awards to the National Youth Pipe Band, the Gordon Gaitherin, the Feis movement and Celtic Connections.</p>

  <p>Detailed information on the sums spent on and budgeted for traditional music is given in the document <em>Scottish Arts Council - Scottish Executive Awards to</em> <em>Traditional Music 1999 to 2004</em> a copy of which has been placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 30870). It is estimated that in each of the last two years over &#163;1 million has been allocated to traditional music across the country from both voted and Lottery funds.</p>

  <p>The Executive monitors the creation and cessation of businesses using:</p>

  <p>VAT registrations and de-registrations provided by the Department of Trade and Industry;</p>

  <p>The Interdepartmental Business Register maintained by the Office for National Statistics and</p>

  <p>Companies House registrations and de-registrations.</p>

  <p>These sources are backed up by:</p>

  <p>Data on insolvencies from the Department of Trade and Industry;</p>

  <p>The number of new business accounts opened at branches of the four major Scottish Clearing Banks;</p>

  <p>Data from the Labour Force Survey (ONS) and</p>

  <p>Management Information from the Enterprise Networks on supported new starts.</p>

  <p>The development of policies is additionally informed by detailed analysis of the Interdepartmental Business Register, evaluation studies and a range of research surveys.</p>

  <p>The Executive keeps the data and information sources that it uses to monitor the creation and cessation of businesses under regular review. Currently the arrangements are sufficient for monitoring policy on this aspect of economic growth, and there are no immediate plans for additional monitoring.</p>

  <p>The Framework for Economic Development in Scotland, published in June 2000, (FEDS) sets out the Executive&#8217;s overarching vision for economic development in the medium and long term. I believe that the direction set out in FEDS remains fundamentally sound, but I recognise that the economic and policy contexts have evolved since the original publication. My officials are therefore revisiting FEDS with a view to publishing a revised framework <strong><em></em></strong> in the coming months. Views have been invited from all interested parties.</p>

  <p>In addition, we continually seek to work in partnership with business organisations, Scottish Trades Union Congress (STUC) and public and voluntary sectors and other key stakeholders in contributing to Scotland&#8217;s economic growth. Engagement is through a variety of channels, including: bi-annual ministerial meetings with the STUC General Council and regular liaison at official level; an on-going programme of ministerial events with business and trade organisations, and regular contact with the voluntary sector.</p>

  <p>The research activity presently underway is designed to build upon our knowledge of how Scotland is perceived in a range of countries and domestically; and how we can use creative material to change or build upon those perceptions. It will inform a number of elements of the Executive&#39;s work to help achieve partnership agreement objectives by promoting Scotland overseas in a more coherent and effective way.

  <p>The First Minister is currently President of the Group of Regions with Legislative Powers (REGLEG); he has attended annual conferences of the Group since its inception in 2001. Scottish Executive officials are active in &#8211; and, during the First Minister&#8217;s Presidency, chair &#8211; the Co-ordination Committee which is remitted by Minister-Presidents to take forward the work of the Group between conferences. Through its participation in REGLEG, Scotland has gained an increased profile in Europe and with other influential regions with legislative powers which has led to the signature of four co-operation agreements for sharing information and best practice in areas of mutual interest and other informal links. We have also been well placed to influence the work of REGLEG towards an enhanced role for regions with legislative powers in European decision-making, ensuring that the policies adopted by REGLEG reflect Scottish interests.</p>

The Scottish Executive, Scotland Office and the Department of Culture Media and Sport participated along with other key stakeholders.</p>

  <p>The working group helped shape the Gaelic provisions of the Communications Act 2003. This act established a new gaelic media service (SnMG) to replace the present gaelic broadcasting committee (CCG).</p>

  <p>The new legislation also enabled the gaelic media service to apply to OfCOM for a broadcast licence. This would allow a dedicated Gaelic TV channel to be delivered on a digital platform. This is now a matter for the board of the gaelic media service to consider after consultation with relevant interests and stakeholders.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what representations it has made to the Home Office in respect of how many work permits for residence will be made available for employment in Scotland; whether, under the Fresh Talent initiative, it will be able to target prospective migrants, such as foreign graduates, and, if so, how it will do this; whether it will offer accommodation and jobs to such migrants and, if so, how such offers will be made, and whether applications for such work permits will still require to be approved by Her Majesty&#8217;s Government.</p>

  <p>The responsibility for the issue of work permits lies with the Home Office. Work permit arrangements allow employers based in the UK to employ people who are not nationals of a European economic area country and who are not otherwise entitled to work in the UK. In most cases employers are required to apply for work permits on behalf of a specific person for a specific post.</p>

  <p>Discussions are ongoing between the Home Office and Scottish ministers to establish the best possible way of achieving fresh talent objectives within the UK work permit system. I plan to make a statement to Parliament on this soon.</p>

  <p>The following table presents estimates of the numbers of adults with gross income falling in the various income bands, for each of the years 1996-97 to 2001-02. The estimates are derived from the Family Resources Survey&#8217;s (FRS) Individual Incomes Analysis. Due to the small sample size of the FRS in Scotland, the higher income bands have been grouped together; the sample sizes are too small to give reliable estimates for the separate groups (g)-(k) in the question.</p>

  <p>The income is gross income and includes all elements of income that are accrued to the individual in their own right. This includes income from earnings, self-employment, occupational pensions, investments, social security benefits, and, in 2001-02, tax credits. Elements of income that are generally accrued by a household rather than an individual are excluded, e.g. housing benefit and council tax benefit, and income from letting/sub-letting.</p>

  <p>For the purposes of the table, individuals&#8217; incomes in each year have not been up-rated for inflation, but represent their actual incomes during the year of the survey.</p>

  <p>Prisoners serving sentences of four years or more are released on licence and are subject to statutory supervision on release. The service for this group is currently being enhanced in response to the recommendations contained in the report from the Tripartite Group &quot;Throughcare &#8211; Developing the Service.&quot; This reflects the priority given to public protection.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Prison Service policy on requests by prisoners to change their name differentiates between those prisoners who have officially changed their name(s) i.e. had their new name recorded by the Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages and prisoners who wish to be known by a new name but have not had that new name officially recorded. In each case, the prisoner&#8217;s records are marked appropriately in order to highlight any change of name to the local authority responsible for supervision on release.</p>

  <p>Additionally under the Sex Offenders Act 1997, relevant sex offenders currently are required to notify the police of their name, and, where he also uses one or more other names, each of those names. Under section 84 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 (to be commenced on 1 May 2004) offenders will be required to notify a change to the notified details (such as name or by assuming an alias) within three days of the change taking place, thus shortening the current period under the Sex Offenders Act 1997 which is 14 days.</p>

  <p>The Executive, along with the UK government and the other devolved administrations, has begun a well-publicised process to review the long term management of radioactive waste. The Committee on Radioactive Waste Management (CoRWM) has been set up to assess the options for radioactive waste management. It is to deliver its recommendations to ministers on a preferred option, or combination of options, by the end of 2005. The use of deep geological disposal is only one of the many options to be assessed. Central to the process will be a round of public debate in 2006, with implementation set to begin in 2007.</p>

  <p>It would not be appropriate for the Executive to make any response directly to the European Parliament about its consideration of the Commission&#8217;s proposed directives on spent nuclear fuel and on radioactive waste management, including the option of deep geological disposal, but the Executive recognises the need not to undermine the current CoRWM process which is essential to the future long term management of radioactive waste within the UK.</p>

  <p>I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that it publishes all results from surveys and research that it commissions. Results from previous dioxins surveys are in the public domain, and more results are due to be published shortly. The agency also aims to publish, by the end of 2004, results from a larger survey of dioxins in fish, including wild and farmed salmon. In 2001, the agency published detailed advice from the independent advisory committee, the committee on toxicity of chemicals in food, consumer products and the environment, explaining how tolerable daily intakes of dioxins are calculated. All of this information is publicly available on the agency&#8217;s web-site.</p>

  <p>I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that risks associated with dioxins were assessed by the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment in 2001. The committee&#8217;s opinion provides the basis of the agency&#8217;s advice that the benefits of a balanced diet outweigh the risk of dioxin intake for both adults and children. The biggest diet-related risk to UK health is heart disease and oily fish, including salmon, contain fatty acids that help prevent this. Most people in the UK do not eat enough oily fish, average consumption being only a quarter of a portion per week.</p>

  <p>I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that based on expert scientific opinion, it recommends that consumers should aim to eat at least two portions of fish per week, one of which should be oily such as salmon, either farmed or wild. The known health benefits of eating oily fish at this level outweigh any possible risks. In 2003, the Food Standards Agency asked a group of experts to advise on the balance of risks and benefits of regularly eating more than this over many years. This group will report later this year. Most people in the UK do not eat enough oily fish, average consumption being only a quarter of a portion per week.</p>
