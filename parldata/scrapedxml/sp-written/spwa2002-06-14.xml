  <p>Midlothian is not part of the Better Neighbourhood Services Fund. Although the Executive recognised that all authorities have disadvantaged communities, in order to maximise the impact of the fund, resources were distributed amongst local authorities with above average proportions of income support recipients and, in the case of rural authorities, those with the highest proportion of income support recipients together with a high level of population dispersal.</p>

  <p>To construct or operate a generation station off-shore, a developer would require a licence under Part II of the Food and Environmental Protection Act 1985 and consent under section 34 of the Coastal Protection Act 1949. At present consent under section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 is required if the capacity of the power station exceeds 50 MW. We are considering proposals to reduce this limit to 1 MW, in which case we will lay a draft order before Parliament to effect such a change.

  <p>The tax liability of individuals under the National Bus Company (NBC) distribution will depend on the method of distribution determined by the trustees of the NBC pension schemes in individual circumstances. Some pension scheme members will receive an element of their share of the distribution in tax-free payments as well as increased pension benefits. This is allowable in the NBC case because payments are being made directly from a pension scheme. This is a matter for the trustees of the NBC pension schemes and the Inland Revenue.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to say that today I am officially opening the first major operational Victim Information and Advice (VIA) Office in Glasgow. We are taking this opportunity to re-launch the Victim Liaison Office with a name which more accurately reflects the aims and objectives of the service. I should add that I will also formally welcome Ms Sue Moody as the first Director of VIA. Ms Moody will take forward VIA's focus on providing information to victims promptly and effectively.</p>
