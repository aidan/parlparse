  <p>(a) The Executive does not currently collect information on the debt of individuals. A recent report from the Department for Trade and Industry contains some information on debt for Great Britain, however we do not have this information at Scotland level. The report can be accessed via the following link: <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/ccp/topics1/pdf1/debtdtionmori.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.dti.gov.uk/ccp/topics1/pdf1/debtdtionmori.pdf</a> .</p>

  <p>It is planned that the proposed Office for National Statistics survey on wealth and assets will collect information on household debt. The survey is in its early development stages. If it goes ahead, some data for Scotland should be available from this source.</p>

  <p>(b)The following table presents estimates of the median weekly total individual income for Scotland, based on a three year rolling average, from 1996-97 to 2003-04.</p>

  <p>Total income includes all elements of income that are accrued to the individual in their own right. This includes income from earnings, self-employment, occupational pensions, investments, social security benefits and tax credits. Elements of income that are generally accrued by a household rather than an individual are excluded, e.g. housing benefit and council tax benefit, and income from letting/sub-letting.</p>

  <p>Discussions with the trade unions will form part of the response to any closure at the Arjo Wiggins paper mill at Corpach. These discussions will be part of the Executive&rsquo;s PACE (Partnership Action for Continuing Employment) Framework which is aimed at ensuring that public sector organisations, including Lochaber Enterprise, Jobcentre Plus and Highland Council, provide coordinated support to help those who may be affected into new employment or training.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what obligation there is on the Parliament to implement a framework decision of the Council of Ministers of the European Union and what action may be taken against the Parliament or the Executive in the event of failure to implement a framework decision.</p>

  <p>Framework Decisions fall within the Third Pillar of the European Union. They are binding on member states by virtue of Article 34(2)(b) of the EU Treaty. The UK is therefore under an international obligation to implement Framework Decisions. However, unlike First Pillar measures under the EC Treaty there is no provision for infraction proceedings in respect of Third Pillar measures and so the UK cannot be taken before the European Court of Justice for failing to implement a Framework Decision.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for implementing Framework Decisions in areas of devolved competence rests with Scottish ministers.</p>

  <p>All flood prevention schemes confirmed by the Scottish ministers will benefit from the increased grant rate of 80% of eligible costs, announced by the Executive in September 2004. This, coupled with the increase in the funds available to local authorities for flood prevention schemes &ndash; to a total of &pound;89 million over the next three years - demonstrates the Executive&rsquo;s commitment to reducing flood risk to vulnerable communities.</p>

  <p>Forestry Commission Scotland has set up the Forest Crofts Steering Group, comprising Forestry Commission Scotland, Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department, the Crofters Commission, Highlands and Islands Enterprise, the Scottish Crofting Foundation and self-employed crofter and writer Bill Ritchie from Assynt. The group is examining whether, and how, national forest estate land might be used to create new crofts under the crofting legislation.</p>

  <p>The group last met on 20 June 2005 and a progress report is expected at the end of July. I have asked for a final report and recommendations before the end of the year and ministers will make an announcement when we have concluded our deliberations on the report.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-07-19.8.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80011" speakername="Rhona Brankin" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa0719.htm#5">

  <p>The national forest estate, owned by Scottish ministers and managed by Forestry Commission Scotland, extends to 656,200 hectares (as recorded in <em>Forest Facts &amp; Figures, 2004</em> , published on 30 September 2004). The estate includes 601,016 hectares of forest land (which includes 135,810 hectares of open land within the forest) and 55,202 hectares of non-forest land.</p>

  <p>The size of the parcels that comprise the estate varies enormously, and we do not hold records of locations that may be of interest for community buy-outs. Communities can apply to acquire parts of the national forest estate provided they satisfy the criteria set out in the new National Forest Land Scheme.</p>

  <p>In addition, under a predecessor scheme of the National Forest Land Scheme (the Sponsorship Scheme for the Purchase of Land Managed By Forestry Commission Scotland) we are dealing with community groups at Minard and Tyndrum regarding the possibility of their purchasing small, local areas, surplus to the national forest estate.</p>

  <p>A map, showing the location of the entire national forest estate, is available at: <br /> <a href="http://www.forestry.gov.uk/pdf/fcs_managed_woodlands.pdf/$FILE/fcs_managed_woodlands.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.forestry.gov.uk/pdf/fcs_managed_woodlands.pdf/$FILE/fcs_managed_woodlands.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p>We are not aware of any criteria for classifying land as a forest or woodland croft; therefore Forestry Commission Scotland does not hold records for such a classification. Forestry Commission Scotland has therefore made no estimate of the area or locations of land on the national forest estate that would be suitable for the creation of forest crofts.</p>

  <p>However, the Forest Crofts Steering Group, comprising Forestry Commission Scotland, the Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department, the Crofters Commission, Highlands and Islands Enterprise, the Scottish Crofting Foundation and self-employed crofter and writer Bill Ritchie from Assynt, is examining whether, and how, national forest estate land might be used to create new crofts under the crofting legislation.</p>

<p>No. It is customary for a modified regime to apply at Christmas and New Year. Any such provisions apply to both long-term and short-term prisoners. Prisoners in open prisons who are eligible for home leave are able to apply one additional period of leave during summer and at Christmas.</p>
