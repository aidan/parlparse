  <p>To secure a lasting legacy for Scotland as a whole and effective cross government input, the Scottish Government has established the following six legacy groups: Healthier, Wealthier and Fairer, Safer and Stronger, Smarter, Greener and Sport. Cultural interests are specifically represented on the Smarter group whose emphasis is on learning, culture and volunteering.</p>

  <p>The Smarter group met on 30 June 2008, 18 August 2008 and 18 September 2008. The group is chaired by the Scottish Arts Council and the membership includes:</p>

  <p>Learning and Teaching Scotland, VOCAL, Youth Scotland, Culture and Sport Glasgow, Volunteer Development Scotland, Scottish Qualifications Authority, Museums Galleries Scotland, ADES, North Ayrshire Council, Equality and Human Rights Commission and the Scottish Government.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Glasgow 2014 Organising Committee, in partnership with Culture and Sport Glasgow, is the lead organisation in terms of the planning and delivery of the 2014 Glasgow&rsquo;s Commonwealth Games.</p>

  <p>Culture and Sport Glasgow have established the 2014 Creative Group to develop ideas for the content of the 2010 Delhi Flag handover ceremony and the wider cultural programme to accompany the 2014 games. The membership of the group has not yet been finalised, but will include Scottish Government representation.</p>

  <p>During 2008, Scottish Government officials have met with representatives of the Australian State of Victoria on two occasions: with the Governor of the State of Victoria in April 2008, and with the Agent-General for the State Government of Victoria in October 2008. The meetings concentrated on the technical and legacy aspects of successful Games delivery as adopted during the 2006 Melbourne Commonwealth Games. In addition, a representative of Culture and Sport Glasgow met with relevant officials in the State of Victoria in relation to the cultural legacy aspects of the games.</p>

  <p>NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde advise that there were eight deaths at the Western Infirmary and 18 deaths at Gartnavel General hospital between January and December 2008 which were directly attributed to Clostridium difficile. It should be noted that these are provisional data only.</p>

  <p>Official data on the number of Clostridium difficile related deaths, by NHS board and by hospital, is published by the General Register for Scotland (GROS) on an annual basis. I am advised that data for 2008 is not yet available but will be published by GROS in August 2009.</p>

  <p>The national HAI (healthcare associated infection) reporting template recently introduced now requires NHS boards to collect real time data on infection rates by hospital and specialty.

  <p>The Aquaculture and Fisheries (Scotland) Act came into force in August 2007. The act allows inspection of fin fish farms to assess whether satisfactory measures are in place to control parasites (sea lice) and to contain farmed fish and prevent escapes. Necessary secondary legislation, the Fish Farming Businesses (Record Keeping) (Scotland) Order was laid at Scottish Parliament in October 2008 and came into force on 10 November 2008. Risk-based inspections and audits, conducted by Fisheries Research Services (FRS), commenced in late November to establish whether satisfactory measures are in place to contain fish, prevent escapes and control sea lice. This new regime is in its infancy and needs time to become established. We have no plans to publish fish-farm specific sea lice data.</p>

  <p>Specific information about the numbers of supervisors of midwives about to retire is not held centrally. However, we expect Local Supervising Authority Midwifery Officers to succession plan to ensure the appropriate number of supervisors are in place if, and when, staff choose to retire. We are also committed to maximising the skills and expertise of all staff in NHS Scotland, including those in the ageing workforce. We are currently jointly funding with NHS Education for Scotland and the South East (NHS) Education Forum, research on the ageing workforce to determine what NHS Scotland can do to recruit and retain those in this section of the workforce.</p>

  <p>It is for NHS boards to determine the staff required in their local areas. However, we expect NHS boards to take account of local population needs and changes in service provision to ensure a multi-disciplinary and multi-agency approach to the provision of care for this vulnerable group of women.</p>

  <p>The Nursing and Midwifery Workload and Workforce Planning Programme has been assisting NHS boards to support the implementation of Birthrate Plus and Professional Judgement tools. Following a review of this process a new tool for Maternity Services in Scotland will be developed, taking account of the experience gained from Birthrate Plus and Professional Judgement tools, and taking into account the Midwifery 2020 Programme which NHS Scotland is leading on behalf of the UK.</p>

  <p>Notification of the outcomes of supervisory investigations is provided in the same way in all Local Supervising Authority regions within Scotland. The Local Supervising Authority Midwifery Officer (LSAMO), midwives involved in the investigation and their named Supervisor of Midwives will be informed in writing of the outcome. The Head of Midwifery in the relevant NHS board will also be informed if a midwife requires developmental or supervised practice. Issues relating to system failures highlighted during the investigation will be discussed by the LSAMO and the Head of Midwifery.</p>

  <p>Table 1 shows, by NHS board, the number of whole-time equivalent (WTE) midwives, the number of births in Scottish hospitals, and the ratio of births to midwives. Latest available complete information for births in Scottish hospitals is for year ending 31 March 2007 and, for comparison purposes, midwife numbers at 30 September 2007 have been used. Information on births is based on hospital of treatment (rather than residence) to allow comparison with the workforce figures which capture where staff are based.</p>

  <p>Centrally held workforce information captures the NHS board where staff are employed but does not allow a breakdown by Community Health Partnership.</p>

  <p>We estimate that around 256,000 individuals living in relative poverty before housing costs will benefit from the reduction in prescription charges when they buy prescriptions.

  <p>A household is in poverty according to the UK and Scottish Governments&rsquo; preferred poverty definition if its household income is below 60% of the median UK household income before housing costs. The household income used in this definition is adjusted to take into account of household size. There are, therefore, different &quot;poverty lines&quot; for households of different sizes.</p>

  <p>Income data held by the Student Awards Agency for Scotland does not include income from all members of the household and is not adjusted to account of household size. It is therefore not possible to determine if a student comes from a household which is in poverty according to this definition.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-13234 on 2 June 2008, which gives an estimate of the number of students with benefactor incomes below &pound;16,000 who may benefit from the abolition of the graduate endowment.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body whether it will provide information on its position in respect of compliance with the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (2002/91/EC).</p>

  <p>In accordance with the Directive, an assessment of the energy performance of the Parliament building has been completed. An energy rating of B has been calculated and is displayed on a certificate in the main hall. The certificate states that a building of this type built to current building regulations standards would have a rating of B. The SPCB is pleased that, although the Parliament was designed and built prior to the introduction of the 2007 Building Regulations, the energy performance of the building has been assessed as achieving current good practice. This clearly demonstrates the efforts which were made to design and construct an energy-efficient building.</p>
