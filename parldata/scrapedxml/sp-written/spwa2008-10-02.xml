  <p>Enforcement is the responsibility of the local licensing boards and the relevant police forces under various powers in the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976.</p>

  <p>We are also implementing the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005 to the timetable set out by the last administration, which will update the licensing regime and offers new tools for more effective enforcement.</p>

  <p>One example we have already put in place is the roll-out of test purchasing across all Scottish police forces, and we are pleased to note that many local authorities have already appointed Licensing Standards Officers who will play an instrumental part in ensuring licence holders adhere to the conditions of their licence.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to promoting constructive dialogue between faith and belief communities and uses established fora, such as the Faith Liaison Advisory Group, to do this. We also meet with organisations such as Faith in Communities Scotland to discuss inter-community relations and are pleased that faith and belief communities have participated in national conversation events.</p>

  <p>Additionally in April we established the independent Scottish Working Group on Religion and Belief Relations to consider how to promote constructive dialogue between religious and belief communities. The working group has been given the following remit:</p>

  <p>&quot;To develop a Scottish strategic framework which can be used to encourage constructive dialogue between religious and belief communities and support the Scottish Government in promoting positive activity between these communities.&quot;</p>

  <p>The working group is currently taking forward consultation with stakeholders and interest groups, and I have asked them to make their recommendations to me in early 2009.</p>

Many of the issues set out in the action plan are similar to those in our strategy, which we developed in consultation with a wide range of key interests.

  <p>Helping new entrants to farming is a priority for the Scottish Government and in our consultation <em>Future Implementation of the Common Agriculture Policy in Scotland</em> we sought views on using the national reserve to give new entrants access to single farm payment. That consultation closed on 5 September 2008 and the responses are currently being analysed. We will take decisions on the future implementation of the single farm payment once the current EU negotiations on the CAP health check have been completed.</p>

  <p>The costs of any such scheme would depend on uptake. Under EU rules the costs would be met through reducing single farm payment to other farmers in Scotland.</p>

  <p>We recognise this is a significant problem and the Scottish Government will work with local authority and other agencies to identify solutions.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has not received any formal submissions from Govanhill Housing Association regarding slum landlords. However, I am aware that Govanhill Housing Association submitted a petition to the Petitions Committee on 2 September 2008.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is tackling substandard housing in Govanhill and across Scotland by providing local authorities with the necessary powers to target problem areas.

  <p>Post-import testing of all livestock coming to the UK from bluetongue-affected countries on the European continent has been in place since bluetongue was found in the Netherlands in 2006.</p>

  <p>In Scotland we have, in addition, a post-movement notification system for all susceptible animals that have been in any bluetongue restricted zone within the previous 60 days. The Scottish Government has also made it a requirement that animals entering Scotland from any restricted zone under conditions of vaccination must be accompanied by a certificate that proves vaccination by a veterinarian. These additional provisions provide protection from domestic as well as foreign bluetongue-infected areas.</p>

  <p>Finally, in light of the recent spate of infected imports to England and Wales, I have, in agreement with industry stakeholders, committed Scotland to launching a vaccination campaign against BTV8 this winter. This will not commence before the 1 November 2008. Twelve million doses of vaccine have been secured by the Scottish Government on behalf of industry and the first batch of 1 million is available for contingency purposes only; the rest of the order will be made available once the campaign is launched. The Scottish Government is supporting the first year of the campaign by paying 50% of the cost of the vaccine from the manufacturer.</p>

  <p>Whilst the Scottish Government is undertaking significant work to protect Scotland against bluetongue it remains important that animal keepers recognise their role and, in particular, avoid sourcing stock from high risk areas.</p>

  <p>Immigration is currently a reserved issue and as such the Scottish Government has no estimates of the likely impact of the change to the Fresh Talent: Working in Scotland Scheme. The scheme has enabled over 8,400 international graduates to remain in Scotland and work after study and although the scheme has been widened out to the rest of the UK, international graduates from a Scottish university will still have the opportunity to work in Scotland after they graduate, as will graduates from the rest of the UK.</p>

  <p>Immigration is currently reserved to the UK Government and as such appointment to the Migration Advisory Committee is a matter for them.</p>

  <p>We are advised that members of the Migration Advisory Committee are independent experts who have been appointed by merit through open competition and as such there is no representation on the basis of geography. The current members are; Professor David Metcalf CBE, Chair, Dr Martin Ruhs, Professor Jonathan Wadsworth, Dr Diane Coyle and Professor Robert Wilson. Mike Campbell of the Commission for Employment and Skills is an ex officio member of the committee.</p>

  <p>While immigration is currently a reserved issue, the Scottish Government has worked closely with the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) since its inception and ministers provided views on the proposed methodology and work plan early in the process. Alongside UKBA, officials facilitated a session for employers in Glasgow and undertook visits to Scottish employers. Along with Scottish Enterprise, Scottish Government officials promoted the MAC&rsquo;s work with a view to raising awareness amongst business networks and encouraging employers to engage with the process. This employer engagement has been reflected in the MAC&rsquo;s report.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government remains firmly opposed as a matter of principle to rendition. I have obtained assurances from the UK Government that no rendition will take place through the UK or its airspace without its prior express permission, and that such permission would only be granted if they were satisfied that the rendition would accord with UK law and the UK&rsquo;s international obligations. I have also made clear to the UK Government our view that a rendition could never meet those conditions, and that we therefore do not expect that such permission would ever be granted in practice. This position applies to all airports in Scotland, not just those in the public sector.</p>

  <p>Work by Scottish Government officials to support the establishment of the Scottish Futures Trust is overseen by the Director of Finance, Alyson Stafford, and by the Director General of Finance and Corporate Services, Stella Manzie. A number of individual officials are involved in the day to day development and liaison work, as specific needs arise.</p>

  <p>The performance of all senior civil servants (SCS) is planned, managed and assessed using a common, service-wide framework which has been provided by the Cabinet Office.</p>

  <p>The performance management process for the SCS includes individual reviews in the course of the year to ensure that objectives remain relevant and that they are being delivered. There is a formal performance assessment at the end of the reporting year. The performance management arrangements are not operated on a pass or fail basis. The emphasis is on continued individual development and all SCS are expected to have a personal development plan which should be reviewed every six months. This allows for on-going development of all staff.</p>

  <p>No UK-based Scottish Government officials receive assistance to pay for private school fees. Scottish Government staff posted abroad with accompanying children are eligible to receive financial assistance for educational costs. The amount of assistance is calculated in accordance with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office rules for foreign postings of civil servants.</p>

  <p>When travelling on official business, Scottish Government ministers and civil servants are required to consider if a journey is necessary in every instance. They are also required to travel in the most cost&ndash;effective and time efficient method available at the time of travelling. This includes taking advantage of the Government Air Fare Programme which offers discounted fares to government departments and accounts for 90% of the air travel undertaken by ministers and civil servants.</p>

  <p>During the 2007-08 financial year the Scottish Government supported Sense Over Sectarianism with &pound;88,750 to deliver community-based anti-sectarian projects and provided Nil by Mouth with &pound;51,500 to undertake anti-sectarian education work. We also provided &pound;85,000 to support and run the &quot;Sectarianism: Don&rsquo;t Give It, Don&rsquo;t Take It&quot; online education resource and deliver related theatre based workshops and this was complimented by &pound;100,000 going to schools across Scotland to undertake anti-sectarian projects. We also provided Football for All with &pound;150,000 to develop and run the football-based anti-sectarian campaign &quot;Kick out Bigotry&quot;.</p>

  <p>In addition we have already made a number of commitments up to March 2011. For example, we are committing &pound;412,500 to Sense over Sectarianism to continue their anti-sectarian work in the Glasgow and travel to work area; we will provide Nil by Mouth with &pound;53,000 to continue their anti-sectarian work, and have also committed &pound;22,000 to YouthLink Scotland to develop an anti-sectarian resource for youth workers. Further funding is being considered as part of a broader package of activities to tackle sectarianism in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers are in regular contact with their UK counterparts in the UK Government and work to promote and support the naval shipbuilding industry in Scotland. Most recently this has involved extensive engagement with MoD ministers around the aircraft carriers contract signing and the Military Afloat Reach and Sustainability vessels. I have on-going engagement with leading companies in the sector and further engagement is also in hand. We remain open to working with companies operating at Nigg and Highlands and Islands Enterprise to take forward future ministerial discussions with the UK Government regarding the sub-contracting of part of the construction of new warships to companies operating at Nigg.</p>

  <p>This is an issue for the forthcoming review of the National Waste Plan. In particular, we will consider what more can be done to provide advice to business on minimising waste and improvements to data on commercial and industrial waste to encourage investment in recycling plants. Also whether any further voluntary or legislative steps can be taken to increase recycling of business waste.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, I have issued a consultation on potential waste legislation, for inclusion in the Climate Change Bill, which includes a number of innovative proposals on how to increase recycling rates in Scotland including the provision of more recycling facilities at work and in public places.</p>
