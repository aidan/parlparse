  <p>The Executive has now completed its consultation events with both the industry and the public.</p>

  <p>A consultation was held on 8 May with potential broadband suppliers from across the UK. Two further consultation meetings took place on 18 May and 7 June with invited representatives from the larger clusters affected by the broadband reach issue, which are known to the Executive. Further information on event participants can be found at:</p>

  <p>We are currently examining the consultation feedback. This will inform our policy approach to addressing the broadband reach issue.</p>

  <p>We will announce our way forward in the coming months.</p>

  <p>We are committed to focus government and public services on creating a more successful country, with opportunities for all of Scotland to flourish through improving our rate of sustainable economic growth.</p>

  <p>We will outline the details of how this will be realised in our New Economic Approach, which will be developed this autumn. This will focus on many of the issues raised in the parliamentary debate on the Wealthier and Fairer theme that took place on 30 May.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what discussions it has had with the Department of Trade and Industry in relation to its on-going investigation into the circumstances surrounding the closure of the Simclar factories in Irvine and Kilwinning in January 2007 and, in particular, whether the investigation will consider the closure against the framework of the EU Information and Consultation Directive.</p>

  <p>There have been no further discussions with the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) in relation to the circumstances surrounding the closure of the Simclar facilities in Ayrshire. The situation remains that information about Simclar is being assessed by the companies investigation branch of the DTI with a view to making a decision about whether to investigate. But that decision, and the process of investigation itself if an investigation is proceeded with, will, as usual, remain confidential.</p>

  <p>Planning applications under the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 are determined by planning authorities or, where cases are called in, by Scottish ministers. Under section 25 of that act, such applications must be determined in accordance with the appropriate development plan, unless material considerations indicate otherwise. Scottish Planning Policy 1 indicates the scope of material considerations.</p>

  <p>The Planning etc (Scotland) Act 2006 will, when in force, amend section 25 of the 1997 act to take account of national developments as designated in the National Planning Framework. This will not, however, alter the underlying principle.</p>

  <p>In determining applications for consent under section 36 of the Electricity Act, Scottish ministers will take into account all material considerations. A referendum of a local population would be a material consideration. The weight to be attached to a referendum in making a determination under Planning of Electricity legislation will be for the decision maker.</p>

  <p>The key areas for growth in the tourism sector are greater productivity and increased investment for expansion. As with most business models, a number of different drivers are required to influence that growth. These include: better capacity utilisation; greater cross-selling; market positioning; effective marketing by the public and private sectors, and capital investment.</p>
