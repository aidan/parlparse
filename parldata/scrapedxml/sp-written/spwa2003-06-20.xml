  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-275 by Nicol Stephen on 4 June 2003, why the terms of its consultancy contracts are commercially confidential, in what circumstances it would detail how much it has been spent on employing consultants; how much it has spent from the interim route development fund on supporting new routes, and how much it has spent on consultancies and studies regarding such new routes.</p>

  <p>The terms of the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s contract with Aviasolutions, which ended on 31 March 2003, are available in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 27924). &#163;41,479 has been paid out up to that date. Aviasolutions&rsquo; on-going work, and other consultancy contracts, on the Interim Route Development Fund (IRDF) are a matter for Scottish Enterprise which is administering the fund on behalf of the Scottish ministers.</p>

  <p>No monies have been paid out from the IRDF. Investment offers have been accepted for five routes which have commenced and monies will be paid out shortly. Any spend on consultancy works regarding the start-up of new air services from Scotland is aimed at underpinning investment decisions and ensuring that the routes meet our evaluation criteria.</p>

  <p>The Pathfinder projects are subject to Government Procurement Procedures under which the Executive, together with its public sector partners, has responsibility for the tendering process. Government Procurement Procedures ensure clarity and that the tendering process is open to scrutiny. In accordance with relevant EU Directives, contract notices were placed in the <em>Official Journal of the European Community</em> for both the Highlands and Islands and South of Scotland Pathfinder projects on 22 November 2002 under reference numbers 2002/S 227&ndash;180984 and 2002/S 227&ndash;180986 respectively. Following evaluation of pre-qualification questionnaires, seven companies were invited to submit outline proposals for the Highlands and Islands project and six companies were invited to do likewise for the South of Scotland project. The outline proposals received are currently being evaluated. It is our view that for reasons of commercial confidentiality it would not be appropriate to give out the names of the tenderers at this stage.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to widening access to further and higher education to individuals from all backgrounds. In addition to free tuition, this is underpinned by a wide-ranging package of support targeted specifically towards individuals facing financial barriers in starting or continuing a course of study.</p>

  <p>Young students from low-income backgrounds in full-time higher education will receive part of their living cost support in the form of a non-repayable bursary and those from the lowest income backgrounds will receive a higher level of support overall. All eligible students are also entitled to receive non-repayable supplementary grants in recognition of additional financial needs such as the cost of caring for dependants (with extra help for lone parents), additional study costs arising from a disability and travel expenses. Additional discretionary support is also available through colleges and universities in the form of a grant from the Hardship Fund or a Hardship Loan. New mature students who started courses since 2001-02 can also get additional help through the Mature Students Bursary Fund for formal child care, housing or excess travel costs.</p>

  <p>For those in further education, student support is provided in the form of a discretionary, means-tested bursary. In addition to general living costs, the bursary can include allowances for costs relating to travel, study, caring for dependants and special educational needs. Additional support can be provided through the Childcare Fund and students who find themselves in financial difficulties that would otherwise force them to leave college can receive further help from the Hardship Fund or the Young Student Retention Fund.</p>

  <p>16- to 19-years-olds in further education will also soon benefit from Educational Maintenance Allowances, which will give young people from low income families financial support to remain in full-time education. Education Maintenance Allowances are currently being piloted in four local authorities in Scotland, and are due for national roll out in 2004-05.</p>

  <p>The Executive is keen to ensure that the current support arrangements are helping us achieve our goal of widening access. As part of our forthcoming review of the funding of learners in post-compulsory education, we will work with our stakeholders to re-examine the support available for students facing financial hardship.</p>

  <p>Roads authorities have general duties under the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 to secure the "expeditious, convenient and safe movement" of all traffic. This general duty is met by the road authority making traffic regulation orders which can be introduced for a variety of reasons, including the allocation of road space for specific purposes.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will seek advice from Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) on the impact that closure of auxiliary fire brigades may have on the environment; whether SNH considers that an efficient and effective fire service is important in respect of the control of muirburn and forest fires, and whether SNH will issue a statement on the matter.</p>

  <p>I have asked Ian Jardine, Chief Executive of Scottish Natural Heritage to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) recognises the impact which uncontrolled fire outbreaks can have on the natural heritage. When a fire gets out of control, the speed and effectiveness with which it is tackled is key to minimising the damage done. SNH is, therefore, very supportive of there being an effective and efficient fire service available to carry out this important task. <em>It is not for SNH, however, to determine how this service can be most effectively and efficiently provided. We do not, therefore, intend to issue a statement on the matter.</em></p>
