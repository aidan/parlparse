  <p>When Scotland submitted its bid document for the 2014 Commonwealth Games, it was necessary for the Scottish Government to give a guarantee that the diving competition facility would comply with the regulations set out by the Commonwealth Games Federation. At no point did the previous Executive or the Scottish Government commit to fully fund the upgrading of the Royal Commonwealth Pool. Under the National and Regional Sports Facility Strategy, the City of Edinburgh Council was allocated &pound;4 million towards the redevelopment of the Royal Commonwealth Pool.</p>

  <p>No. The City of Edinburgh Council&rsquo;s Design and Build project team estimate that the cost of the upgrade of the Royal Commonwealth Pool (RCP) is now &pound;37.5 million.</p>

  <p>As stated in S3W-8332, the previous Executive and the Scottish Government made no commitment to fully fund the upgrading of the RCP.</p>

  <p>It should not be assumed that the government will meet the costs of the RCP upgrade given that the proposal to develop the pool was planned prior to the Glasgow bid. It would be unrealistic to expect government to support the full cost of any one project.</p>

  <p>The 24 hour national freephone gateway line to local child protection service providers was launched in February 2007. It was not piloted in Highland, Edinburgh, north-east Scotland and Midlothian as described in recent media reports, but was from the outset a national service. What distinguishes these four areas is that they opted to participate in the three weeks of locally tailored PR activity which accompanied the national launch of the service. A formal analysis of the early adopters was not conducted.</p>

  <p>A rigorous independent evaluation of the service will be carried out later this year (autumn 2008) which will analyse how the service has been operating, whether it is meetings its aims and stakeholders&rsquo; needs, and whether it is delivering value for money. That evaluation will also assess the success of the marketing campaign when launched.</p>

  <p>S3W-8239 answered on 21 January 2008, explains that the service was launched last February on a national basis and the four areas named were not pilots except in terms of the locally-tailored PR campaign which accompanied the launch.</p>

  <p>Lessons already learnt from the 2007 media campaign and from subsequent experience of running the service are to ensure that sufficient time is given to help embed the 0800 number in the public consciousness. That is why a national marketing campaign will take place over eight weeks this coming February and March. Other lessons learnt this year are to ensure that the national line does not work to the detriment of local Child Protection Committees&rsquo; (CPCs) efforts to promote their own local numbers locally. The CPLine Working Group has been engaging closely with CPCs in the planning and delivery of the national marketing campaign to ensure CP service providers are kept well informed of forthcoming marketing activity relating to the CPLine and are being consulted on local PR where relevant.</p>

  <p>In 2006, total UK losses for online banking fraud from scams such as phishing and Trojans reached &pound;33.5 million. There were 14,156 phishing incidents in 2006, up from 1,713 in 2005. &quot;Card Not Present&quot; fraud, including online, phone and mail order fraud, totalled &pound;212.6 million in 2006. Data published by Post Office on 17 Dec 2007 shows that fear of fraud is the single largest barrier for the over 50s considering internet access. These are therefore serious issues that need to be tackled by government, police and business.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is engaging with the UK Government on its Fraud Review, the report of which was published in March 2007. Activity is under way in relation to the establishment of a National Fraud Strategic Authority to provide leadership and coordination for anti-fraud effort, development of better measurement of fraud loss, and improvements to fraud reporting and intelligence to target investigations.</p>

  <p>Guidance for members of the public to help them to stay safe online is available at <a href="http://www.stop-idfraud.co.uk" target="_blank">www.stop-idfraud.co.uk</a>, <a href="http://www.identitytheft.org.uk" target="_blank">www.identitytheft.org.uk</a> and <a href="http://www.banksafeonline.org.uk" target="_blank">www.banksafeonline.org.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>There are established links and processes in place which allow the Scottish police service to engage with forces internationally on a range of issues, including investigations into internet fraud. For example, Europol facilitates co-operation between the competent authorities of the member states in preventing and combating serious international organised crime.</p>

  <p>Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Constabulary for Scotland are conducting a thematic review of serious fraud in Scotland. Their report and recommendations will be published in due course. HM Inspectorate of Constabulary for Scotland&rsquo;s work has shown that the financial and banking sectors are very active in crime and fraud prevention. Some institutions are bringing in two factor authentication for web-based transaction and most are well integrated with law enforcement and counter fraud forums. The banking industry works closely with SOCA, the SCDEA and overseas partners to minimise online banking fraud committed via phishing and Trojan scams.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency houses the e-crime Unit which provides specialist support to the Scottish Police Service on serious organised crime facilitated by computer and other information technology. The unit is also continually researching, evaluating and developing new techniques which allow them to remain effective in the rapidly changing world of hi-tech crime. This includes forging links with the Scottish business community to maximise opportunities for information sharing and to identify solutions in response to concerns over potential vulnerabilities in corporate e-infrastructures.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government sponsors the Scottish Business Crime Centre, a non-profit making organisation created in 1996 and which operates as a partnership approach between the police, business community and government. The centre acts as secretariat to the Scottish Financial Crime Group and a sub-group of that is the e-crime Group. This group involves the police and major Scottish banks and was formed in early 2007 with the purpose of establishing a forum in which to share information and good practice on e-crime.</p>

  <p>The centre also act as secretariat to the Scottish Commercial Crime Group. As part of the remit of this group, it was decided that the retail sector should be included and a number of meetings have taken place. Again, this sub-group is in its infancy but it will undoubtedly be looking at current and emerging threats, including e-crime.</p>

  <p>The centre has produced a booklet entitled <em>Targeting Retail Crime in Scotland &ndash; A Training Booklet for Staff</em>. They are presently working on the second booklet which will include card crime and helpful advice on preventing internet fraud.</p>

  <p>At this early stage four key themes are emerging as the underpinning basis of the strategy, building parenting and family capacity, creating communities that provide a supportive environment for children and families, delivering services that meet the needs of children and families in a holistic way and building a workforce to deliver these services.

  <p>Whilst local government had flexibility to allocate other resources to this area, the specific amounts allocated to local government for inclusion in schools from 2003 to 2007 were as follows:</p>

  <p>2003-04: &pound;20 million</p>

  <p>NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde is already seeking to reduce inequalities in health in all its activities and in its allocation of resources to these. The Scottish Government provides support through funding targeted anticipatory care interventions (Keep well), unmet needs projects which reach those who are not routinely engaged with NHS services, and other specific activities. These include a multiple and complex needs pilot to develop inequalities sensitive practices in maternity, children, addiction and mental health services for those affected by poverty and other disadvantage.</p>

  <p>Health improvement and health inequalities permeate all NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde activities. Specific actions are therefore wide-ranging and include developing inequalities sensitive practice by staff in every setting, work on infant feeding, financial inclusion, equality-proofed resource alloction, and complying with health and homelessness standards.</p>

  <p>The National Screening Committee, which advises the UK health departments on issues related to screening programmes, has recommended the introduction of a population-wide vascular risk management programme. This is very much in keeping with the approach set out <em>SIGN Guideline 97</em> on risk estimation and prevention of cardiovascular disease, which we are taking forward in part through our Keep Well pilots with their focus on cardiovascular disease.</p>

  <p>The Quality and Outcomes Framework of the GMS contract uses estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) for the detection of chronic kidney disease (CKD). This allows earlier detection of the condition than had been possible previously. CKD is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and using eGFR makes it easier to identify those who should be offered treatment to reduce the risk.</p>

The Scottish Funding Council measures &quot;early student retention&quot; describing the percentage of initial students who stayed for 25% of the course duration, and &quot;student retention&quot;, the number of students completing the programme, expressed as a percentage of those passing the early retention threshold. In the &lsquo;student retention&rsquo; indicator each student is weighted by the amount of teaching input he or she receives. Table 2 combines these two percentages to provide an approximate percentage of students who do not complete their course. These students could have transferred to another course or a higher education institution, terminated their studies because they found work or for other reasons.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has made no assessment of the use of colloidal silver as an antibiotic, particularly its use in tackling MRSA.</p>

  <p>Licensing of medicines is reserved and is the responsibility of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Before a medicine can be placed on the UK market it must have marketing authorisation from either the MHRA or the European Medicines Agency (EMEA). The MHRA has advised that they have not assessed the suitability of colloidal silver in the treatment of MRSA or any systemic form of colloidal silver for any indication. Such an assessment would only be made if a manufacturer submits an application for a marketing authorisation for that product.</p>

  <p>For the purposes of calculating the period over which the appeal has been outstanding, the appeal has been considered to commence at the point at which appeal issues have been formalised at the appeal sift stage (i.e. when a judicial decision is made about whether to grant leave to appeal).

  <p>Low copy number (LCN) DNA analysis is not performed by any of the Scottish Forensic Science Laboratories but, if it is believed that such analysis could be appropriate in any case, police forces in Scotland may send DNA samples to other forensic service providers. This would be an operational decision for the police, as would any review of that practice. For its interests, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service is currently looking at recent developments relating to LCN DNA analysis to assess the implications.</p>

  <p>As part of the local government settlement for the years 2008-09 to 2010-11, we have removed the ring fencing on a number of funding streams, including piers and harbours grant, to allow local authorities greater flexibility in determining their own local spending priorities. Recipient councils will be expected to fund their own local harbours projects from the resources that are made available to them under the local government settlement, and any other funding that is available to them from their own or other sources.</p>

  <p>As at present, it will be for local authorities to consider whether they should provide any financial support towards the development of piers and harbours in their areas that are owned by independent harbour trusts or other bodies.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will continue to fund the development of berthing facilities used by lifeline ferry services that are owned by Caledonian Maritime Assets Ltd, independent harbour trusts and other bodies. Caledonian Maritime Assets Ltd will from 1 April 2008 be responsible for the administration of new grant arrangements to ensure that those berthing facilities remain fit for purpose. It will invite grant applications to enhance or develop facilities to support lifeline ferry services from independent harbour authorities and others and will consider those applications alongside the need for investment in the infrastructure that it owns. We shall be taking a number of detailed steps to ensure that the company does not favour unduly its own projects to the detriment of independent harbour authorities and others that may be seeking grant funding under the new arrangements.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is implementing a range of measures which have the potential to reduce the numbers of female accused and offenders being sent to custody. Individual remand and sentencing decisions are a matter for the courts.</p>

  <p>In relation to remand, we have as part of the budget settlement for 2008-09 for Community Justice Authorities, provided an additional &pound;0.5 million to allow extension of bail supervision schemes to all sheriff courts and increased capacity of existing schemes. In September 2007 we implemented in all sheriff and district courts across Scotland the requirement to use Supervised Attendance Orders (rather than a custodial term) for those who have defaulted on payment of fines of &pound;500 or less. And we recently announced a pilot exercise for the use of Drug Treatment and Testing Orders with lower tariff offenders.</p>

  <p>In late November, we published the Report of the Review of Community Sentences, which is strongly focused on delivering tough, credible community sentences as an alternative to short prison sentences. In the review we propose to pilot a mentoring/link worker scheme for adult female offenders given community penalties.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>We are not aware of any difficulties with the framework arrangements for prisoner transfer. Prisoners are normally expected to serve their sentence in the jurisdiction in which they are sentenced. This general position applies throughout the world. The UK comprises three jurisdictions: Scotland, England and Wales and Northern Ireland. Each jurisdiction has separate legislative sentencing and release arrangements. Transfers between England and Wales are transfers within the same jurisdiction and prison service whereas transfers between England and Scotland involve two jurisdictions. Provision is made under the terms of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 for the transfer of prisoners from one UK jurisdiction to another. The prisoner must apply in the first instance to the jurisdiction in which he or she is detained; both jurisdictions must agree to the transfer before it takes place. Transfer is not a legal entitlement. Each case is considered on its merits taking into account the published criteria and any compelling circumstances. The links which a prisoner has to the receiving jurisdiction, including family contact, play an important part in the consideration of any application.</p>

  <p>Whilst local government had flexibility to allocate other resources to this area, the specific amounts allocated to local government for community education, which includes funding for youth work, from 2003 to 2007 were as follows:</p>

  <p>2003-04 &pound;109.107 million</p>

  <p>2005-06 &pound;120.633 million</p>

  <p>2006-07 &pound;121.253 million.</p>

  <p>As with the community education allocations, some spending on children and young people will have been subsumed within other budgets that covered services to people of all ages - e.g. community health &ndash; and as such, it is not possible to identify the total budget for children and young people over this period. It is not therefore possible to present this as a percentage of the budget for children and young people.</p>

  <p><em>Putting People First </em> is a concordat between the UK Government and other stakeholders in England for the delivery of social care services for adults, including increased personalisation.</p>

  <p>Our <em>Better Health, Better Care Action Plan</em>, published on 14 December 2007, confirms our commitment to continue to shift the balance of care in Scotland, to establish a transparent resource framework to deliver new services and models of care, and to increase personalisation.</p>

  <p>Local authorities in Scotland have had a specific duty since June 2003 to offer disabled people, including older people, the opportunity to purchase and manage their own self-directed support in the community. Revised national guidance, to help further increase the uptake of self-directed care, was published in July 2007.</p>

  <p>The UK Government plans to publish a green paper on the long-term funding of social care for older people. Scotland has led the way with the introduction of Free Personal and Nursing Care and we will keep in touch with developments and any implications for older people here.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government currently has no plans to establish a telephone helpline specifically for children and young people with mental health and/or emotional problems.</p>

  <p>Childline already provides a free, confidential 24-hour helpline across the UK for children and young people, who can talk to Childline&rsquo;s trained volunteer counsellors about any problems they may be experiencing, including abuse, bullying, family issues and teenage pregnancy.</p>

  <p>A 24-hour helpline for people in emotional crisis is also well established across the UK through Samaritans. The Scottish Government supports Samaritans&rsquo; work in Scotland through core grant funding, and in addition <em>Choose Life</em> (the implementation team for the Scottish Government&rsquo;s strategy on suicide prevention) has provided funding to enable Samaritans to develop a co-ordinated approach to suicide intervention in branches in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government also funds the free <em>Breathing Space</em> advice and signposting telephone line. It is aimed primarily (though not exclusively) at young men experiencing low mood or depression.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s consolidated resource accounts are laid before Parliament annually and detail expenditure on the government&rsquo;s stated aims for each financial year, including spend on children and young people. Some spending on children and young people will of course be subsumed within budgets that cover services to people of all ages &ndash; e.g. community health. As such, it is not possible to identify the total budget for children and young people over this period. The accounts can be accessed through both the Parliament and Scottish Government&rsquo;s websites.</p>
