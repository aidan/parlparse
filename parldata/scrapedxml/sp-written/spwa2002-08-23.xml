  <p>The Home Office is responsible for the Immigration Detention Centre at Dungavel House, Strathavon under the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. Her Majesty&#8217;s Chief Inspector of Prisons for England and Wales is responsible for inspection. However, the Immigration Service have consulted with the host authority, South Lanarkshire Council and Social Work Services Inspectorate regarding the provision of services. It is anticipated that The Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care will be consulted about arrangements for inspection.</p>

  <p>No. The use of snares to control pest species of wild animal such as foxes and rabbits is legally permitted subject to certain conditions relating to their use. Snares set must be of an approved type and must, by law, be checked at least once a day.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to safeguarding the capercaillie population in Scotland and a wide range of measures have already been applied to tackle the decline in capercaillie numbers.</p>

  <p>These include the implementation of actions set out in the Biodiversity Species Action Plan for Capercaillie. With funding from the Scottish Executive the Forestry Commission spent &#163;700,000 from September 2001 to March 2002 on the removal and marking of deer fences in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The recent award of almost &#163;2.5 million from the EU LIFE-Nature Fund supports a five year project directed at capercaillie conservation. An equal sum will be secured from a number of public and non public bodies including the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is aware of advice from the Capercaillie Biodiversity Action Plan Steering Group, recommending release of captive-bred capercaillie, on condition that the trial site is south of the central belt. I understand that the purpose of this trial would be to assess the feasibility of a release project and to perfect methodologies and techniques. Under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, any trial could only go ahead on the basis of a licence approved by Scottish Natural Heritage.</p>

  <p>Integrated inspections of pre-school services, undertaken by the Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care and Her Majesty&#8217;s Inspectorate of Education, will aim to promote improvement in the quality of both education and care. In doing so, the Care Commission and HMIE will take account of <em>Child at the Centre</em> , <em>Curriculum Framework for Children Aged 3-5 </em> and the <em>National Care Standards for Early Education and Childcare Up to the Age of 16.</em></p>

  <p>All early years services delivering elements of both care and learning will be subject to an integrated inspection regime. Details of how this will be delivered will be finalised shortly.</p>

  <p>The additional &#163;7.2 million to support workforce expansion and development has been allocated directly to local authorities, which will be free to determine how the resources can best be used to meet local workforce development needs. &#163;3.6 million has been allocated for each of the financial years 2002-03 and 2003-04. This is in addition to the &#163;2 million which was allocated to authorities in late March 2002, which can be spent during the financial year 2002-03. The way in which these funds have been allocated to each local authority is shown in the following table.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has been working closely with Learning and Teaching Scotland to develop assessment in pre-school settings, and to provide guidance on how to avoid damaging discontinuities in children&#8217;s experience, when they move on to primary school. On 18 March this year, I launched <em>Progress With Purpose</em>, a multi-media pack of staff development materials, which was developed by Learning and Teaching Scotland. This pack aims to promote continuity in children&#8217;s learning between the ages of three and eight. Its contents are consistent with the Executive&#8217;s wider work on assessment, which is being taken forward by an action group chaired by the deputy minister.</p>

  <p>The <em>Guidance on the Involvement of Teachers in Pre-school Education </em> was drawn up to take account of the skills of all staff involved in meeting children&#8217;s needs.</p>

  <p>It does not seek to reduce teacher involvement but to allow a more flexible approach to the deployment of teachers, taking account of the needs of centres, the integration of early education and childcare, and the abilities and experience of other staff with different training in pre-school. Making best use of the different skills and expertise of the whole staff group will assist services to meet the unique needs of each child.</p>

  <p>A commitment by all staff to use their collective skills and knowledge for the benefit of children and families offers a strong basis for positive joint working. Trained teachers will continue to play a vital part in early education as part of a broader team.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to the continuation of the pre-school education programme. From April 2002, under the Standards in Scotland&#8217;s Schools Act (2000) local authorities have been placed under a duty to provide a free part-time pre-school education place for all three and four year olds whose parents wish one.</p>

  <p>Pre-school education is designed to provide a broad range of planned learning opportunities, in line with the Curriculum Framework for Children three to five, which supports the development of the child. Pre-school education can broaden the range of children&#8217;s learning experiences, to leave them confident, eager and enthusiastic learners, ready for the transition to school.</p>

  <p><em>The Guidance on Involvement of Teachers in Pre-school Education</em> was informed by a range of evidence, including findings from research and inspection, and by the expertise of the working group members. The working group also considered individual case studies which looked at the different role played by teachers in a range of different early years provision and settings. A list of the centres involved in that study is given on page 19 of the guidance.</p>

  <p>The working group considered the results of a search of published literature databases which did not reveal a body of clear evidence about the specific difference a teacher makes. The group was also aware of various studies in America that suggest a strong correlation between high quality services for children and the presence of staff who are themselves highly educated. However, it is not clear from any research whether those benefits are linked to staff&#8217;s general level of education, or to the knowledge and skills gained through their specific qualifications.</p>

  <p>The recent HMIE report, <em> Standards and Quality in Scottish Pre-school Education 1997-2001</em> included comment on the findings and the main trends from registration inspections of private and voluntary centres carried out between 1997 and 2001. Individual annual reports for 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99 had already been published.</p>

  <p>In all of these inspections, evaluations were based on a suite of 25 HMIE performance indicators covering ethos, curriculum, quality of learning experience, accommodation and resources, and management and quality assurance. The overall pattern was one of improvement, with the proportion of good and very good performance identified in individual centres being higher in 2000-01 than in 1997-98 in the majority of the indicators. Of particular significance were improvements in structure and balance of the curriculum, the programmes in expressive and aesthetic development, aims and policy making, and opportunities for children to learn through play.</p>

  <p>I have asked Douglas Osler, Chief Executive of HM Inspectorate of Education (HMIE), to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>In integrated inspections of private and voluntary centres, in addition to the National Care Standards, HMIE will use the <em>Curriculum Framework for Children aged 3-5</em> and <em>The Child at the Centre</em> as benchmarks of the range and quality of experiences which children should be offered. Details of the inspection methodology are currently being finalised. It is envisaged, however, that the inspections will include evaluations of the programmes provided and of children&#8217;s progress in the key aspects of their development and learning. The key aspects cover emotional, personal and social development, communication and language, knowledge and understanding of the world, expressive and aesthetic development and physical development and movement. The aim will be to ensure that children are given as broad and balanced an experience as possible to assist their development and learning.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether qualifications improve the quality of the learning experience and whether providers performing less well in the HM Inspectorate report, <em>Standards and Quality in Scottish Pre-school Education 1997-2001</em> had fewer staff with teaching qualifications.</p>

  <p>While qualifications are clearly important, they are not in themselves sufficient to ensure a high quality of learning experience. On-going training and staff development and clear advice to staff on good practice also make important contributions to improving quality.</p>

  <p>The nature of the HM Inspectorate of Education inspections did not allow firm conclusions to be drawn about the relationship between numbers of staff with teaching qualifications and the quality of provision.</p>

  <p>Over the past 11 months there has been a thorough re-assessment of our preparedness to deal with nuclear incidents. Our preparedness for such incidents is tested during our participation in the programmes of exercises undertaken by the Ministry of Defence and by civil nuclear establishments. In addition the Radiation Emergency Preparedness and Public Information Regulations 2001(REPPIR) came into force last year. These regulations implement the EURATOM Basic Safety Standards Directive (96/29) and replace the Public Information for Radiation Emergencies Regulations (PIRER) 1992.</p>

  <p>Yes. The Scottish Executive has taken steps to ensure that a supply of stable iodine tablets adequate to satisfy potential needs following a nuclear accident or incident is in place. Potential needs arise only when the release contains radioactive iodine. Determination of adequacy has included assessment of the possible scale and spread of radioactive iodine emanating from such an accident or incident.</p>

  <p>Distribution planning is a responsibility of NHS boards working with the operators of nuclear facilities, the police, local authorities and others who would be involved in the response to any nuclear accident or incident. Methods employed would depend on the nature, scale and circumstances of the accident or incident. In some circumstances distribution to people in their homes might be appropriate; in others, distribution might be effected at reception centres or other points at which people within an affected area would be collected.</p>

  <p>Orders have been laid to implement the right to buy provisions contained in the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001. These should bring about the agreed changes to the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 with effect from 30 September 2002. Details of the changes being introduced are contained in SEDD Circular 5/2002, entitled <em>Housing (Scotland) Act 2001: The Modernised Right to Buy</em> , which was issued recently and copies of which have been placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>In addition, following a consultation exercise earlier this year, we are proposing a new cost floor determination to commence at the same time as these right to buy measures are introduced. This determination will make relatively minor changes to the cost floor rules, primarily allowing for all &quot;initial works&quot; conducted by a social rented landlord following acquisition to count towards the cost floor and to ensure that where costs could be covered by a landlord&#8217;s insurance policy, they are not also added to the cost floor.</p>

  <p>Monitoring and reporting performance against local waiting times targets is likely to be most effective when carried out by individual NHS boards and trusts. The National Waiting Times Unit is currently working with NHS boards on developing local waiting times standards which will focus on tackling the longest waits for first out-patient appointments with a specialist and for diagnostic tests. Information about performance against these local standards will be included in the National Waiting Times Database, which the unit is currently developing, and which will be available by the end of 2002.</p>
