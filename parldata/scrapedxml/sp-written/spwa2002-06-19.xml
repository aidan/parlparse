  <p>Scotland has a range of highly reputable quality assurance schemes covering most agri-food and fisheries products but these are all industry led and industry controlled. They are also voluntary schemes. It is up to individual producers to determine the marketing advantages of membership of such schemes.</p>

  <p>The Executive does, however, recognise the importance of quality assurance and this is emphasised in the Forward Strategy for Scottish Agriculture. It has moreover provided significant financial support to the establishment and development of these schemes and to the independent certification processes which are required to underpin them.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not accept that the implementation of legislative provisions for a crofting community right to buy as proposed in Part 3 of the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill will have an adverse impact on the market value of salmon fishings, sporting rights and mineral rights.

  <p>A summary of the interim findings of the National Evaluation of New Community Schools, including breakfast clubs, will be published by the Scottish Executive in the summer. The evaluation will use quantitative data to examine the relationship between New Community School status and pupil performance, and will explore the views of pupils, teachers and parents on the value of initiatives supported by New Community Schools. While it will not be possible to isolate quantitative data on the specific benefits of breakfast clubs from that of other initiatives, there is a clearly established link between health, nutrition and educational achievement and there is evidence to suggest that breakfast clubs are helpful in this respect.</p>

  <p>The overall aim of the Changing Children&#146;s Services Fund is to encourage better integration of all resources available for Children&#146;s Services across the statutory and voluntary sectors. Proposals are therefore expected to demonstrate evidence of genuine partnership working across these sectors.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer, further to his answer to questions S1W-19252 and S1W-20308 on 16 November and 7 December 2001 respectively, on what date the technical information from Flour City Architectural Metals (UK) Limited should have been provided; what the information was which was &quot;considerably overdue&quot;; to whom the concerns by EMBT/RMJM were expressed; whether the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body will place in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre a copy of the whole document or documents in which such concerns were expressed; in the event that any of this information is deemed to be commercially confidential, whether the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB) will state on what basis and why and whose interest would be damaged by its disclosure, and whether the losses emanating from the insolvency of Flour City are deemed to fall within the category of force majeure on the risk register.</p>

  <p>Flour City Architectural Metals (UK) Ltd were due to produce control samples for the oak windows in June 2001. I understand from the Convener of the Holyrood Progress Group that concerns arose during a routine project meeting between the Design Team and project personnel in May 2001 when it became clear that there might be a delay. However, assurances were given that recovery measures were in place. The Parliament&#146;s position on the disclosure of commercially confidential material has not changed and is set out in my answer of 19 September 2000 to question S1W-9469. It remains the case that documents should not be placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre while the SPCB&#146;s rights and entitlements are still being evaluated, as they may form part of the productions in any litigation which may follow. Costs emanating from the insolvency of Flour City Architectural Metals (UK) Ltd fall within the category of force majeure on the risk register.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer, further to the statement in the Holyrood Progress Group Newsletter No.7 that &quot;factory inspections have already taken place in Thailand&quot;, who from Bovis Lend Lease carried out these inspections; when they took place, and whether the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB) will place in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre a copy of the inspection findings.</p>

  <p>Bovis Lend Lease did not carry out inspections of Flour City&#146;s window supplier&#146;s manufacturing facility in Thailand. I understand from the Convener of the Holyrood Progress Group that representatives from RMJM's local offices in Bangkok undertook inspections, initially in February 2001, and later in June 2001. The Parliament has received legal advice that documents should not be placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre while the SPCB&#146;s right and entitlements are still being evaluated as they may form part of the productions in any litigation which may follow.</p>

  <p>Certain concerns about Flour City Architectural Metals (UK) Ltd's finances were reported to the HPG at a meeting on 12 July 2001. The Convener of the Holyrood Progress Group has confirmed that representatives of Bovis Lend Lease, EMBT/RMJM and the Holyrood Project Team were all present at that meeting. These concerns and subsequent developments were reported to the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB) in August 2001.

  <p>Ten thousand posters and 20,000 postcards were printed to promote www.scottishparliamentlive.com which was hosting the live broadcast of the parliamentary sittings in Aberdeen, at a total cost of just over &#163;2,000. This was done through our in house print contract with TSO. The majority of these posters and postcards were distributed directly by Broadcasting Office staff in Aberdeen, with the assistance of Aberdeen University, Aberdeen City Council, Aberdeenshire Council, Aberdeen University, Northsound, Grampian TV, and Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. In order primarily to reach other outlets, and in particular to get the materials to areas beyond Aberdeen city, some 150 organisations - churches, schools and tourist board offices in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire - were directly mailed limited quantities of the posters and postcards at a postage cost of &#163;205.</p>
