  <p>General Professional Training (GPT) schemes comprise one year in general dental practice and, usually, six months in the Community Dental Service (CDS) and six months in the Hospital Dental Service (HDS). The Scottish Council for Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education have been seeking to establish such schemes in the Grampian region and are making progress. However, there have been problems in identifying suitable placements within the HDS to create substantive schemes.</p>

  <p>Vocational Training (VT) provides a year of supervised experience in general dental practice. Recruitment to VT schemes in Grampian is good and interest is growing. Following the VT year, postgraduate advisers assist the trainees to find appropriate placements in the CDS or HDS if they wish it, therefore creating ad hoc GPT arrangements.</p>

  <p>The work of the Quality Assurance Reference Committee of the Scottish Breast Screening Programme (SBSP) has confirmed that there is no significant radiation dose to the heart from a mammogram. In mammography, the position of the breast and direction of the x-ray beam mean that the heart is never directly irradiated and there is no significant radiation dose to the heart.</p>

  <p>Any x-ray examination inevitably results in exposure to radiation. However, risks associated with mammography are very low and controlled by rigorous quality assurance checks.</p>

  <p>Employment policy is reserved to the UK Government which takes the lead on funding and delivery of the New Deal. In Scotland it does this in partnership with the Scottish Executive and contributing organisations.</p>

  <p>The New Deal for Young People was the first plank of the Government's welfare to work programme. The initial period on the programme, called the Gateway, has been re-designed to allow earlier identification of issues which may prevent the young person from taking full advantage of the programme. Locally, the Employment Service have a number of initiatives designed to engage with unemployed young people who are suffering from various forms of disadvantage in looking for work. Assistance is also available to disadvantaged young people through the New Deal for Lone Parents and New Deal for Disabled People.</p>

  <p>The Training for Work (TfW) programme, although targeted at jobless adults aged 25 and over, also offers help to particular groups of young people seeking to develop their job related skills. These groups include young people aged 18 to 24 who are lone parents or who have a disability, including learning difficulties. Last year 402 young people joined TfW and so far this year 225 have participated in the programme.</p>

  <p>In addition, in Scotland, the New Futures Fund helps unemployed young people who are facing serious disadvantage, such as homeless and drug misuse, in looking for work. Through intensive support and guidance individual projects are funded through this programme to help young people overcome their disadvantage and move towards the labour market.</p>

  <p>Following the recommendations of the Beattie Committee Report the Scottish Executive provided an additional &#163;22.6 million over the period April 2001 to March 2004 to career service companies to develop, manage and co-ordinate multi-agency inclusiveness projects to assist disadvantaged young people between the ages of 16 and 24 in seeking further education, training and employment.</p>

  <p>Information is not held centrally about outcomes for care leavers, but one of our social justice milestones is to halve the proportion of 16 to 19-year-olds who are not in education, training and employment. There are several initiatives under way to address this, often aimed specifically at young people from disadvantaged groups. These include widening access to further and higher education, New Deal 18-24 and New Future Fund projects.</p>

  <p>We have not previously collected statistical information on the educational attainment of young people in care. However, this will change from next year and data will be available in 2002-03.

  <p>There were around 3,800 children who left local authority care in the year to 31 March 2000.</p>

  <p>Under the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 authorities must, unless they are satisfied the young person&#8217;s welfare does not require it, advise, guide and assist young people living in their area who were looked after by a local authority when the young person ceased to be of school age or at any subsequent time up to the age of 19. This responsibility may continue up to the age of 21 if the young person so requests and the local authority agrees. The type of local authority support available can include assistance in cash or in kind and help with accommodation. Information is not held centrally on the numbers of young people who receive this assistance.</p>
