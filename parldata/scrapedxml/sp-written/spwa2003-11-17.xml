  <p>The efficiency of boilers used in the central heating programme is set out in the technical specifications covering the installation of central heating systems. The specifications were approved by a working group, which included all the major power companies and other experts in the field and complies with Part J of the technical standards for compliance with the building standards Scotland regulations. While more efficient boilers are available, the decision to select the boilers used in the programme was made after careful consideration of boiler efficiency, environmental impact and cost.</p>

  <p>Extensive research on call centres in Scotland and outsourced competition from India has recently been undertaken by Phil Taylor of the University of Stirling and Peter Bain of the University of Strathclyde. The Scottish Executive supported this study and the findings are expected to be published later this month. The Scottish Executive will be considering these findings most carefully together with other partners to see what conclusions can be drawn.</p>

  <p>Local authorities are in general free to set their own expenditure priorities. In many cases these will be set in order to pursue statutory obligations, national standards or policies and priorities agreed with the Executive. Where Executive objectives and targets are concerned, monitoring focuses on outcomes rather than expenditure. In some cases, local authorities are funded by specific grants to secure specific activities and expenditure of these grants is monitored by the Executive.</p>

  <p>Pay and conditions are a matter for employers and this dispute must be resolved between the local authorities, as employers, and the trade unions.

  <p>Following the report of the Royal Commission on Long Term Care, extra resources were provided to local authorities, which rose to &#163;48 million in 2003-04. &#163;11 million of this is to increase the provision of short break respite care across the range of Community Care services. Local authorities have prepared draft Local Outcome Agreements on the use of the extra resources. The Executive is currently working with authorities on their draft agreements and hope to conclude these by the end of this year. From the draft agreements received it is clear that many authorities are significantly increasing respite provision. Both the volume and range of respite services are expanding. The arrangements are intended to apply to the full range of needs for respite care. It will be for local authorities to determine their priorities for a respite service, in the same way as for social care services generally.</p>

  <p>Improved information on respite is an issue which both local authorities and the Executive are seeking to address. A sub-group of the Social Work Services Statistical Liaison Group has been set up to recommend an agreed terminology that embraces respite, and other services to support carers, and to look at standardised ways of collecting information on service provision in these areas for use by the Executive, local authorities and the voluntary sector. The group, involving representatives from the Executive, local authorities and carers&#8217; organisations, has met twice and we expect it to make recommendations early next year.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to developing and expanding respite provision across Scotland. To do that we have provided authorities with additional funding of &#163;22 million over the last three years over and above the resources already available to them. That extra funding is now at the level of &#163;11 million per annum.</p>

  <p>Authorities have the flexibility to decide how to use the total resources available to meet local needs and priorities, including respite care. It was always our intention to work in partnership with individual authorities to deliver set outcomes for the extra resources for respite, and targets have been proposed by local authorities in draft Local Outcome Agreements (LOAs). Similar agreements are being piloted across other areas of local government activity as a means of linking national priorities with local service delivery. This shift towards monitoring outcomes means that existing ring-fenced grants now account for a smaller share of the total funding available to local authorities. We need to see how LOAs work in practice but ring-fencing remains an available option.</p>

  <p>Advice on the use of resources provided under the Carers Strategy was given to local authorities in a letter from the Scottish Executive dated 8 December 1999. The letter stressed that the new resources provided under the strategy were to be used to create additional services for carers, including the provision of short break services. Most carers are assessed as part of a wider assessment of the cared for person, the costs of which are met from the general resources available to local authorities.</p>

  <p>We have yet to come to full conclusions on the powers and responsibilities to be exercised by Transport Scotland and its relationships with other transport bodies in Scotland. Those decisions, once made, will permit consideration of its staffing and costs. The results of the current consultation will be important in determining these issues.</p>

  <p>Although this is an operational matter for VisitScotland, the number of telephone enquiries received by visitscotland.com since its inception total over 437,000. The number of calls received during the summer months of this year varied between 40,000 and 56,000 per month. A note setting out the number of telephone calls received by visitscotland.com in each month since its establishment has been placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 29760).</p>

  <p>The total cost of setting up visitscotland.com as a public private partnership in 2002-03 was &#163;7.5 million. Of that sum, the public sector contribution through VisitScotland and the area tourist boards in partnership was &#163;1.875 million, most of which was in the form of a loan repayable by the company. The monthly running costs of visitScotland.com are an operational matter for the company, and are met by it from revenue.</p>

  <p>We are announcing today a package of support totalling almost &#163;3 million over the next two years for voluntary organisations working with vulnerable and excluded children and young people. This includes:</p>

  <p>continuation until March 2006 of support for the Lloyds TSB Partnership Drugs Initiative at the current rate of &#163;750,000 per year, and the continuing secondment of a Scottish Executive staff member to manage the project. This initiative is aimed at promoting voluntary sector work with children and young people affected by drug misuse, whether directly or because of their parents&#8217; addiction.</p>

  <p>&#163;1.2 million over two years (2004-06) to commission Columba 1400 to take up to 300 care leavers a year onto their personal development programme. This will provide an opportunity for care leavers to tap into their own potential for leadership and self determination. It will build their confidence and capacity, helping them in the transition to independent living.</p>

  <p>One-off funding of &#163;250,000 to a new foundation that will fund combined groups of voluntary organisations to provide continuity of care and support to vulnerable young people. A Scottish Executive member of staff will also be seconded to assist the foundation.</p>

  <p>: It was made clear when the Inquiry was announced that it is a non statutory Inquiry and, as such, has no statutory power to compel the attendance of witnesses nor the production of evidence. In his opening statement to the inquiry, Mr John Campbell, QC, Counsel to the Inquiry, emphasised the co-operation received with the production of material, both by civil servants and by the private sector. Mr. Campbell further commented &quot;Thus far, as I have said already, and in this short time so far taken up, the level of co-operation has been impressively high&quot;.</p>
