  <p>Encouraged by the Scottish Government, the employer bodies are working with Sector Skills Council, Lantra, to construct for the industry a level 2 Modern Apprenticeship (MA) framework which could be in place by September 2010. This is being developed as a vehicle to help address the difficulties experienced in finding skilled agricultural employees. To this end the Scottish Agricultural Wages Board introduced an apprenticeship rate of pay into its Wages Order on 1 October 2009. This provision enabled employers to pay &pound;3.50 per hour to workers for the first twelve months of a Level 2 Modern Apprenticeship in Agriculture.</p>

  <p>In terms of addressing wider skills shortages Lantra has also supported a range of measures and activities to promote land based, agriculture and aquaculture career options.</p>

  <p>The Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs for Transplantation (SaBTO) advises the UK Health Departments on issues relating to the safety of blood, cells, tissues and organs for transfusion/transplantation. In July 2009, as part of its undertaking to continually consider exclusion and deferral criteria for blood donation, SaBTO commissioned a review of current policies. This will look at scientific advances as well as up-to-date evidence and data to ensure that donor selection criteria, including deferral criteria, are in place for justifiable reasons. UK Health Departments welcome this review. However, the ultimate aim, must be to maintain the highest levels of blood safety for patients at all times.</p>

  <p>SaBTO is due to complete this review later in 2010, at which time the, Scottish Government, along with the other UK Health Departments, will consider its report and the need for any changes to current practice.</p>

  <p>More information on the review and SaBTO&rsquo;s work can be found on its website at:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has made progress on all the policy areas included in the statement given by the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing on 25 March 2009. These comprise CEL guidance for NHS boards on the introduction and availability of newly licensed medicines in the NHS in Scotland published on 17 May 2010; an information leaflet for the public and patients on new medicines in Scotland published on 17 May 2010; modifiers developed and published by the Scottish Medicines Consortium to be used when appraising medicines in particular categories; the establishment of a National Patient Access Schemes Assessment Group (PASAG) to assess patient access schemes for Scotland, and revised guidance on arrangements for NHS patients receiving healthcare through private healthcare arrangements published on 25 March 2009.</p>

  <p>In relation to access to treatment for rarer cancers, the SMC has a standard process for assessing all newly licensed medicines. The process for assessing orphan medicines, as defined by the European Medicines Agency as a medicine licensed to treat or prevent life-threatening rare diseases affecting fewer than five in 10,000 people in the European Union, is the same as for all other medicines. However, in addition to the usual assessment of clinical and cost-effectiveness, SMC may consider additional factors such as whether the medicine substantially increases life expectancy and/or quality of life; can reverse, rather than stabilise the condition, or bridges a gap to definitive therapy. The SMC can also apply the modifiers to consider additional factors.</p>

  <p>The Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 introduces ambitious, world-leading legislation to reduce emissions by at least 42 per cent by 2020 and at least 80 per cent by 2050. To achieve these targets the Scottish Government has a wide ranging delivery plan to facilitate the economic and social transformation required and this includes many measures to support individual and community action.</p>

  <p>The &pound;27.4 million Climate Challenge Fund (2008-11) continues to support communities across Scotland to take action to reduce carbon emissions. The Scottish Government has in the last financial year provided over &pound;6.5 million grant assistance to support around 300 community projects through the Community And Renewable Energy Scheme (CARES) and a similar level of funding is available in the current financial year. The five Energy Saving Scotland advice centres, which are funded by the Scottish Government and managed by the Energy Saving Trust, provide support to over 100 community groups, including groups funded through the CCF<em>, </em>each year helping them both to plan and implement local carbon saving activities at a grass roots level.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is developing a climate change behaviour research programme to better understand the factors influencing public responses to climate change. The current GoGreener campaign seeks to encourage and support more environmentally responsible behaviour in the general public across Scotland and Scottish Government is also developing a wider climate change public engagement strategy.</p>

  <p>The exact number of consultations in Scotland for the removal of contraceptives within a specified time period is not available centrally. However, national estimates can be given of the number of consultations by either a GP or practice-employed nurse for the removal of contraceptives based on information obtained from a sample of Scottish general practices participating in PTI (Practice Team Information). The patients registered to PTI practices are representative of Scotland as a whole in terms of their age, gender and deprivation profile. The last year for which PTI data are currently available is the year ending 31 March 2009. It is not possible to determine from this data the period of time after which the contraceptive was removed.</p>

  <p>The estimated number of consultations for the removal of a contraceptive by a GP or practice-employed nurse in Scotland in the year ending 31 March 2009, by contraceptive type, based on PTI data, is shown in table 1. Estimates are standardised by age and deprivation. However, these data exclude other settings where devices are removed, such as family planning clinics.</p>

  <p>The Longer Lasting Contraception (LLC) social marketing campaign is primarily evaluated through the Health Improvement Tracking Study (HITS). HITS monitors, on a continuous basis, awareness of health improvement campaigns and their impact on attitudes and behaviour, amongst a robust sample of the target audience.</p>

  <p>The social marketing campaign for LLC reached 67% of our target audience, who recalled the campaign when asked. Awareness of all forms of LLC also rose. Pre and post campaign research was also carried out with the target audience of women aged 18-44, which showed a significant increase in women correctly describing what LLC means and more than 42% motivated to find out more about longer lasting contraception.</p>

  <p>Part (a/b) (i). The rates of maternal deaths and maternal health problems in the Gypsy/Traveller population in Scotland are not held centrally, either by the General Register Office Scotland, or by Information Services Division Scotland.</p>

  <p>Part (a) (ii). The General Register Office Scotland (GROS) publishes data on vital events in Scotland, but does not publish figures which are described as maternal deaths, as such on a regular basis. However, a section on maternal deaths was published in 2005, in table 2.1 of Scotland&rsquo;s Population 2005:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/statistics/publications-and-data/annual-report-publications/rgs-annual-review-2005/annual-report-2005-tables.html" target="_blank">http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/statistics/publications-and-data/annual-report-publications/rgs-annual-review-2005/annual-report-2005-tables.html</a>.</p>

  <p>For the purpose of the 2005 report, maternal deaths were defined as deaths for which the underlying cause was coded to International Classification of Disease 10 (ICD10) Chapter XV codes O00-O99; Pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium. Each year, GROS publish the numbers of O00-O99 deaths in the Vital Events Reference Table 6.1:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/statistics/publications-and-data/vital-events/vital-events-reference-tables-2008/section-6-deaths-causes.html" target="_blank">http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/statistics/publications-and-data/vital-events/vital-events-reference-tables-2008/section-6-deaths-causes.html</a>.</p>

  <p>This table shows that there were five deaths in 2008 and single-figure numbers in each of the previous 10 years.</p>

  <p>Part (b) (ii). Information on severe maternal health problems are published annually by NHS Quality Improvement Scotland in The Scottish Confidential Audit of Severe Maternal Morbidity Reports.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not available in the precise form requested. In 2006, the then Scottish Executive set limits on the maximum amount of financial assistance payable in relation to the stock transfer set-up costs of councils and the potential receiving landlords.

  <p>There has been no changes in policy and boards were not told that projections would no longer be required.</p>

  <p>Boards were advised that the annual projections exercise, which looks at NHS boards future demand for staff for years one, two, three, five and 10 years and helps to inform the annual intake of student nurses and midwives, was under review to see what changes might be made to improve the output of these projections. In addition, while this wider review is being undertaken, boards were asked to provide projections for any expected staff group changes for 2010-11 and to send their draft Workforce Plans to Scottish Government prior to publication. Copies of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s letter of 9 April 2010 asking for that have been placed in the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s Information Centre (Bib. number 50922).</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers have been kept informed of this work.</p>

  <p>Discussions are regularly held with NHS boards, and in partnership with NHS boards and staff side organisations, on a wide range of staffing matters. This includes staff governance and terms and conditions issues, such as voluntary severance.</p>

  <p>Boards have been advised that, when planning for service redesign or other organisational changes, they should only consider a voluntary severance scheme as a last resort and that these schemes require to be financed from within existing budgets.</p>

  <p>No specific funding is made available for voluntary severance payments in NHSScotland. NHS boards receive an allocation to meet the healthcare needs of their resident population. It is for boards to decide how best to utilise this funding to meet national and local priorities.</p>

  <p>In response to an independent stock taking review of Respect and Responsibility in 2007, sexual health outcomes and actions for 2008-11 were developed. These covered four themes - knowledge and awareness; leadership, co-ordination and performance management; standards and service provision, and young people.</p>

  <p>We will be working with stakeholders over the coming months to determine the future direction of sexual health strategy beyond March 2011. This process has already begun with a meeting in Edinburgh on 27 May 2010 with stakeholders from a number of disciplines from across Scotland.</p>

  <p>(a) The NaSH system has been live since March 2008 and has been rolled out in NHS boards since then. There are 10 health boards with NaSH, covering 93.76% of the population. Discussions are underway with Highland to agree dates for implementation. Western Isles and Shetland will have limited use of the system in a clinical setting, using it only for a small number of central clinics. Orkney has decided not to implement NaSH as all their services are provided by GPs, who will use a GP system to cover sexual health.</p>

  <p>(b) NaSH has been designed to be used by all specialist sexual health services in Scotland, both GUM and sexual and reproductive health clinics.</p>

  <p>(c) NaSH maintains a patient index accessible only to NaSH users and there is no mandatory national minimum data set allocated, apart from that mandated for the existing Sexually Transmitted Infections Surveillance System (STISS) coding, which remains anonymous. The system allows information to be captured in the following areas &ndash; sexual history, blood borne virus risk factors, sexually transmitted infection screening, emergency contraception details, gynaecology, examination, sexual partner notification, men&rsquo;s health, child protection issues and competency, attendance details and chaperone.</p>

  <p>Requests for car park spaces are only declined if all available spaces have been booked. Spaces which appear to be vacant have been pre-booked and should be occupied in due course. The exceptions to this occur when a car park user fails to inform the FM helpdesk that they cannot use a pre-booked space or if they leave during the day and do not intend to return. Every effort is made to identify such spaces and re-allocate them using a waiting list compiled by the FM helpdesk operators. Periodic reminders are issued through the corporate bulletin to urge users to alert the Helpdesk of any cancellations.</p>
