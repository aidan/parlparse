  <p>I am pleased to announce today that, following our review, the Scottish Government will now seek the agreement of the European Commission for continuation of the Air Discount Scheme (ADS) from 1 April 2008 for another three years at the existing discount rate.</p>

  <p>The ADS gives residents of Orkney, Shetland, the Western Isles, Islay, Jura, Caithness and North West Sutherland a 40% discount on the price of core air fares.</p>

  <p>An analysis conducted on our behalf by Halcrow shows that there have been significant increases in patronage on some ADS-related services, and significant increases in the frequency and capacity of these services since the launch of the scheme in May 2006. The analysis has also identified large reductions in average journey times for ADS members, as well as broad satisfaction with the scheme&rsquo;s administration. From the analysis it is clear that the scheme has performed very effectively and ministers have concluded that it should continue.</p>

  <p>Halcrow&rsquo;s analysis accords with our own statistical and other evidence built up since May 2006. ADS membership levels are in general very high and well over 200,000 discounted tickets have been purchased since the scheme began. Over the next three years, we believe that the scheme will make further progress and that increasing numbers of residents in the Highlands and Islands will benefit. We will continue to monitor the ADS&rsquo;s performance during that time to ensure that the scheme continues to fulfil its key aims.</p>

  <p>Single outcome agreements will stipulate the progress which each council will be expected to achieve against the relevant indicators. Councils will be accountable for how they perform against each of these indicators.</p>

  <p>The expected level of progress will be agreed between each council and the Scottish Government. This means that specific measures of progress can be set to reflect local priorities and local circumstances, as well as our need to ensure that the Scotland-wide outcomes set out in the <em>Scottish Budget: Spending Review 2007</em> are achieved.</p>

  <p>&quot;Significant progress&quot; in that section of the concordat does not relate to maintaining teacher numbers. It relates to the policy of Scottish Government and local government to improve the learning experience for children and young people by improving the fabric of schools and nurseries; developing and delivering a Curriculum for Excellence, and as quickly as possible, reducing class sizes in P1 to P3 to a maximum of 18 and improving early years provision with access to a teacher for every pre-school child.</p>

  <p>We expect local government to make year on year progress in reducing primary 1 to primary 3 classes to a maximum of 18 pupils. There will be different rates of progress according to local circumstances. We will enter into an agreement with every authority which agrees to the concordat that will set out the progress we agree that authorities can make. Class size data is collected at individual school level annually through the school census. Scotland currently already has variations in class sizes in primary 1 to primary 3 between local authorities across Scotland.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to announce the launch today of the National Planning Framework &ndash; Discussion Draft. The draft framework sets out what we believe is an ambitious agenda for shaping Scotland&rsquo;s long-term development. It has a critical contribution to make to our overall purpose of creating a more successful country. Discussion events will be held over the next 14 weeks in each of the following cities: in Aberdeen, Dumfries, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Inverness. We will seek to use these events to build consensus around a strategy for Scotland&rsquo;s spatial development. Copies of the draft framework will be available from the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 44303). The draft framework, the Strategic Environmental Assessment report and further information can also be viewed online at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/topics/planning/national-planning" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/topics/planning/national-planning</a> .</p>

  <p>Policy teams within the Scottish Government routinely meet with such organisations so that their interests can be represented in the development of national policy and priorities. I would expect these discussions will have a significant impact on the formulation of single outcome agreements between the Scottish Government and local authorities.</p>

  <p>I would also expect each local authority to continue its duty to engage with such organisations and community bodies as it thinks fit when setting priorities and planning services as part of the new arrangements.</p>
