  <p>The registration scheme contained in the bill will ensure that private landlords are fit and proper people to be letting houses and will establish a list of the houses that they let. Licensing of houses in multiple occupation controls detailed physical and management standards for a specific category of privately let houses. Voluntary accreditation is intended to recognise physical and management standards in any type of privately let house.</p>

  <p>We wish to avoid unnecessary duplication in the assessment of landlords as fit and proper under the different schemes, or in the recording of details of houses, and will be working to achieve in consultation with key stakeholders on the detailed implementation of the registration scheme.</p>

  <p>The registration scheme allows for a rent sanction to be applied if a landlord who ought to be registered is not registered or has not applied to be registered. The sanction is that rent is not payable. In those circumstances the tenant is not liable to pay rent and housing benefit is accordingly not payable.</p>

  <p>The refusal or removal of a landlord&#8217;s registration does not affect the tenant&#8217;s rights under the lease, the common law or housing law. The Rent (Scotland) Act 1984 makes unlawful eviction and harassment a criminal offence, and behaviour such as harassment and intimidation can lead to criminal prosecution under the common law.</p>

  <p>Although the registration scheme will provide a means of dealing with landlords who fail to adopt acceptable management approaches to antisocial behaviour it also serves a broader function. It assists local authorities to engage effectively with the private rented sector in pursuit of the strategic improvement of the sector in line with local housing strategies and Scottish Executive policies. As with other local authority functions, I expect each local authority to arrange its staffing and financial resources to support these purposes in an appropriate way according to local needs.</p>

  <p>The bill gives ministers powers to provide funding to local authorities in connection with the administration of the registration scheme. I intend to use those powers as necessary to ensure that the resources are in place to support the initial costs of establishing the scheme. I will decide the amount of support to be provided in the light of further detailed work with stakeholders on the implementation of the scheme within the framework provided by the bill. We intend that the running costs of the scheme will be met from registration fees.</p>

  <p>The registration scheme is intended to protect tenants of all types in the private rented sector by ensuring that their landlords are fit and proper people to let housing.

  <p>The key low-income results, above, are for 60% of both the relative and absolute median thresholds. Estimates on the full range of income thresholds and explanation of how these estimates are calculated are published in <em>Households Below Average Income, 1994-95 to 2002-03</em>, copies of which are available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 32212).</p>

  <p>The relative low-income measure compares against the median in the same year. The absolute measure compares against the median in the baseline year of 1996-97, uprated to remove the effects of inflation.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-5835 by Peter Peacock on 10 February 2004, whether the statement in <em>Making it work together - A programme for government</em> , published in September 1999, that &quot;we will ensure that there are at least four modern computers for each class by 2003&quot; was a target set by it and whether that level of computer provision has been achieved.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive set targets for the National Grid for Learning to achieve on average pupil to modern computer ratios of 5:1 in secondary schools and 7.5:1 in primary schools. These were expressed more succinctly in the 1999 Programme for Government as an average of &quot;four modern computers for each class&quot;. The latest information, from the 2002 School Census (available online at http://www.scotland.gov.uk/stats/bulletins/00272-00.asp) shows pupil:modern computer ratios of 3:1 in special schools, 5:1 in secondary schools and 9:1 in primary schools. Decisions about the actual deployment of the computers are taken locally in the light of teaching practice and accommodation requirements.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>*Calendar year</p>

  <p>Due to the nature of European Structural Funding it is not possible to break the expenditure down into financial years. The European Commission uses calendar years for Structural Funds and as such the expenditure is recorded that way. Even if the figures could be split into financial years this would not reflect the total picture as more projects will be funded starting in 2005.</p>

  <p>In February 2004, the Scottish Further Education Funding Council commissioned the second mapping exercise of supply of and demand for further education in Scotland. A national report and eleven area reports are due to be completed in spring 2005.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what changes were introduced in the guidance on hospital car parking charges issued on 2 April 2004 compared with the guidelines issued on 17 March 2000.</p>

  <p>The guidance on car park charging issued to NHSScotland in March 2000 detailed the principles of car park charges, namely:</p>

  <p>The decision of whether to charge for car parking facilities is one for local determination in the light of local circumstances;</p>

  <p>Charging for car parking in hospitals should not be motivated by a desire to generate income, and</p>

  <p>Charging may only be justified if it:</p>

  <p>is to cover the cost of providing improved parking facilities;</p>

  <p>is to make the car park more secure, or</p>

  <p>is to better manage existing car parking facilities by discouraging &quot;fly parkers&quot;.</p>

  <p>The guidance issued on 1 April this year, and detailed in my answer to S2W-7206 on 28 April 2004, develops these principles and is much fuller. This guidance, which will cover all future car parking schemes, applies both where car parking facilities are being provided and/or managed by NHS boards and by private sector providers.</p>

  <p>The revised guidance reiterates that car park charging should not be introduced as a means of generating income and details more fully the circumstances where charging may be justified, namely if it is to:</p>

  <p>cover any significant costs in providing new or improved parking facilities or making existing facilities more secure (e.g. capital charges, maintenance costs, administration costs, security costs, security lighting, CCTV), and</p>

  <p>better manage car parking facilities by discouraging unauthorised users (e.g. fly-parkers) but in so doing, measures taken to discourage unauthorised users must not be detrimental to the car parking arrangements for staff, patients and visitors.</p>

  <p>The revised guidance also outlines more fully the principles NHS boards should adhere to where charges are made, as follows:</p>

  <p>NHS boards must be able to demonstrate the level of income generated from car parking and how it has been utilised;</p>

  <p>before introducing or substantially revising car park charges, NHS boards must consult with staff, the public and any relevant bodies or organisations;</p>

  <p>sufficient car parking space and concessionary car parking rates should be available to staff and consideration should be given to providing concessions to certain categories of patient (e.g. patients attending regularly for dialysis or radiotherapy), and</p>

  <p>a reasonable proportion of parking spaces should be set aside for disabled parking. In determining disabled parking spaces, the needs of disabled persons should be fully considered (e.g. wide spaces, no kerbs or steps, preferably under cover, and located at different entrances to the NHS facility).</p>

  <p>The revised guidance further advises that where fly parking is a particular problem, in discouraging unauthorised users, NHS boards should investigate ways to control such parking, other than introducing excessive daily charges for all car-park users. Such options may be:</p>

  <p>to check at manual barriers the validity of parkers between, say 7 am and 10 am (e.g. staff id, appointment card, details of the patient they are visiting); or</p>

  <p>to limit the availability of car parking space by keeping certain car parks closed until 10 am and, say, designating car parks "staff only" and "out-patients/day-patients only", and</p>

  <p>where there is no option but to discourage or control the level of unauthorised parking by charging excessive daily rates, arrangements must be put in place to ensure that patients and visitors who are legitimately parked in the car park all day are given a concessionary rate.</p>

  <p>The guidance is clear that in all cases charges should reflect a reasonable balance between the perceived needs of staff, patients and visitors, the cost of car parking generally in the area, and the costs of maintaining car parking facilities, and concludes by stating that widespread charging of excessive rates to staff, patients or visitors cannot be justified.</p>

  <p>The procedures in place for family liaison officers are an operational matter for chief constables. Last year, Her Majesty&#8217;s Inspectorate of Constabulary carried out a thematic inspection of family liaison arrangements. Their report, <em>Relatively Speaking &#8211; A Thematic Inspection of Family Liaison in Scotland,</em> was published in May 2003 and is available at:</p>

  <p>http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library5/justice/fltr-00.asp</p>

  <p>The report contained 17 recommendations.</p>

  <p>Following this report, the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland is currently developing guidance for use by all police forces, including nationally agreed criteria for the deployment of family liaison officers. I understand that the guidance is due to issue later this year.</p>

Guidance specifically on the value for money of public private partnership projects is contained in Treasury Taskforce publications which apply in Scotland. Policy Statement No. 2, <em>Public Sector Comparators and Value for Money</em> , sets out the role of comparators in public procurement highlighting the importance of value for money.

  <p>The Executive has been involved in dialogue with Treasury over the new Green Book, and over an improved approach to the appraisal of public private partnerships. Treasury issued Draft Value for Money Appraisal Guidance in February which sets out new proposals for a value for money assessment, including the reform of the Public Sector Comparator. Documentation on this can be found on Treasury&#8217;s website at http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk. The guidance is intended to provide a framework for evaluating the appropriateness of and value for money of PPP. A dialogue with both public and private sectors is continuing over these changes.</p>

The Football Academy Programme, under the Lottery Sports Fund ended on 31 March 2003.</p>

  <p>At the end of December 2003, 334 secondary schools across Scotland had a school sports co-ordinator in post. This represents coverage of some 86% of secondary schools.</p>

  <p>As part of the Executive&#8217;s Physical Activity Strategy, the school sports co-ordinator programme has been merged with the previous active primary schools programme, extended and developed to become the active schools programme. We have invested &#163;24 million over the three years to 2005-06 to roll out the active schools programme across Scotland.</p>
