  <p>The value of the Scottish European Social Fund (ESF) programmes is set in euros. The total euro allocation for the 2007 to 2013 H&amp;I ESF programme was &euro;52,150,195. The total euro allocation for the 2007 to 2013 LUPS ESF programme was &euro;269,920,942. All requests for repayments by countries go to the Commission in euros and are paid in euros.</p>

  <p>As the exchange rate between the euro and sterling fluctuates, the value of these programmes and the amounts repaid by the Commission also fluctuates and are calculated in sterling monthly using a rate provided by the European Commission.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government bears the exchange rate risk from the date when funds are allocated to a project up to the point at which the project has run and their claim for re-imbursement has been paid by the managing authority. At that point the exchange rate is locked at the European Commission rate applicable to the month of payment. It is therefore very important for organisations awarded ESF grants, such as the Community Planning Partnerships, to spend and claim to agreed timescales.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-19852 on 28 January 2009. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="../../../Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx</a> . The answer to question S3W-19852 outlined the circumstance in which ministers are prohibited from ordering a person&rsquo;s extradition.</p>

  <p>The quoted range of outturn prices for the project represents the estimate of the cost for the delivery of the project by the most efficient procurement means. The choice of procurement options other than a publicly funded design and build contract would increase the cost above this level and reduce the certainty of delivery.</p>

  <p>The value for money of a range of funding and procurement options was tested by Transport Scotland and their consultants using the prevailing view of the cost of finance in autumn 2008. Both a design and build contract with conventional funding and a PPP/NPD privately financed contract were considered to provide good value for money.</p>

  <p>Changes to government accounting practice to be introduced by the UK Government in April 2009 had made the latter unaffordable whilst the adverse effect of the financial market since last autumn provides evidence to question the likely value for money that might be achieved from using private funding within the timescale of promoting this competition.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-18821 by Stewart Stevenson on 14 January 2009, whether the reduction in the cost estimate for the Forth Replacement Crossing is wholly attributable to the reduced width of the bridge, the use of ITS and more refined estimating in light of further detailed surveys, investigations and design development.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-02-06.S3W-19910.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80393" speakername="Stewart Stevenson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa0206.htm#5">

  <p>The new proposals come within an outturn price range of &pound;1.7 billion to &pound;2.3 billion, an average saving of around &pound;1.7 billion on the previous estimate of &pound;3.2 billion to &pound;4.2 billion.</p>

  <p>This has come principally from:</p>

  <p>1. the reduced cost for the new bridge, which with the use of the existing bridge for public transport, has allowed the full functionality originally announced for the crossing in a narrower structure [25% price reduction], and</p>

  <p>2. a reduction in the extent of road construction through the use of Intelligent Transport Systems [50% price reduction].</p>

  <p>The overall reduction to the base costing from these elements is 35% within a total reduction of 44%. The remaining savings come from refinements in risk and optimism bias which has been possible as a result of the additional survey, investigations and design which have been undertaken.</p>

  <p>Yes.

  <p>The Scottish Government is pursuing a number of measures to curb the supply of knives to young people.</p>

  <p>The Custodial Sentences and Weapons (Scotland) Act 2007 has given ministers the power to introduce a licensing scheme for knife dealers. As part of the licensing scheme, dealers will be required to keep records of how proof of age was established. Our consultation on draft regulations to establish the scheme concluded at the end of October. We shall announce our response shortly then bring forward an order for parliamentary consideration.</p>

  <p>In addition, test purchasing of age restricted products is a useful tool available to the police to crack down on those who sell knives to young people. The decision to undertake test purchases whether as a co-ordinated initiative or in response to specific intelligence is an operational matter for police forces.</p>

  <p>The UK Health Protection Agency maintains an overview of emerging research on the health effects of mobile phones. They advise that no new evidence has emerged to alter their current advice. In keeping with that advice, the UK Chief Medical Officers strongly advise that where children and young people do use mobile phones, they should be encouraged to use them for essential purposes only and to keep all calls short. The Scottish Government considers that this approach maintains an appropriate balance between individual responsibility and regulatory control.</p>
