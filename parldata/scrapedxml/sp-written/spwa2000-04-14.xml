  <p>The Scottish Executive is working to ensure that all Government Departments, Agencies and organisations as well as the private sector are encouraged to contribute to the enhancement of Scotland's biodiversity. While particular action is targeted at a number of priority species and habitats, general conservation measures are also widely encouraged.</p>

  <p>Progress towards the UK Biodiversity Action Plan targets is being achieved by the Forestry Commission through its status as Lead Partner for the BAP woodland habitats and its involvement with a number of species action plans. Highland and Islands Enterprise is funding preliminary work for the Highland Council Local Biodiversity Action Plan and undertakes work towards biodiversity targets across the breadth of its estates and holdings. Land held by the Rural Affairs Department is sympathetically managed, to contribute where appropriate, to specific biodiversity action plans. The department has also recently launched a new Estates Charter, which incorporates recognition of the natural heritage, sustainable development and biodiversity in its estate practices.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive wants to improve survival rates for all cancers. We have adopted the target of reducing cancer-related premature deaths by 20% between 1995 and 2010.</p>

  <p>The biology of prostate cancer is not yet fully understood. One of the main things, however, which will improve survival rates for prostate cancer is to increase the early reporting of cancers and we encourage men to seek early help and expect GPs to ensure rapid referral for specialist treatment when symptoms appear.</p>

  <p>In order to help increase our understanding of cancers and their treatment, the Scottish Executive has supported a range of cancer-related research projects with funding from the Chief Scientist Office, totalling nearly &pound;2.2 million. Many of the findings of these projects are relevant to prostate cancer.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Cancer Group is also following the progress of a number of studies being undertaken internationally to evaluate new forms of treatment for prostate cancer and is considering how best these might be introduced into Scotland, should the research confirm that they are effective. In addition the Chief Medical Officer&#8217;s Clinical Resources and Audit Group has funded an audit of all urological cancers, which includes cancer of the prostate. The audit, starting in 2000, will provide a nationwide picture of the process and treatment of this group of tumours and leave Scotland well placed to demonstrate the effectiveness of new therapies. The possibility of a screening programme is also being kept under review by the UK National Screening Committee.</p>

  <p>Greater Glasgow Health Board is working in partnership with all the other agencies in Glasgow to tackle the life circumstances underlying health inequalities and so improve the health of their population. It also targets considerable resources on the promotion of healthy lifestyle choices in relation to diet and nutrition, smoking and physical exercise which have been shown to reduce the risk of cancer.</p>

  <p>The health board has developed programmes with the aim of detecting certain cancers at an early stage. These include improving the attendance by women for breast and cervical screening. General practices are given extra funding to enhance their ability to identify and contact women who have not attended for screening and the board has invested in extra mammography equipment which can be taken to areas where uptake of the service is seen to be low. The health board has also participated in a national multi-centre trial of colorectal cancer screening.</p>

  <p>The health board has invested substantially in audits of cancer care and is able to demonstrate quite clearly how effective its clinicians are in treating cancer.</p>

  <p>A managed clinical network is in place which has been shown to improve substantially the pattern of care for patients with breast cancer. A similar network for gynaecological cancer is being implemented and networks of care for colon and lung cancer are planned. Currently work is underway to identify bottlenecks in cancer services.</p>

  <p>The health board and its Trusts are also embarked on a major programme of refurbishment for the Beatson Oncology Centre. This includes the provision of new radiotherapy equipment.</p>

  <p>Since launching our <i>Strategy for Carers in Scotland</i> , we have been working closely with carers&#8217; organisations and local authority representatives on implementing key measures set out in the strategy. Authorities now have their share of the &pound;10 million ear-marked under the strategy for carers&#8217; services, including respite care. Many are already consulting carers and others on the use of these resources. Monitoring arrangements will ensure that these resources are used appropriately.</p>

  <p>The Carers&#8217; Legislation Working Group was set up in January with a remit to draw up new legislative proposals to better address carers&#8217; needs. The group has met twice to date and we propose to use their recommendations as the basis for public consultation later this year.</p>

  <p>Information packs for young carers are being made available to all primary, secondary and independent schools. These will be available shortly.</p>

  <p>From 1 April, the free NHS Helpline has been able to provide information and advice to carers on a range of issues, including access to local support groups, short-break services and financial assistance. We will shortly be undertaking a national media campaign to alert carers to the strategy and the helpline.</p>

  <p>I have asked my officials to work with clinicians to phase out the use of general anaesthesia in NHS general dental practice as soon as practicable. Such services will be transferred to acute hospital centres but I also hope that there will be a continuing reduction in the use of general anaesthesia for treating dentally-anxious patients. Other methods such as local anaesthetic with or without conscious sedation are more appropriate and safer.</p>

The Scottish Executive established the Domestic Abuse Service Development Fund to support local initiatives for tackling domestic abuse.

  <p>The Education for Work and Enterprise agenda, promoted by the Scottish Executive, supports a wide range of enterprise education activities aimed at developing links between schools and the world of work which are similar to those identified in the Presidency Conclusions. The strategic aims of the agenda are being taken forward by the National Centre: Education for Work and Enterprise at the University of Strathclyde. The centre will shortly publish a National Strategy with the aim of raising the profile of education for work at local and national level.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive Education Department and IBM are currently co-operating over the development of SCOTBEE, Scottish Business Education Exchange, a new project to use ICT to support links between teachers and the world of work. The Scottish Executive is also currently funding two ICT learning centres, one in Bellshill, North Lanarkshire and one in Alloa, Clackmannanshire. Both are examples of education working in partnership with the local community and industries.</p>

  <p>Policy and Financial Management Review (PFMR) is at the heart of the Executive&#8217;s commitment to achieve better quality and more responsive public services.

  <p>Assistance is available for eligible patients and families of patients who incur travelling expenses for cochlear implantation services at Crosshouse Hospital in Kilmarnock and the City Hospital in Edinburgh. A non-means tested scheme is available to patients from the Highlands and Islands Health Board areas. A means tested scheme applies to the rest of Scotland. In addition, health boards have discretion to consider travel costs of patients referred to national facilities such as the Cochlear Implant Centres and who are not eligible for assistance under the statutory travel schemes above. The National Services Division (NSD) of the Common Services Agency may also consider assisting patients with travel costs where they need to make frequent referrals onwards from national services, such as the Implant Centre, to other highly specialist services.</p>

  <p>The White Paper, <i>Towards a Healthier Scotland</i> , identified sexual health as a priority health topic and set out proposals for improving sexual health, acknowledging that health services have found it hard to tackle the issue in the past. The proposals included the introduction of a national demonstration project, &quot;Healthy Respect&quot;, to develop best practice in the promotion of sexual health and the provision of funding to enable the voluntary sector&#8217;s expertise to be made available in more schools. Both initiatives are being implemented and will build on existing work.</p>

  <p>I have announced my intention to bring together a group from the public, private and voluntary sectors. In order to provide a co-ordinated and informed overview of this work, and to develop a comprehensive sexual health strategy. A review of genito-medicine services will form part of that work.</p>

  <p>The NHS has a central role in the provision of sexual health services. Health boards use their knowledge of the health needs of their local populations to develop their sexual health services. Inequalities in access to services is one of the aspects considered by health boards and Trusts.</p>

  <p>NHS bodies are provided with guidance to assist them in planning the provision of services, including sexual health services. For example, the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) have completed work on the guideline <i>Management of Genital Chlamydia trachomatis Infection</i>, which will be distributed to health boards, NHS Trusts and other specialist groups in Scotland within the next few weeks.</p>

  <p>Other statutory bodies also have a role in the promotion of sexual health through, for example, the provision of information and advice. We want to ensure that the development of the health promoting schools concept takes account of the importance of sexual health.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally. The precise cost of treating smoking-related disease is difficult to ascertain, since cost data collected centrally from the National Health Service in Scotland cannot be attributed to individual disease. However, our best estimate is that the annual cost to the NHS in Scotland of treating illness and disease caused by smoking is approximately &pound;140 million in terms of GP visits, prescriptions, treatment and operations (Buck et al, <i> Cost effectiveness of smoking cessation intervention</i> , <i> </i> 1997).</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is firmly committed to the principles set out in the White Paper. The provision of high quality statistics free from political interference is vital if there is to be informed decision-making and debate in the Executive, the Parliament and beyond. It is essential that official statistics are collected, analysed and made available in a way that has the trust and confidence of the Scottish people.</p>

  <p>The Executive is working with the United Kingdom Government on this. In October, we published a Concordat on Statistics along with the <i>Memorandum of Understanding</i>. These set out the basis on which we will work with the UK Government. More detailed arrangements are being put in place to ensure that the needs of the devolved administration are met. Since the publication of the White Paper, we have been developing a Framework for National Statistics which takes account of these needs. We will be jointly publishing this in the near future. It will set out the roles and responsibilities of Ministers and officials both at a UK level and in devolved administrations. As Minister for Finance, I will be responsible for co-ordination of National Statistics across the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>Under National Statistics, we will introduce new planning arrangements in which we will be actively seeking the views of users of statistics, including MSPs, on their needs and priorities. A Scottish Statistics Plan setting out a programme for the coming year is published today as a consultative document.</p>

  <p>We expect the formal launch of National Statistics to take place in early June. The Statistics Commission will play an important role in ensuring the integrity and development of National Statistics. We will wish to have early discussions with the Commission on how it might operate in Scotland to ensure that Scottish interests are properly represented.</p>

  <p>In addition, the framework notes that the Parliament may if it wishes set up arrangements for enhanced scrutiny of National Statistics as a further assurance of their integrity and quality. I will be proposing dialogue on this matter in the near future.</p>

  <p>I am placing a copy of the Scottish Executive Statistics Plan in the Parliament's Information Centre. Additional copies are available in the Document Supply Centre. The Framework for National Statistics will be added in due course.</p>

  <p>The Action Programme for Youth is our pledge in the <i>Programme for Government</i> to launch an initiative which values young people and reflects their aspirations and needs. We are working with a range of voluntary and statutory agencies to engage with a wide range of young people on a wide range of issues and afford them opportunities to feed their views directly to us. As part of this process, we are holding a Youth Summit in the Civic Centre, Motherwell on 19 June which we hope will involve well over 1,000 young people.</p>

  <p>The Executive has invested &pound;70,000 in the initiative to date from its community education budget. We will assess the need for any further funding after the Summit.</p>

  <p>I will keep the Parliament informed as the initiative develops.<br /></p>
