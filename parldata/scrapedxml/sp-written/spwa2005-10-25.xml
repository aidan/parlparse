  <p>I have asked Dr Paul Stollard, Chief Executive of the Scottish Building Standards Agency (SBSA), to answer. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The SBSA is currently in the process of developing its directive implementation strategy, which includes working with other policy areas of the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>As the directive is not yet implemented there is at present no quantifiable and measurable outputs available. However, it is anticipated that this directive, when implemented, will have a positive impact on climate change and may augment other areas of energy policy in Scotland in respect of dwellings.</p>

  <p>Scotland shall apply a methodology of calculating the energy performance of buildings on the basis of the general framework set out in the Annex to the directive. The mandatory standard for a methodology will be expressed in functional terms, to ensure that there is no possible conflict with the Construction Products Directive. This approach will make it possible for consideration to be given to the use of any Directive compliant methodology, both for setting the energy performance standards and the production of energy performance certificates.</p>

  <p>We have no plans to draw up a national strategy in Scotland. Work is already being done in several areas to encourage women into traditional male-dominated occupations and vice-versa. Work to date has been focused on construction, child care, the police, teacher education and gender stereotyping in schools. We believe that continuing to implement the Equality Strategy with the aim of mainstreaming equality throughout the policy making process, across the different relevant portfolio areas would be more effective. This provides a means by which action can be put in place by strategic collaborative partnership working, without the need to develop individual strategies to tackle specific areas of policy. It remains our opinion that collaborative partnership working will be far more productive in achieving demonstrable results in gender segregation. The Executive is committed to working with Equal Opportunities Commission Scotland, Scottish Enterprise and Careers Scotland to tackle occupational segregation in the workplace.</p>

  <p>Investors in People (IiP) recognises the importance and benefits of a flexible working approach and this already forms part of the scheme. Following a review of the IiP Standard in 2004, work-life balance and flexible working have been included in, and are now covered by, the new IiP Profile Tool. The tool allows an organisation to establish how well it measures up to the IiP Standard. It also gives an organisation the opportunity to benchmark itself with its peers. In this way, the tool will show how good that organisation is in comparison to others and where further improvements could be made.</p>

  <p>As a result of feedback from employers, IiP also introduced the Work-Life Balance Model in 2003. This model, which can be used by organisations both within and outside the IiP scheme, encourages organisations to use work-life balance solutions to improve the way they do business and make their organisation a more attractive place to work. Flexible working might be one of the solutions adopted by an organisation using the model.</p>

  <p>There is only one case involved. On 26 November 2001, the Executive made an award of freight facilities grant totalling &pound;289,469 but rail freight traffic to the business concerned ceased well before it was able to fulfil its commitments in the grant offer agreement.

  <p>Without the gauge enhancement scheme, there is a risk that the existing freight traffic could be lost to road whilst the decision to progress allows for increased movement of freight by rail. This is a significant development for the north east of Scotland as it will deliver environmental and economical benefits, and it reaffirms the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s commitment to a more efficient distribution of freight.</p>

  <p>Whilst it is not possible to gain commitments from the freight operating companies or their customers until the project is complete, detailed forecasting and marketing consultation has revealed a strong desire for the additional capacity and North East Scotland Rail Freight Development Group will be responsible for marketing and promoting the new facility with the aim of gaining optimum use.</p>

  <p>Our forecasting cannot confirm the number of extra trains that will run, but it does indicate that the enhanced gauge will result in a reduction of lorry use by around 12.3 million vehicle kilometres per year.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive and agencies such as <strong></strong> sportscotland, Scottish Enterprise, VisitScotland and the Scottish Arts Council will develop their working relations with the UK Government and other key organisations responsible for delivering the Games and Team GB&rsquo;s participation in them. These include the newly established London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (LOCOG) and the Olympic Delivery Authority to be established by the London Olympics Bill currently before the Westminster Parliament.</p>

  <p>The Nations and Regions Group established during the bid phase is being reconstituted by LOCOG to provide a mechanism for planning and co-ordinating input from all the UK nations and regions to the delivery of the Games and their associated benefits. Mr Charles Allen &ndash; a Scot &ndash; will continue to chair this Group on which the chair of <strong></strong>sportscotland, Ms Julia Bracewell, will serve as the Executive&rsquo;s nominee. We are also reforming the Scottish Co-ordinating Committee, established during the bid phase, under Ms Bracewell&rsquo;s chairmanship to oversee and co-ordinate the development and implementation of strategies aimed at ensuring that the potential benefits to Scotland of the 2012 Games are realised and maximised.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Co-ordinating Committee will be supported by a new team within the Executive to co-ordinate work on the 2012 Games and the Executive&rsquo;s input to the bid to stage the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.</p>

  <p>The number of Scottish student loan borrowers who have been declared bankrupt to 2003 is given in the answer to question S2W-6052 on 2 March 2004. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="../../../webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a> .</p>

  <p>The number declaring bankruptcy in 2004 is 289.</p>

  <p>There is no statutory requirement for bankrupt students to notify the Student Loans Company of their status, so the figures given will not include all bankruptcies.</p>

  <p>This is a correction to the earlier answer to this parliamentary question given by Jim Wallace MSP on 28 February 2005. I have written to Ms Hyslop to say that the Student Loans Company have apologised for their mistake and that they have asked for their apologies to be passed onto Parliament. My letter has been lodged in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 37248).</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the value was of bookings taken by visitscotland.com for tourist providers in Perth and Kinross and what percentage of total Scottish bookings taken this represented in (a) the first 18 months of visitscotland.com&rsquo;s operation and (b) the most recent six months for which figures are available.</p>

  <p>The value of bookings made through visitscotland.com for tourist providers in the Perth and Kinross area for the first eighteen months of its operation was &pound;233,000. This business represented 3% of all bookings made through visitscotland.com during this period. The value of bookings made during the period April and September 2005 was &pound;674,673, which represented 6% of all Scottish bookings made through visitscotland.com. The latter figure is broadly in line with the proportion of Scottish tourism value accounted in the area.</p>
