  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-13209 by Ross Finnie on 22 February 2001, why it considers that there is no need for specific research into the impact of farmers&#8217; markets and whether the work done by its Rural Affairs Department, Scottish Enterprise and the Scottish Agricultural Organisation Society in supporting the formation of the Scottish Association of Farmers&#8217; Markets is having a positive impact and providing value for money.</p>

  <p>My answer to question S1W-13209 on 22 February said that we do not consider that there is a need for specific research into the impact of farmers&#8217; markets at the present time. It did not rule out such research in the future.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Association of Farmers&#8217; Markets, whose formation we supported, has only been in existence for a few months. They will need time to develop a number of initiatives, and it would be more appropriate to examine the impact of these on the markets at a later stage.</p>

  <p>Similarly, it is too early to say whether the assistance provided in supporting the formation of the association is having a positive impact.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Dental Epidemiological Survey was not completed this year due to difficulties in the interpretation by some local authorities of the Data Protection Act. This has led to a potential decrease in the accuracy and quality of the data obtained from this survey.</p>

  <p>These surveys are an essential part of the planning of dental services in Scotland and it was considered inappropriate to publish data of doubtful accuracy and quality. It is anticipated that these issues will be resolved and that future surveys will continue.</p>

  <p>The commitment scheme has been developed between the UK Health Departments and the British Dental Association, in a response to a recommendation by the independent Doctors and Dentists Review Body (DDRB). In making its recommendation on commitment payments, the DDRB considered that the scheme should: reward past and present commitment to the NHS; require a high threshold of NHS gross fee earnings; commence the first payments to general dental practitioners after about 10 years service in the NHS, and provide a further boost to NHS earnings at a later stage in GDPs&#8217; careers once again based on length of service criteria.</p>

  <p>The NHS gross fee earnings threshold of &#163;25,000 was set following discussions between the Health Departments and the British Dental Association.</p>

  <p>I am aware that there have been some concerns about whether the commitment scheme is achieving its underlying purpose in areas where there is limited population, and have asked officials to review this during the coming financial year.</p>

  <p>Currently, only claimant count unemployment figures are published below large unitary authority areas. Numbers of claimants unemployed in 1991 wards or postcode sectors are already published monthly via the NOMIS database. This is available via the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre, and the staff are happy to help get required figures.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has plans to publish a claimant rate for local areas over the next year. In addition, the Scottish Executive will fund a neighbourhood statistics project. Over the years 2001-02 to 2003-04, the Executive will spend &#163;7 million to develop statistics covering many aspects of society and the economy at a very local level. Planned here are many labour market statistics, including the internationally standard ILO measure of unemployment.</p>

  <p>I have announced today that the Scottish Executive has decided to establish a Judicial Appointments Board.</p>

  <p>The board will be chaired by a senior non-legal figure, and will have other lay members, who will be appointed following Nolan public appointment procedures. It will also contain representatives of the judiciary and legal professions, so that lay and legal members will be equally balanced.</p>

  <p>The board will be set up on an administrative basis, but when parliamentary time allows it will be put on a firm statutory footing. Its role will be to advise the First Minister on names of new appointees to the office of Judge of the Court of Session, Sheriff Principal and Sheriff (both permanent and part-time Sheriffs). It will determine its own procedures, but these will be subject to guidance from the Scottish ministers.</p>

  <p>All appointments will be advertised and appointments will be made solely on merit. The board&#8217;s procedures will include a requirement that the legally qualified members are satisfied as to the legal capacity of those recommended.</p>

  <p>The board will make its recommendation to the First Minister, who will consult the Lord President of the Court of Session (as he is obliged to do by the Scotland Act 1998). The First Minister will expect to accept the advice of the board unless there is good reason to the contrary. The Lord Advocate will no longer routinely advise on appointments, but will advise the First Minister in any case of uncertainty about the board&#8217;s recommendations.</p>

  <p>It is not for the Executive to interpret the statute. But, as The Independent Review Group on the Retention of Organs at Post Mortem, chaired by Professor Sheila McLean, noted in its recently published report, it appears there is nothing in the Cremation (Scotland) Regulations 1935 to support the view that body parts may not be cremated. The report also urges the British Cremation Authority to deal with the reported problem of some crematoria appearing unwilling to cremate individual organs. I have asked officials to consider whether there is a need to amend the Regulations in order to remove any lack of clarity on this point.</p>

  <p>Good progress has been made on the Red Tape Review recommendations. I have today issued an external communications strategy which responds to a major recommendation of the Red Tape Review Report. This covers all aspects of communications between SERAD and producers, including the future introduction of electronic systems for claiming subsidies. It sets out actions for the future with targets for delivery. Progress reports will issue every six months.</p>

  <p>Also published today is a report of the SERAD commissioned research into the burdens of form filling on small-scale producers &#8211; fulfilling a further recommendation of the Red Tape Review Report. This research, carried out by George Street Research Ltd, highlights the central importance of IACS subsidies to producers and identifies a number of improvements which can be made to communications with producers.</p>

  <p>A table is also published today showing the latest position on implementation of the Red Tape Panel recommendations. All the main recommendations have now been implemented or are in process of implementation. The remaining recommendations &#8211; which mainly require changes to EU legislation &#8211; are also being actively pursued.</p>

  <p>Copies of the external communications strategy and of the updated Red Tape Report implementation table are available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre. A copy of the George Street Research Report is available on the SE website.</p>

  <p>Guidelines for initial teacher education in Scotland, revised in 1998, require that courses prepare teachers entering the pre-school, primary and secondary sectors to be responsive to the needs of all pupils in respect of health and general well being.</p>

  <p>While these guidelines offer the scope to address the issue of epilepsy awareness, the breadth of initial teacher education programmes limits the time available for consideration of any one specific topic. The guidelines are not prescriptive and each training institution develops their own course programme. Good practice guidance on the administration of medicine in schools is being prepared. The guidance recommends that school staff should have general awareness training of a number of medical conditions including epilepsy.</p>

  <p>It is the responsibility of local authorities, as employers, to ensure a wide range of continuing professional development (CPD) opportunities is available for teachers. The CPD needs of teachers will be assessed annually and will reflect national priorities as well as the priorities of the schools and teacher. This should include a range of activities that ensures teachers are well prepared to deal with pupils&#8217; health issues.</p>

  <p>A teaching qualification is not a prerequisite for tertiary education and training in epilepsy awareness would be a matter for the employer.</p>

  <p>The methodology used to calculate the distribution of funding of the Scottish Science Research Investment Fund was described in a Circular Letter issued to higher education institutions by the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council (SHEFC) on 1 March 2001 (HE/05/2001).</p>

  <p>Allocations to higher education institutions were calculated using a straightforward formula agreed by the UK higher education funding councils. The allocations were linked to research excellence and the volume of research. 50% of the funding was calculated on the basis of the funding from the SHEFC Research Assessment Exercise-based grant. The other 50% of the funding was calculated on the basis of the total external research income received by institutions. There is a minimum allocation of &#163;25,000 for institutions that are eligible to receive funding through SRIF.</p>

  <p>The calculations were based on those areas of the science research base falling within the remit of the Office of Science and Technology.</p>
