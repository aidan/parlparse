  <p>Physical activity is integral to the whole school approach to health promotion in schools. The Scottish Health Promoting Schools Unit (SHPSU), which supports the Executive&rsquo;s commitment for all schools to become health promoting by 2007, includes a National Development Officer who has responsibility for the national programme for physical activity.</p>

  <p>The Active Schools programme aims to encourage increased physical activity by developing high quality opportunities for young people to participate in regular, frequent, safe and fun activities incorporating physical activity, sport, play and active travel. Over years 2003-06 the Scottish Executive has invested &pound;24 million in this programme with further funding of &pound;12 million for 2006-07. Currently, 32 Active Schools managers and more than 650 Active Schools co-ordinators are in post in local authorities and schools across Scotland.</p>

  <p>Outdoor Education is a widely recognised and valued component for a rounded and rich educational experience. Over 2004-06, local authorities were awarded funding of &pound;34 million for Study Support/Out of School Hours Learning provision. This includes opportunities for Outdoor Education.</p>

  <p>The Executive is also funding a two-year programme - Outdoor Connections - which is being implemented by a National Development Officer seconded to Learning and Teaching Scotland. Outdoor Connections aims to continue the drive to improve the quality of learning experiences through various and diverse programmes and approaches and to secure a sustainable status for Outdoor Education as part of overall education and lifelong learning provision.</p>

  <p>Sport 21, the national strategy for sport in Scotland, has a target &quot;To make progress towards all schoolchildren taking part in at least two hours of high quality physical education classes a week&quot;. The Scottish Executive is committed to meeting the target of having an additional 400 Physical Education teachers in place by 2008. To this end, we announced in December 2005 additional funding to allow local authorities to recruit new teachers and we are working with teacher education institutions to increase the number of places available for PE students.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what progress is being made to provide assistance to the fishing industry to help address rising fuel costs.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-06-21.S2W-26822.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80032" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0621.htm#6">

  <p>If, as seems possible, fuel prices are set to stay at current levels for a long time, the industry must consider how it can adjust. Short-term measures which do not address the long-term issues facing the industry are unhelpful.</p>

  <p>To help the industry in this matter the Seafish Industry Authority is leading an integrated programme of projects, with part funding from the Scottish Executive, that aim to find ways of enhancing the fuel efficiency of fishing vessels.</p>

  <p>One of these projects is looking into the provision of cheaper, environmentally friendly fuel by investigating two different approaches:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>The production of a form of bio diesel that can be used in existing fishing vessel engines, and <br />
              Bio fuels which can be used after modifications to engines.</p>
</blockquote></p>

  <p>Testing on the latter will commence on two vessels over the coming months, with the aim &ndash; if all goes well &ndash; of investigating widespread commercial use by the end of 2007.</p>

  <p>Other Seafish projects will involve the examination of thinner twines to reduce trawl drag and other areas in gear, vessel engineering and vessel operations which can produce significant savings or improvement in efficiency.</p>

  <p>The new EFF regulation also provides the possibility of grant aiding the purchase of replacement engines. Conditions are attached to prevent increases in fleet capacity that could undermine the value of the difficult measures we have taken in Scotland to match better fleet capacity to available stocks.</p>

  <p>Under the Flood Prevention (Scotland) Act 1961 (the 1961 Act), the Moray Council submitted the <em>Lhanbryde Flood Prevention Scheme</em> for confirmation in December 2003. After the withdrawal of the only objection on 24 March 2004, Scottish ministers considered the submission and confirmed the Scheme, without modification, on 5 May 2004. A Notice of Intention to Develop (NID) for the Lhanbryde scheme was notified to Scottish ministers on 9 March 2004, and planning permission was granted on 5 April 2004. An offer of grant funding of 50% of the estimated eligible costs of &pound;1,354,107 was made in August 2004. The level of grant support was subsequently revised to 80% following the abolition in 2004 of specific capital consents for schemes and the introduction of the prudential regime.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Moray Council formally advertised the <em>Forres (Burn of Mosset) Flood</em> <em>Prevention Scheme</em> on 23 February 2005 and submitted the Scheme to Scottish ministers for confirmation in June 2005. Although the Council sought to address the objections received by Scottish ministers four objections were not withdrawn. Accordingly, in accordance with the 1961 act, a Public Local Inquiry (PLI) requires to be held to consider the objections and this has been arranged to open on 26 September 2006. After Scottish ministers have considered the report of the PLI, they may confirm the scheme, with or without modification, or refuse to confirm the Scheme. Should the scheme be confirmed, the indications are that the scheme would be eligible for grant at 80% of the eligible costs.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers also have a NID for the <em>Forres (Burn of Mosset) Flood Prevention</em> <em>Scheme</em> before them. Letters of representation were received and the planning application was notified to Scottish ministers on 1 June 2006. This case is currently under consideration, with the 28 day deadline due to expire on 3 July. As the case is currently before Scottish ministers, it would be inappropriate for any comment to be made on the merits of the particular proposal at this stage.</p>

  <p>Following the launch of the Coronary Heart Disease and Stroke Strategy in 2002 an additional &pound;40 million was &quot;ring fenced&quot; to support its implementation for a period of three years between 2003 and 2006. Managed clinical networks, established in each NHS board area, have been an integral component in determining the allocation of these funds at a local level.</p>

  <p>The Executive&rsquo;s Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) and Stroke Strategy, drawn up in 2002 set out recommendations to improve stroke services in NHS Scotland. NHS boards have taken action to implement these recommendations. A Stroke Managed Clinical Network (MCN) has been set up in each health board area. These networks are a way of bringing together clinicians from all sectors of the NHS to work with patients to deliver sustainable improvements in stroke services. A National Advisory Committee for Stroke has been established to take forward the implementation of the stroke elements of the strategy. &pound;40 million of additional funding for the period 2003-06 was allocated to boards to help take forward the recommendations of the CHD and Stroke Strategy. Approximately 50% of this funding was allocated to priority projects identified by the Stroke MCNs. These projects included: setting up Acute Stroke Units, enhanced neurovascular services, and recruiting more allied health professionals and nursing staff.</p>

  <p>Following on from the strategy we set a target to reduce deaths from stroke by 50% in the under-75s between 1995 and 2010. We are on track to meet these targets as there has been a 40% reduction in the mortality rate for the under-75s during this period.</p>

  <p>NHS Quality Improvement Scotland published its Stroke Standards in March 2004 and all boards have been visited by NHS QIS staff during 2004-05 to assess whether they were meeting these standards. All boards have developed action plans to increase their compliance with the quality standards.</p>

  <p>In their treatment of stroke patients boards are also expected to take account of evidence-based SIGN Guideline 78 - Management of patients with stroke: Identification and management of dysphagia, and SIGN Guideline 64 Management of patients with stroke: rehabilitation, prevention and management of complications, and discharge planning. SIGN Guideline 64 is currently being reviewed but its recommendations are not significantly affected by new evidence.</p>

  <p>Information is not held in the form requested. For private sector dwellings, information is held by main postcode area. In the PA postcode area, a total of 3,848 houses in the private sector are now centrally heated as a result of the central heating programme.</p>

  <p>Information on installations in council properties is held at local authority level. In the West Dunbartonshire Council area, a total of 202 council owned dwellings are now centrally heated as a result of the central heating programme. In the Argyll and Bute Council area a total of 151 council owned dwellings had systems installed under the programme.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what its response is to the findings of research by the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations and Community Care Providers Scotland identifying reductions which housing associations are having to make in their services to homeless, disabled and elderly people and deficits of &pound;2 million in 2005-06 and nearly &pound;3 million in 2006-07 faced by 12 of the major service providers operating Supporting People services.</p>

  <p>A comprehensive process for monitoring the impact of the budget changes made to Supporting People funding was agreed with local authorities, the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations (SFHA), Community Care Providers Scotland (CCPS) and others. The first monitoring returns from October 2005 confirmed that &pound;12 million of efficiency savings had been made through reviewing services, with only limited evidence of any reduction in service capacity. There was also no strong evidence at that time that external providers were being disproportionately affected by the drive to improve efficiency and the need to redistribute Supporting People funding more fairly across Scotland.</p>

  <p>We will take very careful note of the SFHA/CCPS survey findings, but we need to await the next formal monitoring returns from local authorities at the end of July to get a comprehensive picture. We will be careful to check in our own monitoring that the service review process is fair and that external providers are not being treated unfairly. Local authorities are being asked for example to provide signed statements from a representative range of external providers confirming they agree the process has been fair.</p>

  <p>We take the concerns expressed in the SFHA/CCPS survey very seriously, but the Scottish Executive has already made &pound;60 million of additional funding available, beyond that provided by Treasury, slowed down the rate of redistribution, and allowed local authorities to carry forward any under-spends from previous years to ease transitional pressures.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-06-21.S2W-26702.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80057" speakername="Mr Andy Kerr" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0621.htm#15">

  <p>The majority of patients who require in-patient and day case treatment, including orthopaedic surgery, are treated quickly. Nearly 53% of patients treated in NHSScotland hospitals receive immediate treatment and never join a waiting list. Of those whose condition does not require immediate treatment and who are placed on a waiting list, over 40% are admitted within 1 month and over 70% within three months.</p>

  <p>The Executive has been steadily reducing the maximum waiting time for those patients who wait longer. The national maximum waiting time was reduced from 12 months to nine months on 31 December 2003 and to six months on 31 December 2005. This will be further reduced to 18 weeks from the end of 2007. On 31 March 2006, no patient with a guarantee had waited more than six months for orthopaedic surgery.</p>

  <p>NHSScotland is making good progress towards meeting the next key target of a maximum wait of 18 weeks by the end of 2007. At that point, a new approach to defining and measuring waiting will also be introduced to replace availability status codes (ASCs), which have the effect at present of excluding patients from waiting times guarantees where for example, they are medically unfit for treatment, where they have asked for their treatment to be postponed, or where their treatment is highly specialised or of low clinical priority. The new approach will be fairer, more consistent and more transparent.</p>

  <p>Retrospective analyses of waiting times for hospital treatment compiled from SMR01 returns are based on data that does not record whether patients have had an ASC applied. Information requested on waiting times for elective admissions to trauma and orthopaedic departments is given in the following table: it includes the waiting times of patients who have been exempted from the guarantee for the reasons given above and therefore overstates true waiting times. It is not possible to estimate the extent of the overstatement. The SMR3 waiting times census data, which excludes patients with ASCs, is used for target compliance purposes, and the table also presents SMR3 data for patients who were waiting for elective admission to trauma and orthopaedic departments on the censuses undertaken on 31 March in each year since 1999.</p>

  <p>A prisoner remains the responsibility of the prison service when he or she is in hospital, and the hospital authorities are expected to work with prison staff to ensure appropriate security while the necessary clinical care is provided.</p>

  <p>It is for local NHS and custody staff to carry out a risk assessment in each case to ensure that the conditions of security in which the prisoner is treated are appropriate and not excessive. However, it is ultimately for the hospital to decide where to accommodate the patient based on their need for treatment and care. While local arrangements would not necessarily exclude an open ward, prisoner patients tend to be managed in side rooms.</p>
