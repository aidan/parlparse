  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-2952 by John Swinney on 14 August 2007 and given that it will make an announcement in due course on future policy on the location of public sector posts, on what basis it decided to base the new Scottish Legal Complaints Commission in Edinburgh and to cancel the planned relocation of NHS Health Scotland, NHS Quality Improvement Scotland and NHS Education for Scotland to Glasgow.</p>

  <p>The decision to base the Scottish Legal Complaints Commission in Edinburgh was taken following careful consideration of the options identified by the previous administration. As the Cabinet Secretary for Justice noted in his announcement, the decision reflects the need to ensure that the location chosen should be suitably accessible to potential users and would enable business continuity as well as representing a cost-effective solution offering the potential for future sharing of accommodation and/or sharing of services with other scrutiny bodies.</p>

  <p>The decision to not to relocate the three NHS Special Health Boards from Edinburgh was taken following an examination of the full business cases for the move which demonstrated that this did not represent the best use of resources which could be better invested in front-line services and in tackling health inequalities.</p>

  <p>In the current financial year the Scottish Government has provided &pound;374,799 to Community Justice Authorities for the specific purpose of delivery of perpetrator programmes by certain of the constituent local authorities within their areas. This funding is provided under section 27(1) of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968.</p>

  <p>In addition, many other authorities undertake work with perpetrators of domestic abuse as part of their overall section 27 grant settlement but it is not possible in these instances to identify the specific amounts attributable to work with this group of offenders.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government sponsored Caledonian System incorporates a programme which seeks to challenge and rehabilitate perpetrators of domestic abuse. This has been submitted to the Scottish Accreditation Panel for Offender Programmes and is due to be considered by the panel this month. Decisions on future roll-out of the Caledonian System will be informed by the outcomes of the accreditation application.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s Skills Strategy, launched on 10 September, confirms our commitment to providing opportunities for everyone to contribute to Scotland&rsquo;s prosperity, to encouraging the integration of employment and skills services, and to addressing the skills needs of people furthest from the labour market.

  <p>The Procurator Fiscal is responsible for investigating all sudden, suspicious, unexplained, unexpected or accidental deaths and will consider, based on all the facts and circumstances, whether a fatal accident inquiry (FAI) is necessary.</p>

  <p>Current legislation provides for mandatory fatal accident inquiries in respect of deaths which occur in the course of employment or in legal custody, and for discretionary FAIs where it appears to the Lord Advocate to be in the public interest to hold such an inquiry. A full investigation by the Procurator Fiscal will precede an FAI.</p>

  <p>FAIs are held in public. The sheriff who presides over the FAI makes a determination, on the facts and circumstances of the case at the conclusion of the FAI and may issue recommendations which are not currently legally enforceable.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government maintains a public database of FAI determinations.</p>

  <p>Obesity statistics are available from the <em><strong>Scottish Health Survey</strong></em> <strong>. The most recent survey was run in 2003</strong> . Statistics for adults are available by NHS board area (grouped for the island boards because of the relatively small numbers involved). Statistics for children are not available at NHS board level from this source.</p>

  <p>(See worksheet labelled &quot;BMI&quot; for NHS board level figures.)</p>

  <p>In addition, for more up-to-date statistics on obesity in children, all NHS boards in Scotland are required to provide a <em>Child Health Surveillance Programme</em> where children are offered routine reviews at various stages of their life. The majority of Boards record these reviews using the electronic child health systems, CHSP-Pre-School and CHSP-School. <a href="http://www.isdscotland.org/child_obesity" target="_blank">http://www.isdscotland.org/child_obesity</a>.</p>

  <p>The primary purpose of the Housing Supply Task Force is to tackle blockages that are preventing the construction of housing across Scotland. The focus will be on action to address these impediments and at this stage it is not envisaged that specially-commissioned research will be a feature of the task force&rsquo;s activities. Task force members will be contributing their in-depth understandings of the issues to the meetings and are best placed to inform discussion on these issues.</p>

  <p>There is an expectation, however, that all research commissioned by the Scottish Government is published on the Scottish Government website as soon as a final report can be made available. Should any research be commissioned to support the task force, this would be published in the normal way.</p>

  <p>There are no specific service standards that are laid down for property managers and factors, although those that are members of trade or professional bodies are expected to comply with their respective codes of practice. The enforcement of such codes of practice is a matter for those bodies.</p>

  <p>Otherwise service delivery by property managers is a contractual matter between them and their customers, enforceable in the courts. In addition, house owners who are dissatisfied with the service provided by a property manager have powers to dismiss them. Even if the title deeds are silent on this point, the Title Conditions (Scotland) Act 2003 and the Tenements (Scotland) Act 2004 provide that a simple majority of owners can dismiss the property manager and, regardless of what the title deeds specify, a majority of two thirds will always be able to dismiss the property manager. An exception to these provisions is in a new development, where the developer may retain the right to appoint the factor for up to five years after the properties are built or until the last house is sold, whichever is sooner.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-2233 by John Swinney on 2 August 2007, what the total cost to the taxpayer will be of all existing PFI/PPP projects over the course of their contractual life, broken down by (a) local authority area, (b) NHS board and (c) individual project.</p>

  <p>The information requested is provided in the following table.</p>

  <p>Since S3W-2233 was answered on 2 August 2007, two more PPP projects have reached financial close: East Dunbartonshire schools and West Lothian schools. They have been included in the table. The table covers the years 1999-2000 to 2040-41, a period of 42 years and includes estimates for the unitary charges in future years.</p>

  <p>The unitary charge is the amount paid by the public sector procuring body to the private sector consortium for the services it provides over the length of the contract. The services include capital construction, lifecycle maintenance and facilities management, and not just the upfront construction cost of the asset.</p>

  <p>The replacement of the Townhill Primary School building in Hamilton is a matter for South Lanarkshire Council which has a statutory responsibility to provide and maintain school buildings.</p>

  <p>There are several procurement options open to public sector procuring bodies and it is their responsibility to assess which is most appropriate for any investment they are undertaking. As regards the Scottish Futures Trust, work on the design aspects is underway, and we believe it will be able to deliver better value arrangements for major public infrastructure projects. We will make an announcement when we are ready to explain it in more detail.</p>
