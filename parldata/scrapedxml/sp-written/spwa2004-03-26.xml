  <p>We are tackling problem debt through our Partnership for a Better Scotland commitment to support the money advice sector in Scotland. To this end an extra &pound;4 million of new funding for 2004-05 and 2005-06 was announced on 26 January 2004 which will go towards developing new front-line money advice services for a number of vulnerable groups, such as minority ethnic communities and lone parents. The funding will also be used to boost the &pound;3 million annually already provided to local authorities by the Executive, which has resulted in 120 additional money advisers.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive <a name="QuestionText">how its procurement policies promote the use of high-efficiency energy appliances in the public sector.</a></p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2004-03-26.S2W-6854.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80109" speakername="Tavish Scott" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-04/wa0326.htm#QuestionText">

  <p>The Scottish Public Finance Manual, which applies to the Scottish Executive, its agencies and non-departmental public bodies, states that all procurement of goods and services should be based on value for money, having due regard to propriety and regularity. &quot;Value for money&quot; is defined as the optimum combination of whole-life cost, which will include running and disposal costs as well as the initial purchase price, and quality (or fitness for purpose) to meet the user's requirement.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not prescribe what energy-related equipment should be procured by public sector bodies. This will be a matter for the body concerned. Through the Government's Actionenergy programme, local authorities have access to free advice on good practice on energy management including technical information on high efficiency appliances.</p>
