  <p>There is no evidence-based explanation for more pupils being recognised as having autistic spectrum disorder.

  <p>The recruitment of history teachers to schools is a matter for local authorities (LAs), depending on the curriculum needs of individual schools.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive carries out an annual teacher workforce planning exercise to ensure at a national level adequate numbers of newly qualified teachers are trained for when they are required in publicly funded schools. This takes into account factors such as the age profile of the profession; changing pupil numbers; numbers of new entrants to the profession and those leaving due to resignation, retirement etc.</p>

  <p>As part of the exercise subject specialisms are prioritised to make certain intakes to initial teacher education reflect the teachers needed. Factors which are considered in the prioritisation exercise include vacancy levels reported by LAs and the demand from LAs for probationer teachers in each sector/subject.</p>

  <p>Pan Fish&rsquo;s stated aim of &quot;lowest cost production&quot; resulting from its proposed merger with Marine Harvest will still require its operations to comply with existing legislation with regard to the notification of suspected and actual escape incidents. Similarly, requirements specified by the authorities with regard to containment measures and contingency plans, which are designed to minimise escapes, should also be adhered to.</p>

  <p>These requirements are expected to be strengthened further by the proposed Aquaculture and Fisheries Bill due for introduction before the summer recess.</p>

  <p>The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is the central competent authority for food safety and standards. Local authority environmental health services in Scotland are in a position to provide allergy advice to local authority meal providers. The FSA Scotland provides up to date advice to environmental health services on allergens, including nuts. This advice is in the form of update letters, training and guidance on the FSA website.</p>

  <p>The advice which is available to local authority meal providers includes examples of foods containing allergens, typical reactions and key messages in catering environments e.g. knowledge of ingredients, prevention of cross contamination and training.</p>

  <p>New hygiene regulations which came into force on 1 January 2006 require that all food businesses (including local authority meal providers) must implement and maintain food safety management procedures. Hazard analysis requires the operators to consider the hazards associated with food allergens, including nuts.</p>

  <p>A number of documents are available from the FSA to assist food businesses. The <em>CookSafe </em>document, most commonly used in Scotland, has a section specifically dedicated to allergy advice, including nuts.</p>

  <p>Hungry for Success, the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s programme for the provision of healthy school meals advises that any food for nut allergy sufferers should be provided in accordance with diet plans prepared by a State Registered Dietician.</p>

  <p>Language Network Scotland states its role as &quot;promoting a greater national capability in languages&quot;. This interfaces with school education, where we have guaranteed the opportunity to learn a modern European language starting in primary school, and with lifelong learning, where our colleges and universities continue to provide opportunities for students to develop their language skills. This includes innovations such as the University of Strathclyde&rsquo;s Certificate in Applied Language Study, a new degree-level qualification which recognises professional competence in language at work.</p>

  <p>As part of their initial teacher training, student teachers are required to undertake a core module on health education which is designed to develop their understanding of health, health promotion and related issues. The module covering health education includes an introduction to the variety of counselling approaches and techniques designed to support pupils and children in dealing effectively with their emotional well-being.</p>

  <p>With regard to Continuing Professional Development, a number of organisations provide training on dealing with self-harm in young people for teaching professionals across Scotland.</p>

  <p>Other support is available to teaching professionals for example, The Scottish Executive&rsquo;s handbook on child protection in education, <em>Safe and Well</em> (2005), provides information on a range of issues concerning children&rsquo;s care and welfare to guide the practice of teaching professionals, including a section to help school staff recognise and respond effectively to pupils who self-harm. <em>Happy, Safe and Achieving the Potential</em> (2004), the report of the National Review of Guidance, gives a 10-point standard for personal support in Scottish schools, including effective co-ordination of support with other agencies and time to listen to children.</p>

  <p>In addition, The Scottish Health Promoting Schools Unit (SHPSU) works to increase awareness of the partnerships, networks and organisations at local level that can support schools in work around mental and emotional health in schools, including self harming.</p>

  <p>The website <a href="http://www.healthpromotingschools.co.uk" target="_blank">www.healthpromotingschools.co.uk</a> is continually updated to provide information about resources and support (including training) and links widely to the organisations that specialise in particular issues.</p>

  <p>The exact number of children under 16 diagnosed with depression in Scotland in each year since 1999 is not available centrally. However, national estimates of the numbers of children consulting for depression can be given based on the number of patients seen for the condition in general practices participating in PTI (Practice Team Information). PTI data is obtained from a sample of Scottish General Practices. This sample has a pattern of age, sex, deprivation and urban/rural distribution that closely matches that of the Scottish general practice population. The number of participating practices is too small to allow estimates for individual NHS board areas.</p>

  <p>The estimated number of children under 16 seen in general practices in Scotland for depression, based on PTI data (GP only) and standardised by sex and deprivation, is shown in the following table:</p>

  <p>Estimated Scottish prevalence of depression in children under 16, by year:</p>

  <p>The Allandale Park and Ride site was proposed in the Central Scotland Transport Corridor Study to provide some alternative for road traffic using the A80/M80 corridor into Glasgow, and was part of a package of measures aimed at limiting the need for additional road capacity.</p>

  <p>The present study has evaluated that option in greater detail, and also considered more recent ideas to develop an additional or alternative park and ride site at Bannockburn.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland has the operational responsibility for this area, and can be contacted for more information if required.</p>

  <p>Such forecasting involves detailed modelling and would carry significant cost. It would also rapidly become out of date. There is no advantage in doing this work while use of the powers has been ruled out.</p>

  <p>Such forecasting involves detailed modelling and would carry significant cost. It would also rapidly become out of date. There is no advantage in doing this work while use of the powers has been ruled out.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W 23269 by Mr Andy Kerr on 16 February 2006, whether it is its understanding that the Chief Medical Officer was referring to thousands of (a) live virus vaccines or (b) attenuated vaccines and that he was suggesting that it is safe to administer to a child thousands of vaccines containing the mercury preservative thiomersal.</p>

  <p>Whether the vaccines are live or inactivated is not specified by the authors of the paper referred to in my previous answer. The administration of 10,000 vaccines at the same time is a theoretical concept to illustrate the capacity of an infant&rsquo;s immune system, rather than something that is actually going to be done.</p>

  <p>None of the vaccines in the routine childhood immunisation programme now contains thiomersal.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how much income Scottish Water expects to receive from infrastructure and connection charges on new development under the Provision of Water and Sewerage Services (Reasonable Cost) (Scotland) Regulations 2006; for what purposes this income will be used, and what criteria will be applied in allocating this income where it is used to fund infrastructure.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to estimate the income Scottish Water will receive from infrastructure charges payable for every new water or sewerage connection to its networks as this will depend on the total number of new connections made in any year. However, for the purposes of the Final Determination, the Water Industry Commission for Scotland predicted a figure of &pound;30 million based on the estimated number of new housing units to be provided by Scottish Water up to March 2010.</p>

  <p>The funds Scottish Water raises from this charge will be used to help address demands on capacity that cannot be attributed to particular developments. Further information on the purposes and criteria to be used in applying this income were set out in the Scottish Executive Consultation Paper <em>Connecting To The System &ndash; consultation on paying for connections to the water and sewerage system</em>, and in the Scottish Executive report on that consultation <em>Connecting To The System &ndash; consultation on paying for connections to the water and sewerage system: Consultation Report</em>. Copies of these documents have been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. numbers 37568 and 39416).</p>
