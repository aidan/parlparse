  <p>The changes announced to the modern apprenticeship programme ensures that public investments supports the Government Economic Strategy. We have committed to target new support for MA 20+ to construction, engineering and related sector, where we know our investment delivers results.</p>

  <p>Evidence from an evaluation on modern apprenticeships in Scotland carried out by Cambridge Policy Consultants showed that many non-traditional frameworks used by adults involve little added learning and therefore do not deliver value for money. Although there is a high proportion of older workers in the food and drink sector, it is important that future interventions are employer and demand-led. Therefore, Sector Skills Councils and Skills Development Scotland are currently working with employers and training providers to consider what the most appropriate skills interventions are and how these should be supported.</p>

  <p>The curriculum in Scotland is not based on statutory prescription. It is for local authorities and schools, in the light of the curriculum framework within which they operate, to determine how best to organise the syllabus and offer substance misuse education as part of a wider health education programme.</p>

  <p>Through Curriculum for Excellence, young people will be able to develop their knowledge, skills and understanding of substance misuse as part of education for health and well-being. Draft Curriculum for Excellence outcomes and experiences for health and wellbeing were published in May 2008 by Learning and Teaching Scotland. Practitioners are being asked to reflect on these and provide feedback, linked to a process of trialling over the coming months.</p>

  <p>Through the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency, the Scottish Government supports the Choices for Life programme. The programme delivers positive lifestyle messages to around 54,000 primary 7 children each year with the aim of addressing issues about smoking, underage drinking and illegal drugs. &quot;Choices&quot; events have taken place in Aberdeen, Glasgow, Edinburgh and the Highlands and Islands. All schools within the north east were invited to send their primary 7 pupils and more than 5,200 young people attended the events held in Aberdeen in May.</p>

  <p>Improving literacy and numeracy skills is at the heart of the Curriculum for Excellence programme.

  <p>Inspectors are required to have a relevant degree, with first or second class Honours, or have other means to demonstrate achievement of an equivalent standard. They must have an appropriate professional qualification in education or services for children. In addition, they must have successful professional experience in education or services for children and proven success in a significant leadership role. Prior to appointment and to determine their suitability, potential inspectors undergo an intensive assessment centre. This evaluates both their professional expertise and their skills and competencies in key areas such as written and oral communication, analysis and investigation and team management.</p>

  <p>HM Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) would generally expect assistant inspectors to have a proven successful track record in carrying out independent, external evaluation and reporting in the sector(s) to which they are deployed. They must show extensive and up-to-date knowledge of their educational sector(s) or in services for children, and have detailed working knowledge of the HMIE quality framework and inspection/review procedures for their educational sector(s) or in services for children. They are required to have a proven, successful career as a teacher, lecturer, and other education professional or within services which work closely with children and young people. Like inspectors, they must demonstrate success in a significant leadership role and high quality interpersonal and writing skills.</p>

  <p>Although not employed directly by HMIE, promoted staff from schools and education authorities join HMIE inspection teams as associate assessors. HMIE would generally expect associate assessors to be experienced practitioners who carry high credibility in their field and have sound judgement and very good inter-personal and communication skills.</p>

  <p>HMIE work closely with a number of organisations and other inspectorates participating in inward and outward secondments. Currently, HMIE has seconded professional staff from HM Inspectorate of Constabulary, the Social Work Inspection Agency, Care Commission and NHS Quality Improvement Scotland. Those seconded to HMIE must be professionals who will have worked successfully in their field for a significant period of time. Each must have in-depth experience of their particular sector and backgrounds and expertise which enable them to work across a range of sectors.</p>

  <p>HM Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) is strongly committed to continuing professional development (CPD) for all its employees. HMIE use a variety of approaches to delivering programmed CPD for inspectors and assistant inspectors amounting to an average of eight days per year. Such CPD ranges from corporate training conferences and seminars to sector-specific, directorate training events. Inspectors also attend specific external courses and events associated with the sectors they are deployed in to ensure they remain at the forefront of national and international developments. Corporate services staff receive regular programmes of corporate training and bespoke training relevant to their job within the corporate services team. Although not employees, all associate assessors and lay members appointed to HMIE receive specific training to allow them to undertake their inspection responsibilities and contribute fully to the work of HMIE. Across HMIE, extensive use is also made of shadowing, mentoring and coaching to enable staff to develop the skills, behaviours and attitudes needed for them to carry out their work to a high standard.</p>

  <p>A key challenge of the skills strategy is that we encourage the integration of employment and skills services to facilitate the journey individuals make from long-term unemployment to sustained employment and in-work progression. This includes working jointly with the UK Government and Jobcentre Plus who have the primary responsibility for helping disabled people find employment and working with COSLA to develop a framework for supported employment in Scotland. Equality is a guiding principle of the skills strategy and we will ensure that each programme underpinning this strategy will be equality impact assessed across six strands (race, disability, gender, sexual orientation, age and religion/faith) to make sure that they are appropriate.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The SFC does not publish any information on funding per student at higher education institutions (HEIs).

  <p>While this shows the relative allocations to fund undergraduate and postgraduate provision, this is on a full-time equivalent basis and does not demonstrate how funding is allocated within individual institutions to support the range of full-time and part-time provision.</p>

  <p>Additionally, the gross funding figures include the tuition fee element of funding which is not paid by SFC. We are unable to disaggregate this on a per student basis as different students pay different fees depending on their domicile.</p>

  <p>We have also made available funding to help provide training which will allow those who have had a stroke to take part in the work of the stroke managed clinical networks.

  <p>The regulator&rsquo;s policy of not reporting who makes freedom of information (FOI) requests is in line with the approach taken by the Scottish Government and the Scottish Parliament. The Data Protection Act 1998 prevents the regulator publishing personal data about private individuals. This includes information on who makes requests under the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002. The regulator&rsquo;s website publishes a log of the information released in response to FOI requests where it may be of wider public interest and has not been published elsewhere.</p>

  <p>Agenda for Change is a UK-wide agreement and, as such, implementation issues throughout the UK are similar. However, in Wales, concerns were raised with the implementation process being used, particularly around the consistency of application and outcomes. The Welsh review rightly aimed to address a number of these concerns. In Scotland, Agenda for Change has been implemented in full partnership and arrangements have been in place to check consistency of outcomes prior to assimilation since the process began.</p>

  <p>This Scottish Government, as part of its new relationship with local government, is investing record levels of funding in local government. The settlement for each local authority provides a single budget within which authorities can exercise flexibility to reach decisions on how to achieve agreed outcomes. This new agreement is built on mutual respect and partnership, and reinforces the need for local authorities to balance local needs and priorities across their area. This means that local government should have sufficient resources not just to maintain, but also improve front-line services.</p>

  <p>One of the national outcomes towards which we are working is that our young people should become successful learners, confident individuals, effective contributors and responsible citizens; as part of this, local authorities and the Scottish Government are committed to the development and implementation of Curriculum for Excellence. The draft experiences and outcomes for Curriculum for Excellence which have been released over the course of the school year contain rich opportunities for schools and other educational establishments to encourage activities outwith the normal school day. <em>Building the Curriculum 3: a framework for learning and teaching,</em> also restates a definition of the curriculum as comprising: the ethos and life of the school as a community; curriculum areas and subjects; opportunities for personal achievement, and interdisciplinary learning. This definition enables many different approaches to learning and teaching and can include, for example, outdoor learning, work-related activities, out of school hours learning as part of a young person&rsquo;s curricular experience.</p>

  <p>Irrespective of how earnings may rise in the next three years, the number of Scottish students receiving support other than non means tested maintenance loans would be unaffected as under current funding rules all eligible students are entitled to tuition fees (or tuition fee loans if they are studying elsewhere in the UK) which are not means tested. The table below shows the number of Scottish students receiving Student Awards Agency for Scotland (SAAS) support other than non means tested maintenance loans in 2006-07 by parental/spousal income. The table also shows how these data would look if average earnings rose by 3.1% (figure based on growth in average median weekly earnings in the year to April 2007) in each of the subsequent three years.</p>

  <p>A national multi-agency working group has recently reported to ministers with a series of recommendations for strategic action relating to service provision for young runaways. The group identified the need for significant action in a number of areas including risk assessment, training, emergency accommodation and refuge provision, data collation and improved practice in relation to the delivery of Return Home Welfare Interviews for young people who run away from home or care. Ministers have asked for work to be undertaken in partnership with stakeholders on how best to take forward the recommendations.</p>

All SOAs should reflect the priorities and agreed outcomes for each council and include relevant supporting indicators and targets.
