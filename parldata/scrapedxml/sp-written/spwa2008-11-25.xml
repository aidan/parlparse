  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. A repeat discharge is defined as a discharge with an alcohol-related diagnosis for a patient who has previously been discharged from hospital with such a diagnosis earlier in the same year. The total includes multiple repeat discharges for patients with more than two discharges in one year.</p>

  <p>2. Excludes psychiatric hospitals and maternity hospitals. Transfers are also excluded. Includes Scottish residents only.</p>

  <p>3. Caution is necessary when interpreting these figures. The recording of alcohol misuse may vary from hospital to hospital. Where alcohol misuse is suspected but unconfirmed it may not be recorded by the hospital.</p>

  <p>There is a range of both institutional and individual financial support packages available to students studying within Scotland depending on whether the student is on a further or higher education course.</p>

  <p>Colleges receive block grants for teaching which are not split into funding for specific courses or assistance. In 2008-09, the main teaching allocation totalled &pound;392 million. In addition to funding for teaching the courses, colleges receive funds to support their students. This includes a bursary allocation which can be used to meet the additional support needs of students to assist them accessing and participating in college. This part of the bursary allowance is called the Additional Support Needs for Learning Allowance and is not subject to a means test. These funds can be used by the student (or on the student's behalf) to fund a personal learning assistant or to pay for assistive technology. In 2008-09, the bursary allocation totalled &pound;58 million.</p>

  <p>The Disabled Students Allowance (DSA) is an non income assessed allowance intended to cover the extra costs or expenses a student may have while undertaking a higher education course which arises because of their disability. In 2007-08, 3,625 students were in receipt of DSA payments totalling &pound;8.1 million. This is an increase of 7.1% in terms of numbers and 6.7% in terms of amounts paid out since 2006-07. As part of the DSA, students can receive support from a non-medical personal helper (NMPH), for example a dyslexia specialist support worker. From academic year, 2008-09, eligible students that require the assistance of a NMPH will benefit from an increased allowance of up to &pound;20,000.</p>

Stage 4 of the package, for those on low incomes who live in homes with very poor energy efficiency, will offer insulation measures for hard to treat homes, beyond those currently included in Warm Deal. The technical specification of the individual measures to be included will be established with input from expert stakeholders.

  <p>At birth, and at 65 years of age, Scottish men and women have lower life expectancies, healthy life expectancies and disability-free life expectancies than people in the rest of the UK.</p>

  <p>From birth, and over the age of 50, men and women can typically expect to live &quot; in good health&quot; for 15 and 19 years respectively, or &quot;free of disability&quot; for 11 and 13 years for men and women respectively.</p>

The CSO primarily responds to requests for funding research proposals initiated by the research community in Scotland.

  <p>The Scottish Government has no plans to devolve the functions of NHS 24 to territorial NHS boards. On that basis, such costing information is not held.</p>

  <p>However, the Scottish Government is committed to the development of local NHS 24 services across Scotland in support of its national infrastructure. In addition to the three regional centres (Clydebank in the West, South Queensferry in the East, and Aberdeen in the North), five local centres in Inverness, Dundee, East Kilbride, Kilmarnock and Dumfries were established in late 2005. The aim was to build NHS 24 capacity, aid the recruitment of specialist nurses and improve the performance of the NHS 24 service. These centres supported the development of closer strategic relationships with the host territorial health boards. They also delivered increased positive partner feedback as well as patient satisfaction from local board areas through improved service delivery. They have afforded the opportunity for flexible working and improved work life balance for the nursing workforce within those localities.</p>

  <p>All these sites have resilient telephony and IT links and operate as part of an integrated national network. The telephony design is aimed at ensuring patient calls are answered at their closest regional centre and if a consultation with a clinician is required the call is routed to their designated local centre. However in the case of serious and urgent calls if a local nurse is unavailable within a pre-determined timescale, the call will automatically look for the first available nurse to ensure patient safety is maintained at all times.</p>

  <p>The <em>Better Health, Better Care</em> action plan tasked NHS 24 to work towards establishing local services within all mainland health board areas. The following table provides details of the current progress against this action.</p>

  <p>The Chief Scientist Office (CSO) within the Scottish Government Health Directorates has responsibility for encouraging and supporting research into health and healthcare needs in Scotland. CSO primarily responds to requests for funding research proposals initiated by the research community in Scotland. CSO does not therefore, have any specific plans for further investment in research into learning difficulties but would welcome research proposals into this area which would be subject to the usual peer and committee review.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is fully committed to the personalisation agenda, including the most radical aspect of personalisation, self-directed support.</p>

  <p>Personalisation of services has been a component of public sector reform and is a key aspiration of the Changing Lives review of social work services. Personalisation is a theme that features in all the work being done by the five change programmes and the products to be produced by those groups over the next six months or so. This includes a supported self-evaluation guide being developed with SWIA and local authorities as well as a training toolkit being developed to support the notion of citizen leadership described by the Changing Lives User and Carer Forum.</p>

  <p>In terms of self-directed support, a reference group is currently considering a draft strategy to radically increase the uptake of self-directed support in Scotland. A key part of this strategy will be running test sites in three local authorities to consider how well specific interventions improve uptake. This work builds on research conducted in June 2008 which demonstrated the flexibility, choice, control and independence that self-directed support is able to offer individuals. The Scottish Government will consider further guidance, explicit target setting or legislation if they prove necessary in the longer term.</p>
