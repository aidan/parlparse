  <p>On 19 July 2007, I had meetings with Vernon Coaker MP, Minister of State at the Home Office. and the Home Secretary to discuss a number of issues including drink driving.</p>

  <p>On 12 March 2008, I wrote to the Secretary of State for Transport, Ruth Kelly MP, urging the UK Government to lower the drink driving limit to 50mg per 100ml of blood, and to introduce random breath testing.</p>

  <p>As part of the review we will be considering the use, effectiveness and range of existing measures available to local agencies to tackle unacceptable behaviour, including services relevant to high hedge disputes, such as mediation. We intend to publish the findings of the review by the end of 2008.</p>

  <p>Additionally, the Scottish Government is exploring options, including legislative ones, for supporting a means of last resort for resolving disputes about high hedges. This will be done in parallel to the national antisocial behaviour review. In doing so, we will bear in mind consultation on the issue by the previous administration, the provisions in place in England and Wales, and Scott Barrie&rsquo;s bill, which fell at dissolution of the last session of the Parliament.</p>

  <p>On 29 November 2007 we announced our decision to introduce a bill to reverse the House of Lords Judgment of 17 October 2007 in <em>Johnston v NEI International Combustion Ltd</em> . We also announced that the provisions of the bill would take effect from the date of the Judgment. The intention is to ensure that pleural plaques remain an actionable injury in Scots law. The bill which is introduced to the Parliament will also make clear that asymptomatic pleural thickening and asymptomatic asbestosis, when caused by negligent exposure to asbestos, continue to give rise to a claim for damages in Scotland. Subject to Parliamentary timetabling, we expect to introduce the bill before the summer recess.</p>

  <p>Scotland at present has no system of sentencing guidelines. However, the Scottish Government believes that there is a case for guidelines to deliver more consistent and transparent sentencing and for setting up a sentencing council to create them. We consider that there needs to be further consultation and dialogue with key interests, principally the judiciary, on this issue.</p>
