  <p>The Executive provides assistance to the Scottish beekeeping industry through the UK Apiculture Programme. The Scottish element of the programme is delivered by:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>the Scottish Agriculture Science Agency, which provides a free laboratory diagnostic service for notifiable disease examination and assessment;<br />
              the Scottish Agricultural College, through its apiculture specialist, provides free advice and training in all aspects of integrated pest management and good bee husbandry in relation to the control of notifiable bee diseases, and<br />
              Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department&rsquo;s (SEERAD) bee officers respond to notification of the possible presence of notifiable bee disease and carry out voluntary searches for the presence of such disease.</p>

  <p>It is recognised that honey bees make an important contribution to the pollination of commercial grown crops and wild plants and flowers. This contribution is difficult to quantify; but I understand a study by Carreck and Williams in 1998 estimated that the value of the contribution that bees make to the UK economy to be in excess of &pound;200 million per annum.</p>

  <p>The treatment of cancer is a top priority for the Scottish Executive and NHSScotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has invested heavily in more skilled staff and equipment to improve cancer services, including &pound;87 million for the new West of Scotland Cancer Centre. The &pound;25 million recurring additional investment from <em>Cancer in Scotland </em>has resulted in more than 300 additional staff and additional/new equipment to build capacity with many examples of specific reductions in waiting times and other important clinical quality improvements.</p>

  <p>With some of the best treatment in the world, more and more Scots are living with and beating cancer. All of Scotland&rsquo;s five cancer centres have new state of the art imaging, radiotherapy and other equipment. In addition, &pound;125 million is invested over three years for new medical equipment across the country, including &pound;33 million for new radiotherapy equipment and a 20% increase in capital investment for NHS boards.</p>

  <p>Equipment is calibrated and serviced on a continual basis by specialist trained professionals, according to manufacturers&rsquo; recommendations and in accordance with safety legislation and national quality standards.</p>

  <p>Decisions on where cancer treatment is provided are clinically based and are agreed between doctor and patient. As far as possible and dependent on the type of tumour and treatment requirements, arrangements are made to treat patients as close to home as possible.</p>

  <p>Delivering for Health sets the direction for NHS services for the future with services delivered as locally as possible, when that can be done safely and sustainably, but with prompt access to specialised services when necessary.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive and NHSScotland are constantly seeking to develop the service in line with patients&rsquo; needs, taking into account patient safety which is paramount. However, in some cases, treatment requirements are so highly specialised that they are available only in Cancer Centres e.g. radiotherapy and some forms of chemotherapy.</p>

  <p>There are five cancer centres in Scotland in Glasgow, Dundee, Edinburgh, Inverness and Aberdeen. Outreach services and some treatments for cancer are also available in local hospitals.</p>

  <p>There are six breast screening centres in Scotland in Glasgow, Irvine, Dundee, Edinburgh, Inverness and Aberdeen. To enable ease of access the Scottish Breast Screening Programme also operate 18 mobile units throughout the country.</p>

  <p>Following a report from the National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) about the evidence of an increased risk of breast cancer following supradiagphragmatic (mantle) radiotherapy for Hodgkins disease in young women, the Chief Medical Officers of the four UK Departments of Health instituted a UK-wide identification and notification exercise which commenced in 2003. This involved identifying, contacting and informing patients throughout the UK.</p>

  <p>Letters and fact sheets were sent to identified patients&rsquo; general practitioners and consultants and a national announcement was made by the Department of Health in England in November 2003.</p>

  <p>More than 300 women across Scotland were contacted as part of the exercise, some of whom elected to take up the invitation for advice and surveillance. Some women are also now of an age that they are called for screening by the Scottish Breast Screening Programme.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has any plans to monitor, with a view to curbing, environmental pollutants such as pesticides, herbicides and the use of antibiotics, additives and hormone treatments in the animal and plant food chain, in light of the statement by the UK Working Group on the Primary Prevention of Breast Cancer in its report, <em>Breast Cancer &ndash; an Environmental Disease: The Case for Primary Prevention</em> , that they are influential in causing a rise in the rate of breast cancer in women.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-11-02.10.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80057" speakername="Mr Andy Kerr" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa1102.htm#2">

  <p>The report suggests that exposure to industrial chemicals and radiation are major causes of breast cancer. However, there is currently no compelling scientific evidence for the role of pollutants in breast-cancer risk. Evidence for a link between breast cancer and exposure to environmental pollutants is weak.</p>

  <p>Scottish Executive policy is designed to ensure that all pesticides are safe to those who use them, to consumers of the treated produce and to the environment. Monitoring programmes are run annually, including to identify residue levels of pesticides in crops, food and feeding stuffs.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive supports the overall objective of the proposed new European Union&rsquo;s Chemicals Strategy REACH (Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals), the aim of which is to protect human health and the environment. The Scottish and UK Governments want to develop a fast, efficient and workable process to test and screen chemicals and tackle those of most concern. It is hoped that the new regulatory regime will be a marked shift forward in terms of speeding up the regulation and authorisation process for new and existing chemicals.</p>

  <p>Growth hormones are not permitted for feeding to animals in Scotland. The Feeding Stuffs (Scotland) Regulations 2000 will be replaced by The Feeding Stuffs (Scotland) 2005 Regulations. The new Regulations will ban the use of antibiotic growth promoters in Scotland from 1 January 2006.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will include in the draft Crofting Reform Bill a provision such as that contained in Schedule l of the current Crofters Scotland Act 1993 which provides that &quot;the Secretary of State may provide the services of such officers and servants as the Commission may require&quot; and what its intentions are in respect of the future of its staff currently seconded to the Crofters Commission.</p>

  <p>No. The changes proposed in the draft Crofting Reform Bill will empower the Crofters Commission to employ its own staff. It is not possible to include a provision such as the one suggested as it would have the effect of fettering the new commission in relation to staffing matters. Ministers have already made a commitment that, should the new commission wish to make arrangements for existing staff to remain on secondment, it would be open to them to do so. I expect that the existing staff will be offered posts in the new organisation on terms and conditions at least as good as those they currently enjoy. Those staff based at the commission who do not accept an appointment with the new body will remain Scottish Executive staff and we will endeavour to find posts for them elsewhere within the Scottish Executive or in other parts of the civil service.</p>

  <p>No routine statistical information is collected centrally on the number of people with age-related macular degeneration, nor, of those, who would benefit from photodynamic therapy treatment (PDT). The necessary treatment facilities in Scotland are, however, fully operational. There are five of these operational facilities located at North Glasgow, South Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dundee and Edinburgh. NHS boards are giving priority to ensuring that those who require PDT receive it and to implementing the appropriate clinical patient pathways. This will ensure that National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) advice endorsed by NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS) is fully implemented. This treatment is currently provided for people with classic with no occult subfoveal choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) in accordance with the NICE guidance endorsed by NHS QIS.

  <p>For the first time, allergy was recognised by the Specialist Training Authority as constituting a related but distinct specialty in 1999. The effects of specialist training in this discipline will take time to be fully reflected in NHS provision.</p>

  <p>Training in the assessment and treatment of allergic reactions forms part of general undergraduate medical education and is also a component of a number of general medical specialties. Allergy and the management of anaphylaxis is also normally discussed with GPs during training. All doctors in NHSScotland will have a certain level of knowledge in this area.

  <p>The European Commission&rsquo;s proposals for a European Institute for Technology (EIT) should offer some helpful opportunities for the Scottish higher education sector. The proposals are at a very early stage of development. The Commission&rsquo;s public consultation document presents a very wide range of options for the possible mission, structure and priorities for an EIT. The Executive is working with the UK Government on developing a response to this consultation. The Executive will continue to work with the higher education sector and other stakeholders to ensure that Scotland contributes to the development of the EIT, and is able to take best advantage of the opportunities that it may offer.</p>

  <p>Of the 22 recommendations, most are for NHS 24 and the area NHS boards to progress, while some are for the health department. Work on a number of them has already begun. I expect the recommendations to be taken forward in partnership wherever that is appropriate and I also expect them to be delivered within the deadlines where these have been set. Progress will be monitored closely and shall be reported to me on a quarterly basis.</p>

  <p>The priority for NHS 24 and all area NHS boards at the moment is to develop robust plans to deal with the expected winter demands on out-of-hours services. This addresses the first recommendation in the report.</p>

  <p>Note: Individual patients may have more than one hip replacement procedure recorded during an episode in hospital.

This information was requested from the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) who advised that they are unable to provide numbers based on country of origin. The NMC regard this information as irrelevant as an international nurse either meets the NMC standards or not and there should be no discrimination for selection for an overseas nurses programme (ONP) based upon country of origin.</p>

  <p>Securing the conservation and enhancement of, and fostering understanding and facilitating enjoyment of, the natural heritage of Scotland. Scottish Natural Heritage also has to have regard to the desirability of ensuring that anything done in relation to the natural heritage is undertaken in a manner which is sustainable.</p>

  <p>Scottish Natural Heritage is an open organisation. Its board meetings are held in public and its board papers are generally available. Information on progress against targets and objectives is available through SNH&rsquo;s annual reports starting in 1992-93.</p>

  <p>The regulation and safety of medicines is reserved and is the responsibility of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The MHRA has advised that there are currently 102 vaccines licensed in the UK of these 20 contain thiomersal or sodium thimerfonate. Seven vaccines (Anthrax Vaccine, Ad DTP, Act-HIB DTP, Behring Ad T, Behring Ad DT, Evans Ad T, Tritanrix Hep B) contain preservative levels, and 13 vaccines (Tetravac, Pentavac, Fluarix, Engerix B, Fluvirin, Inactivated Flu, Twinrix Adult, Twinrix Paediatric, Infanrix Hexa, Infanrix Penta, Ambirix, Fendrix and Quintanrix) contain residual traces from the manufacturing process.</p>

  <p>None of the vaccines are used in the current childhood immunisation programme.</p>

  <p>The product information for these products clearly states that thiomersal or sodium thimerfonate is present in the vaccine.</p>

  <p>Information about the work of the MHRA, including its licensing procedures, can be found at: <a href="http://www.mhra.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.mhra.gov.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is in regular contact with the UK Government on a wide range of issues, including the implications for devolved matters in Scotland of its legislative programme. This contact reflects the approach, set out in Devolution Guidance Note 1 in accordance with the principles set out in the Memorandum of Understanding, that the administrations normally consult each other from an early stage on the development of relevant legislative proposals.</p>
