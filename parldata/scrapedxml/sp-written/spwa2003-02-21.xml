  <p>The Close the Gap Campaign is the main initiative supported by the Scottish Executive that focuses on raising awareness of the gender pay gap and to take steps to address it. For further information about the campaign, I refer the member to the answer given to question S1W-33512 today. More widely, the Scottish Executive is committed to mainstreaming equal opportunities in all its policies and legislation. Many of the Scottish Executive&#146;s policies relating to education, training and economic development include reducing the barriers to women getting into work, being promoted at work or starting and maintaining a successful business.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what procedures were in place at the time of construction in order to identify construction defects such as those now identified as affecting housing in Ainslie Road and Maclehose Road, Cumbernauld; who had responsibility for ensuring that any such procedures were followed, and why the defects were not identified and prevented at the time of construction.</p>

  <p>The underlying construction methods used in the flats at Ainslie Road and Maclehose Road were regarded at the time of the construction of the flats as accepted practice. The building of these properties would have been subject to the standards and inspection processes required by the local byelaws or the building regulations as they applied at the time.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the current position is regarding reviewing the availability of grants under section 54 of the Housing Act 1988 that are presently paid to registered social landlords in order to mitigate their liability for corporation tax.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mr Bob Millar, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>A working group was established to review the impact of the withdrawal of tax relief grants. The working group&#146;s recommendation has been accepted that Registered Social Landlords (RSLs) will continue to be in receipt of tax relief grant and be able to claim 75%, 50% and 25% of their tax liability during the RSL financial years completing March 2003, 2004 and 2005 respectively. There will be an additional safeguard during the phasing out period whereby RSLs will be able to claim up to &#163;100,000 if this is greater than these amounts. There is an expectation that the grant scheme will cease at the end of 2005.</p>

  <p>As set out in the white paper, <i>Towards a Healthier Scotland</i> which is available in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 3036), the aim of tackling health inequalities is being pursued through the contributions of an extensive range of social, economic and health programmes. Consequently, there is no discrete health inequalities funding programme for which figures can be given.</p>

  <p>Scotland&#146;s unique heritage is a proven attraction for visitors to this country, and the 400th anniversary of the Union of the Crowns is a significant date in Scotland&#146;s rich cultural and political history. We expect that the wide range of events planned to commemorate the Union will attract more people to experience Scotland for themselves.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive <a name="QuestionText">what fees are being paid to members of the advisory group that is assisting it in devising events and a strategy for commemorating the 400th anniversary of the Union of the Crowns; what criteria were used to appoint the group; who appointed the members; to which minister the group will report and in what way, and whether these arrangements conform with the Nolan Committee's principles on public appointments.</a></p>

  <p>No fees are being paid to members of the advisory group, which consists of senior representatives of those organisations known to be involved in events to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the Union of the Crowns. I invited the members of the group to participate, and they will report to the First Minister and me through the Executive.</p>

  <p>Because of the short-term nature of the group and its purely advisory role, the Union of the Crown&#146;s advisory group does not come within the scope of the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments.</p>
