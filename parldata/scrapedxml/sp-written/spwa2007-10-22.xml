  <p>No specific action is being taken by the Scottish Executive to monitor the waiting times for educational support for children with autism.</p>

  <p>However, under the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 (the act), education authorities are required to identify and then make adequate and efficient provision for the additional support needs of children and young people, including those with an autism spectrum disorder.</p>

  <p>The act introduced statutory timescales to which education authorities and appropriate agencies must adhere. In instances where an education authority and/or appropriate agency is in breach of these timescales, a parent has the right to utilise the new dispute resolution mechanisms such as mediation, independent adjudication or, in certain circumstances, the Additional Support Needs Tribunal for Scotland.</p>

  <p>It is for local authorities to decide how incidents of bullying should be monitored and recorded.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to preventing and tackling bullying whenever and wherever it arises, regardless of the motivation. To support this commitment a national anti-bullying service, Respect<em>me</em> has been established. Respect<em>me </em>provides advice, information, support and training to local authorities and schools in all aspects of anti-bullying from promotion of positive ethos to dealing effectively with incidents of bullying of all kinds.</p>

  <p>On 31 October 2006, HM Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) published their report on <em>Education for Pupils with Autism Spectrum Disorders</em> . This report (commissioned at the request of the Scottish ministers) evaluated and reported on the educational provision for pupils with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in Scotland and was issued to all education authorities.</p>

  <p>In light of both the HMIE report and the National Autistic Society (NAS) Scotland&rsquo;s &quot;make school make sense&quot; report, the Scottish Executive created an Autism Spectrum Disorder Education Working Group to take forward the recommendations in both reports. The intended outcome of this group is to produce a resource pack/tool kit for education authorities (EAs) which will include: strategic planning for future service provision; guidance on the information EAs should be publishing for parents, and guidance to schools.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is funding a pioneering new project at Aberdeen University, providing &pound;1.39 million over 2005-10, to embed inclusive approaches to teaching for pupils with additional support needs, including ASD, within initial teacher education. The findings and best practice from this project will be disseminated to other initial teacher education providers.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government also provides education authorities with &pound;7.2 million per year specifically for the training and development of staff working with pupils with additional support needs. A further &pound;13.5 million is issued annually to allow local authorities to co-ordinate and provide Continuing Professional Development (CPD) for teachers.</p>

  <p>The decision to exclude pupils from schools lies with head teachers and education authorities and is taken on an individual basis in light of the circumstances of the case. The Scottish Government supports this local decision-making to exclude where necessary as a last resort and within a consistently applied behavioural policy. A range of approaches to make sure all pupils engage with and benefit from the curriculum and to promote positive behaviour in schools, contributes to preventing and supporting reductions in exclusions for all pupils.</p>

  <p>*Part Year figures for 2003-04.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Legal Aid Board grants legal aid where an application passes both merits and means tests. If the assisted person subsequently informs the board that they no longer wish to proceed, or if they fail to pay their first contribution installment, the grant of legal aid will be terminated. Prior to October 2003, where the applicant was assessed as eligible but required to make a contribution, an offer of legal aid would be made before it was formally granted. If the applicant did not respond to the offer, no grant of legal aid would be made.</p>

  <p>The board is not usually given a reason for the non-payment of the installment or for the applicant choosing not to proceed. A survey by the board in 2001 of those who turned down offers of legal aid suggested a number of reasons for this, including inability to pay, the matter having resolved itself or the applicant having decided to pay their solicitor privately. The board has since increased the period over which contribution installments can be paid which should improve affordability.</p>

  <p>Caution should be exercised when comparing the data for the years in question, particularly in relation to cases that did not proceed (the figures for 2003-04 relate only to the period after the change in procedure in October 2003). The board also improved the way it records information about applications for and grants of legal aid in 2005. In addition to recording more specific categories of cases, the board also now records both the primary crave and any ancillary craves for which legal aid is sought. The data for the period before 2005 only covers the primary crave.</p>

  <p>Under the terms of the agreements between CalMac Ferries Ltd (CFL) and Caledonian Maritime Assets Ltd (CMAL), relating to the delivery of the Clyde and Hebrides Ferry Services (CHFS) contract, CFL has paid CMAL, since the start of the contract on 1 October 2007, a harbour access fee of &pound;125,160 per month for access to the CMAL owned harbours required to operate the services. This represents an increase from the pre-October figure of &pound;110,583.33 that was quoted in the reply to S3W-3346. From now on, the figure is subject to a Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation adjustment each year on the anniversary of the start of the CHFS contract.</p>

  <p>As a further part of the agreements, CMAL pays &pound;117,000 per month to CFL to meet the costs of harbour maintenance. This figure is also subject to an annual increase.</p>

  <p>CFL carry out harbour operations on behalf of CMAL at CMAL owned harbours as part of the CHFS contract. This activity is funded from CFL&rsquo;s revenue and the block subsidy paid by the Scottish Government.</p>

  <p>NHS Scotland wheelchair services are provided from five regional centres and independent report <em>Moving forward: Review of NHS wheelchair and seating services in Scotland</em> published in 2006 reports some 96,000 users registered with these centres in 2005: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/127201/0030495.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/127201/0030495.pdf</a> .</p>

  <p>This will include users living in communal establishments, such as nursing homes, and people with differing levels of use, from complete dependency to very occasional use. However, there is wide variation between the figures reported by individual centres in the number of registered users per head of population. This is in part due to regional differences in identifying and recording the more &quot;active&quot; users as distinct from &quot;registered&quot; users. In addition, a number of users obtain services from private providers rather than the NHS. Such users will not be included in the figures provided by the regional centres.</p>

  <p>There is no direct estimate of the number of wheelchair users living in social rented accommodation. The Scottish Household Survey gives an indication of the tenure of respondents in private households who use wheelchairs. The most recent data available for 2005 and 2006 show some 46% of wheelchair users were living in social rented accommodation, representing about 2% of respondents in the sector (data from two years have been combined due to small base numbers).</p>

  <p>Changes in building regulations over the past few years have lead to increased accessibility of the more recent mainstream new build, particularly in the social sector, resulting in higher levels of barrier-free housing which can more readily be adapted to meet the particular needs of wheelchair users.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Communities Scotland has no plans to inspect Wishaw and District Housing Association in the near future. The risk based approach to regulation and inspection which was introduced in 2006-07 means that cyclical inspections are no longer programmed. The association will be reviewed from time to time along with all other registered social landlords, to monitor for any changes required to the level of regulatory engagement.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. Her response is as follows.</p>

  <p>Communities Scotland provides Housing Association Grant to Registered Social Landlords (RSL) to provide affordable housing. Over the past three financial years 17 RSLs which are constituted as housing co-operatives have received funding from Communities Scotland (or from City of Edinburgh Council and Glasgow City Council where the Transfer of Management of Development Funding has occurred).</p>

  <p>In 2004-05 grants totalling &pound;8.603 million were provided to housing co-operatives, in 2005-06 grants totalling &pound;19.080 million were provided, in 2006-07 grants totalling &pound;12.380 million were provided and in 2007-08 Communities Scotland has allocated grant funding of &pound;11.293 million to housing co-operatives for delivery of affordable housing.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. Her response is as follows.</p>

  <p>All of the local authorities that have submitted standard delivery plans (SDPs) outlining how they will reach the Scottish Housing Quality Standard have indicated that they are able to achieve the Standard by the end of 2015. As part of achieving the standard, councils can apply for exemptions from certain energy efficiency criteria where these are not technically feasible or involve disproportionate cost.</p>

  <p>South Ayrshire Council and Orkney Islands Council have received exemptions for 133 and 99 homes respectively. Highland Council is seeking exemptions for 4,250 homes but this is still being assessed along with other aspects of the council&rsquo;s SDP by Communities Scotland. Edinburgh, West Dunbartonshire, Renfrewshire and Stirling Councils are still working to complete their SDPs.</p>

  <p>The designation of land for a particular type of development in a development plan, or the granting of planning permission for a specific development proposal on said land does not compel anyone to carry out the development. For example, as planning permission runs with the land, the owner of a piece of disused land could assert his or her rights as owner and prevent anyone from carrying out development despite having obtained planning permission.</p>

  <p>This sort of &quot;earmarking&quot; does not last indefinitely. Planning permissions are time limited in the sense that the permission will lapse unless development has begun by a date specified in the permission. The designation of land in a development plan may also change if the plan is amended or when it is eventually replaced.</p>

  <p>There is already evidence that a healthier diet leads to longer term health benefits. The evaluation of our free school meals trial for primary 1 to primary 3 pupils will investigate the impact on the uptake of school lunches by all pupils together with providing an assessment of any changes in attitudes and behaviours in relation to healthy eating both at home and at school.</p>

  <p>Yes. Our first priority is to conduct the free school meals trial for primary 1 to primary 3 pupils in five local authorities from October until the end of March next year. In the future we would like to extend entitlement for free school meals to families in receipt of maximum child tax credit and maximum working tax credit, although this will depend on forthcoming discussions with COSLA about outcome agreements.</p>

  <p>Each local authority has a statutory responsibility to provide and maintain their own school buildings. The replacement of Wick High School, therefore, is a matter for Highland Council as is any other school proposal within the council&rsquo;s authority and control. There are several procurement options open to public sector procuring bodies and it is their responsibility to assess which is most appropriate for any investment they are undertaking.</p>

  <p>As regards the Scottish Futures Trust, work on the design aspects is underway, and we believe it will be able to deliver better value arrangements for major public infrastructure projects. We will make an announcement with further details in due course.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Law Commission is expected to issue its final report on its Review of Rape and Sexual Offences soon. In this review the commission has considered, among other issues, the law of evidence and whether juries should be allowed to hear about previous convictions of accused persons charged with sexual crimes.</p>

  <p>The commission&rsquo;s discussion paper, issued for consultation in January 2006, made the following preliminary proposal in relation to these issues: &quot;Any consideration of the law relating to evidence of the character of a person accused of a sexual offence should be conducted as part of a wider review of the law of evidence.&quot;</p>

  <p>Converting one of the two proposed bored tunnels from road to light rail would raise the capacity issue of reducing the crossing to a single lane for general traffic in either direction.</p>

  <p>Therefore, no costing has been produced.</p>

  <p>The tunnel options under consideration do not satisfy the gradients required for heavy rail to be incorporated, either during construction or at a later stage. As such, we have not estimated the costs of converting one of the two bored tunnels from road use to heavy rail during the lifetime of the new Forth crossing.</p>
