<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-09-04.S3W-26426.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80396" speakername="Nicola Sturgeon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa0904.htm#1">

  <p>As Zometa&reg; (Zoledronic Acid) is not recommended for use in the treatment of prostate cancer by the Scottish Medicines Consortium, it is not routinely prescribed to Scottish patients. As such, information regarding the prescription of Zometa to Scottish prostate cancer patients is not collected centrally.</p>

  <p>The prescribing of particular medicines is however a matter for NHS boards. All NHS boards and their Area Drugs and Therapeutics Committees (ADTCs) have processes for the consideration of SMC and NHS QIS &quot;not recommended&quot; medicines in accordance with clinical judgement, based on clinical skills and knowledge, the circumstances of the patient, national advice and local priorities&rsquo;. Evidence suggests that Zometa is being prescribed to individual patients, for secondary conditions relating to their initial prostate cancer diagnosis.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-26462 on 4 September 2009. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="../../../Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx</a> .</p>

  <p>In addition, the consultation on revising our Diabetes Action Plan 2006, which closed on 22 August, specifically sought responses on how to tackle the health inequalities associated with diabetes, and included a section on minority ethnic issues and the relationship between poverty and incidence of diabetes.</p>

  <p>Our revised Diabetes Action Plan will draw on these responses and the work of the Scottish Diabetes Group&rsquo;s Diabetes Minority Ethnic Group to identify the actions needed to support people most at risk of developing diabetes, including those from minority ethnic communities. Publication of the new action plan is expected in November of this year.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The information for this question has been extracted from the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service&rsquo;s Case Management Database. The database is a live, operational database used to manage the processing of reports submitted to procurators fiscal by the police and other reporting agencies. If a Procurator Fiscal amends a charge submitted by a reporting agency the database will record details only of the amended charge.</p>

  <p>2. The database is charge-based. The figures quoted therefore relate to the number of charges rather than the number of individuals charged or the number of incidents that gave rise to such charges.</p>

  <p>As our report <em>Equally Well</em> makes clear, the Scottish Government is strongly committed to tackling health inequalities.</p>

  <p>Our <em>Better Heart Disease and Stroke Care Action Plan</em>, which we published in June this year, describes the actions required to reduce the health inequalities associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD), which we define as including Coronary Heart Disease(CHD), stroke and diabetes. These include promoting the use of ASSIGN as the CVD risk prediction tool best suited to Scottish circumstances because it includes deprivation as a factor. We also have the NHS National Performance Framework indicator &lsquo;to reduce mortality from CHD among under 75s in deprived areas&rsquo;.</p>

  <p><em>Keep Well</em> is a programme of anticipatory care that operates within Scotland&rsquo;s most deprived communities, identifying those aged between 45 and 64 at greatest risk of developing cardiovascular disease, and then delivering appropriate life style advice and clinical interventions where appropriate. Over 50,000 people have completed a<em> Keep Well</em> assessment since 2007. The <em>Well North</em> programme replicates that approach in remote and rural areas.</p>

  <p>As the mechanisms for targeting and engaging with &quot;at risk&quot; populations become more refined, NHS boards are expected to broaden their focus to include other key groups that are vulnerable to premature mortality from CVD, such as the South Asian community and offenders. The action plan contains actions designed specifically to promote culturally sensitive approaches to tackling CVD within the South Asian community.</p>

  <p>The public inquiry into the outbreak of C difficile at the Vale of Leven hospital will be set up on 1 October 2009. The Right Honourable Lord MacLean has been appointed to chair this Inquiry, to be known as the Vale of Leven Hospital Inquiry, and the Instrument of Appointment (Bib. number 48497) and Terms of Reference (Bib. number 48495) have been placed in the Scottish Parliaments Information Centre (SPICe) today. I do not intend to appoint additional panel members. However, Lord MacLean has indicated that he wishes to appoint one or more assessors to assist him during the Inquiry.</p>

  <p>It is for Lord MacLean to conduct the inquiry independently. The purpose of this inquiry is to investigate this matter thoroughly, and the necessary resources to do so will be provided to the Inquiry from the Health budget. The Inquiries Act 2005 requires that unnecessary costs be avoided and the Scottish Government will monitor the progress and costs of the Inquiry.</p>

  <p>The advice I received on 14 August has been published and is available at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/lockerbie">www.scotland.gov.uk/lockerbie</a> .</p>

  <p>I considered alternative conditions concerning place of residence, travel restrictions, remote contact with the supervising officer, medical reports and additional supervision. The parole board recommended that the mandatory life licence conditions would be sufficient in this case.</p>

  <p>No, ministers did not so agree, and the licence does not contain such a condition. The frequency and nature of supervision will be determined by the supervising officer. The licence requires Mr Megrahi to provide his supervising officer with a report on his medical condition on a monthly basis, but that is a separate matter from the frequency of the supervision.</p>

  <p>The licence contains residence and travel restrictions, but these do not amount to house arrest. A condition amounting to detention would be incompatible with a licence providing for compassionate release.</p>

As set out in my statement on 20 August, I was provided with reports and recommendations by the Governor of Greenock Prison, the doctors and prison social work staff.

  <p>As I explained to Parliament on 24 August, it has been suggested that Mr Megrahi could have been released from prison to reside elsewhere in Scotland. Clear advice from the Deputy Chief Constable of Strathclyde Police was that the security implications of such a move would be severe. A minimum of 48 officers would be required simply to allow Mr Megrahi to live in Scotland. I therefore ruled that out as an option. The advice has been published and is available at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/lockerbie" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/lockerbie</a> .</p>

  <p>As I explained in my statement on 20 August, the advice on which I based my decision was contained in a report dated 10 August from the Director of Health and Care for the Scottish Prison Service.</p>

  <p>He had access to and reviewed all the information about Mr Megrahi&rsquo;s medical records. The latest assessment of Mr Megrahi&rsquo;s condition was conducted by the Scottish Prison Service primary care physician treating him, in close consultation with a highly experienced NHS consultant oncologist of many years experience &ndash; both of whom have dealt with Mr Megrahi&rsquo;s case since the earliest stages following the diagnosis of metastatic prostate cancer. It was assessed that Mr Megrahi&rsquo;s clinical condition had declined significantly during the week 26 July to 3 August.</p>

  <p>It was the conclusion of the report submitted by the Scottish Prison Service Director of Health and Care, in light of all the medical information, and having reviewed the contributions of all of the clinicians involved in Mr Megrahi&rsquo;s case, that: &quot;the clinical assessment is that a three month prognosis is now a reasonable estimate for this patient.&quot; This view is based upon an analysis of all of the views expressed and the consensus of the medical experts that the condition of Mr Megrahi was now entering its final stages.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it agrees that under all existing prisoner transfer agreements to which the United Kingdom is a party, once a prisoner is advised of the Government&rsquo;s intention to transfer, the prisoner should be &quot;invited to make written representations&quot; which should then be taken into account when determining whether or not the transfer should proceed.</p>

  <p>No. Previous Prisoner Transfer Agreements (PTAs) required the consent of the prisoner, and that was reflected in the terms of the Repatriation of Prisoners Act 1984. The PTA agreed between the UK and Libyan Governments is the first bilateral PTA which does not require the prisoner&rsquo;s consent. The Additional Protocol to the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons, which comes into force in November, also removes the requirement for the prisoner&rsquo;s consent in certain circumstances. In preparation for that Protocol, amendments were made to the Repatriation of Prisoners Act 1984 by the Police and Justice Act 2006, and these were extended to Scotland, with the consent of the Scottish Parliament, by the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008.</p>

  <p>No. One of the criteria set out in the Prisoner Transfer Agreement between the United Kingdom and Libya is that &quot;the judgement is final and no other criminal proceedings are pending&quot;. An on-going appeal does not, however, prevent an application being considered to establish whether the other criteria are met.</p>

  <p>I have no information on this matter. Mr Megrahi submitted an application for compassionate release in July. Any decision by him to send home or otherwise distribute personal belongings is a matter for him. Prisoners are at liberty to send belongings home if they wish, and many do. It is also quite common for prisoners who have appeals etc. to also send belongings home anticipating a successful outcome. If prisoners request to send belongings home they would normally be allowed to do so.</p>

  <p>The Public Contracts Scotland website was launched in October 2008 as a free-to-use one stop shop for public bodies to advertise public sector tender opportunities and for suppliers to register their interests and receive free e-mail alerts whenever advertisements which may be of interest, are posted. Significant progress has been made to encourage its use and all contract opportunities for contracts to be awarded by the government, its agencies and local authorities and which are above the financial thresholds set out in the Public Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2006 (currently &pound;90,319 or &pound;139,893 depending upon the status of the public body) are published on the website.</p>

  <p>In addition, 123 organisations, including the government, 18 of its agencies and non-departmental public bodies&rsquo;, and 25 local authorities have advertised contract opportunities on the website where the value of the contract is below these financial thresholds. The Public Procurement Reform Board, in which I chair, has stated that all public bodies should aim to advertise contracts with a value of &pound;50,000 or more on the Public Contracts Scotland website. Since its launch 4,867 contract opportunities have been advertised.</p>

  <p>Dover House is operated by the Scotland Office, and the Scottish Government pays a percentage share of the overall running costs incurred by the Scotland Office in relation to Dover House. The percentage is based on the proportion of floor area of the rooms that is allocated to the Scottish Government against the total running cost for the building. For 2008-09 this equated to &pound;201,871.</p>

  <p>Funding for the Scotland Office is provided from the total Departmental Expenditure Limit (DEL) for Scotland. Scotland Office costs therefore have first call on Scotland&rsquo;s block budget from Westminster. In 2009-10, the Scotland Office&rsquo;s total budget is &pound;7.5 million, out of the total DEL for Scotland of &pound;29,141 million.</p>

  <p>Officials from across the Scottish Government make use of Dover House facilities. In addition, a breakdown of the number of times the facilities have been used by those named in your question is listed in the following table:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to working with a range of partners to tackle gang violence in our communities. We are investing &pound;1.6 million in the Community Initiative to Reduce Violence project in the East End of Glasgow, which will engage with over 500 gang members between 2008 and 2010. In addition, in 2008, we invested &pound;200,000 in a Collective Violence initiative, which funded 19 projects across Scotland. We are also working with local communities in every local authority area to provide diversionary and educational opportunities for young people through the CashBack for Communities scheme. We have committed to reinvest &pound;13 million of the proceeds of crime into the CashBack programme, and so far over 100,000 young people have benefitted. Through programmes like this we will help keep our young people away from gangs.</p>
