  <p>Provision for the introduction of &quot;green&quot; certificates is made in the Utilities Bill, which is currently in its Committee stage in the House of Commons. Under the proposed renewables obligation, trade in them is expected to take place between renewable electricity generators and electricity suppliers. It is envisaged that a market will begin to operate at UK level, but since the Government will not be involved in these transactions, which will be between companies, no revenues will accrue to Government. It is likely, however, that revenues from renewable generation in Scotland will represent an important source of income for Scottish renewable projects.</p>

  <p>Works to improve home insulation may well help to reduce the number of excess winter deaths, hence the Warm Deal, the biggest package of home insulation measures ever available in Scotland - a total of approximately &pound;39 million over the next three years. This can lead to savings in fuel bills of up to &pound;170 per year. 100,000 households will benefit from the Warm Deal during the lifetime of this administration.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to give a precise answer. Even during a major influenza outbreak, the underlying cause of death is rarely classified as influenza, and doctors do not often mention influenza on the certificate of cause of death. Provisional returns for the three months December 1999 to February 2000 show that influenza was mentioned in only 161 cases. It is known that deaths from a number of other causes, notably pneumonia and other respiratory conditions, increase significantly during a period of high influenza activity. However, there is no standard method of associating a proportion of these extra deaths with influenza activity.</p>

  <p>The Scottish dietary targets were set in 1994. Their continuing relevance was confirmed in the White Paper, <i>Towards a Healthier Scotland</i> , published in February 1999 and endorsed by the Scottish Parliament the following September.</p>

  <p>The Health Education Board for Scotland, as the national agency for health education in Scotland, is at the forefront of the Scottish Executive&#8217;s drive to improve Scotland&#8217;s diet and to increase public awareness of the benefits to health of a balanced diet.</p>

  <p>Healthy eating is a key component of the board&#8217;s high profile &quot;Big 3&quot; adult mass media campaign, targeting Scotland&#8217;s three major killer diseases, coronary heart disease, cancer and stroke. Other board initiatives, such as its work with Health Promoting and New Community Schools and its introduction of a Cyberschool, are providing effective mechanisms for the promotion of healthy eating specifically to children and young people. Increasing use of IT is being made by the board to deliver health education messages to both the public and to professionals.</p>

  <p>National activity is complemented, at local level, by the wide range of innovative work being undertaken by health boards, NHS Trusts and primary care teams.</p>

The board&#8217;s 1997 survey, published last year, indicated that the majority of the population were aware of the importance of healthy eating, with 83% of those interviewed having attempted to make changes to their diet in the past year.</p>

  <p>I have recently agreed with the Scottish Law Commission a <i>Sixth</i> <i>Programme of Law Reform</i> . This was presented to the Parliament today and will be published tomorrow. Copies have been placed in SPICe. The new Programme, which supersedes and consolidates the existing five Programmes, describes the short, medium and long term projects on which the Commission will be working between now and the end of 2004. Timetables are set for the short and medium term projects.</p>

  <p>The centrepiece of the projects in the Sixth Programme remains the Commission&#8217;s work on property including conversion of some categories of long lease to ownership, land registration and general consolidation of conveyancing legislation. Other matters on which recommendations are expected before the end of 2004 include irritancies, judicial factors and Trusts. The Commission&#8217;s work on diligence is also expected to be completed.</p>

  <p>The Government welcomes this Programme, which concentrates on a number of important and timely law reform projects. The fixing of priorities and timetables will help all of those with an interest in law reform to keep track of and prepare for changes in the law which the Commission might recommend.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Law Commission has a general remit to keep under review, for the purpose of reform and consolidation, the law of Scotland. In addition to the Programmes of Law Reform agreed from time to time with Ministers, the Commission also receives references on specific issues and provides other advice on specific areas of the law.</p>

  <p>The formal designation of Marine Environmental High Risk Areas (MEHRAs) will be a matter for the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR), taking account of both the risk of pollution from shipping and coastal environmental sensitivity.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive will be involved in the discussions leading to the identification and establishment of such areas in waters adjacent to Scotland. An initial study commissioned by the DETR to identify potential MEHRAs has already identified the area of the Minches as having a very high environmental sensitivity.</p>

  <p>It is for health boards, NHS Trusts and GPs to determine which of their records they retain for clinical or research purposes in line with the guidance that was issued to the NHS on 1 December 1993.

  <p>The Framework for Mental Health Services, launched in 1997, emphasises the need for all care agencies to publicise and improve the profile of mental health services in the community. Health boards - often working in partnership with Trusts, primary care agencies and local communities - undertake a range of local health promotion initiatives aimed at raising awareness of mental health issues, including stigma.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the Health Education Board for Scotland promotes the reduction of stigma through their support of Scottish Mental Health Week and in the Think About It campaign aimed at young people.</p>

  <p>All the comments made on the draft National Parks (Scotland) Bill are currently being considered.</p>

  <p>We recognise the importance of communities and local residents in the running of the National Parks they live in. The draft Bill sets out the aims of National Parks at section 1(3) and the conditions for a National Park proposal at section 1(2). These encompass the interests of residents and communities, as well as many other interests, without specifying them all by name. Section 30 is for definition of terms and is not the appropriate place for setting out community involvement.</p>

  <p>The powers and responsibilities of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) are kept under continual review to take account of new and proposed duties arising from European and domestic legislation. In accordance with normal arrangements for non-departmental public bodies, the Scottish Executive proposes to carry out a five-year review of SEPA either later this year or during 2001. The scope of this review, and whether it will extend specifically to SEPA&#8217;s powers and responsibilities, has yet to be decided. The Scottish Executive is also considering how to take forward a review of the possible rationalisation of the regulatory mechanisms under which SEPA operates, in response to a recommendation by the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency&#8217;s (SEPA&#8217;s) operating arrangements are set out in a formal Management Statement agreed with the Scottish Executive. This records how SEPA is held to account, through a structure of planning, reporting and performance review, to the Scottish Ministers and through them to the Scottish Parliament. The Management Statement is due to be reviewed as part of a five-year review of SEPA by the Scottish Executive later this year or in 2001.</p>

  <p>SEPA reports annually on its activities, plans and performance through its Corporate Plan, Annual Report and audited accounts. These reports, which are published, are reviewed by, and agreed with, the Scottish Executive each year. SEPA is also committed to being accessible and responsive to stakeholders, to explaining the reasons for its work and to publishing information on its activities and on the state of the environment. SEPA also publishes a quarterly magazine about its activities and operates a comprehensive website which receives over one million visits each year. Its board meetings are held in public.</p>

  <p>Central records are not maintained of all grant schemes which Volvo may have been eligible to apply for. However, the principal form of government grant assistance made available to industry is Regional Selective Assistance. In 1994 Volvo was offered Regional Selective Assistance amounting to &pound;1,400,000 to help expand production capacity at Irvine. Having met initial targets set out in the offer of grant Volvo was paid &pound;620,000. Following the announcement of the closure of Volvo&#8217;s Irvine plant the grant was repaid in full.</p>

  <p>Volvo therefore has no outstanding obligations under the Regional Selective Assistance Scheme.</p>

  <p>The forthcoming EC Water Framework Directive is currently under negotiation. Its possible effects on industry, including the Scotch whisky industry, could include tighter controls on some waste-water discharges. The draft Directive would also require a system of controls on the abstraction and impoundment of water. The Scottish Executive will consult extensively on its proposals for implementing the Directive.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is fully involved in the development of the UK&#8217;s negotiating position on the draft Directive.</p>
