  <p>A report on serious fraud was published on 13 May 2008 by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMICS). The report made a number of recommendations aimed at improving how the police work with their partners to tackle serious fraud, which can include cases of identity theft.</p>

  <p>One of the report&rsquo;s recommendations was that &quot;the Scottish Government consult with stakeholders, including the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service and the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland (ACPOS), to make certain that legislation, process and interventions relating to fraud in Scotland are no less comprehensive or robust than they are elsewhere in the UK&quot;.</p>

  <p>An ACPOS-led Working Group, which will include representatives of the Scottish Government, is being established to take forward all of the report&rsquo;s recommendations.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for the overall provision of NHS general dental services in the area rests with NHS Lanarkshire. NHS Lanarkshire is aware that there are problems with access to NHS dental services in the area and the board has been working with dental practitioners to try and increase provision.</p>

  <p>NHS Lanarkshire has provisionally been allocated &pound;6.47 million of the &pound;75 million being invested in Scotland under the Primary and Community Care Modernisation Programme over the two years 2009-10 and 2010-11. A priority for the funding is the development of new dental centres for independent general dental practitioners working in the NHS.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has introduced a number of financial measures to improve access to NHS dental services, including grants under the Scottish Dental Access Initiative for dentists wishing to establish new or expand existing NHS dental practices.</p>

  <p>NHS boards have also been given the authority to appoint salaried dentists where this is the best solution to meet local needs.</p>

  <p>As Scottish Women&rsquo;s Aid themselves state, the single outcome agreements (SOAs) are new for both national and local government and this is a process still in development. The next stage of SOA development will ensure the full involvement of community planning partners, which should in turn assist with the engagement of violence against women multi-agency partnerships in the process of identifying local priorities.</p>

  <p>Public bodies are subject to the requirements of the public sector equality duties set out in equalities legislation. It is expected therefore that councils will equality impact assess their policies and activities and have due regard to the promotion of equality and elimination of discrimination in developing SOAs and their priorities.</p>

  <p>The SOA document does not describe everything that is being undertaken by the council and community planning partners.</p>

  <p>Colleges receive block grants for teaching which are not split into funding for specific courses or assistance. For that block grant they are expected to deliver a set level of activity which is weighted to reflect the resource input required. Courses which are specifically designed for students with additional needs have the highest out of 18 weightings. In addition to this, activity for students who are not on a specialised course but who have additional support needs is also weighted to reflect the additional resource input. In 2008-09, the main teaching allocation totalled &pound;392 million.</p>

  <p>It is a condition of grant that any colleges claiming the additional weights that are allocated from the Scottish Funding Council (SFC) must complete a Personal Learning Support Plan (PLSP). This is checked and reported on through the SFC&rsquo;s audit process. The auditor also signs off the final claims for activity. The allocation of student support funds must meet the conditions of the SFC bursary policy and the use of the funds is audited.</p>

  <p>We are not aware of any reduction in undergraduate medical teaching in dermatology, and this view is borne out by NHS Education for Scotland and the British Association of Dermatologists.</p>

  <p>The introduction of Modernising Medical Careers (MMC) has provided the opportunity to develop a new and better approach to GP training. All doctors entering GP Specialist Training from 2007 have already completed a two year medical foundation training programme, and the UK Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) approved curriculum for GP Specialist Training, which doctors in training are assessed against, has a full section covering relevant issues for dermatology.</p>

  <p>We do not hold information about every NHS board&rsquo;s funding decisions following completion of a centrally funded programme during this time. However we do know that eleven out of 15 NHS boards were given time limited funding for clinical leadership and project management to test new models of service to deliver and sustain the waiting time target that by December 2005 no patient should wait longer than 26 weeks for a first out-patient appointment. This target was delivered and has been further reduced to 18 weeks from December 2007. It is for NHS boards to evaluate the success of their pilots and to mainstream the findings if they think appropriate. As at the closure of the Skin Action Scotland national programme (Dermatology) in March 2006, seven of the 11 had secured funding for 2006-07 of which five reported that this funding was recurring. &pound;270 million, &pound;90 million per year, has been made available nationally to improve waiting times during the period 2008-09 to 2010-11.</p>

  <p>Decisions about the dispersal of work to Benbecula are an operational matter for Skills Development Scotland (SDS). However, I understand that they have no plans to reduce current staffing at the centre and indeed are looking to further develop its use as part of their operating plan for 2009-10. I also understand that this information has been conveyed to SDS staff there.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to securing equal access to justice for disabled people. Through the multi-agency Justice Disability Steering Group we are working with key partners to ensure more effective engagement with disabled people. As part of this work the group is planning an event to be held next year that will involve disabled people in identifying how to improve the operation of the justice system in ways that promote better access and tackle discrimination.</p>

  <p>We are supporting the Scottish Appropriate Adults Network in raising awareness and promoting consistency in the delivery of the Appropriate Adult Scheme across the country to better meet the needs of disabled people. We will also continue to facilitate the work of the multi-agency Witness Issues Group in monitoring, reporting and evaluating the impact of the Vulnerable Witness (Scotland) Act 2004 especially with regard to providing improved opportunities for all vulnerable witnesses, including disabled people, to give their best evidence.</p>

  <p>Individual police forces are responsible for health care and forensic services in police custody. The delivery of improved healthcare and forensic services through partnership working between the police force, health board and the university is being explored through a three year pilot in Tayside which will begin in January 2009, supported by the Scottish Government.

  <p>Full assessment of the implementation of the Administration of Medicines in Schools Guidance was last carried out in 2004. Whilst the Scottish Government takes the issue of child health and welfare extremely seriously, statutory responsibility for the Administration of Medicine in Schools lies with NHS boards, supported by local education authorities. We understand that with the exception of one area of Lanarkshire, joint agreements between all other NHS boards and education authorities covering the arrangements for the administration of medicines are in place. I have asked my officials to liaise with Lanarkshire NHS board to ensure that this matter is addressed quickly, for the benefit of all children in schools with health care needs.</p>

  <p>The responsibility for the implementation of the Administration of Medicines in Schools guidance is a local issue for NHS boards to work with their education authority partners. There is no routine monitoring of the implementation of the guidance currently in place as previous surveys carried out on NHS boards and education authorities showed the guidance to be working well in practice in most areas. We have no plans to carry out further monitoring at this time.</p>
