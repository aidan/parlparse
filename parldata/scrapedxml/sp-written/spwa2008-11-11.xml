  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how it is encouraging police forces to work in partnership with local authorities, health and other agencies to establish best practice in dealing with drunk and incapable people.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government, working with the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland, the Scottish Ambulance Service and the NHS, commissioned research on drunk and incapable people in June 2008. This aims to identify the potential scale of the problem in Scotland, and to identify different models of support practised by all relevant agencies including local authorities, both in Scotland and elsewhere, to establish the key elements of successful approaches.</p>

  <p>A set of conclusions and recommendations on how best to manage people who are drunk and incapable to help alleviate the unnecessary pressure on emergency services is expected in the New Year.</p>

  <p>Robert Brown (Glasgow) (LD): To ask the Scottish Executive what funding is available for alcohol referral schemes in (a) 2008-09, (b) 2009-10 and (c) 2010-11, expressed in real terms.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government provides funding for alcohol services through NHS boards and local alcohol and drug action teams (ADATs). It is for ADATs and boards to decide which services to fund based on identified local need.</p>

  <p>&pound;24.86 million has been distributed to NHS boards in 2008-09 to fund alcohol services. Funding allocations to boards for 2009-10 and 2010-11 have not yet been finalised.</p>

  <p>Robert Brown (Glasgow) (LD): To ask the Scottish Executive what (a) percentage and (b) number of under-18s admitted to accident and emergency departments suffering from alcohol-related problems had obtained their alcohol from a parental home.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Adolescent Lifestyle and Substance Use Survey 2006 provides some information on sources of alcohol for 13 and 15-year-olds. 61% of 13-year-olds and 39% of 15-year-olds who had ever had a drink didn&rsquo;t purchase the alcohol. This suggests that it was obtained from other sources such as family and friends. Also, of those who had purchased alcohol, 22% of 13-year-olds and 29% of 15-year-olds had purchased from a friend or relative.</p>

  <p>Robert Brown (Glasgow) (LD): To ask the Scottish Executive what funding is available for alcohol-free activities for under-18s in (a) 2008-09, (b) 2009-10 and (c) 2010-11, expressed in real terms.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has provided a range of funding to support diversionary activities for young people. It is not possible to specify which of this targets only under-18s.</p>

  <p>Under the CashBack for Communities initiative we have invested &pound;11 million in a range of projects for young people delivered through partnerships with Scottish sporting, arts and business associations all of which are of course alcohol-free. We have also provided &pound;100,000 to Lloyds TSB partnership drugs initiative for alcohol misuse work.</p>

  <p>Figures for 2009-10 and 2010-11 are not available.</p>

  <p>Robert Brown (Glasgow) (LD): To ask the Scottish Executive what guidance has been given to licence holders with regard to customers buying alcohol for under-18s.</p>

  <p>Guidance is given to prospective personal licence holders as part of the training required by the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005. Before a personal licence can be granted, the applicant must possess a licensing qualification. The training which leads to the award of a qualification includes training in respect of the offences under the Act.</p>

  <p>Robert Brown (Glasgow) (LD): To ask the Scottish Executive how many individuals have been prosecuted for buying alcohol for under-18s in each year that this has been an offence and what the level of punishment was in each case.</p>

  <p><em>Building the Curriculum 3: a framework for learning and teaching</em> underlines the importance of recognising that the curriculum comprises more than subjects alone, but is also about other types of experiences such as outdoor learning, work-related activities and out of school hours learning. There is, however, no prescription since one of the intentions of Curriculum for Excellence is to provide teachers with the freedom to provide experiences in creative and imaginative ways that take account of local needs and circumstances.</p>

  <p>The draft experiences and outcomes for Curriculum for Excellence, which were published between January and June 2008 for trialling and engagement, contain a range of opportunities for schools and other educational establishments to encourage activities outwith the normal school day. For example, within health and wellbeing it is clear that the outcomes for physical activity and sport will take place in addition to planned PE sessions, at break times and lunchtimes and beyond the school day.</p>

  <p>The full set of finalised experiences and outcomes, supported by exemplification materials is due to be published in 2009.</p>

  <p>The relevant transmission licensees, in this case Scottish Power Transmission and National Grid, are responsible for liaising together to identify possible upgrades to the electricity interconnector system.</p>

  <p>A detailed technical and economic case is then submitted to the energy regulator Ofgem. Following consultation with stakeholders, Ofgem will make a decision in relation to funding of the proposed upgrade. In the event that funding is approved, then the proposed development will be progressed through planning and delivery.</p>

  <p>Scottish Power Transmission and National Grid have invested heavily since the early 1990s to upgrade the Scottish export capacity from 850MW to the current figure of 2200MW. Work is well advanced to further increase export capacity to 2800MW by 2010. Further work has been funded by Ofgem to increase the export capability to 3100MW. This involves expenditure of around &pound;250 million between National Grid and Scottish Power. This stage is scheduled for completion by 2013.</p>

  <p>The contract between Scottish ministers and NorthLink Ferries Ltd is a legally binding agreement that specifies the approved ferry services to be delivered. NorthLink cannot alter the terms and conditions of the contract or make changes to the approved ferry services without the agreement of Scottish ministers.</p>

  <p>Although the contract contains a detailed performance and deduction regime that enables financial penalties to be imposed on NorthLink in particular circumstances, it does not cover operational matters such as how many staff NorthLink should employ on particular functions or where they should be located.

  <p>The location of individual staff posts is an operational matter for NorthLink to consider. In circumstances where changes resulted in NorthLink buying in services from a sister company, or any other company, it would be for NorthLink to agree appropriate commercial terms with the supplier of those services. Indeed, we understand that NorthLink already buys in work from other companies, including some from those within the David MacBrayne Ltd Group, on a commercial basis and that the contracts concerned ensure that the full costs are charged in all cases.</p>

  <p>Accordingly, the restructuring of financial processing functions within the Group would have no implications for the openness and transparency of the Northern Isles ferry contract with NorthLink Ferries Ltd.</p>

  <p>Bidders for future ferry contracts would need to make their own decisions on the number and location of staff they felt would be required to deliver the services being tendered. In doing so, they would also need consider whether the Transfer of Undertakings (TUPE) legislation would apply and reflect any relevant cost implications in their bids.</p>

  <p>A formal equalities impact assessment was not carried out on the decision to advance up to &pound;100 million under the Affordable Housing Investment Programme (AHIP). It was necessary for the Scottish Government to act swiftly in response to the changing economic climate, and acceleration of AHIP was part of this package of actions. The bulk of the funding will be used to accelerate projects or acquire land for future projects which will meet needs defined in local housing strategies and which will comply with our usual grant conditions on accessibility. Where funding is sought to support purchase by registered social landlords of completed houses built by private developers these will either meet the improved accessibility measures in the 2007 building regulations or else a special case will have to be made.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, we are unable to share the site-specific details of these projects at this time given some on-going issues of commercial sensitivity.</p>

  <p>On 24 October COSLA agreed to contribute &pound;40 million to ensure a total of &pound;100 million can be accelerated fro million the affordable Housing Investment Programme (AHIP) in 2010-11 and split &pound;30 million in 2008-09 and &pound;70 million in 2009-10. This acceleration will be funded fro million identified underspends in local and central government budgets and will not adversely affect services or service users on the ground. COSLA is working with local government Directors of Finance to finalise the proposed contributions fro million individual local authorities and a recommendation is expected to be identified shortly for COSLA Leaders to approve.</p>

  <p>The remainder of the &pound;30 million has yet to be announced but work is well underway to identifying the balance of projects required for this financial year. Further announcements will shortly follow. We do not anticipate any difficulties in expending these accelerated monies on strategic priorities this year. We are, however, unable to show the consequent impact that the &pound;30 million accelerated spend will have on planned units and investment for affordable housing in each local authority in 2008-09 given that not all monies have yet been allocated. Given that this funding is accelerated from 2010-11 and is additional to the AHIP programme for 2008-09 announced in May, any expenditure will also be additional to that already planned and will not be to the detriment of other affordable housing activities.</p>

  <p>No decisions have yet been taken on AHIP allocations for 2009-10.</p>

  <p>Jamie Stone (Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross) (LD): To ask the Scottish Executive how many affordable homes for rent it will deliver between 2008 and 2011.</p>

  <p>The Affordable Housing Investment Programme will deliver 21,500 affordable homes for rent and low cost home ownership over the period 2008-11. The vast majority of these homes will be for rent but the exact proportion is not known and will be settled as the programme is rolled out. In addition to this through the &pound;25 million incentivisation of council housebuilding we would expect to contribute to the delivery of further affordable homes for rent.</p>

  <p>Metal dealing is covered by sections 28 to 37 of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982. Under those provisions, the 32 local authorities are responsible for licensing metal dealers and itinerant metal dealers. A task group was set up by the previous administration to review the licensing provisions contained in the 1982 Act. We intended to include provisions in the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Bill to implement recommendations from the group&rsquo;s report. The recommendations included changes to the metal dealing provisions. However, in the light of the growing concerns about metal thefts we will seek the views of the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland on the issues involved and reassess the legislative position in the light of its response.</p>

  <p>The threshold for exemption from the need to obtain a metal dealer&rsquo;s licence is set out in section 29(1) of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982. It is currently &pound;100,000 and has not changed since the act came into force. A task group was set up by the previous administration to review the licensing provisions contained in the 1982 act. The group recommended that this threshold should be repealed and we have plans to do this in the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Bill. It would then be for local authorities to determine whether there should be any exemptions for larger businesses and, if so, what the level of turnover should be.</p>

However, the option to operate additional services between Edinburgh and Dunbar is part of the franchise extension consultation being carried out by Transport Scotland.
