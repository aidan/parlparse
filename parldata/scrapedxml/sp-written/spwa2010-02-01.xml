  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what assessment it has made of the comments of the neuroscientist, Dr Steven Alexander, from Nottingham University that each bottle of Buckfast tonic wine contains 281mg of caffeine, the same amount as in eight cans of Coke, and that consuming large amounts of caffeine would make people feel very anxious and aggressive.</p>

  <p>At present there is no evidence that mixing alcohol and caffeine - whether through consumption of a ready mixed drink or by drinking an alcoholic drink followed by a caffeinated drink (such as coffee) - enhances the intoxifying effect of the alcohol or that it causes aggression. We note the recent call for evidence from manufacturers on the safety of caffeinated alcoholic beverages by US Food and Drug Agency. We will review their findings should they be published and consider whether further research is necessary.</p>

  <p>There is, however, a clear link between alcohol consumption and crime, in particular violent crime. That is why Scottish Government is concentrating on tackling excessive alcohol consumption, not consumption of specific brands.</p>

  <p>Information on the calendar year 2009 is not currently available. The most up to date information available is for financial the year 2007-08. Data on the financial year 2008-09 will be available from 23 February 2010.</p>

  <p>The question has two separate parts:</p>

  <p>1. Patients treated for Alcohol related illnesses.</p>

  <p>2. Patients treated for alcohol related injuries.</p>

  <p>1. Patients with alcohol related illnesses are treated in a variety of inpatient and outpatient settings. The information available centrally covers only alcohol related hospital admissions. Information on the number of patients discharged from Fife hospitals with an alcohol related diagnosis in 2007-08 is presented in table 1. These figures include only those admissions due to illnesses directly attributable to alcohol (such as alcoholic liver disease) and do not include the much larger number of admissions resulting from illnesses indirectly attributable to alcohol (such as unintentional injuries, cancers and high blood pressure).</p>

  <p>2. Patients with alcohol related injuries are treated in a variety of inpatient and outpatient settings such as accident and emergency departments. Information is not available centrally on the number of alcohol related injuries treated in outpatient and accident and emergency settings. Furthermore, it is not possible from centrally held information to establish that an individual injury was caused by alcohol.</p>

  <p>ISD recently carried out work to estimate the number of hospital admissions due to alcohol related injuries using alcohol attributable fractions. The results are presented here:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not hold this information.</p>

  <p>When the Scotland-wide Free Bus Travel Scheme for Older and Disabled People was introduced on 1 April 2006, existing local authority concessionary cardholders transferred into the new scheme without undergoing a reassessment of their entitlement. The number of those cardholders specifically in receipt of lower rate Disability Living Allowance (DLA) at that time was not provided. Those previously in receipt of concessions on the grounds of receipt of lower rate DLA would, on expiry of their card, no longer be eligible under the Scotland-wide scheme unless they qualified under any of the other criteria.</p>

  <p>We do not hold the data to quantify how many of these 57 are capable of providing <br /> 2 Mbps to either all of end-users they serve, or to those living three miles or more from their exchange. However we can confirm that a number of factors, especially distance from the exchange, can affect the broadband speed which each end-user receives.</p>

  <p>We were not aware of the potential of the Globespan Group going into administration until the evening of 16 December 2009. Although we were aware from my meeting with the company in September 2009 that it would have to borrow more money to sustain some of its activities, our discussions did not include any request for or offer of financial support; nor were there any discussions with lending institutions regarding Globespan. No approach was made by the Group or any other party seeking our input into any rescue package.</p>

  <p>Contact with the Globespan Group at official level has been on air route development. Discussions with Scottish Enterprise after the company went into administration have been on approaches by airport operators seeking replacement carriers. We had no discussions with Scottish Enterprise on the Globespan Group prior to this, and therefore there was no request to Scottish Enterprise to offer support.</p>

  <p>While responsibility for the company and its customers now lies with the Administrator, the Partnership Action for Continuing Employment (PACE) responded as soon as we were aware that the Group had gone into administration. On 22 December PACE officials prepared comprehensive information packs on support available through PACE, which included the offer of one-to-one counselling, advice on career development and opportunities, and access to high quality training for issue by the Administrator directly to Globespan employees.</p>

  <p>Scottish Government statisticians have reviewed the approach which was previously taken to responding to such questions, in light of national statistics protocols.</p>

  <p>For S3W-29776, NHS boards were approached for the data as no formal published hospital level statistics for the periods concerned were published or available. This was a time consuming and costly exercise, which involved substantial effort on the part of boards in collating the data, and moreover, the information collected was unvalidated.</p>

  <p>In reviewing the approach to responding to such requests, Scottish Government statisticians have advised that parliamentary question responses should only be based on information which has been validated or formally published. Official Clostridium difficile statistics, prepared by Health Protection Scotland (HPS) following validation, including laboratory testing, are published by HPS on a quarterly basis.</p>

  <p>The response to S3W-29776 refers to the web link where unvalidated hospital level infection data, published by NHS boards, can be found. For ease of reference this is:</p>

All 32 reports have been received and are available on the Local Government Improvement Service website at <a href="http://www.improvementservice.org.uk/library/577-single-outcome-agreements/666-phase-1-single-outcome-agreements-2008-2011/693-single-outcome-agreement-2008-09-reports/view-category/" target="_blank">http://www.improvementservice.org.uk/library/577-single-outcome-agreements/666-phase-1-single-outcome-agreements-2008-2011/693-single-outcome-agreement-2008-09-reports/view-category/</a> .</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is producing an overview commentary, which assembles some of the key messages from these annual reports. I expect that it should be published shortly.</p>

  <p>The answer to oral parliamentary question S3O-08884 on 17 December 2009 is available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government already funds the Breathing Space telephone advice and signposting service for people experiencing low mood, depression or anxiety. Available out of hours on 0800 83 85 87, this handles around 4,000 calls per month and has a website which provides advice on a range of mental health issues. <a href="http://www.breathingspacescotland.co.uk" target="_blank">www.breathingspacescotland.co.uk</a> .</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government also provides core funding support to Samaritans who provide support to people in crisis by telephone and email.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Steps for Stress<em> </em>National Mental Health Improvement Campaign was launched by the Scottish Government in November 2009. It has two aims, to facilitate self recognition of stress, and to inform positive choices around how to reduce stress and improve mental wellbeing.</p>

  <p>Both a booklet and website (<a href="http://www.infoscotland.org.uk/stepsforstress/" target="_blank">http://www.infoscotland.org.uk/stepsforstress/</a>) are available, giving advice on differing subjects such as money worries, unemployment, problems at work, family and relationship difficulties, physical health problems, the pressure of being a carer, bad experiences in the past, and being discriminated against. Each topic gives practical advice, and has contact details and telephone numbers of organisations which give specialist advice.</p>

  <p>The Carstairs Index is an area based measure of deprivation, which was developed by Vera Carstairs and Russell Morris, at Edinburgh University using data from the 1981 Census.</p>

  <p>The original Carstairs index was subdivided into seven categories with category 1 = most affluent and category 7 = the most deprived.</p>

  <p>The Carstairs index is generally not used by the NHS or by the Scottish Government to measure deprivation and the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation is used instead.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s payment policy is that all suppliers&rsquo; invoices not in dispute are paid within the terms of the relevant contract. The Scottish Government aims to pay 100% of invoices, including disputed invoices once the dispute has been settled, on time within these terms. The Scottish Government&rsquo;s audited annual consolidated accounts provide information on payment policy and performance measured against 30 days in 2006-07, 2007-08 and 2008-09. Additionally, as part of its plan for supporting economic recovery in Scotland, the First Minister announced on 9 October 2008 that the Scottish Government would aspire to a 10 day target for paying bills to businesses in Scotland and performance on this is also reported in the 2008-09 accounts.</p>

  <p>The published accounts for the financial years 2006-07 onwards are available at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk</a> at these links:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government remains committed to supporting business in the current economic climate by paying bills more quickly and since the announcement of the target on 9 October 2008, performance has risen significantly. For the current financial year, an average of 95% of bills were paid within 10 working days in the five months to December 2009 by the Scottish Government, executive agencies and other bodies who use our financial systems. (For those bodies with their own financial systems we do not hold information until the point when it is reported in annual accounts.)</p>

  <p>It is for each local authority to manage its own winter preparations and to determine how best to meet its statutory duties during adverse weather conditions. We would expect local authorities to review their own planning and response activity.</p>

  <p>To support our councils and others, the Scottish Government has contacted resilience stakeholders across Scotland to identify lessons which may be learned and applied from the recent period of prolonged and at times extreme winter weather. The Cabinet Sub Committee for Scottish Government Resilience will consider the findings of this review to ensure that any lessons identified for the Scottish Government are learned and applied.</p>
