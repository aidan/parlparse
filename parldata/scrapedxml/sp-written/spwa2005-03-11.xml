  <p>Youth football would have benefited from the awards made from the Scottish Consolidated Fund set out in the following table. However, it is not possible to quantify the precise amount of the award which has benefited youth football. In addition to these, a contribution was made in 2002-03 towards the costs of the review of youth football carried out by independent consultants.</p>

  <p>Section 16 of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2003, which commenced on 1 November 2004, determines the conditions under which victims of crime are given an opportunity to be notified when a prisoner is released, dies in custody, is transferred outwith Scotland, becomes eligible for early release or is unlawfully at large. These conditions require that the offender who perpetrated the offence against the victim must have been sentenced to four or more years imprisonment or detention and must have been convicted of a prescribed offence.</p>

  <p>The Victim Notification (Prescribed Offences) (Scotland) Order 2004 (SSI 2004/411), which came into force on 1 November 2004, prescribes the offences for which a victim will be entitled to receive information relating to the person who perpetrated the offence against them.</p>

  <p>Ministers may, by order, change the conditions set out in section 16 of the 2003 Act by amending the period of time to which an offender must have been sentenced, by adding to the information that victims can receive or by altering the list of prescribed offences.</p>

  <p>The legislation governing the release of information to victims has been in effect since 1 November 2004. Its effect on victims is subject to evaluation. Once that evaluation is complete, Ministers will consider what changes, if any, are required to the conditions set out in section 16 of the 2003 Act.</p>

  <p>As has been stated on more than one occasion, the Scottish Executive has no plans to make provision of any devolved service dependent on an individual being registered on the National Identity Register. Should that position change, it would require an Act of the Scottish Parliament - clause 44 of the Bill makes this clear.</p>

  <p>The Bill would give the Home Secretary regulated power to disclose information from the Register to the Scottish police for the prevention and detection of crime. Scottish Ministers recognise the need to ensure that Scottish police are not unduly hampered in their ability to prevent and detect serious crime. However, conferring power on a UK government minister to disclose information from a register established for intrinsically reserved purposes is outwith the competence of the Scottish Parliament.</p>

  <p>In response to the recent suggestions that a Sewel motion is required in respect of clauses 17(6) and 18(4), both of which state &quot;in this section &lsquo;enactment&rsquo; includes an enactment comprised in an Act of the Scottish Parliament&quot;, I can confirm that this is not the case. The references to ASPs reflect the fact that the Scottish Parliament would have power to require registration on the National Identity Register for devolved purposes. The provisions address the consequences that would flow from any such requirement.</p>

  <p>Neither clause alters: devolved purposes; the legislative competence of the Parliament; or the executive competence of Scottish Ministers. No Sewel motion is therefore required.</p>

  <p>This is an operational matter for chief constables. However, the police have an important role to play in partnership working to prevent harm to children. If, for example, the police are concerned about the behaviour of a child, they may want to contact a child&rsquo;s school&rsquo;s guidance teacher so that additional support or early intervention could be considered, before reaching the stage of criminal charges or referral to the Children&rsquo;s Reporter.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body on what date it obtained legal advice in respect of its legal remedies in relation to Flour City Architectural Metals (UK) Ltd; whether that advice contained recommendations that further inquiries be made and, if so, and whether those inquiries have been made and whether they have been completed, and whether that advice recommended, in particular, that any documents be obtained from the construction managers and, if so, whether those documents have been obtained.</p>

  <p>: A report containing legal advice on the Flour City issues was received on 4 December 2002, and was first considered at a meeting of the corporate body on 17 December 2002. The advice contained a number of recommendations, and the corporate body has been and continues to be guided by that advice. The advice received includes the recommendation that its contents should be kept confidential and not publicly discussed, so as not to prejudice the SPCB&rsquo;s position. Accordingly, and for this reason, I am not prepared at this time to provide further details as to what steps have been taken or are planned.</p>
