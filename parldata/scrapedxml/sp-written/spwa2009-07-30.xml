  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will extend the consultation period for the draft crofting reform Bill.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-07-30.S3W-25715.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80301" speakername="Roseanna Cunningham" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa0730.htm#2">

  <p>The government is keen to hear views on the proposals in the draft crofting reform Bill and other constructive suggestions on how crofting legislation might be reformed to ensure a more secure future for crofting. However, it does not propose to extend the consultation period on the draft crofting reform Bill. Generally, the government considers 12 weeks to be sufficient time to allow for responses to be made to public consultations. In the case of the current consultation on crofting reform, the government believes the timescale to be sufficient for the majority of stakeholders. However, where individual organisations specifically request an extension in order to consult members, it will be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>

  <p>This is a matter for NHS Highland. However, I understand from NHS Highland that the orthodontic service in Caithness is currently staffed by a visiting consulting service which is focusing on the completion of active treatment, and that all new referrals for orthodontic treatment are referred to Raigmore. I further understand that treatment waiting times in Highland have reduced considerably and a review of overall service delivery is to be undertaken, including looking at the options for re-introducing locally delivered orthodontic services for new patients in Caithness.</p>

  <p>We have increased funding to tackle drug addiction by 13.5%. This brings the total provided for drug treatment and rehabilitation in 2009-10 to &pound;29,998 million. However, it is for health boards and their partners to allocate these resources in order to meet local needs.</p>

  <p>We are introducing a new national HEAT target requiring NHS and NHS-funded services to reduce waiting times for drug treatment services. This will ensure that people with drug problems are able to access services, including community-based support, at the point of need, to support their recovery. We are also drafting guidance on reducing drug treatment waiting times.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) has statutory responsibility for controlling potential sources of pollution from sites it regulates in urban areas. These include emissions from industrial facilities, sewage treatment works and surface water drainage and waste management activities. SEPA is able to determine the location of environmental emission sources within regulated sites and monitor and assess the accumulative environmental impacts of such emissions. In addition, SEPA&rsquo;s environmental surveillance monitoring enables it to trace and investigate any unauthorised emissions, together with any potential pollution incidents notified by members of the public.</p>

  <p>Additionally, the Scottish Government assists local authorities to implement their duties under the Environment Act 1995 to review and assess air quality by issuing comprehensive guidance, which can be found at:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) resources and functions are not assigned specifically to either urban or non-urban sources of pollution, therefore the following estimate of costs is very crude.</p>

  <p>Approximately two thirds of SEPA&rsquo;s activities are associated in some way with the &quot;tracing&quot; of urban pollution, accounting for approximately &pound;53 million and 900 staff. This staffing estimate includes those staff directly involved in the regulation and monitoring of potential urban impacts (such as environment protection officers, legal staff and science staff) and also SEPA&rsquo;s support service staff such as human resources, admin and finance.</p>

  <p>Local authorities in Scotland receive, as part of the financial support from the Scottish Government, a contribution towards funding of air quality assessment work in their areas. The Scottish Government also provides grant support of about &pound;1.5 million per annum to urban local authorities who have declared air quality management areas under the Environment Act 1995.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to improving the energy efficiency of Scotland&rsquo;s homes to alleviate fuel poverty and help meet our ambitious climate change targets. We have a range of initiatives to support households with this:</p>

  <p>The Energy Assistance Package (EAP) provides a holistic package of support for fuel-poor households. It aims to offer advice to around 75,000 potentially fuel-poor people in the first year. Of this, an estimated 50,000 could be referred for advice on social energy tariffs and a benefits health-check, 30,000 to CERT providers for cavity wall and/or loft insulation and up to 10,000 for enhanced energy efficiency measures at stage 4.</p>

  <p>The Home Insulation Scheme announced in the budget is an intensive area-based approach where every household in the area will be visited and offered an energy assessment and benefit/tariff check (where appropriate) along with insulation measures. The scheme will aim to contact 90,000 households in the first year and will link to the Energy Assistance Package as closely as possible mirroring the various EAP stages.</p>

  <p>The Energy Saving Scotland home renewables grant scheme, formerly known as SCHRI, provides funding to householders towards the installation of small scale renewables systems in Scottish homes. This scheme provides grants to householders of up to 30% of the costs of the installation, to a maximum of &pound;4,000. The Energy Saving Trust (EST), who deliver the scheme, hope to pay out 1,000 household grants this year.</p>

  <p>The Energy Saving Scotland Network, also delivered by EST, provides energy efficiency and microgeneration advice to anyone who calls the network. They have a target in place to engage with 220,000 customers in 2009-10.</p>

  <p>The Energy Efficiency Design Awards was launched on 3 February 2009. This offers &pound;1 million in prize money this year and next to generate and encourage the development of novel ideas and solutions to improve energy efficiency in &quot;hard to treat&quot; homes which number around 624,000 in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Proposals for a loan mechanism for investing in domestic energy efficiency measures will come forward later in the year.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-07-30.S3W-25718.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80330" speakername="Fiona Hyslop" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa0730.htm#10">

  <p>Information on the previous institution of study prior to attending higher education (HE) is collected by both the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) - for those doing HE at higher education institutions, and Scottish Funding Council - for those doing HE at colleges. However not all higher education institutions provide this information to HESA and as such the resulting data is of insufficient quality to provide a robust measurement of the number and proportion of graduates who received their senior school education in the Lothians region.</p>

  <p>Three thousand, one hundred and fifty five of those graduating from a higher education institution with a first degree in Scotland in 2007-08 (15 per cent of all graduates in Scotland) lived in the Lothians region prior to entering higher education. It is likely this number and proportion of graduates will be similar to the number and proportion who attended a secondary school in the Lothians region prior to entering a higher education institution.</p>

  <p>The Annual Population Survey is the official source for national estimates of the numbers of people aged 16 to 19 who were not in education, employment or training. In 2008, 31,000 people aged 16 to 19 were not in education, employment or training.</p>

  <p>We are committed to reducing the number of young people not in education, employment or training through our More Choices More Chances strategy, with a top priority being to help them stay in learning post-16 in order to improve their long-term employability.</p>

  <p>We&rsquo;re doing this by rolling out 16+ Learning Choices, formally launched in November, with the aim of giving every young person an appropriate offer of post-16 learning and support. The key to this is ensuring that young people get high quality careers information, advice and guidance so that they can make informed choices about the types of learning and training suitable for them well before reaching their school leaving age and at subsequent transition points.</p>

  <p>We have also recently announced an extra &pound;28.1 million investment in our colleges, including &pound;16.1 million which will deliver thousands of extra places during the next two years to help meet the additional demand for college courses from young people during the downturn.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-20470 by Fiona Hyslop on 19 February 2009, how many young people were not in education, employment or training and in need of additional support to be able to move into learning or employment in the last year for which information is available.</p>

  <p>All young people are entitled to support in moving into positive and sustained destinations beyond school. We are doing this by rolling out 16+ Learning Choices, formally launched in November, with the aim of giving every young person an appropriate offer of post-16 learning and support.</p>

  <p>Data are not held centrally on the number of young people not in education, employment or training who are in need of additional support to be able to move into learning or employment.</p>
