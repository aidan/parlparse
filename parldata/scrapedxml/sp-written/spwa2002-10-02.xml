  <p>In the period 2003-04 to 2005-06 the level of deficit and capital funding provided to Highlands and Islands Airports Ltd (HIAL) will increase from &#163;20.9 million to &#163;22.1 million a year (excluding capital charges of &#163;9 million per year).</p>

  <p>The level of funding will allow HIAL to operate 10 airports in the Highlands and Islands and keep airport charges at a level that will encourage the development of air services. The additional funding will also support the development of Inverness Airport and the associated business park.

  <p>NHS 24 is not being piloted in the Grampian region; Grampian is the first part of Scotland to benefit from the national rollout of this new NHS service. NHS 24 was designed and developed with the support of staff from the Scottish Ambulance Service and accident and emergency services to complement these services. By providing callers with home care advice or, where required, directing them to the most appropriate NHS service it should help reduce inappropriate demand on these services. NHS 24 is working very closely with NHSScotland to maximise nursing resource and minimise impact on local NHS services. Consequently, no additional funding was provided to the Grampian NHS Board area solely because NHS 24 would be launched in that area.</p>

  <p>It is for local authorities to choose care provision which best suits the needs of those people requiring care.

  <p>There remains a need for the continuation of specific grant funding focused on driving change and targeted at priority initiatives. Where appropriate, funding should be mainstreamed within GAE.</p>

  <p>Any future fund should focus on the five National Priorities for Education.</p>

Three events were held during September, in Dumfries, Edinburgh and Perth, which were attended by 40 NGOs and a number of individuals.</p>

  <p>I can confirm that planned provision for Clyde and Hebrides ferry services is &#163;37 million in 2003-04 and &#163;38 million in each of the years 2004-05 and 2005-06.</p>

  <p>The provision will allow existing services currently provided by Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd, together with the new Sound of Barra service and enhancements to services out of Oban, to be delivered at affordable fare levels. It will also meet the set up and running costs of the new vessel owning company to be established as part of the tendering of Clyde and Hebrides routes.</p>

  <p>These figures will be reviewed in the light of the outcome of the tendering process.</p>

  <p>I intend to make a separate announcement in due course on a new vessel programme for these services.</p>

  <p>The regulation of international trade is a reserved matter. However, the Executive continues to be in regular contact with the Department of Trade and Industry and other UK Government Departments on trade issues and how these may impact on the Executive&#146;s responsibilities.</p>

  <p>The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) applies to measures affecting trade in services taken by central, regional or local governments and authorities, and by non-governmental bodies in the exercise of powers delegated by such governments and authorities. Progressive liberalisation under the GATS concerns the reduction or elimination of the adverse effects on trade in services of such measures as a means of providing effective market access for foreign service suppliers. The GATS makes clear that liberalisation shall take place, if at all, with due respect for national policy objectives. The agreement recognises the right of World Trade Organisation member governments to regulate, and to introduce new regulations, on the supply of services within their territories in order to meet these objectives.</p>

  <p>The Bologna Process was initiated by a small group of European Education Ministers in Paris in 1998 and taken forward by a larger group of ministers in Bologna in 1999 and is not a formal EU process. It is an inter-ministerial process of agreed action between 33 signatory countries, including the UK, with the aim of creating a European higher education area by 2010. This will mean having readily comparable higher education systems across Europe. With its existing Bachelor/Masters structure and the development of SCOTCAT and the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework, the Scottish higher education system already fits well with the Bologna model.</p>

  <p>As oil seed rape produces pollen, it is impossible to rule out altogether the possibility of some pollen travelling outwith the boundaries of the trial site. Separation distances are used to minimise this possibility.</p>

  <p>When considering applications for GM field trials the consequences of pollen travelling by wind or foraging insects is specifically assessed by the Executive&#146;s advisory bodies including the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment. Approval would not have been given for the current trials if this assessment had given rise to safety concerns for human health or the environment.</p>

  <p>The information available is given in the following table. Offenders convicted for offences committed while subject to a bail order issued prior to 1 April 1996 will, if the main part of the sentence related to the offence under the Bail (Scotland) Act 1980 of re-offending while on bail, have been classified to the &quot;Other crimes&quot; grouping. Where the bail order was issued on or after 1 April 1996, the offender will have been classified to the main offence committed while on bail. Convictions data for 2001 are expected to be available in November.</p>

  <p>Information on persons with a charge proved in 1999 and 2000 where a bail aggravation was recorded in the sentence is included in Table 14 of the annual statistical bulletins Criminal Proceedings in Scottish Courts published for those years (Bib. numbers 11289 and 17818 respectively). Data for the year 2001 are expected to be available in November 2002. Assault and robbery falls within the Scottish Executive Justice Department&#146;s crime category of robbery.</p>

  <p>The Solicitor General shares with all ministers a desire to ensure that the Appeal Courts operate as effectively as possible. I refer the member to my answer to question S1W-28835 on 13 September 2002, that describes steps being taken to help speed up the appeals procedure. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&#146;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/search wa</a> .</p>

  <p>Since then, ministers have agreed to a request by the Lord Justice General that an additional five temporary Judges should be appointed to help with the backlog of work generally. The number of permanent Judges stands at a record level of 32.</p>

  <p>The legislative provisions contained in Schedule 1 paragraphs 2(1) of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 requires a local authority to forward a copy of any application for the grant or renewal of a taxi or private hire car licence to the Chief Constable. In addition, a local authority in considering such an application, can also make any other reasonable inquiries it considers necessary. As such, local authorities should be aware of the criminal convictions of applicants and will take into account any information provided by the Chief Constable in determining the application for a licence.</p>

  <p>We are not aware of any difficulties with the current legislative provisions in this regard. However, an independent task group set up by ministers to review the licensing provisions in the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982, which includes a representative from the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland, is currently consulting on its emerging findings. The Task Group Consultation Paper makes no reference to this issue but it is open to people submit comments to the task group on any aspect of the licensing provisions about which they have concerns. The closing date for responses is 4 October 2002 and the consultation paper is on the web at:</p>

  <p>The task group is due to submit its report by the end of 2002.</p>

  <p>(a) The Local Government in Scotland Bill as introduced, identifies local authorities as facilitators of the community planning process. As such, it places a requirement on local authorities to produce a report on what has been done by way of community planning in their areas. The emphasis is on reporting to the community and stakeholders. In its Stage 1 report on the Local Government in Scotland Bill, the Local Government Committee has made recommendations in this area and we are currently considering the contents of the report.</p>

  <p>(a) There is now a Community Planning Partnership in each local authority area in Scotland. Local authorities have played a significant role in the development of Community Planning Partnerships in their areas.</p>

  <p>The Local Government in Scotland Bill currently being considered by Parliament, proposes a statutory underpinning for community planning and gives local authorities a duty to initiate and facilitate the community planning process in their areas.</p>

  <p>(a) The Local Government in Scotland Bill proposes a statutory basis for community planning and in so doing will give local authorities a duty to initiate and facilitate the process.

The Local Government in Scotland Bill also proposes to give local authorities a power to advance well-being, effectively a power of first resort, which should enable them to work in a more innovative and creative way in responding to the needs of their communities.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the decision of the Minister for Health and Community Care to approve the plans of Greater Glasgow NHS Board on the future provision of acute hospital services in the board area is final and not subject to any further review.</p>

  <p>In approving Greater Glasgow NHS Board&#146;s plan for the future provision of acute hospital services throughout its area, I gave careful consideration to, and looked closely at, the process that had been carried out by the NHS board in formulating its proposals. I also closely scrutinised the considerable amount of information made available to me by NHS Greater Glasgow and other interested parties.</p>

  <p>This is a long-term plan, which must be flexible enough to take account of changing service demands and developing medical practice. I, therefore, support the on-going monitoring and review process that will include external commentary by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) on the governance arrangements and processes for the development and implementation of the Acute Services Strategy. The reports produced by PwC will be submitted to Audit Scotland and will be subject to independent review. They may also form the basis of any reports to the Scottish Parliament that the Auditor General for Scotland may prepare.</p>

  <p>I also recognise that there remains particular concerns about the future number of accident and emergency departments serving the city and a review of the proposed configuration will be carried out in two years time when the position becomes clearer. This will involve staff, patient and community groups, Glasgow Health Council and the Scottish Royal Colleges.</p>

  <p>It is now for NHS Greater Glasgow to turn its ambitious and far-reaching proposals into reality for the benefit of all the people of Glasgow and beyond without further delay. In doing so, the NHS board must fully involve all stakeholders throughout the detailed planning process and in setting and achieving milestones during the implementation period.</p>

  <p>We have no plans to conduct any inquiry into the use of the funds Napier University receives under the terms of the contract for the provision of nurse education.

  <p>The Police Grant Aided Expenditure Working Group has met formally on 10 occasions, most recently on 24 September 2002. The previous such meeting was in June 2001, when the group considered some provisional recommendations put forward by consultants, but regarded these as inconclusive. In the interval between these two meetings, further work was undertaken and a number of informal meetings and exchanges of correspondence took place between members of the group. Following these, the group was able to reach agreement in principle on its recommendations at its September 2002 meeting. A report of the processes and analysis involved is being prepared and will be submitted to ministers in October, following which consideration will be given to wider publication.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>We do not consider that there is a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights. Access to toilet facilities during the day is generally unrestricted. At night, an automated system allows prisoners in single cells to access toilet facilities. For security reasons, prisoners who are sharing a cell cannot make use of the automated system. Staff require to supervise the unlocking of their doors. Night shift staffing has recently been increased to reduce the delay in unlocking doors. Furthermore, procedures are in place to ensure that women with serious medical conditions are not required to share a cell.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The performance measures in Schedule F of the contract relate to the extent to which the contractor is expected to manage events, incidents or activities. Acts of indiscipline by prisoners, such as those cited, are often spontaneous and difficult to predict: the performance measures reflect whether the contractor has minimised the potential for such an incident and/or to have contained its effect. If, for example, the items cited in (d), (e), (i) or (j) had been smuggled into the prison, that is how the event would be reflected as a performance measure; if a breach of security procedures allowed a prisoner to be somewhere he should not be &#150; as in (h) - again that is how it would be reflected. In a number of the cases cited, the measure is about whether the management of prisoners is such that other prisoners do not become involved in isolated incidents of serious indiscipline, thereby preventing these from escalating. Each individual incident/prisoner is dealt with in the orderly room, as appropriate.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has provided &#163;6.5 million to fund the development of the North Edinburgh tram to parliamentary order stage and to look at options for the Edinburgh South Suburban Railway, and a further &#163;5 million to do the same for the West Edinburgh Tram. We are currently considering a proposal from City of Edinburgh Council for funding for development of a South East Edinburgh Tram.</p>

  <p>The funding that is in place will allow progress to be made as quickly as possible on the North and West lines. Until this development work, including a Scottish Transport Advisory Group 2 (STAG2) appraisal in each case, is complete, it would be premature to enter into commitments about funding the building of these lines.</p>

  <p>The project agreement requires measures to be taken to achieve standards of odour treatment.

  <p>The works achieved discharge compliance on 7 February 2002.

Since then, work has progressed commissioning the remainder of the plant, equipment and control systems, and setting the operational parameters for the long-term running of the treatment works. The contract with Scotia Water allows for this commissioning process until the next stages of practical completion and actual completion are reached.

  <p>I have asked Dr Jon Hargreaves, Chief Executive of Scottish Water to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Odours from the plant have come principally from the interim sludge processing operation, the transport of the sludge cake and from the storm tanks.</p>

  <p>The interim sludge processing was stopped on 13 September and the sub-contractor was instructed to clean out the remaining sludge from his storage tanks before standing down. As the sludge is heavy and grit laden at the bottom of these tanks, decommissioning is likely to last until the second week in October. Sludge is now being pumped to Shieldhall waste water treatment works through Scottish Water&#146;s new pumping station at Dalmuir.</p>

  <p>The trucks transporting the sludge cake were also a source of odour nuisance. This was caused by the release of ammonia as a result of the lime addition required for agricultural recycling of the material. Scottish Water took over the management of cake disposal from the beginning of July. An alternative disposal route was found which did not require the addition of the lime and this has reduced the nuisance considerably.</p>

  <p>The storm tanks have proved to be a source of odour nuisance particularly during emptying. Prolonged periods of wet weather over the last 12 months caused a large accumulation of sludge in the tanks and caused problems with both the volume to be cleared, and deterioration in sludge quality as the sludge aged and turned septic. Settled weather during the last month has only now allowed all the tanks to be cleaned. In light of experience, Scotia Water has alleviated some nuisance by modifying its operating procedures to limit exposure of sludge to the atmosphere and return tank contents to the head of the works at an early stage. Discussions have also been held with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency on using the tanks more effectively and if agreement is reached, the tank operation will be simplified and the odour risk reduced.</p>
