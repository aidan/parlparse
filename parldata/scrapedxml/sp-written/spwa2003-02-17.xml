  <p>No. The Executive believe that the identification of local priorities for economic development and the delivery of co-ordinated economic development activities is dealt with most effectively by partnerships of local organisations and agencies. The Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire Local Economic Forum provides a robust mechanism for driving forward an agreed economic agenda for the area. Scottish Enterprise Grampian, a member of the forum, will continue to follow the Smart, Successful Scotland strategy, by taking action to encourage the growth of businesses, improvements in skills and the creation of new employment opportunities. There are already in place effective arrangements for dealing with redundancy situations and in the event of job losses, support will be provided to those affected through a dedicated local response team under the Executive's Partnership Action for Continuing Employment framework. This will ensure a rapid response from local agencies in terms of offering advice, support and guidance on the wide range of retraining, upskilling and employment opportunities.</p>

  <p>Information on the measurement of transport-related pollutants is not held centrally.

  <p>Ministers attach considerable importance to the performance of planning authorities in processing planning applications and are keen to see performance match the Executive&rsquo;s targets in this regard. To that end, the Executive carries out a rolling programme of planning audits of the development control and development planning procedures of planning authorities. The audits aim to identify strengths and weaknesses in the procedures of each planning authority, promote good practice and help authorities improve upon their levels of performance. An annual audit report is published containing statistics on performance with a short commentary, and is available on the internet ( <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/about/Planning/audit.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/about/Planning/audit.aspx</a> ).</p>

  <p>The introduction of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development)(Scotland) Order 1992 in March 1992 removed permitted development rights from agricultural buildings in excess of 465 square metres or 12 metres in height. It was considered that the larger structures should be subject to planning control in order to ensure that their effect on the landscape, particularly the sensitivity of build and location, could be taken fully into account in the deliberation process. While no planning fee is charged on agricultural buildings not exceeding 465 square metres the developer must apply to the authority for prior approval which currently costs &#163;42.</p>

  <p>Through the School Sports Co-ordinator Programme, school sport in the Argyll and Bute and West Dunbartonshire local authority areas has benefited since 1998-99 by &#163;43,145 and &#163;139,870 respectively as outlined in the following table. West Dunbartonshire Council applied to the programme on behalf of all schools in its area whereas Argyll and Bute Council decided to leave it to individual schools to decide whether to apply to the programme for funding. Neither local authority is involved in the Active Primary School Programme or the TOP Programme.</p>

  <p>The Executive&rsquo;s aim is to increase participation in sport at all age levels and in particular instil healthy positive attitudes in our children and young people towards sport and physical activity in all parts of Scotland. To assist that objective the Executive has allocated significant additional resources to school sport in particular in its most recent budget. <strong>Sport</strong>scotland will work with all education authorities including Argyll and Bute and West Dunbartonshire in developing these programmes further.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive <a name="QuestionText">what percentage of household waste in (a) Scotland, (b) the East Renfrewshire Council area and (c) the East Dunbartonshire Council area is (i) disposed of by landfill, (ii) recycled, (iii) composted and (iv) incinerated.</a></p>

  <p>The information requested for the two councils is available for 2001-02 on the Accounts Commission website,</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.audit-scotland.gov.uk/performance/compendium/councils.htm" target="_blank">http://www.audit-scotland.gov.uk/performance/compendium/councils.htm</a></p>

  <p>Summation of the data from that source shows that overall Scotland landfilled 89.6%, recycled 8% (including 2.3% composted and 0.4% ash from incineration which is recycled) and incinerated 2.4% of household waste in 2001-02. Unreliable information from one council (Dumfries and Galloway) has been excluded from the Scotland figures.</p>
