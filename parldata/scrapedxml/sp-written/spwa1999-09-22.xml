  <p>The responsibility for gulf veterans rests with the Ministry of Defence. The issues raised are therefore reserved to the UK Parliament.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether, further to the publication of the UK anti-poverty strategy by Her Majesty&#8217;s Government, it will make a statement on its strategy for tackling poverty and social exclusion.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/1999-09-22.5.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80131" speakername="Ms Wendy Alexander" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-99/wa0922.htm#1649">

  <p>Wide ranging action is necessary to tackle poverty and social exclusion. Responsibilities for some matters are reserved, and some are devolved. Effective, integrated action therefore requires a close working partnership between the Scottish Executive and the UK Government. The UK strategy <i>Opportunity for All &#8211; Tackling Poverty and Social Inclusion</i> that was published yesterday is the first report on the action that is being taken across the UK. It makes it clear however that devolved administrations will develop their own policies in devolved areas to reflect their countries' particular circumstances and the needs and wishes of their people.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive will work in partnership with all interested parties to build on policy developments in the UK. In consultation with the Scottish Social Inclusion Network, the Scottish Executive will set out its plans for integrated action in devolved areas over the next few months.</p>

  <p>The Royal Mint manufactured and supplied the medallions which displayed the appropriate Scottish coat of arms. The lining of all Royal Mint presentation cases contain the Royal Mint&#8217;s crest, which is their corporate insignia.</p>

  <p>Once the Procedures Committee has produced recommendations on the balance between meetings of the Parliament and meetings of Committees, and the time available for Parliamentary proceedings, an estimate will be made of any cost implications, to help inform any decision of the Parliament. Staff will be consulted on any proposals that might have a direct impact on their terms and conditions. <br /></p>
