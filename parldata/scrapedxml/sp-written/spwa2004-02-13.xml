  <p>The European Commission has alleged non-compliance in relation to the UK Government&#8217;s failure to consult the Commission in relation to the continuance of trade of certain species of game birds.

  <p>I refer the member to the answers given to questions S2W-4264 and S2W-4827 on 5 December 2003 and 12 December 2003, which address the resources made available to local authorities to support carers as part of local government finance settlements for community care.</p>

  <p>Our commitment to create more inclusive communities is being taken forward under a range of initiatives. A key component is the &#163;60 million being invested in social inclusion partnerships (SIPs) which support a range of clients within a wide area of activity, including education, health and employment. In addition, the Better Neighbourhood Services Fund (BNSF) is providing &#163;120 million to 12 local authorities over four years (2001-05) to help advance the Executive&#8217;s social justice objectives, by improving mainstream public services in the most deprived areas of Scotland. It is up to the SIP partnerships, and in the case of the BNSF local authorities involving community planning partners, and local communities themselves to decide how best to use these resources. However, these resources can be, and are being, used to support vulnerable groups and their carers.</p>

  <p>The study referred to was commissioned by Scottish Enterprise from Bradley Dunbar Associates and entitled <em>Opportunities and Challenges of EU Enlargement</em> . This study was published on the Scottish Enterprise website at www.scottish-enterprise.com/euenlargement in August 2003 and is available to any interested party.</p>

  <p>The key findings of the study were that Scottish companies need to position themselves to benefit from two specific drivers of opportunities in the acceding countries: the structural funds that will flow to the new member states; and the need for action in those countries to ensure compliance with EU legislation following a transitional period.</p>
