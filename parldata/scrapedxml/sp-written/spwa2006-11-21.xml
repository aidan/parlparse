  <p>The Standing Orders of the Scottish Parliament require all bills on introduction to be accompanied by a Financial Memorandum which sets out the best estimates of the administrative, compliance and other costs to which the provisions of the bill would give rise, best estimates of the timescales over which such costs would be expected to arise, and an indication of the margins of uncertainty in such estimates. The Financial Memorandum must distinguish separately such costs as would fall upon (a) the Scottish administration, (b) local authorities and (c) other bodies, individuals and businesses. These memoranda are freely available on the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s website.</p>

  <p>The Abolition of Poindings and Warrant Sales Act 2001 was due to come into force on the 31 of December 2002, but the Debt Arrangement and Attachment Act 2002 came into force on 30 December 2002 and schedule 3, paragraph 27, repealed it.</p>

  <p>On 10 November 2006, there were 204,141 criminal justice profiles obtained from arrested people registered on the Scottish DNA database. Of these, 99,770 (48.9%) are known to have been convicted of an offence as the profile is being held as a result of that conviction.</p>

  <p>The remainder of profiles are held while current criminal proceedings are still on-going. Under current legislation, the profiles of these individuals will be removed from the database, and no records kept, if a decision is subsequently taken not to pursue the criminal proceedings, or the proceedings conclude with the individual not being convicted. Data on whether these individuals have previous convictions is not recorded when they are entered on the database.</p>

  <p>Information on the number of arrests made by the police is not held centrally, only the number of crimes recorded. Furthermore, figures for driving offences involving drugs alone are not available. Finally, no information about the age of the accused is held centrally.</p>

  <p>The following table, therefore, gives the number of drunk or drug-driving offences (including those involving the refusal to provide a test or sample) recorded by the police in each local authority area since 1999-2000.</p>

  <p>Policy and legislation on driving whilst under the influence of drugs is reserved. The police have powers under the Road Traffic Act 1988, as amended by the Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003 to require suspects to provide samples for roadside testing for the presence of drugs and to participate in tests designed to help officers to reach a judgement whether that person may be impaired. The police must administer such tests in accordance with a code of practice issued by The Secretary of State for Transport in December 2004. The code of practice is available via the following link:</p>

  <p>The decision not to take proceedings against the four SCRO officers who identified print Y7 as being that of Shirley McKie, made by the Lord Advocate in 2001, is final and it would not be possible to prosecute these officers at any point in the future in relation to their identification of Y7.</p>

  <p>The finality of the decision is not, however, as a result of immunity granted by the Crown &ndash; no such immunity has been granted. The decision is final because, in Scots Law, when a decision to take no proceedings has been intimated by the Crown to a person against whom a criminal allegation has been made, the Crown are held to it, and such intimation will usually constitute a bar to any proceedings thereafter.</p>

  <p>The Executive does not have a dedicated budget allocation for veterans commemorations. However, we are happy to consider requests for financial support for veterans commemorations on a case-by-case basis. My answer to question S2W-27577 on 21 August 2006, provides details of the funding allocated to such commemorations in each year since 1999.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it can commission any medal in respect of the Scottish Arctic convoys and, if so, whether it will consider commissioning such a medal.</p>

  <p>Matters concerning the commissioning of medals for military service are reserved, initially, to the Ministry of Defence, and Scottish ministers have no locus to intervene in the these decisions.</p>

  <p>In recognition of service in the Arctic during the Second World War, the UK Government has specially commissioned the Arctic Emblem to commemorate the service of Merchant Seamen and members of the Armed Forces in the Arctic Region between 3 September 1939 and 8 May 1945.</p>

The Executive has not made any representations to the Ministry of Defence with respect to an Arctic Convoy Medal.</p>

  <p>The Arctic Emblem represents tangible recognition in the form of something that can be worn as a unique, recognized addition to medals by those men who served in the Arctic regions and who were often subjected to especially dangerous circumstances including extreme weather conditions and determined resistance from German forces.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the (a) initial set up and (b) annual costs to (i) the Executive, (ii) local authorities, (iii) other public sector organisations or bodies and (iv) other individuals, organisations and bodies of the Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) Act 2003 were projected to be in the Financial Memorandum to the bill and what the actual (1) initial set up costs were and (2) annual costs have been in each year since the act came into force, in each category.</p>

  <p>The Financial Memorandum to the bill is available on the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s website. The only costs incurred up to the end of 2005-06 that are attributable directly to the provisions in the act have fallen on the running costs of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. These costs amounted to some &pound;3.8 million in 2005-06. The provisions in the act that would result in costs falling on other organisations only came into force in April this year. Annual costs falling on these organisations are not therefore available yet.</p>
