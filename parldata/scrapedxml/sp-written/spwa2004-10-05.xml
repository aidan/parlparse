  <p>In 2002, the Scottish Executive awarded a grant of &pound;145,000 to Seafood Scotland in support of the organisation&rsquo;s activities. Applications from Seafood Scotland for the next round of Financial Instrument for the Fisheries Guidance (FIFG) awards have just been received and are currently under consideration.</p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise has also funded Seafood Scotland activities on a project basis. Seafood Scotland received funding for some of the projects under the 2001 Scottish fish processors action plan. Scottish Enterprise Grampian have provided &pound;216,960 support in 2002-03, &pound;198,651 in 2003-04 and &pound;26,077 in 2004-05. Support for other projects are planned for the future.</p>

  <p>In addition to the financial support awarded on a project basis, the Scottish Executive supports the excellent work of Seafood Scotland in a variety of non-financial ways, for example, through regular attendance at the Seafood Scotland board meetings.</p>

  <p>We are deeply concerned about the knife culture and its contribution to violent crime.</p>

  <p>There are already extensive provisions under the existing law which restrict the sale and promotion of knives.</p>

  <p>The Criminal Justice Act 1988 makes it an offence to sell to anyone under 16 any knife, blade, razor blade, axe, or any other bladed or sharply pointed article made or adapted for causing personal injury. That act also makes it an offence to import, manufacture, sell or hire a specified offensive weapon or expose or possess such a weapon for the purposes of sale or hire. The weapons which have been specified as offensive weapons include various types of knife such as butterfly knives and push daggers. The Restriction of Offensive Weapons Act 1959 makes it an offence to manufacture, sell or hire a flick knife or a gravity knife.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Knives Act 1997 makes it an offence to market a knife in a way which indicates that it is suitable for combat or in a way which is likely to encourage violent behaviour involving the use of the knife as a weapon.</p>

  <p>As promised in our Partnership Agreement, we are reviewing the enforcement of these measures.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Legal Services Ombudsman&rsquo;s written report on a complaint, or Opinion, sets out her recommendation on a case, and is sent only to the complainant, the practitioner and the professional body as required by section 34A of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1990. The Ombudsman&rsquo;s annual reports for 2002-03 and 2003-04 record that the Law Society of Scotland accepted most of her recommendations to reconsider its decision, or re-investigate a complaint, and that the Faculty of Advocates refused to accept a particular recommendation in one case in 2002-03 and in two cases in 2003-04.</p>

  <p>The Ombudsman can also make advisory recommendations to the professional bodies in her annual report about their procedures for, and methods of, dealing with complaints. Section 34B of the 1990 act requires the professional bodies to consider such recommendations and to notify the Ombudsman of the results of that consideration and any action which they have taken, or propose to take, in consequence of the recommendation. The Ombudsman normally records in her annual report the responses made by the professional bodies to previous advisory recommendations and it is clear from previous reports that the majority of such recommendations have been accepted and implemented in recent years.</p>

  <p>The information is not available.</p>

  <p>The following rail freight grant schemes operate in Scotland - the Freight Facilities Grant (FFG), Track Access Grant (TAG) and Company Neutral Revenue Support (CNRS) Grant schemes. These grants are available to encourage the transfer of freight from road to rail where without grant support the freight would be transported by road because the rail option is more costly. All are limited to the level of environmental benefits generated by using rail rather than road. The FFG scheme helps with the upfront capital costs of becoming linked to rail. TAG helps with the Track Access Charges made by Network Rail for, mostly, bulk commodities such as timber. CNRS provides help with the operating costs of transferring inter-modal containers by rail. Copies of the guidance for applicants are available in the Parliament&rsquo;s reference centre (Bib. numbers 33921, 33922 and 33923).</p>

  <p>FFG is paid to applicants once they have incurred capital expenditure. The grants are based on rail being used for an agreed number of years, normally between three and ten, and are monitored for that set period. TAG and CNRS awards are normally limited to three years but may be extended.</p>

  <p>Bilingual signing has been provided on the A830, A887 and A87 (Skye and the mainland) as part of a commitment given in June 2003 to sign a number of highland routes. A contract has just been awarded for the A835. Bilingual road signs will be provided on the remaining agreed routes by 2008, namely:</p>

  <p>A828 Ballachulish to Connel Bridge</p>

  <p>A85 Tyndrum to Oban</p>

  <p>A83 Tarbet to Kennacraig/Campbeltown</p>

  <p>Our bilingual signage strategy has been agreed jointly with Highland Council and at present only involves routes which travel through Gaelic speaking communities. There are currently no plans to erect bilingual signs on the A9.</p>
