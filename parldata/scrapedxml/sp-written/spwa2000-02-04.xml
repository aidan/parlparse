  <p>Education Maintenance Allowances are being piloted in East Ayrshire over three years. The aim of the scheme is to encourage young people from low income families to stay in full-time education at school or FE college in order to achieve qualifications. The effect of EMAs on attendance and achievement rates will be monitored and evaluated during the pilot. A full evaluation will not be possible until the pilot is complete, but it is intended that an interim evaluation will be made at the end of the first year.</p>

  <p>Modern Apprenticeships, which are part of the Skillseekers programme, are primarily targeted at 16 and 17 year olds. Once LECs have provided training places for 16 and 17 year olds they have discretionary power to allocate funding to training for young people aged 18-24. All LECs do currently fund Modern Apprenticeships for 18-24 year olds but this funding is applied in each area according to specific criteria designed to meet the skills needs of the local and national economy and to take account of local labour markets.</p>

  <p>The funding of training for 18-24 year olds is being examined as part of the &quot;Opportunities and Choices&quot; consultation exercise on future developments in post-16 non-advanced education and training.</p>

  <p>Medicines Control is a reserved matter dealt with on a UK-wide basis by the Medicines Control Agency.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not, therefore, intend to consult separately on changes to the Prescription Only Medicines (Human Use) Order 1997. These changes would be necessary to extend the categories of health professionals who can administer injectable prescription only medicines, including Naloxone, on their own initiative.</p>

  <p>Source: Death registration data held by the General Register Office for Scotland (GROS).</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Road traffic accidents: Deaths classified to ICD9 (International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision) codes E810-E819 and E826-E829. GROS use slightly different definitions to those used for classifying the road accident statistics collected by the police eg the GROS data are classified by place of residence whereas road accident statistics are based on place of occurrence.</p>

  <p>2. Use of Class A drugs: Deaths classified to ICD9 codes 304, E850-E858 and E980 where a Class A drug was known to be involved. Each year GROS publish a short paper on drug-related deaths. The figures in the table are based on the definition of drug-related deaths used in this paper but they are restricted to cases where a Class A drug was known to have been involved.</p>

  <p>3. Use of volatile substances: Deaths classified to ICD9 code 3046. A research team at St.George&#8217;s Hospital, London, also collate (GB) information on deaths from volatile substance abuse. Their figures are usually slightly higher than those of GROS because, for example, they may include deaths where volatile substance abuse was mentioned on the death certificate as one of the causes of death although the underlying cause of death was not coded to ICD 3046 by GROS.</p>

  <p>Our primary care system is based on the model of a &quot;registered patient list&quot;, where a named doctor serves a list of patients identified by their place of residence. However, everyone has a right to be on a doctor&#8217;s list and Primary Care NHS Trusts have a responsibility to ensure that all patients are assigned to a suitable practitioner if they have been unable to secure services themselves.</p>

  <p>Greater Glasgow Primary Care NHS Trust have a number of specific initiatives in place which are designed to improve access to primary health care services for the homeless. They include:</p>

  <p>The <u>Medical and Nursing Health Service City Mission</u> which provides a range of general medical interventions and treatment to homeless adults (including the elderly) who have difficulty in obtaining treatment in the General Medical Service.</p>

  <p>The <u>Homeless Families Health Care Service</u> which tracks homeless families through their period of homelessness. A key element of the service is the establishment of a link between previous and new primary care services for those who move area due to homelessness and become lost to existing mainstream services.</p>

  <p>The <u>Mental Health Hostel Service</u> which is designed to prevent patients falling through the net of community mental health services and provides a comprehensive specialist Mental Health Service to the homeless.</p>

  <p>The <u>Community Dental Service to the City Mission</u> which provides a full range of treatment to homeless adults (including the elderly) who have difficulty in obtaining treatment in the General Dental Service.</p>

  <p>The <u>Podiatry Service City Mission</u> which provides assessment, diagnosis and treatment of lower limb pathologies enabling clients to attain optimum mobility. Access to the community chiropody services for the homeless is through direct attendance at one of the service delivery sites.</p>

  <p>A <u>Nutrition and Dietetic Service</u> which plans a programme on food safety/hygiene, budgeting, and information on nutrition and healthy eating for young single homeless and for homeless families.</p>

  <p>A <u>Physiotherapy Service</u> relieves acute conditions and provides advice on chronic conditions leading to improved quality of life and improved general health for homeless people.</p>

  <p>Further details of these services are available from Greater Glasgow Primary Care Trust.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Court Service has a key strategic aim of using modern technology to improve the service it delivers and assist the work of the courts. In the last year it has completed the installation of a computer network linking all the Sheriff and Supreme Courts in Scotland and is developing computer based systems to assist in tracking cases before the courts. A website has been introduced which provides information on the Scottish Courts and includes a searchable database of recent judgements. The opportunity to incorporate modern technology is also routinely considered in planning the major refurbishment of court buildings.</p>

  <p>The finance consultation document <i>Spending Plans for Scotland</i> invited views on our spending proposals for the next two years. Inevitably the spending plans for local government have to strike a balance between affordability and the requirements of other services for which the Scottish Executive is responsible. However, overall our spending plans provide for the most generous local government settlement for seven years, with spending set to rise by 4.8% this year, 3.7% in 2000-01 and 3.6% in 2001-02, higher than the forecast rate of inflation.</p>

  <p>The basic process which is followed is set out below:</p>

  <p>Question and template for answer received by Parliamentary Clerk, Scottish Executive from the Chamber Office. Parliamentary Clerk allocates to appropriate Executive Department and issues question and template for answer in electronic form to Departmental Secretariat.</p>

  <p>Departmental Secretariat issues question and template to appropriate official to prepare draft answer.</p>

  <p>Appropriate official drafts answer. Depending on the question, this is likely to involve liaison with colleagues in other parts of the Executive, Whitehall departments or other bodies.</p>

  <p>Draft answer cleared by senior official in Department and returned to Departmental Secretariat.</p>

  <p>Draft answer considered by appropriate Minister(s) and any changes discussed with the Department.</p>

  <p>Answer lodged with Member and Chamber Office by Parliamentary Clerk.</p>

  <p>Guidance was issued in May 1999 setting out the above process. Some existing Scottish Office guidance remains of relevance, e.g. on the interaction of PQs with data protection requirements. Arrangements for liaison with the UK Government on PQs are contained in the <i>Memorandum of Understanding</i> and Concordats. The Civil Service Management Code and the Scottish Ministerial Code also inform the role of civil servants in preparing answers to Parliamentary Questions. These various sources of guidance are being drawn together to create comprehensive guidance for staff on PQs, which will issue shortly. This guidance will also provide advice on dealing with common forms of questions. I will place a copy of this guidance in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre once it is complete.</p>

  <p>Vehicles using liquid petroleum gas play a number of important roles in respect of the environment. They help reduce emissions of air pollutants that impact on local air quality, as well as reducing emissions of carbon dioxide. Compared to diesel vehicles used in heavy-duty applications, LPG vehicles emit considerably lower levels of nitrogen oxides and particles, which are harmful to health. LPG vehicles are also substantially quieter at low speeds than the diesel equivalents.</p>
