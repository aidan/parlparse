  <p>The plan for action on alcohol problems, which was published on 18 January, sets out additional funding of &#163;1.5 million for a national alcohol problems communications strategy and increased funding to Alcohol Actions Teams of &#163;1 million.

  <p>The schools cultural co-ordinators pilot programme will seek to maximise the contribution to children and young people&#8217;s education of the full range of arts and cultural activities. The pilot programme will allow the local authorities participating to determine the ways in which this is done, reflecting local circumstance. Contemporary music has a special ability to engage and enthuse the young and I expect it to play an important part in the pilot activities.</p>

  <p>Housing benefit administration is a matter for the UK Government. Local authorities in Scotland have a statutory duty to administer housing benefit and council tax benefit under social security legislation and are funded by the UK Government for doing this.</p>

  <p>All authorities are expected to secure Best Value by the pursuit of continuous improvement across the full range of their activities. The Local Government in Scotland Bill, introduced on 16 May, will give statutory backing to the duty of Best Value and the audit regime which supports it.</p>

  <p>Radiotherapy is a highly specialised form of cancer treatment which is available only in cancer centres. Linear accelerators are the equipment through which radiotherapy is delivered. These are sited in each of Scotland&#8217;s five cancer centres in Inverness, Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow (NHS boards Highland, Grampian, Tayside, Lothian and Glasgow respectively). There are currently 18 linear accelerators, as follows:</p>

  <p>Two additional linear accelerators are being installed in the Beatson Oncology Centre in Glasgow during the course of this year, bringing the total there to 10 and the national total to 20.</p>

  <p>The Royal College of Radiologists recommends that there should be five linear accelerators per million population. Scotland&#8217;s current total is equivalent to 3.5 per million population. With the additional two machines in Glasgow this will rise to 3.9 per million population by the end of 2002.</p>

  <p>A further wave of central purchasing (Wave 4) is currently being planned that, subject to the required investment appraisal process by NHS boards, will see a further six machines being commissioned. Two of these would be replacements but the other four are additional to current numbers.</p>

  <p>Section 24 (1) of the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill requires each local authority to establish at least one local access forum in its area. Section 24 (2) sets down the functions of these forums as being "to advise the local authority and any other person or body consulting the forum on matters having to do with the exercise of access rights or the drawing up and adoption of a plan for a system of core paths". It is also intended that <strong> </strong> forums may assist in the resolution of disputes about the exercise of access rights, the drawing up and adoption of core path plans or the use of core paths.</p>

  <p>Tackling waiting at all stages of the patient&#8217;s journey is a key priority for the Scottish Executive. That is why extra resources have been made available to help NHSScotland to reduce waiting times.

These local standards will reflect local priorities and focus on tackling the longest waits for outpatients clinics and diagnostic tests.</p>

  <p>We do not have a central record of all information held by each division within the Scottish Executive and one could only be provided, and maintained, at disproportionate cost. However, through the <i>Code of Practice on Access to Scottish Executive Information, </i> Scottish ministers emphasise the importance we attach to making factual information as widely available as possible. To that end, copies of key Scottish Executive publications such as consultation papers, White Papers, annual reports and departmental circulars are made available to the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>All police authorities have indicated at some point, either formally or informally, that additional funding for extra officers would be beneficial to their communities.</p>

  <p>Since April 2000, additional special grant of &#163;8.1 million per year has been allocated to forces to provide for the recruitment of extra officers. Funding for the police service in Scotland is at an all time high, as are police numbers. There are now 15,251 officers (as at 31 March 2002). There are in addition 5,535 whole time equivalent civilian support staff.</p>

  <p>To arrive at the distribution of Grant Aided Expenditure for 2002-03, forces were invited to submit detailed estimates of their needs for the current year assuming no change in the levels of service provided by the police. Budgets were submitted via the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland and the funding settlement for 2002-03 enabled the bids to be met in full.</p>

  <p>Scottish Executive and BEAR Scotland Ltd are aware of the condition of the A830 which has been caused mainly by the wet weather and the freeze/thaw conditions over last winter. The action to repair potholes and undertake patching on the route has ensured it has remained safe.</p>

  <p>Mallaig Community Council wrote to the Scottish Executive on 12 May 2002 expressing concerns about the A830 and a reply confirmed that a structural maintenance scheme was programmed to be implemented in the autumn. Meantime, an interim strategy to undertake urgent repairs and increase the frequency of safety inspections has been formulated to ensure road safety is maintained.</p>

  <p>In addition to the repairs already carried out, further extensive patching works have been identified and will be implemented shortly.</p>

  <p>In recognition of the importance of this route, consultations have started with some of the interested parties on the optimum timing of the proposed works.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-25402 by Lewis Macdonald on 10 May 2002, whether it will place copies of the two contracts, including the alterations referred to, with BEAR Scotland Ltd for the management and maintenance of the north west and north east units in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre; whether it will give a detailed breakdown of the additional costs to be paid to BEAR for the additional responsibilities as a result of these contract alterations, and what these costs will cover, how they will be calculated and why they are required.</p>

  <p>A generic copy of the contract document applicable to all four management and maintenance contracts is already available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 16573). The minor alterations to the two contracts with BEAR Scotland Ltd came into effect when the Executive wrote formally to BEAR. The majority of these alterations have not as yet been recorded in the individual contract documents. When they are, arrangements will be made for the generic copy to be amended.</p>

  <p>The minor alterations include improved communications with the National Driver Information and Control System (NADICS), new provision for direct communications between BEAR and the press and MSPs/MPs, and increased safety inspections on some routes.</p>

  <p>It would not be appropriate to publish details of the additional costs to be paid to BEAR as a result of these minor alterations because of commercial and contractual considerations. However, the costs are not significant in comparison with the existing contract costs.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to ensuring that each public body is subject to a regular policy and financial management review. A review of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) will start in June 2002. The terms of reference for the review will be:</p>

  <p>To examine the role and functions of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the effectiveness and efficiency with which these functions are carried out. The review will:</p>

  <p>consider how effectively SEPA has performed since it was established and seek the views of a range of stakeholders on its performance;</p>

  <p>consider how well SEPA responds to the policies and priorities of the Scottish ministers and if the level of delegation to SEPA from the Scottish Executive is sufficient and appropriate;</p>

  <p>examine the role of SEPA in relation to other bodies with responsibilities for environmental protection and regulation;</p>

  <p>identify ways of improving the service that SEPA provides to local communities and regulated organisations;</p>

  <p>examine the policies and practices of SEPA in relation to the charges it levies for its regulatory service;</p>

  <p>look at ways of improving the system of environmental permits and emissions monitoring, and</p>

  <p>identify the key issues that need to be addressed to allow SEPA to meet the challenges posed by the shifting focus of environmental legislation.</p>

  <p>The review will be expected to make recommendations to the Scottish ministers in all of the key areas outlined above.</p>

  <p>The review will be informed by other relevant reviews, in particular the recent quinquennial review of the Environment Agency in England and Wales and the December 2000 Audit Scotland report <i>A Measure of Protection</i>.</p>

  <p>These terms of reference take account of the outcome of the 2001 Public Bodies Review, which concluded that there was no fundamental change needed to the functions and structure of SEPA. The Public Bodies Review made cross-cutting recommendations relevant to all public bodies; the implementation of these recommendations in relation to SEPA will be considered as part of the review.</p>

  <p>As an essential part of the review process, officials will be consulting widely with interested parties. It is intended to hold a stakeholder event early in the review to help define the detailed scope and identify the key questions to be answered in the review, within the broad terms of reference.</p>

  <p>The Business Improvement Plan aims to improve facilities management services in the Executive and reduce costs by &#163;2.1 million per annum. Over the period 2002-03 to 2004-05 a number of changes will be made to the organisation of facilities services within the Executive, to contracts which support this work and the way in which staff gain access to services. The Executive offers a wide range of interesting and challenging careers and aims to maintain continuity of employment and offer development opportunities to all its staff. Every effort will therefore be made to ensure that staff surpluses do not arise and redundancies are avoided through establishing staff preferences, re-skilling, retraining and redeployment.</p>

  <p>No, the Scottish Transport Group is not obliged to lay the report and accounts of the individual pension schemes before Parliament.

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to looking at lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues as part of its wider work on mainstreaming equality and promoting equal opportunities.</p>

  <p>Following a meeting with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) communities in autumn 2001 the, then, Minister for Health asked officials to convene a discussion forum to ensure that the particular health needs of these communities were identified and addressed. The group has met on three occasions and an agreed programme of work is now under way.</p>

  <p>For young people, personal and social education offers opportunities to explore issues surrounding gender stereotypes, equal opportunities and discrimination, respect and caring both for self and others, and respect for individual differences.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what consideration it has given to (a) introducing "rucksack" funding packages for children with special educational needs, which follow the child throughout his or her education, and (b) funding such packages centrally.</p>

  <p>We have no plans to introduce such arrangements.</p>

  <p>The majority of funding for special educational needs provision is provided to local authorities through grant-aided expenditure and is so allocated to allow authorities to deliver effective provision, which takes account of local needs and circumstances and economies of scale. Within the funding available to them local authorities can implement integrated packages of education and care, including joint funding arrangements agreed with other agencies, for individual children with special educational needs.</p>

  <p>Note:</p>

  <p>In addition to the in-service training funding above for teachers and other staff, a further &#163;1,079,450 has been allocated for training for educational psychologists each year. This funding is allocated to local authorities on the basis of trainee placements sponsored.</p>

  <p>SEN Innovation Grant Programme funding cannot be broken down by local authority area because grants are awarded to voluntary and non-statutory organisations to carry out projects in the field of special educational needs. Some of these projects will be carried out across Scotland on a national basis, whilst others will be carried out in local areas.</p>

  <p>Funding is allocated directly to the seven grant-aided special schools, and not direct to local authorities, and these schools are open to pupils from across Scotland. &#163;8.8 million has been allocated to these grant-aided special schools for 2002-03.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to announce that we are publishing the third Scottish Executive Statistics Plan, for 2002-03, for consultation today. We received a number of useful comments on the first two plans, which have influenced the development of our proposals for 2002-03. Executive staff have also contributed fully to the development of the second UK National Statistics Work Programme. This includes significant proposals for the development of the Scottish Executive Statistics, while our own plan gives more details.</p>

  <p>We remain committed to making available high quality statistics which meet the needs of users and support informed decision making.</p>

  <p>I am placing a copy of the Scottish Executive Statistics Plan in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre and additional copies are available in the Document Supply Centre.</p>

  <p>We currently provide support for different forms of advice and information either to support national organisations to improve the infrastructure for advice, or targeted locally at primary provision. For example, we recently allocated &#163;3 million per annum in additional resources to local authorities to secure the expansion of local money advice services, including provision by the voluntary sector.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive <strong> </strong> currently provides financial support for advice and information either to support national organisations to improve the infrastructure for advice, or targeted locally at primary provision.</p>

  <p>Local authorities and other public bodies take on a major role in supporting local advice provision, in accordance with local need or the particular remit and responsibility of the public body.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive <a name="QuestionText">how voluntary sector organisations meet their central overhead costs and whether it envisages any role for public sector partners in meeting these costs.</a></p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-05-28.47.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80144" speakername="Ms Margaret Curran" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0528.htm#QuestionText">

  <p>Voluntary organisations meet their central overhead costs through a range of funding mechanisms, including grant funding, and income from donations and trading, rents and investments. The Scottish Executive itself provides core funding for a range of organisations including the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations (SCVO) and Volunteer Development Scotland.</p>

  <p>Following on from its review of direct funding, the Executive is committed to conducting a strategic review of funding for the voluntary sector that will look at how public funding meets the needs of the sector. This review will consider whether it is possible for all funders of the sector to work together to ensure that they are operating in a way that meets their own needs and those of the sector. The review is due to commence in the summer, and discussions on how best to take work forward are taking place with SCVO and COSLA.</p>
