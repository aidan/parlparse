  <p>The reference to the establishment of regional advisory committees in the European Commission&#8217;s Green Paper on the future of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) reflects the hard work already undertaken by UK fisheries departments and the UK fishing industry.</p>

  <p>The Executive has also promoted the idea of a strengthened regional dimension to the CFP with its contacts from other member states. In particular, amongst northern states, familiar with the way in which the various stock recovery plans have been developed, there is an increasing recognition of the benefits of a more regional and inclusive approach.</p>

  <p>Services, such as gas, electricity and water can gain access to the countryside where repair/maintenance work is deemed essential.

  <p>The Scottish Executive undertakes continuous review and revision of the building regulations and their associated Technical Standards. As part of this regular updating of standards, the sixth amendment to the Building Standards (Scotland) Regulations 1990 will be published in September this year. The package of proposed amendments to regulations will include higher thermal insulation standards for all new buildings.</p>

  <p>More generally, following the issue in April 2000 of an initial consultation paper, <i>Improving Building Standards</i>, a review team has considered all the responses and further evidence provided, and has considered a range of specific issues in detail, including quality in construction and enforcement. I expect to consider the report of the review team in the summer, after which it is expected that a Green Paper will be issued.</p>

  <p>Consumer protection is a reserved matter, and the UK Government has encouraged these organisations to improve their inspection regimes.</p>

  <p>Building standards are a devolved matter, and I expect that a Green Paper on this matter will be issued later this year.</p>

  <p>CSA running costs for the functions transferred were estimated to be &#163;7.3 million per annum as compared to the &#163;8.7 million running costs incurred by health boards. Projected savings, therefore, were &#163;1.4 million per annum. The estimated timing of these savings, however, was difficult to judge as a significant part were in fixed overheads rather than transferable revenues and so, in recognition of this, the amounts transferred from health boards was abated by &#163;1.3 million to &#163;6 million. This meant the value of the savings was passed immediately to the NHS.</p>

  <p>A variety of factors affect waiting times. There is no evidence that in-patient and day case waiting times in Glasgow are poorer than those for Scotland as a whole. Across Scotland, almost 50% of patients wait less than a month for treatment, and over 80% of patients who go on to the waiting list are treated within three months.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&#8217;s commitment to reducing waiting at every stage of the patient&#8217;s journey and to ensuring that journey is as swift and responsive as possible is reaffirmed in <i>Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change</i>. The NHS in Glasgow shares this commitment and is moving this agenda forward for the benefit of patients in its area.</p>

  <p>In response to early recommendations from the independent Review Group on the Retention of Organs at Post-Mortem, which I set up under the chairmanship of Professor Sheila McLean to advise the Executive on this highly sensitive issue, the Chief Executive of the NHS in Scotland wrote to all Trusts on 17 January indicating that they should nominate a fully-trained member of staff to deal with such inquiries and to set up a dedicated telephone line for that purpose.</p>

  <p>Both that letter and a subsequent communication from the Chief Medical Officer have re-iterated the advice contained in the review group&#8217;s report on the first phase of its work, which stressed the need for maximum sensitivity on the part of NHS staff when dealing with such inquiries. The quality of each Trust&#8217;s response is being monitored.</p>

  <p>Information is also given to callers, where appropriate, about the general support and bereavement counselling which are available.</p>

  <p>As indicated in the answer to question S1W-14159, inquiries are being handled by existing staff of NHS Trusts who are familiar with the issues involved. Yorkhill NHS Trust, which has dealt with the great majority of inquiries, has taken on an additional member of staff specifically to deal with these.</p>

  <p>Further assistance, where needed, is being provided in the main by voluntary support groups, who are particularly well placed to fill that role.</p>

  <p>We do not anticipate any significant changes in overall staff numbers over the coming year.</p>

  <p>Last December I announced to Parliament that detailed reviews of the Edinburgh operations of six public bodies would be undertaken to individual timetables based on lease breaks and other operational factors. In accordance with this timetable we aim to be in a position to make decisions on the location of the Scottish Public Pensions Agency, the Health Education Board for Scotland and <strong></strong>sportscotland by 31 March 2002, with a decision on the Common Service Agency of the NHS in Scotland by mid-2002.</p>

  <p>I also announced at that time that the Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care and the Scottish Social Services Council would not be located in Edinburgh. Mr Chisholm announced on 6 March that the national offices of these two new bodies will - if the Parliament passes the necessary legislation to enable them to be established - be located in Dundee. Decisions on regional offices for the commission will be announced shortly.</p>

  <p>The policy does not target specific areas but considers locations throughout Scotland that best fit the particular needs of each case.</p>

  <p>There is no initial teacher education qualification in special educational needs. Gaelic-medium is not a separately identified funding subject group.</p>

  <p>This does not take account of student support or payment of tuition fees by the Student Awards Agency for Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive supports the policy of phased withdrawal of reliefs offered to charities. As the Deputy Minister for Environment and Rural Development indicated on 4 April, the Scottish Executive recognises the concerns of a number of organisations about the immediate impact of the first phase of withdrawals this year, and we are in contact with the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations on this.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to make an overall assessment of the impact on such a large number of diverse organisations. Reliefs are being phased out over a number of years to allow organisations time to adjust to higher charges.</p>
