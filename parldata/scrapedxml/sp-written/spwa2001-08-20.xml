  <p>I refer the member to my announcement on 2 August of an additional &#163;5.51 million for VisitScotland for the purposes of marketing Scotland. Funding for VisitScotland has increased by 95% since February 2000, and is now at a record level of over &#163;37 million. It is for VisitScotland to determine how its funding should be used to promote Scotland. The promotion of direct access routes is an important part of its strategy. Edinburgh and Lothians Tourist Board is responsible for the promotion of Edinburgh as a tourist destination.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive will continue to encourage the development of more commercial and cost effective air services to and from Scotland for the benefit of the travelling public and the Scottish economy. This is a matter that we discuss regularly with the Enterprise Networks, with VisitScotland, and with the airport operators.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-16407 by Mr Jim Wallace on 3 July 2001, where the 10,000 Gaelic translations of the census form questions were held during the census period; what steps were taken to advertise their availability; how many requests were made for copies, and what has been done with any unused copies.</p>

  <p>4,500 Gaelic translation leaflets were distributed around Scotland&#8217;s 22 census areas, broadly in proportion to the numbers of Gaelic speakers in each area. Some 3,500 were retained at census HQ to meet any demand coming to the centre and a further 2,000 were retained at the premises of the distribution contractor for immediate response to extra demand in an area.</p>

  <p>Although there was no paid advertising for the Gaelic translation leaflet, its availability was mentioned in a number of news releases concerned with the availability of translations into minority languages generally; the Registrar General made a point of referring to the available translations in broadcast interviews and there was a specific news piece carried on Radio Nan Gaidheal by one of our census district managers. In anticipation of this broadcast a further 1,000 copies of the leaflet were despatched to the area manager for the Western Isles.</p>

  <p>Generally, however, the promotion of the availability of the leaflets was devolved to the 22 census area managers throughout Scotland as part of their community liaison responsibilities and in response to demand. No specific record was kept of the take up of the leaflets but demand was not high. Authority has been given to destroy the unused copies held by area managers.</p>

  <p>The copies held at census HQ and with the distributor are currently still held there, but may soon be destroyed.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&#8217;s current Northern Isles subsidy contract with P&amp;O Scottish Ferries and the recently awarded contract with NorthLink for the period 2002-07 provides subsidy for passenger and car ferry services only.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive provides considerable financial support for the movement of livestock between Orkney, Shetland and the Scottish mainland under the Tariff Rebate Subsidy (TRS) scheme for bulk and livestock shipping. The TRS scheme provides 50% rebate on shipping costs for exporting and importing livestock. As indicated in my reply to S1W-14998 the Executive received recently the report of an evaluation of the TRS Scheme conducted by consultants. The evaluation report is being considered in detail and ministers will announce their conclusions on the review in due course. These will reflect the Executive&#8217;s commitment to maintaining essential ferry services to Orkney and Shetland and their communities.</p>

  <p>The Freight Facilities Grant scheme makes awards towards expenditure of a capital nature although the applicant&#8217;s project as a whole can include revenue elements as well. Grant is calculated in relation to the environmental benefits estimated to be saved by switching freight traffic from road to rail. Volumes of freight shifted from road to rail are monitored by the Scottish Executive over the lifetime of the project.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will investigate (a) whether the incidence of Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma in men in the Tayside area is 4.6% higher than the national average and (b) whether such incidence could be directly related to the emission of dioxins from the Baldovie waste incinerator, as stated by Friends of the Earth Scotland.</p>

  <p>Figures from the Scottish Cancer Registration System confirm that during the period 1988-1997 cases of Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma for men living in Tayside were indeed 4.6% higher than the national average. However, the incidence for women living in the same area during this period was 6.4% <u>lower</u> than the national average. These variations from the national averages are within the range of normal fluctuations. There is no reason to believe that exposure to environmental factors in a particular locality would increase the risk in men but not in women. The Executive therefore has no plans for an investigation at this time.</p>

  <p>1. Budgets include both revenue and capital allocations. Capital allocations in particular can vary considerably from year to year. The inclusion of capital allocations and other allocations of a non-recurring nature mean that year-on-year comparisons are not, therefore, necessarily comparing like-for-like.</p>

  <p>2. 2001-02 budget is allocation to date. Further allocations will be made in-year.</p>

  <p>My department received 13,718 claims. A small number have been either rejected, because they did not fulfil the basic criteria of the scheme, or withdrawn by the applicants. This left some 13,535 claims to be paid and to date 13,343 have been paid in full (98.6%). The claims awaiting settlement are typically the more difficult cases involving cross-border claimants, business transfers and are made up of: 100 (0.7%) where the claimants have already received the minimum payable under the scheme using the transitional payment arrangements (more commonly called the safety net) and 92 (0.7%) where the claimants have yet to have their payments calculated. In both cases, my officials are liasing closely with the appropriate parties whether they be other administrations or claimants in order to get these claims paid as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>No such monitoring is carried out. Our proposals to introduce a new Renewables Obligation (Scotland) on all licensed suppliers to significantly increase the amount of electricity supplied from renewable sources is already creating a real demand for new renewable energy schemes and equipment in Scotland. This has already led to the recent decision by Vestas, the Danish wind turbine manufacturer, to set up a factory near Campbeltown, and we will continue to work with Scottish Enterprise to ensure that Scotland benefits economically as well as environmentally from the development of our considerable renewable energy resource.</p>

  <p>There are a number of ways in which the issue of providing access to indoor training facilities for elite athletes is being addressed.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Institute of Sport has nine programme sports for which it will provide not only a full time coach but also a programme budget which allows, among many other things, payment to be made to local partners for access to facilities. Institute athletes are on holistic training programmes which cover their sporting needs and their need for indoor and all-weather training is dealt with in this context. A similar system exists for athletes identified at an area institute level who all have access to facilities in their local area as part of a holistic training programme. In addition, individual elite athletes can receive awards from the Lottery Sports Fund Talented Athlete Programme which allows them to buy time in appropriate facilities. The younger athletes are supported through the Junior Groups aspect of this programme.</p>

  <p><strong></strong>sportscotland provides support to governing bodies through their development grant aid process which can be used for national squad training. <strong></strong>sportscotland also has ongoing dialogue with local authorities and with the Scottish Athletics Federation about the provision of adequate national facilities for athletics.</p>

  <p>In addition to this support from <strong></strong>sportscotland, many local authorities still run independent, free or reduced cost access schemes for athletes performing at a national level.</p>

  <p><i>Sport 21</i> recommended that local authorities should publish a strategic plan for sport and recreation for their areas. Such strategies are expected to include a playing field strategy as recommended in the National Planning Policy Guideline 11 on sport and recreation (NPPG 11). In a recent address to the Scottish Association of Directors of Leisure Services, I called on local authorities to quicken the pace in taking this work forward. <strong></strong> sportscotland stands ready to assist local authorities with this work and is currently developing practical guidance on preparing playing field strategies.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Executive is investing &#163;300,000 to enable <strong></strong>sportscotland to conduct, over the next two years, an audit of the condition of Scotland&#8217;s stock of sports facilities. The results will inform strategies and plans for meeting future needs including those for pitch sports.</p>

  <p>We are still developing our policy on the implementation of the EC Water Framework Directive. The full resource implications are not likely to be clear for some time.</p>

  <p>However, additional grant-in-aid, totalling some &#163;16.5 million over the 3-year period 2001-02 to 2003-04, has been announced for the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA). The extra grant-in-aid takes account of the increased responsibilities and duties that will fall to SEPA in implementing European and domestic legislation and in fulfilling the Executive&#8217;s Programme for Government commitments. This includes preparatory work for the implementation of the EC Water Framework Directive.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive which of the two aims of providing value for money or meeting statutory requirements, as referred to in page 188 of <i>The Scottish Budget</i> , carries the higher priority in Scotland&#8217;s water and sewerage service.</p>

  <p>The Scottish water authorities have made substantial progress since 1996 in delivering value for money, and further improvements will be required during the next strategic review period.</p>
