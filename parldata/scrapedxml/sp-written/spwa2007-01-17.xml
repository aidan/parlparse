  <p>A wide range of materials and expert guidance supporting improvement is made available by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) and Learning and Teaching Scotland.</p>

  <p>The specific support and expert advice offered to schools will be dependent on the circumstances of the school and local authority in question. In appropriate cases, HMIE inspectors will monitor the measures taken by schools and by local authorities to address weaknesses highlighted in their inspection reports.</p>

  <p>Guidance was issued to local authorities on devolved school management in February 2006 and it is for them to determine what is included in their schemes. However, everything that can reasonably be devolved to head teachers should be, and certainly up to 90% of relevant budgets, in line with our Partnership Agreement commitment.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-28342 by Patricia Ferguson on 9 September 2002, whether it will list any feudal superiorities in Scotland owned by Prince Charles, Duke of Rothes, in his role as the Prince and Steward of Scotland, as referred to in Schedule 5 of the Scotland Act 1998.</p>

  <p>The feudal system of land tenure in Scotland was brought to an end on 28 November 2004 when the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 was fully brought into force. On that date, all superiority interests in land were extinguished. Section 58 of the Act applies the provisions in the act to The Crown and the Prince and Steward of Scotland. Therefore, the Prince and Steward of Scotland does not now own any feudal superiorities.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it is satisfied that the Department of Trade and Industry&rsquo;s Appropriate Assessment of the 24th Oil and Gas Licensing Round will ensure that oil licensing adjacent to the Moray Firth Special Area of Conservation will not be in breach of the EU Habitats Directive and what representations it has made on the matter.</p>

  <p>In accordance with Article 6 of the Habitats Directive, the Department for Trade and Industry as the competent authority, must satisfy themselves that any exploration licence issued under the 24th licensing round will not have an adverse effect on the integrity of any European Site, including the Moray Firth Special Area of Conservation (SAC). The Scottish Executive has been kept fully informed.</p>

  <p>Article 6 (3) of the Habitats Directive requires that &quot;any plan or project not directly connected with or necessary to the management of a site but likely to have a significant effect thereon either individually or in combination with other plans or projects, shall be subject to an appropriate assessment of its implications for the site.&quot; As the consenting authority, the DTI have undertaken an appropriate assessment which was published (in draft) on their website in October 2006. The assessment concluded that the 24th licensing round will not have an adverse effect on the integrity of any European Site (SPA or SAC), and therefore there is no obligation under the Habitats Directive or any other enabling legislation to withhold consent for the 24th Licensing Round.</p>
