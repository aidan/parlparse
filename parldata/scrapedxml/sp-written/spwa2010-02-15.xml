  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what systems NHS Health Scotland has inhouse for monitoring the effectiveness of its corporate communications activity with MSPs; what changes have been made recently as a direct result of such monitoring, and when NHS Health Scotland will share this information with MSPs and other stakeholders.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government can confirm that NHS Health Scotland does not monitor the effectiveness of its corporate communications, but monitors the effectiveness of its campaigns across a wide range of audiences. NHS Health Scotland does this through tracking awareness and understanding among the target audience, feedback from NHS partners, number of opportunities to see of advertising, visits to campaign websites, media coverage, programme mentioned in a parliamentary question, motion or debate, visits to road shows and NHS24 helpline enquiries. This information is used to develop subsequent phases of the campaign in terms of creative approaches and channels used. Information on each campaign is shared with campaign partners and can be made available on request.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government can confirm that the Directorate of Equalities and Planning within NHS Health Scotland has ensured there is a mandatory equality and diversity questionnaire which forms part of all tender documentation considered by the organisation. Contracts and agency appointments are all tested through rigorous procurement procedures. This includes taking account of principles of equal treatment and non-discrimination in the tendering process. The pre-qualification questions are all compliant with the directives contained within the Public Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2006 and EU Procurement legislation. This tender documentation is derived directly from the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Procurement toolkit.</p>

  <p>We will not know how many nurses will graduate during 2010 until they have graduated. However, we do not expect the numbers to vary greatly from those of the previous three years. I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-31151 on 3 February 2010 which contains that information.</p>
