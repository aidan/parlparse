  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what its response was to the latest recommendation from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea that a total ban on cod catching in Scottish waters be implemented by the European Union.</p>

  <p>The situation on cod remains serious. However, the latest scientific advice does suggest that for North Sea cod fishing mortality has declined and the stock can recover. The European Commission has already indicated that it will propose significant across the board cuts in total allowable catches and days at sea. We believe that such cuts would be disproportionate and that a more targeted approach is necessary. This approach should include measures which shift the burden of further efforts to secure cod recovery away from the main whitefish fleet to the secondary cod fisheries where the problems of discarding remain significant.</p>

  <p>The Standing Orders of the Scottish Parliament require all bills on introduction to be accompanied by a Financial Memorandum which sets out the best estimates of the administrative, compliance and other costs to which the provisions of the bill would give rise, best estimates of the timescales over which such costs would be expected to arise, and an indication of the margins of uncertainty in such estimates. The Financial Memorandum must distinguish separately such costs as would fall upon (a) the Scottish administration, (b) local authorities and (c) other bodies, individuals and businesses.
