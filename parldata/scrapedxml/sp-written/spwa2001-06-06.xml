<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2001-06-06.5.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80223" speakername="Peter Peacock" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-01/wa0606.htm#c2">

  <p>Best Value is currently being taken forward on a voluntary basis in Scotland, and as such there are no formal &quot;requirements&quot; placed on local authorities by legislation or by the Scottish Executive with which local authorities must comply. Nevertheless, all authorities are expected to undertake a rolling programme of Best Value service reviews, to engage with and make comparative information on performance available to stakeholders and to plan for continuous improvement. These are in line with voluntary undertakings made in 1998.</p>

  <p>Local authorities are subject to inspection and audit arrangements which have been amended to accommodate Best Value scrutiny. Audit Scotland, on behalf of the Accounts Commission, annually consider the results of a &quot;Performance Management and Planning&quot; audit in each local council and publish an overview report. Inspection reports by HM Inspectorate of Education, the Social Work Services Inspectorate, HM Inspectorate of Constabulary, the Fire Services Inspectorate and the Benefits Fraud Inspectorate make comment on Best Value where it is considered appropriate. The new inspections of the education functions of local authorities are conducted within a framework of quality indicators which have been designed to embody Best Value policy.</p>

  <p>In the future we intend to succeed the current voluntary regime by placing authorities under a duty to secure Best Value and we have already announced our intention to publish proposals for legislation on Best Value in the autumn.</p>

  <p>The Motorola task force, comprising representatives from Scottish Enterprise Edinburgh and Lothian, the Employment Service, West Lothian Council, the Careers Service and the Benefits Agency have been in regular contact with the company with a view to supporting those workers who are losing their jobs.</p>

  <p>200 employees, approximately 6.5% of the workforce, have been granted early release in order to take up new employment. A further 50 employees, 1.6% of the workforce, are currently on job-specific training and are guaranteed employment when the training ends.</p>

  <p>The figures do not take into account those employees who have a job offer but have not yet left Motorola. We hope to have a more complete picture when the tracking scheme for employees comes into effect.</p>

  <p>Whilst it is almost two years since the last suspected ISA cases, we cannot entirely rule out the possibility of further outbreaks, which could again threaten the viability of some fish farming companies. The scheme will thus remain open for applications from such affected companies until spring 2002. We will, however, review the spending position later this year.</p>

  <p>The budget for the ISA Re-Start Scheme was &pound;9 million. No applications were approved during 1999-2000 as EC state aids approval was not obtained until May 2000. The value of applications approved during 2000-01 was &pound;2.9 million. Those still under consideration during the current year could, if approved, amount to a further &pound;1.4 million.</p>

  <p>Scottish Homes currently own approximately 1,000 rented properties in the Central Scotland electoral region. Following enactment of the Housing (Scotland) Bill, any remaining properties will continue to be owned by Scottish Homes, operating as a residuary body, until such time as they are transferred to other social landlords.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Qualifications Authority will always endeavour to alert schools to course changes as early as it can. Unfortunately, in the case of Standard Grade Technological Studies, this was not possible until May. While I understand the difficulties this causes, the alternative would have been to delay changes for another session and thereby deny teachers access to new resource materials and pupils the opportunity to study the newly developed contemporary course.</p>

  <p>Details of the arrangements for collecting the Graduate Endowment are being finalised in discussions between the Scottish Executive and the Student Loans Company. However, the view of the Student Loans Company to date has been that, as the number of liable students expected to leave the UK after graduating will be relatively small, the cost of collecting the endowment from them does not merit calculating it separately.</p>
