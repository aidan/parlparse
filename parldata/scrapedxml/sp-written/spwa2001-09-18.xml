  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what Audit Scotland&#8217;s role is in determining whether local authorities are delivering best value and what criteria are used by Audit Scotland.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2001-09-18.1.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80192" speakername="Angus MacKay" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-01/wa0918.htm#se_Minister">

  <p>Audit Scotland and the Accounts Commission (on whose behalf it works) have played a central role since 1997 in developing the Best Value framework, in monitoring its implementation and in working closely with relevant inspectorates to secure a joined-up approach to Best Value scrutiny.</p>

  <p>In addition, Audit Scotland collects and assesses a range of statutory performance indicators each year, covering the full range of local authority services. These allow comparative assessment to be made about the impact of Best Value not only within an authority over time but between authorities at any one time.</p>

  <p>In assessing local authority performance, Audit Scotland looks for evidence against the following 10 criteria:</p>

  <p>That members and officers show clear leadership on best value</p>

  <p>That they are responsive to stakeholders</p>

  <p>That they carry our best value reviews</p>

  <p>That they have detailed and realistic plans to achieve their aims</p>

  <p>That they make the best use of their staff</p>

  <p>That they make the best use of their assets</p>

  <p>That they have sound financial control and reporting</p>

  <p>That they actively support continuous improvement</p>

  <p>That they monitor and control overall performance</p>

  <p>That they have an effective approach to public performance reporting.</p>

  <p>We already have. On 21 March this year I announced that the Executive was setting up a working group to review existing advice to schools and education authorities on the safe use of the internet. At the same time, the Executive wrote to education authorities with guidance on implementing current targets for pupil e-mail addresses. The guidance suggested that for younger pupils in primary schools, schools might consider class e-mail addresses more appropriate than individual ones. It also underlined the need to have appropriate technical and human checks in place to protect pupils. The working group has been asked to consider issues relating to the safe use of e-mail, and I expect to receive its report in October.</p>

  <p>There is no evidence to indicate that higher levels of dioxins are emitted when recycled liquid fuel is used to provide energy in cement kilns compared with emissions from purpose-built incinerators. The use of this type of fuel in cement kilns is treated by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) as a process of co-incineration falling within the scope of the EC hazardous waste incineration directive. That directive requires a dioxin limit of 0.1 nanogrammes per cubic metre for hazardous waste incinerators. This is the same limit that SEPA applies to purpose-built incinerators.</p>

  <p>The recycling of waste products into fuels that are useable in processes such as cement production reduces the demand for raw materials and helps to conserve fossil fuel resources.</p>

  <p>The Executive has no plans to commission an analysis of the production processes at the Dunbar plant. The toxicity of substances used in building materials is controlled through environmental and health and safety legislation. Responsibility for assessing the effectiveness of monitoring procedures for emissions at particular sites lies with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and for occupational health matters with the Health and Safety Executive.</p>

  <p>This area of work is now the responsibility of the Food Standards Agency (FSA) which informs me that it currently has no plans to commission a study of food and feedstuffs produced in the vicinity of the Blue Circle cement factory.</p>

  <p>However, I am advised that the FSA, in its role as a statutory consultee of the regulator SEPA (the Scottish Environment Protection Agency), will shortly be reviewing the operations carried out by Blue Circle at Dunbar in the context of the company&#8217;s application for a permit under the terms of the Pollution Prevention and Control (Scotland) Regulations 2000.</p>

  <p>If the agency has concerns about the impact of emissions on the food chain, it will advise SEPA accordingly and will, if necessary, recommend that additional safeguards be instituted.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the Scottish Environment Protection Agency&#8217;s recommended level is of authorised emissions of dioxins to air from cement factories burning waste known as &quot;recycled liquid fuel&quot; and what levels are recommended by the World Health Organisation and EU respectively.</p>

  <p>The use of substitute liquid fuel in a cement kiln is treated by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency as a process of co-incineration falling within the scope of the EC hazardous waste incineration directive. That directive requires a dioxin limit of 0.1 nanogrammes per cubic metre for hazardous waste incinerators.</p>

  <p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) does not set standards for emissions from processes. WHO standards for dioxins are in terms of tolerable daily intakes or TDIs. The main source of these intakes is our food. The WHO currently recommends a TDI of between 1 and 4 picogrammes of dioxins per kilogramme of body weight. The European Union&#8217;s Scientific Committee on Food defines its recommended limits on intake in terms of a tolerable weekly intake which is currently set at 14 picogrammes of dioxins per kilogramme of body weight. For the UK, limits on intake are currently subject to consideration by the Food Standards Agency&#8217;s committee on toxicity of chemicals in food, consumer products and the environment.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-15536 by Rhona Brankin on 16 May 2001, whether it will list the fishing gear research projects commissioned, under way or completed, in each case detailing the cost, outline aims of the project and the name of the organisation carrying out the research.</p>

  <p>In my answer to question S1W-15536, I referred to an additional &#163;1 million for collaborative research which would benefit those fishermen whose vessels were used for trials as well as benefiting fishermen in the longer term.</p>

  <p>A partnership board has been set up between scientists and leaders of the fishing industry which has identified and agreed upon suitable trials for the additional research money. The trials include both gear research projects and biological or stock research projects.</p>

  <p>The table sets out the details of the research projects agreed to date, organised by all three research organisations (Fisheries Research Services (FRS), North Atlantic Fisheries College (NAFC) and Sea Fish Industry Authority (SFIA)).</p>

  <p>It is important to note that some of the figures are estimates and are subject to a degree of variability. Until all the projects have been completed, the costs cannot be defined precisely. The Executive expects that the full amount will be spent in due course.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the railway sleepers used for the cremation of animals slaughtered in the course of the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak came from existing stocks held in Scotland prior to the outbreak of the disease and, if they did not, from where they were sourced, when they were ordered, and when they arrived in the UK.</p>

  <p>Information from the contractor engaged to construct pyres in Scotland during the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak indicates that around 70,000 new softwood sleepers were used, 5,000 of which were imported from Austria and Belgium. This accounted for the wood used at just under 40 per cent of the pyres, the remainder being supplied with forestry timbers sourced in Britain. It is not possible to identify what proportion of either of these materials was sourced from stock held in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The assessed cost in respect of each year of future service is 0.3 per cent of the public service pay bill. If the change was also to apply in respect of all past service of current members, the further cost is assessed as 3 per cent of the pay bill.</p>

  <p>A wide range of training opportunities is already available to staff in further education colleges which addresses the teaching of students with disabilities and supporting their special educational needs.</p>

  <p>In response to a recommendation of the Beattie committee, which examined the needs of young people who require additional support to make the transition to post-school education and training or employment, the Scottish Executive is making funds available to establish and operate a national co-ordinating centre. The purpose of the centre is to improve, by the provision of advice, training and staff development, the expertise of staff in further education colleges in identifying, assessing and meeting the needs of students with disabilities and special educational needs.</p>

  <p>Public/private partnerships have a significant role to play in our strategy for improving the school stock and the learning and teaching environment for our pupils and teachers.</p>

  <p>Ten education authorities in Scotland are already guaranteed financial support for school PPP projects under an arrangement which was agreed in 1998. Many pupils and teachers are already enjoying new or refurbished school accommodation as a result of that support and further projects which attracted that support are either under way or due to start soon.</p>

  <p>It is important to maintain the momentum and I shall, therefore, be providing more revenue support to local authorities in Scotland so that further school PPP contracts may be taken forward. As was the case in 1998, authorities who have proposals for school PPP projects will be invited to submit bids for the support which will be available. I envisage a date of 14 December 2001 for submission of the first round of bids, which should be in the form of outline business cases for the projects concerned. I would expect to respond to each bid and have made appropriate decisions before the end of April 2002.</p>

  <p>I shall reach a final decision on the level of financial support for this new round of PPP projects following the discussion I shall be having with council leaders on 31 October about the overall strategy for the improvement of school buildings. It is, however, likely to be similar to that which was made available for school PPP projects in 1998 and which is helping to fund building work on schools with a capital value of around &#163;500 million.</p>

  <p>Full details of the new arrangements will be issued to local authorities in the form of full bidding guidance by the end of this month. Further advice on the level of support will be issued immediately following my meeting with council leaders on 31 October.</p>

  <p>Information and general advice from the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) was taken into account during the preparation of <i>National Planning Policy Guideline (NPPG) 19: Radio Telecommunications</i> . In addition, the NRPB were specifically consulted on a draft of the NPPG.</p>

  <p>On siting and design, NPPG 19 requires &quot;operators to provide with their applications evidence that consideration has been given to siting and design options&quot;. The NPPG also requires that the installation and operation shall meet ICNIRP guidelines on exposure to radiowaves for any area where the public might reasonably gain access. Reasonable steps must be taken to exclude the public from any areas where ICNIRP guidelines might be exceeded.</p>

  <p>Operational requirements, particularly the need to limit the spread of radiowaves between the &quot;cells&quot; covered by different masts mean that operators are required to restrict these emissions to the lowest levels commensurate with effective operation of the mast. This requirement is also referred to in the NPPG.</p>

  <p>The current level of municipal waste incinerated in Scotland is around 2 per cent. The National Waste Strategy provides the framework for waste management policy in Scotland and, through the development of 11 area waste plans, will determine the best practicable environmental options for future waste management. A major objective of the strategy is to reduce the reliance on landfill, moving instead to options higher up the waste hierarchy i.e. reduction, reuse, recycling, composting and energy recovery. It would therefore be inappropriate to implement a policy of decreasing the level of waste disposal by incineration.</p>

  <p>The renewables obligation (Scotland) consultation paper issued by the Executive on 3 August 2001 sets out the policy on energy-from-waste as a source of renewable energy. Following initial consultation the Executive proposes not to support the conventional incineration of municipal waste. New, cleaner thermal technologies such as gasification and pyrolysis will be supported where these fit in with an integrated waste management system. This would involve thermal treatment only of the residues left once separation, recycling and composting has been carried out first.</p>

  <p>Copies of the consultation paper are available in the Parliament&#8217;s reference centre (Bib. no. 15597).</p>

  <p>The Executive commissioned this research to inform its consideration of the proposed European community directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment. When the terms of the directive have been finalised and a potentially suitable means of implementing it is determined the Executive will carry out a more intensive study in the form of a regulatory impact assessment.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what plans it has to introduce a producer responsibility for electrical and electronic products whereby producers bear the responsibility for the collection of end-of-life products and ensure that any waste is disposed of in an environmentally acceptable way.</p>

  <p>The Executive intends to introduce a system of producer responsibility when the terms of the proposed European community directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment have been finalised. It is too early to say what the nature of this collection and treatment scheme will be, but industry and other interests will be fully consulted before the new measures are introduced.</p>

  <p>There are no such targets. However, the proposed EC directive currently under discussion on waste electrical and electronic equipment contains recycling targets of 50 per cent-80 per cent within overall recovery targets of 70 per cent-80 per cent, depending on the nature of the waste product to be achieved within 46 months of the directive coming into force.</p>
