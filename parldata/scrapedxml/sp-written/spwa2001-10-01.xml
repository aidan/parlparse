  <p>The Executive is currently considering the Plan for Action on alcohol misuse in the light of the views expressed during consultation earlier this year. As part of work towards the plan, we are developing a framework for alcohol misuse services which will assist in local planning and commissioning.</p>

  <p>The asylum seekers dispersal programme is a matter for the Home Office since immigration and asylum are reserved. To date existing resources available to local authorities, the police, health services and further and higher education have covered the demands on devolved services arising from the asylum seekers dispersal programme. The position is, of course, being kept under review.</p>

  <p>In September 2001, I announced &#163;700,000 in additional funding for communities across Glasgow, including asylum seekers and refugees. I also announced the Executive&#8217;s intention to provide new funding of &#163;1.7 million in the current financial year, and in future financial years, for further education colleges to support a package of new measures which will strengthen the ability of the colleges to provide further education, including language skills. That sum comprises &#163;0.5 million to boost college provision specifically for asylum seekers.</p>

  <p>The package of measures will include the waiving of the residence and settlement criteria which, until now, have governed the ability of a college to claim funding and to reclaim the cost of waived fees; the provision of funding to allow colleges to provide books and support with travel, and a new discretion relating to asylum seekers which will allow colleges to approve continued studies beyond the level of basic courses.</p>

  <p>The decision of the Scottish Executive to provide &#163;1.7 million in extra resources will ensure that existing budgets can continue to be used for their original purpose without detriment to Scottish students.</p>

  <p>There was a fire on the Kincardine Bridge on the evening of 3 August 2001 on the timber jetty in the vicinity of the central pier. An electrical fault is believed to have been the cause and there was local damage to timber members as a result.</p>

  <p>A member of the public using a mobile phone raised the alarm with the fire brigade and police who attended the incident. Emergency procedures are in place between Amey Highways Ltd and the emergency services and these were followed. Amey Highways Ltd staff went to the site on being contacted by the emergency services. I understand that the fire brigade also contacted others, including Falkirk Council and Forth Ports Plc.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to question S1W-18001 lodged on 7 September 2001, what the greatest scale of nuclear emergency is in preparation for which drills have been carried out; what the nature of the supposed emergency was in this case, and what the outcome of the drill was.</p>

  <p>There is a comprehensive programme of exercises undertaken by MOD and civil agencies which are intended to test a range of scenarios. The largest scale exercise in Scotland in recent years took place at Faslane in November 1997. This involved over 7,500 participants over three days and postulated a fire leading to a radioactive leak from a submarine berthed at Faslane. A number of learning points emerged, as is the purpose of these exercises, and were referred to the appropriate organisations for follow-up action.</p>

  <p>Spending priorities are kept under regular review. These are normally run within the cycle of UK spending reviews. To maximise the output from a fixed budget it is essential that priorities are regularly scrutinised to ensure that they both meet identified needs and are affordable. We consult outside bodies on the budget using the Annual Expenditure Report and the Budget Roadshows. Departments run consultations on a range of issues as required.</p>

  <p>There are currently no provisions in Scots or UK law expressly covering liability for damage caused specifically from fields of genetically modified crops. Under the Environmental Protection Act 1990, there are powers to prosecute a consent holder where the conditions attached to a consent are breached. Liability in relation to negligence or nuisance would be a matter for the civil courts to determine.</p>

  <p>The European Commission is currently drafting an EU-wide environmental liability directive which will cover possible damage caused by the use of genetically modified organisms.</p>

  <p>An Incident Control Team was set up by Fife Health Board in February this year, when the first report of hepatitis B infection was received. A full investigation is currently under way and a report will be submitted to the board once the Incident Control Team have completed their enquiries. The report will then be assessed by the Health Department to see whether further action is needed.</p>

  <p>The Incident Control Team&#8217;s report will also be considered by the Advisory Group on Hepatitis (AGH). The AGH provides the UK Health Departments with expert advice on the prevention and control of viral hepatitis. The group will advise on whether any changes are needed to current guidance on screening NHS staff or on handling events of this kind.</p>

  <p>The Executive will take any appropriate action in the light of the group&#8217;s advice.</p>

  <p>Yes. Using the definition of settlement contained in the publication <i> Scottish Settlements &#8211; Urban and Rural Areas in Scotland</i> (a copy of which is available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre) the General Register Office for Scotland has combined West Kilbride and Seamill into a contiguous urban settlement.

  <p>The Scottish Law Commission published its <i>Report on the Law of the Tenement</i> (Scot Law Com No 162) in 1998. Following the publication of the subsequent <i>Report on Real Burdens</i> (Scot Law Com No 181) in October 2000, the Executive asked the commission to update its recommendations on the law of the tenement to take account of its subsequent work on real burdens and title conditions. This is because the management of tenements is governed by rules and conditions set out as rights and real burdens in the relevant title deeds. The modernisation and simplification of the law on real burdens will rationalise the application and enforcement of burdens on all property, including tenements. Reforming the law relating to real burdens and title conditions first will mean that reform of the law of the tenement should be more straightforward.</p>

  <p>The Executive has just completed a consultation exercise based on the commission&#8217;s draft Title Conditions Bill and the responses are currently being analysed. One of the issues which the consultation has highlighted are the problems which arise in relation to management, maintenance and repair in mixed tenure estates and blocks of flats where the local authority or other social landlord continue to have a significant holding.</p>

  <p>The underspend in 1999-2000 and 2000-01 was primarily due to the timing of expenditure on committed capital projects, including investment in prisoner accommodation and improved staff facilities.

  <p>In partnership with East Renfrewshire and South Lanarkshire Councils, we are currently considering taking forward the M77 jointly with Glasgow Southern Orbital (GSO) as a Public/Private Partnership (PPP) contract. Statutory schemes and orders have been made and land has been purchased covering the main requirements of the M77. Similarly, Scottish ministers have granted planning consent and confirmed a Compulsory Purchase Order for the GSO. Following an initial review of the PPP option, a list of contractors has been selected from whom tenders can be invited.</p>

  <p>The level of service required from Operating Companies in respect of the trunk road maintenance contracts is defined within the contract. Differing conditions of contract make direct comparisons with the previous operators difficult. However, work undertaken by the Performance Audit Group (Halcrow in association with PricewaterhouseCoopers) shows that Amey Highways Ltd is performing at least as well as the previous operators at the same stage in the earlier contracts.</p>

  <p>BT is carrying out the upgrading of exchanges to allow access to ADSL on a commercial basis, based on the company&#8217;s analysis of demand at a local level. Currently between 34% and 38% of households in Scotland are in areas served by ADSL-enabled exchanges, compared with an estimated 60% within the UK as a whole. Approximately 42% of the central belt population (Central, Lothian and Strathclyde) are served by an ADSL-enabled exchange. BT has indicated that the lower figure in Scotland reflects a relatively lower demand and higher deployment costs. Demand for ADSL is still very low in Scotland, the UK and across Europe as a whole.</p>

  <p>BT has an extensive copper-based local network, making them the only telco in Scotland in a position to offer their own ADSL product. However, ADSL is not the only higher-speed telecoms service available residentially. Cable modem is also available to a significant percentage of households, and broadband fixed wireless access licences are expected to be available shortly. Satellite coverage has potential for remoter areas, and BT has recently launched a UK-wide broadband satellite service from which the Highlands &amp; Islands will be the first to benefit with service available from November.</p>

  <p>The 54 Scottish BT exchanges due to be ADSL-enabled by September are listed by parliamentary constituency:</p>

  <p>*Households covered by ADSL by Region as % of total households. Figures supplied by BT.</p>

  <p>Figures for take-up by exchange are commercially confidential. However, of the ADSL lines currently available in Scottish enabled exchanges, 23% are taken up. This represents an average of approximately 0.4-5% of the total telecoms lines (including PSTN and ISDN) within enabled exchanges, as compared with 0.5% in enabled exchanges within the UK as a whole.</p>
