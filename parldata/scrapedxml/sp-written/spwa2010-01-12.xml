  <p>The most important concern is meeting the needs of the child, regardless of the sexual orientation of the adopters. Where adoption by same-sex couple is the best option for a child, that route should be available. The Adoption and Children (Scotland) Act 2007 which removes the prohibition on adoption by unmarried couples, including same sex couples, came into force on 28 September 2009.</p>

  <p>All children deserve a secure and stable home to grow up in. Meeting the needs of the child is the paramount concern. If an unmarried couple, regardless of their sexual orientation, is able to provide the safe, stable and secure home that a child needs then there should be no barrier to the placement of a child with them.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s position is that faith-based adoption agencies should be able to continue to operate within the teachings of their faith in order to provide an invaluable service to children who are considered hard to place.</p>

  <p>The Adoption and Children (Scotland) Act 2007 allows unmarried couples, including same sex couples, to adopt as a couple. Alongside this, the UK Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2007 make it illegal for adoption agencies to refuse to assess potential adopters on the basis of their sexual orientation unless the agency&rsquo;s charitable instrument enables it to do so.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers have issued screening decisions on 27 projects under the Environmental Impact Assessment (Agriculture) (Scotland) Regulations 2006, and the Environmental Impact Assessment (Uncultivated Land and Semi-Natural Areas) (Scotland) Regulations 2002 which they replaced. For 20 of those projects the decision was that there was no significant environmental effect; for five others it was that they were outwith the scope of the regulations. The decisions on two projects concluded that they were &quot;relevant projects&quot; likely to have a significant effect on the environment and accordingly could not be carried out without consent of the Scottish Ministers. An Environmental Statement was received for one of the proposals on 11 July 2009 and following consideration, consent was refused and the applicant notified on 4 November 2009. An Environmental Statement has not yet been received for the other project; consequently no consent decision has been made whether or not to grant consent.</p>

  <p>Details of proposals submitted for screening can be viewed on the public register maintained under regulation 7(7) (b) of the 2006 regulations on the Scottish Government website at:</p>

  <p>The Environmental Impact Assessment (Agriculture)(Scotland) Regulations 2006 contribute to protecting and enhancing the rural environment by guarding against possible negative environmental effects arising from the restructuring of rural land holdings on agricultural land and/or the use of uncultivated land and semi-natural areas for intensive agricultural purposes.</p>

  <p>Other EIA consent systems may apply to agricultural or land management activities. Exemptions to the provisions of the 2006 Regulations are provided for in Regulation 3 (2) and include projects which constitute development for which the Environmental Impact Assessment (Scotland) Regulations 1999 apply and projects as described in Regulation 3(2) of the Environmental Impact Assessment (Forestry)(Scotland) Regulations 1999.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not routinely respond to reports produced by the Royal College of Psychiatrists, although we remain interested in and take account of their findings. This report overlapped with work that the Scottish Government took forward in respect of the PHIS Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Needs Assessment Report, which was completed in August 2008.</p>

  <p>The Autistic Spectrum Disorder Reference Group worked to improve the consistency of diagnosis across Scotland by training professionals in the use of agreed diagnostic tools and issued a quality standard for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnostic services. It also published guidance to local agencies on commissioning services to ensure that these are appropriate and accessible for people with ASD.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network then published extensive guidelines on assessment, diagnosis and clinical interventions for children and young people with ASD to help doctors better diagnose and manage the condition.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is developing the carers strategy for Scotland in partnership with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA). As NHS health boards are accountable to ministers, it is not appropriate or necessary for them to have equivalent formal status. Clearly, however, they are vital contributors to the work on the strategy and some boards, including NHS Fife, are represented on one or other of the two steering groups helping to inform the development of the carers and young carers strategy. All health boards have been invited to a learning event in February to share practice on their carer information strategies and to input to the development of the carers and young carers strategy.</p>

  <p>NHS (e) Tayside has implemented some of the updated criteria but patients are returned to the waiting list after each unsuccessful cycle of infertility treatment.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what powers local authorities have to dredge watercourses.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-01-12.S3W-30225.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80301" speakername="Roseanna Cunningham" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa0112.htm#8">

  <p>Local authorities currently have powers, under section 2 of the Flood Prevention (Scotland) Act 1961, to cleanse, repair or otherwise maintain any watercourse in a due state of efficiency. Under section 4B of the act, they have a duty to do so in certain circumstances. Cleansing means the removal of mud, silt, debris or other obstructive matter from a watercourse in the ordinary course of good maintenance.</p>

  <p>These provisions will be revoked when part 4 of the Flood Risk Management (Scotland) Act 2009 is brought into effect in 2010. Local authorities will then have a general power, under section 56, to do anything to manage flood risk and, under section 59, a duty to carry out any clearance and repair works described in a schedule prepared under section 18. Clearance and repair works consist of removing obstructions, or things at significant risk of becoming obstructions, and repairing artificial structures forming part of the bed or banks of a body of water.</p>

  <p>Inappropriate dredging can cause significant damage to the ecological quality of the water environment, and destabilise rivers leading to increased upstream and downstream erosion. This can damage river banks and even undermine structures in the river channel. The scale of the effect depends on the river characteristics and the design of the works. Because of these risks, dredging requires an authorisation from SEPA under the Water Environment (Controlled Activities) (Scotland) Regulations 2005.</p>

  <p>However, where the environmental risks are low, the Regulations allow dredging to be undertaken under general binding rules. The rules, specified in CAR, set conditions on appropriate good practice. They cover activities such as removing sediments from around culverts, upstream of small weirs and small, straightened rivers. In these circumstances, no application to SEPA is required.</p>

  <p>It will delay the submission of the report of the inquiry to the Scottish Government. The report of any inquiry must be considered before ministers come to a decision about confirmation of a scheme. At this stage, it is not possible to estimate a timescale as this will depend on a number of factors, not least when the council can provide the information requested, the content thereof and the extent of any further representations by the parties concerned.</p>

  <p>The HEAT target for March 2009 of 4% was a very challenging target. Four NHS boards achieved a rate of less than 4%, two boards achieved their individual targets of 5% and 6% respectively and of the remaining 16 NHS boards only one reported a rate higher than 5%.</p>

  <p>When compared to March 2008 NHSScotland reported a 0.63% improvement in absence rates which equates to over 650,000 more hours being available for the service. Seventeen NHS boards reported improvements in their sickness absence rates when compared to March 2008.</p>

  <p>There is an expectation that NHS boards will continue to develop strategies that will promote attendance at work and further reduce absence towards a standard of 4%.</p>

  <p>No. Healthy start is open to pregnant women and families with children under the age of four who are on income support, income-based jobseekers&rsquo; allowance or child tax credit (but not working tax credit unless their family is receiving working tax credit run-only) with an income of &pound;16,040 a year or less.</p>

  <p>The &pound;19 million has been allocated to health boards under a number of broad criteria. That is to give heath boards flexibility to implement strategies and interventions appropriate to their local areas. It is expected that health boards will monitor and evaluate interventions locally and we will also be asking health boards to provide us with information on action taken.</p>

  <p>We will be able to monitor the impact nationally through the annual breastfeeding rate statistics, the numbers of maternity units attaining Baby Friendly status, and the number of beneficiaries claiming Healthy Start benefit.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the revised estimate is of the cost for (a) small and (b) large retailers of compliance with the ban on the display of tobacco as contained in the Tobacco and Primary Medical Services (Scotland) Bill.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-01-12.S3W-29765.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80379" speakername="Shona Robison" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa0112.htm#16">

  <p>There is no single estimate of the cost to a retailer of complying with the tobacco display ban, as the Tobacco and Primary Medical Services (Scotland) Bill and the relevant draft regulations do not stipulate how tobacco should be stored to comply with the display ban. The financial memorandum sets out estimated costs provided by retailers to comply with the legislation. The Scottish Government makes clear in the financial memorandum that these figures were supplied by industry representatives based on the assumption that refitting would require under the counter units and have not been adjusted to account for more innovative, cost effective solutions for concealing displays.</p>

  <p>In line with the commitment made to the Finance Committee, officials have been working with retailers to minimise the cost to them of complying with the display ban. Draft regulations allow retailers to modify their gantries rather than having to refit their shop, significantly reducing the cost to comply with the legislation. The least expensive option offered by the National Federation of Retail Newsagents would involve installing a white plastic fronting to each row on the gantry. It has been estimated that such a solution could cost as little as &pound;20 for the materials for each fronting with minimal installation costs. If they so wished, retailers of all sizes could install such a solution in order to comply with the legislation.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will continue to work with retailers of all sizes to support them in complying with this legislation.</p>
