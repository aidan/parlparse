  <p><i>Independent Advocacy - A guide for Commissioners</i> , states that advocacy schemes, commissioned by health and social services, should be independent of the statutory and voluntary service sectors.</p>

  <p>Whilst service providing agencies clearly undertake a valuable role in providing direct representation (or advocacy) for individuals who rely on their support, there are times in an individual's life when they need, or want, someone to advocate for them who has no connection with them as a provider of services.</p>

  <p>Our <i> Programme for Government </i> sets the objective of providing children with a stimulating environment for playing, developing and learning.</p>

  <p>The pre-school education curriculum is founded on the concept of learning through play. Physical development and movement is a key aspect of children&#146;s development and learning. 97% of four-year-olds and 80% of three-year-olds, now receiving grant funded pre-school education, are benefiting from learning through play.</p>

  <p>We are providing funding to a range of organisations committed to the development of play and, through the Special Educational Needs Innovation Grant Programme, to projects developing integrated play and learning for children with special needs.</p>

  <p>Decisions on the funding of individual colleges of further education are a matter for the Scottish Further Education Funding Council (SFEFC). The council is currently conducting studies into the supply of, and demand for, further education across four Scottish sectors, including construction. The results will be shared with the colleges, and others, to help inform decisions on how best to provide suitable and efficient further education so as to meet identified needs.</p>

  <p>Improving the matching of skills supply to demand in Scotland is a core function of the new Future Skills Scotland unit. With regard to the construction sector, Future Skills Scotland will draw upon the outcomes of the SFEFC studies and on labour market information and intelligence provided by the Construction Industry Training Board.</p>

  <p>NHSScotland is spending more than &#163;300 million a year in tackling diabetes. This involves national and local initiatives to improve prevention, detection and treatment.</p>

  <p>The Executive will shortly launch the first national Diabetes Framework to ensure better and more consistent services are delivered across Scotland.</p>

  <p>Raising attainment for all pupils and closing the gap between the poorest and best performers are central to the National Priorities for education. I will shortly be issuing guidance to education authorities which sets out a clear, evidence-based improvement framework for monitoring the delivery of National Priorities at all levels. Schools and authorities will be supported in that delivery by our drive to provide better integrated children&#146;s services.</p>

  <p>A number of reports have been published giving international summaries of the problem. The answer to question S1W-3574 gave a comprehensive list of relevant reports but copies of all these documents are not held centrally by the Executive.

  <p>None. Firearms policy and legislation are reserved matters and responsibility for policy on firearms licensing rests with the Home Office.</p>

  <p>The Home Office, in consultation with police forces and with Her Majesty's Inspectorates of Constabulary, will be carrying out a review of firearms licensing fees and efficiency over the coming year.</p>

  <p>At present there is no central or national firearms licence application database covering all UK force areas. Each Scottish, and indeed UK, police force maintains its own standalone system. In Scotland, the Scottish Criminal Records Office receives and records details of firearm certificate holders located within the Scottish force areas. This information can then be accessed on-line by all Scottish police forces.</p>

  <p>The Police Information Technology Organisation is progressing the establishment of a National (UK) Firearms Certificate Holders Register. The National Firearms Certificate Holders Register Project Board, which includes representation from the Association of Police Officers in Scotland, is aiming for UK-wide implementation of the register by summer 2002.</p>

  <p>The Firearms Act 1968 (as amended) specifies that a young person under the age of 17 cannot purchase a low-powered air weapon and/or ammunition for it.</p>

  <p>Firearms policy and legislation are reserved matters. However, the Scottish Executive is represented on the Firearms Consultative Committee, which is an independent statutory body established to keep under review the working of the provisions of the Firearms Acts, and to make recommendations to the Home Secretary for improving their working. The committee&#146;s latest annual report is due to be submitted to the Home Secretary shortly and will thereafter be laid before the UK Parliament.</p>

  <p>The Executive actively encourages local authorities to reduce and manage the flood risk to non-agricultural land.</p>

  <p>We have issued planning guidance on flood risk and have ensured that councils have the necessary powers and resources to address local flooding concerns. Additionally, the Executive has published research on flood risk and provided for Scottish Environment Protection Agency&#146;s flood warnings and information on the risk of flooding to be more readily available.</p>

  <p>Research into <i>Potential Adaptation Strategies for Climate Change in Scotland </i>was published last month. This research will inform our consideration of a strategic level response to assist local decision makers to implement adaptation strategies to protect their communities from flooding.</p>

Disposal routes for the material throughout the UK were considered by the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee, the Department of Health, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Environment Agency. They considered all possible disposal options for the material arising from the large pyres, including re-incineration and on-site burial, and concluded that the best option is disposal at a licensed engineered landfill site.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers have powers under section 57 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 to direct the holder of a waste management licence to accept and keep, or accept and treat or dispose of, controlled waste at specified places on specified terms.

  <p>Since the end of August, there have been extensive discussions between Scottish Executive officials and the East Ayrshire Council Director of Community Services about proposals for the disposal of the ash from the three pyre sites in the South of Scotland. These included meetings in Glasgow and Kilmarnock. I have also discussed the matter personally with the leader of the council, Councillor Drew McIntyre, and the First Minister met him on 1 November.</p>

  <p>In 1995 Tayside Regional Council carried out a review of options for providing grade separation of the Ballinluig junction, by providing slip roads connecting the northbound carriageway of the A9 to the A827 Ballinluig to Killin Road. This study took into account earlier work carried out by Acer Consultants in 1992, which considered the provision of low flow grade separation. The outcome of the Tayside Regional Council&#146;s study was that none of the options brought forward could be economically justified within the competing priorities of the trunk road programme at that time.</p>

  <p>At my request, consultants are now re-examining options for improving road safety at this junction, including those previously considered by Tayside Regional Council with a view to identifying and costing an improvement scheme that may be taken forward.</p>

  <p>The consultation period on the <i>Review of Strategic Planning</i> closed on 31 October. We have received over 250 responses and an independent consultant has been appointed to analyse these responses. He will report at the end of January next year and his report will be published. A seminar will be held in January to provide initial feedback to consultees. I intend to announce conclusions in the spring.</p>

  <p>The timetable for any changes to the arrangements for strategic planning will depend on the conclusions reached and, in particular, on whether primary or secondary legislation is required to implement the outcome of the review.</p>

  <p>The Executive is making good progress in implementing the <i>Scottish Strategy for Victims</i> and the Action Plans which support it. We are improving the support and information available to victims and will be providing them with more opportunities to participate. For example, yesterday we announced the launch of a consultation paper on the procedures for a victims&#146; statements scheme. Such a scheme would provide victims with the chance to set out the impact which a crime has had an on them and would be an important step in providing victims with more opportunities to participate in the criminal justice process.</p>
