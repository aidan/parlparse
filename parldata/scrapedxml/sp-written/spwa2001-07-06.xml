  <p>I have asked the Intervention Board to reinstate the Over Thirty Month Scheme (OTMS) in Scotland by mid-July. Operational details are now being worked on by the Intervention Board which operates this scheme and the Meat Hygiene Service which has to provide the necessary hygiene staff for the plants.</p>

  <p>In response to question S1W-2680, Mr Sam Galbraith announced the results of the consultation, which showed a majority support for the principle of a general fund. He also announced the setting up of an implementation group, comprising representatives from key stakeholders, to consider the implications of the transfer of resources for improved aftercare.</p>

  <p>I expect the group to report its recommendations in the autumn. We will then consult on detailed proposals.</p>

  <p><i>The</i> <i>Regulation of Early Education and Childcare &#8211; The Way Ahead</i> , published in May 2000, set out our conclusions following consultation in March 1999. During the course of the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Bill, we further amended our policy proposals to ensure full regulation covered children up to 16 and child care agencies, and to provide for fully integrated inspection of care services which include an educational element. The Bill awaits Royal Assent.</p>

  <p>67 detailed responses on the future of the Code&#8217;s provisions were received. Consideration was delayed to allow negotiation and implementation of the McCrone Report&#8217;s recommendations, which had implications for areas of the Code such as grades of posts in schools.</p>

  <p>Support from the Scottish Executive will continue to facilitate the provision of high quality training programmes for those individuals wishing to develop their skills. It is a priority of the Motorola Taskforce to ensure that all Motorola workers have access to appropriate training, where this is identified as being the best means of equipping them for future employment. The taskforce is willing to consider any reasonable proposals for retraining from those workers affected by the closure.</p>

  <p>Training opportunities through ISLI (the Institute for System Level Integration) have been mooted as a potential means of providing enhanced level training to those who require it to enable access to the higher value end of the electronic sector. Scottish Enterprise Edinburgh and Lothian are working closely with ISLI and the Alba Centre to establish a viable proposal which fits with the needs of the Motorola employees.</p>

  <p>No decisions have yet been taken on the 20-day standstill proposal.

  <p>Over 150 replies have been received and are being carefully considered. The vast majority of responses stress that the introduction of a straight 20-day standstill period is unworkable. Equally, however, many recognise that the status quo is untenable and offer alternative proposals. These are being actively considered in terms of effectiveness, enforceability and impact on industry.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is a statutory consultee in respect of planning applications that affect trunk roads.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of the terms of HM Inspectorate of Constabulary&#8217;s Primary Inspection into the Scottish Criminal Records Office (SCRO), whether the Lord Advocate has any plans to consider ending the requirement to have all fingerprint identifications made by SCRO officers independently checked.</p>

  <p>The Lord Advocate has instructed Procurators Fiscal that the independent verification of SCRO fingerprint identifications is no longer required in light of the changes and improvements made to SCRO procedures.</p>

  <p>Since independent verification was introduced last year, over 1,700 cases have been examined and in each instance, the quality and accuracy of the work of SCRO officers has been confirmed. I am not aware of any successful challenge to fingerprint evidence in Scotland over the past year and it remains open to the defence in each case to secure their own expert to independently check any fingerprint evidence to be adduced by the Crown.</p>

This included a number of landlords whose estates included hut sites (including the Carbeth Estate) and a number of individual hutters, as well as the Carbeth Hutters&#8217; Association. In addition, the paper was sent to all MSPs who had displayed an interest in the subject and all local authorities in Scotland. A number of other organisations including the National Farmers&#8217; Union, Scottish National Heritage and the Forestry Commission were sent copies of the report. Certain individuals requested multiple copies of the report for distribution to their associates. Such requests were met when made.</p>

  <p>The answer to question S1W-15074 described the Collaborative Review of Initial Teacher Education as a departmental consultation exercise. May I take this opportunity to correct that statement. The consultation should have been listed as &quot;Collaborative Review of Initial Teacher Education.&quot; The inclusion of the word &quot;department&quot; was a typographical error and I offer my apologies for any confusion this has caused.</p>

  <p>The new process of collaborative review is aimed at enhancing quality assurance arrangements in Initial Teacher Education in Scotland. The process will evaluate against the Standard for Initial Teacher Education issued on 26 February 2001. This document was included as an annex in the handbook produced by the Standing Committee on Quality Assurance in Initial Teacher Education.</p>

  <p>The Standing Committee issued the handbook for comment to all local education authorities, teacher education institutions and other key educational stakeholders on 26 February 2001 for comment by 6 April.</p>

  <p>A total of 26 organisations responded. These comments will be incorporated along with the outcomes of a Pilot Review (September 2001-April 2002) leading to a revised version of the handbook being produced in time for the Review Cycle beginning in September 2002.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive <a name="QuestionText">whether water authorities would have greater commercial freedom if they were exempted from the Competition Act 1998.</a></p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2001-07-06.25.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80155" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-01/wa0706.htm#QuestionText">

  <p>Exemptions from the provisions of the Competition Act 1998 are relevant only in the case of the Act&#8217;s Chapter I prohibition against agreements between undertakings which have the object or effect of preventing, restricting or distorting competition in the United Kingdom. Such exemptions, which do not apply to undertakings, can only be established in the courts on a case-by-case basis by proving that an agreement that could be caught by the prohibition assists economic progress and technical development. There is no reason to believe that establishing exemptions in the case of particular agreements between a water authority and another undertaking would affect the commercial freedom of that authority.</p>
