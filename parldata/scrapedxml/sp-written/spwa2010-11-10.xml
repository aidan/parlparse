  <p>For the purposes of section 227V(6)(a) and (b) of the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010, it will be for the court to satisfy themselves that an individual has an alcohol dependency. Before imposing a community payback order, the court must take account of a report provided by a local authority officer, which contains information about the offender and the offender&rsquo;s circumstances. Where appropriate, report writers will seek input from treatment services or clinicians.</p>

  <p>Professionals involved in assessing an individual&rsquo;s alcohol problem will be informed by the World Health Organization&rsquo;s (WHO) clinical definition of dependency i.e. &quot;an individual having three or more of a range of symptoms including; tolerance; alcohol withdrawal, craving, persistence of drinking despite negative consequences&quot; and can draw upon a range of well-established screening tools.</p>

  <p>NHS funded assisted conception should be available to couples who meet all of the following national criteria developed in 2000 by the Expert Advisory Group on Infertility Services in Scotland:</p>

  <p>1. Infertility with an appropriate diagnosed cause of any duration or unexplained infertility of at least three years duration.</p>

  <p>2. Female partner aged less than 40 years at the time of treatment.</p>

  <p>3. Neither partner previously sterilised.</p>

  <p>4. No child living with the couple in their home.</p>

  <p>We are taking the principles of the All Our Futures strategy &ndash; older people contributing and participating, enjoying a sense of purpose and belonging, respected and included &ndash; forward in the context of our single purpose for a prosperous Scotland from which all can benefit. The Scottish Government has introduced, and continues to support, a number of major policies specifically designed to help older people. These include:</p>

  <p>The National Concessionary Travel Scheme which provides free Scotland-wide bus travel for older people;</p>

  <p>Free personal and nursing care;</p>

  <p>The Energy Assistance Package which came into effect in April 2009, and which continues to provide support to low income pensioner households living in energy inefficient homes and to provide central heating systems to all those aged 60 and over who have never had central heating installed in their home;</p>

  <p>The freeze on council tax, first introduced in 2008-09 and now continued for a third year 2010-11; and</p>

  <p>Engagement with older people in various ways, including the Scottish Older People&rsquo;s Assembly which I addressed in Glasgow on 10 November 2010.</p>

  <p>There are no administrative costs to the Scottish Government as this work is part of the ongoing sponsorship tasks of sportscotland and the top-up swimming programme is delivered through sportscotland in partnership with Scottish Swimming.

  <p>The Scottish Government does not hold comprehensive information on local authority provision of free year-round access to swimming for children. However I understand that whilst sportscotland do not systematically gather this data they have supplied general information which gives a good picture of local authority provision as well as the varied level of programmes offered. As an example, the following local authorities provide free year-round access to swimming for children:</p>

  <p>Aberdeen: concession scheme for those on low income, disability benefit;</p>

  <p>Angus: free swimming for under fours;</p>

  <p>City of Edinburgh: free casual swimming for primary-aged children;</p>

  <p>Dumfries and Galloway: free swimming Saturday mornings (under 18);</p>

  <p>East Dunbartonshire: free to under fives;</p>

  <p>Falkirk: parents and toddlers in organised classes;</p>

  <p>Glasgow: free to under 16s with a Glasgow Kidz card;</p>

  <p>Inverclyde: free swimming offered;</p>

  <p>Orkney: free to under fives;</p>

  <p>Shetland: free swimming pre- school;</p>

  <p>Stirling: free swimming to under 16s;</p>

  <p>We want to ensure that Scotland&rsquo;s children are given the opportunity to learn to swim and to enjoy swimming as a lifelong activity. This is why I recently announced funding of &pound;800,000 to be invested over the coming year for a top-up swimming programme. This will support the improved delivery of swimming lessons and ensure that all children should have the opportunity to learn to swim before leaving primary school. Given the reductions in Scotland&rsquo;s budgets by the UK Government, this represents a considerable investment in swimming for children.</p>

  <p>Each local authority will have access to these funds but, quite rightly, it is for them to decide how best to design services in their area or supplement existing provision.</p>

  <p>There are two species in Scotland which have been reintroduced under licence. These are beavers, under the Scottish beaver trial and sea eagles.</p>

  <p>Beavers have been licensed for release as part of the Scottish beaver trial. As these animals are currently outwith their native range they are not afforded specific protection under the Habitats Directive. However, they would enjoy a level of protection from shooting under rules relating to armed trespass under the Firearms Act 1968.</p>

  <p>The Scottish beaver trial regards the beavers as their property and as such anyone who kills them would be at risk of prosecution or legal action.</p>

  <p>Sea eagles enjoy the protection afforded to wild birds under Part 1 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.</p>

  <p>Although Scottish National Heritage (SNH), and, formerly the Deer Commission for Scotland, do carry out deer counts in particular areas, there is no comprehensive national count of the red deer population. In carrying out counting it is also difficult to reliably identify male numbers.</p>

  <p>The following table identifies the number of male red deer recorded as being killed through the statutory cull returns for each year between 1996 and 2010, inclusive. The statutory cull return does not represent all deer shot in Scotland, as SNH only request a return from occupiers of landholdings that are known to cull deer. However, the cull return does provide a good indicator of trends.</p>
