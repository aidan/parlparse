  <p>Health and safety is a reserved matter enforced by the Health and Safety Executive or local authorities depending on the type of premises. There are no specific regulations covering children&#146;s playgrounds under health and safety law. The Health and Safety Executive has issued a sector information minute which provides information on the physical standards expected in children&#146;s playgrounds, the management systems play providers should have in place and the relevance and status of applicable European standards. I have arranged for a copy to be placed in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 19102).</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is already fully engaged with the UK Government in the development of the UK position in the debate on the future of European Structural Funds. We participated in significant events last year such as the Cohesion Forum in Brussels in May, the Namur Informal Council in July and meetings with the Commissioner for Regional Policy and Scottish MEPs in September.</p>

  <p>We are working with the breadth of Scottish interests to produce a robust presentation of the key areas for structural funds in the future and to ensure that Scottish priorities are adequately reflected in the final UK position. We expect to attend the commission&#146;s seminars on the 10 priorities highlighted in the <i>Second Cohesion Report </i>in May. Subject to clarification on the format of these seminars it is hoped a broad Scottish delegation will accompany us.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is aware of the research planned by the World Health Organisation into travel related deep vein thrombosis (DVT). However, the cost of this large epidemiological study is great (over &#163;4.8 million) and at present funding for this study has not been secured. Although the Department of Health in England has agreed to contribute towards these costs, this is conditional upon funding being provided by other sources such as the airline industry. The Scottish Executive has not made any direct representation to the World Health Organisation or the Department of Health relating to this subject.</p>

  <p>The Chief Scientist Office of the Scottish Executive is currently funding three projects at a cost of &#163;328,000 into aspects of DVT, the findings of which will inform the future direction of research and treatment of DVT.</p>

  <p>Details of jobs created by community buy-outs since 1994 are not available.</p>

  <p>It should be recognised that for many community land initiatives, job creation is not necessarily the primary objective. Priorities can vary, and include security and control of land, environmental management, access and amenity, provision of social services, building management, and promotion of voluntary activity.</p>

  <p>Job creation and retention, both of a direct and indirect type, can take time. In some community land buy-outs, there has been some initial loss of employment as the new community owner attempts to put the estate on a more sound, financially sustainable footing. In others, the formation of subsidiary companies and encouragement of other business start-up has created indirect spin-off employment.</p>

  <p>Highlands and Islands Enterprise Community Land Unit have, however, estimated the employment impact of two community land owners as follows:</p>

  <p>No further research has been carried out into the rate of attrition in sexual offence cases. Responses to the consultation document, <i>Towards a Just Conclusion</i> , provided numerous examples of the problems experienced by victims giving evidence. As noted in my response to your question on plans for research into the treatment of sexual offence witnesses in court (question S1W-18513, answered on 9 October 2001), we plan to commission further research to provide a baseline of information prior to any changes to be brought about by the Sexual Offences (Procedure and Evidence) (Scotland) Bill.</p>

  <p>I understand that East Dunbartonshire Council, as planning authority, is presently giving consideration to a planning application and environmental statement submitted by the West of Scotland Water Authority for the Katrine Water Project. As a statutory consultee, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency has been given the opportunity to comment on the environmental statement.</p>
