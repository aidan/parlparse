  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has been informed of the estimated number of people on incapacity benefit or employment support allowance who will be required to seek work under the welfare reform proposals and, if so, what the impact of this will be on the Scottish economy.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has been informed that an estimated 175,000 current Incapacity Benefit customers will be reassessed at a rate of approximately 1,100 per week. The <em>Department for Work and Pensions</em> estimate that 23 per cent will be deemed fit for work, 58 per cent will be moved into the Work Related Activity Group (WRAG) of Employment Support Allowance (ESA) and 19 per cent will go into the support group of ESA and will not be required to actively seek work. An estimated 800 per month of current ESA claimants are moving onto the WRAG and are required to seek work.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has not estimated the impact of these changes on the Scottish Economy as they will be dependent on the labour market conditions at the time of transferral. However, it is our intention to monitor the overall impact of the UK Government&rsquo;s welfare reform package on Scotland&rsquo;s labour market.</p>

  <p>Scotland has robust, equitable and transparent arrangements for the introduction of newly licensed clinically and cost-effective medicines to treat all conditions, including those to treat rare cancers. The arrangements include opportunities at local level for clinically led consideration of medicines for individual patients in certain circumstances.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will give due consideration to the Department of Health cancer drugs fund consultation findings once they are published.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) may, in addition to the standard assessment of clinical and cost-effectiveness, apply modifiers which consider other additional factors. Subject to meeting certain criteria, this can facilitate acceptance of a medicine notwithstanding the economic evidence provided.

  <p>We are taking action on a number of fronts. <em>The Carers Strategy</em> , published in July, contains a number of different actions to help promote the development of flexible, personalised short breaks services. I announced &pound;1 million for short breaks in 2010-11, which we have rolled forward, resulting in &pound;5 million in total for short breaks between 2010 and 2015. This is being allocated to the National Carers Organisations, who have now announced a Short Breaks Fund to help support and sustain carers and young carers. Subject to parliamentary approval of the draft budget, there will also be &pound;2 million in 2011-12 for short breaks for families with severely disabled children and &pound;5 million to support carers and young carers through the Carer Information Strategies.</p>

  <p>As part of the concordat commitment to deliver an extra 10,000 respite weeks, we provided local authorities with &pound;2.82 million in 2010-11. This &pound;2.82 million, reduced by the 2.6% applying to total local authority spending, will be in the overall local government settlement to councils. Councils will be required to agree to deliver certain commitments, including &quot;continuing to work with the Scottish Government towards implementation of the Carers and Young Carers Strategy at local level, including the maintenance of an extra 10,000 weeks respite care.&quot;</p>

  <p>Local authorities&rsquo; net revenue expenditure on support for carers, including respite care, was &pound;134.74 million in 2008-09.</p>

  <p>There are provisions in the draft Self-directed Support Bill for support to carers, which might include respite. Our proposals will be subject to consultation that will take place before the end of 2010.</p>

  <p>In recognition of the pressures on the health and social care system in a challenging fiscal climate, the Scottish Government has allocated &pound;70 million in 2011-12 within the NHS budget to a Change Fund for NHS boards and partner local authorities to redesign services to support the delivery of new approaches to improved quality and outcomes. By ensuring that older people remain independent in their own homes, health boards and local authorities will be able to focus on reducing unnecessary hospital admissions and speeding discharge after a crisis. This will result in better outcomes for older people and ease the pressure on acute hospital provision. Given the vital role performed by carers, we expect local partnerships to invest an appropriate proportion of their change fund allocation in provision that specifically supports carers.</p>

  <p>The announcement of &pound;400 million for short breaks in England over four years does not mean that Scotland will fall behind in short breaks provision. Our own plans, with investment, are robust.</p>

  <p>An evidence note published by NHS QIS in January 2009, suggests that for some people with type 2 diabetes, self-monitoring may lack significant benefit, with little, or no effect on people&rsquo;s glycaemic control.</p>

  <p>We would however expect any change to a person&rsquo;s self-management regimen, including home blood glucose monitoring, to be made in close consultation with the person concerned, and in line with the advice set out in SIGN Guideline 116 on the management of diabetes.</p>

  <p>The Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 places a duty on individual local authorities to introduce a discount scheme for council tax for those who make their homes more energy efficient. The Scottish Government has no formal role in overseeing the introduction of such schemes, but we have been working with COSLA, local authorities, the energy companies and some other interested parties to support implementation. From the latest information we hold, we understand that all 32 local authorities will each have a scheme in place for the start of the 2011-12 financial year.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government also provided a small amount of funding to allow COSLA and the Improvement Service to commission a review of energy efficient council schemes in Scotland. The review has been completed and a copy of review report has been placed in Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 51226). The report states that, as at the date of publication, 15 local authorities have a scheme in place, 11 have plans which are at an advanced stage and the six remaining authorities are planning to introduce schemes for the start of the 2011-12 financial year.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will not take investment decisions and therefore has had no discussions with local authorities about the distribution of JESSICA funding.</p>

  <p>The Government has worked closely with local authorities during the development of the JESSICA funding model. COSLA, the Scottish Local Authorities Economic Development Group and individual local authorities were represented on a Steering Group that led on feasibility work and concluded that JESSICA would be a valuable funding tool to support the delivery of regeneration in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s document <em>Scotland&rsquo;s Spending Plans and Draft Budget 2011-12,</em> published on 17 November 2010, set a budget to address the financial challenge of a reduction of &pound;1.3 billion in cash terms in 2011-12. In the document, the Scottish Government reaffirmed its fundamental strategic priorities, which are to:</p>

  <p>support economic recovery and deliver our purpose of increasing sustainable economic growth;</p>

  <p>protect the public services on which people depend and which are most effective in tackling deep seated problems and delivering real benefits and better outcomes for the people of Scotland, and</p>

  <p>establish a competitive advantage through the opportunities offered by taking action on climate change.</p>

  <p>Information about the measures taken by the government is set out throughout the draft budget document, including in the chapters on each government portfolio, and in the associated material published on 17 November.</p>

  <p>The Draft Budget 2011-12 is now subject to detailed scrutiny by parliamentary committees. This examination of the budget allows each committee the opportunity to take evidence from Cabinet Secretaries and ministers and invites them to respond to detailed questions on the priorities the Scottish Government has set and the measures it has put in place to address this unprecedented financial challenge.</p>

  <p>The insights and principles gathered through the development of an integrative care approach to long term conditions management have helped inform our Long Term Conditions Action Plan and our Quality Strategy, with their emphasis on person-centredness and compassion, and a holistic approach to people&rsquo;s healthcare needs.</p>

  <p>Through the work of our Lead Clinician for Integrative Care, we have been supporting the use of people&rsquo;s experiences and outcomes to develop Wellness Enhancement Learning (WEL) Programmes and staff training programmes that provide an integrative approach. More information on WEL can be found at <a href="http://www.thewel.org" target="_blank">www.thewel.org</a>. One of our Lead Clinician&rsquo;s specific objectives has been to produce an evaluation of the WEL programme for people with ME-CFS (Myalgic Encephalomyelitis and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome), as a way of encouraging its wider availability.</p>

  <p>Our Long Term Conditions Action Plan includes a commitment to produce guidance on supporting people towards developing services that help promote people&rsquo;s capacity for self-healing and recovery. Regular reports on progress with that action are provided to the Long Term Conditions Programme Board by our Lead Clinician for Integrative Care.</p>

  <p>There are very few centres in the UK able to undertake specialised scoliosis surgery. The Scottish specialist spinal deformity service has made significant progress in reducing its overall waiting times, but there continue to be extended inpatient waiting times. It is not possible to offer the treatment elsewhere within the United Kingdom within a shorter wait. Average waiting times in specialist centres in England also extend beyond waiting time guarantees, and currently there is no capacity available within English NHS providers to accept referrals for patients from Scotland. We will therefore continue to focus on reducing waiting times in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has not conducted an assessment of equity of access to innovative treatments for patients with rare diseases. There are longstanding commissioning arrangements to ensure patients are able to benefit from specialised services required for the treatment of rare and ultra-rare conditions. Access to this national resource is managed by the National Services Division (NSD) of NHS National Services Scotland, which commissions relevant treatment within NHSScotland or from highly specialised services across the UK or further afield in Europe, as and when it is required.</p>

  <p>Our aim for NHSScotland, as set out in our Healthcare Quality Strategy, is that it provides the best quality healthcare services to the people of Scotland through the delivery of person-centred, safe and effective care.</p>

  <p>Our ambition to deliver effective care includes providing the most appropriate treatments, interventions, support and services at the right time to every patient and eradicating wasteful and harmful variation in clinical practice. In undertaking their responsibility for the planning and provision of NHS services in their area, we expect NHS boards to focus on the quality of service they provide.</p>

  <p>Each local authority is under a statutory duty to determine and keep under review the maximum amount that it can afford to allocate to capital expenditure. In determining this amount, the local authority must have regard to the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA) Prudential Code. The Prudential Code is a professional code of practice and requires that capital investment is prudent, affordable and sustainable. In relation to the Housing Revenue Account, the Prudential Code requires a local authority to consider the impact of borrowing on the level of rents and whether the level of borrowing is affordable and sustainable. Scottish Government monitors the level of individual and aggregate Housing Revenue Account (HRA) debt and Scottish ministers may consider issuing guidance if it were deemed to be necessary though there are currently no plans to issue such guidance.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive for what reason there was a 46% reduction in new build starts under the Affordable Housing Investment Programme in the third quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-12-09.S3W-37916.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80370" speakername="Alex Neil" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa1209.htm#14">

  <p>The main reason that new build starts in Q3 2009 were much higher than in Q3 2010 is due to a large number of council house building starts being recorded in Q3 2009 mainly resulting from Rounds 1 and 2. Lower levels of starts coincided with Q3 2010.</p>

  <p>However, we have only recently started recording starts in this way and there is only a short-time series over which to compare trends. Factors such as planning issues, infrastructure constraints and weather conditions can also affect starts on site and therefore there is not a uniform spread or pattern of starts.</p>

  <p>Research specifically examining the appeal of mid-market rented property in the social rented sector has not been conducted by the Scottish Government to date. However, the current Communities Analytical Services business plan for 2010-11 includes a project on estimating demand for mid-market rent housing. This project is due to start shortly and be completed by the end of February 2011.</p>

  <p>There is no measure of demand for mid-market rent housing, but the local Housing Need and Demand Assessments submitted to date can be examined, since as part of these assessment process local authorities should have considered the role for mid-market / intermediate rented housing in their housing market areas. In addition, information on the take-up of existing mid-market rent properties will be examined as part of this study. Although the data sources are limited, it is hoped that this study will help increase understanding of the scale of demand of mid-market rented property in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Properties for mid-market rent are generally not provided by landlords in the social rented sector. The great majority of properties for mid-market rent are provided by landlords in the private rented sector, through RSL subsidiaries.</p>

  <p>At present, the Scottish Government does not hold mid-market rent data at local authority or indeed national level.</p>

  <p>We only currently hold data relating to intermediate rented housing in the private rented sector that has been approved for government funding; we do not currently hold data on rent levels in the very limited amount of mid-market rent housing provided by local authorities.</p>

  <p>There are only a fairly small number of homes provided for mid-market rent at the moment, but that number is expected to increase over the next few years, through initiatives such as the National Housing Trust.</p>

  <p>Data is collected on uptake vaccine by all those aged 65 and over, but this data does not differentiate between those in care homes and those not. Individual care homes may keep records of residents who are vaccinated against seasonal flu however, this data is not collected centrally.</p>

  <p>Low-level offenders sentenced to unpaid work all around those areas of Scotland affected by the recent adverse weather conditions have been working hard as part of the clear-up efforts. Information is being placed within the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 52182) today which shows the numbers of those on community service that have been undertaking this work. It shows that offenders have carried out 14,949 hours of work between 25 November 2010 and 8 December 2010.</p>

  <p>Since the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010 received Royal Assent on 6 August, the community payback order (CPO) working group has met on four occasions. It will meet again on 13 December.</p>

  <p>At these meetings, the group has considered the impact of the introduction of the CPO on relevant partners, their capacity and readiness to deliver the CPO, and the procedures and processes that will be required to monitor the operation and impact of the CPO.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will provide a report to the Justice Committee on the preparations for the CPO, including the progress made by the working group, before the CPO provisions come into force on 1 February 2011.</p>

  <p>The recommendations contained in Professor Harrington&rsquo;s review of the Work Capability Assessment (WCA) go a substantial way to addressing the concerns raised by stakeholders. Any implications are a matter for the Department for Work and Pensions. The Scottish Government welcomes the recommendations made in the review that will help make the WCA fairer. My officials will continue to monitor developments from the implementation of the review of the WCA and will also continue to work with employability service providers and other partners to assess any impact on those who want to work.</p>

  <p>Maintaining police officer numbers at least 17,234 is one element of the 2011-12 funding package agreed by Scottish Government and COSLA&rsquo;s Leadership and currently being considered by councils. To secure the full funding package, councils are required to agree to all the elements of the package, including that on police officer numbers. A process of verification for the various commitments during 2011-12 will be discussed and agreed between the Scottish Government and COSLA so that agreed arrangements can be in place by the start of the financial year. Local government&rsquo;s performance in delivering on the commitments will of course ultimately be a key factor in assessing the level of the local government settlement in the next spending review, for 2012-13 and later years.</p>

  <p>Procurement Scotland, part of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Procurement Directorate, has in place a national agreement for paper accessible by all public sector bodies. Since the agreement commenced on 1 September 2008 some 8 million reams of paper have been purchased by 172 public bodies and 721 charities, housing associations and registered social landlords: 640,000 reams in 2008, 3.9 million reams in 2009 and 3.3 million reams to date in 2010. Prior to the introduction of the national contract this information was not collected centrally: equivalent data for 2007 is not therefore readily available.</p>

  <p>We are aware of the recently reported conviction of an individual, following the posting of comments on newspaper websites. We are not aware of any connection between this incident and the incident referred to in S3W-34777.</p>

  <p>However, the Scottish Government takes any incidents of anti-Semitic behaviour as of the utmost gravity whether these are isolated incidents or not. We condemn and abhor anti-Semitic views and anti-Semitic behaviour. We continue to work productively with the Scottish Council of Jewish Communities and others and through this we can achieve the aspiration of One Scotland of many cultures, faiths and beliefs.</p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise offer a range of research and development and investment support and this would potentially be available to businesses looking to develop osmotic power techniques or facilities in Scotland. These agencies would be willing to engage with any potential developers interested in taking forward activity in Scotland. Should this technology emerge as a commercial proposition the Scottish Government would consider options for eligibility through the Renewables Obligation.</p>

  <p>As I indicated to the Parliament during the debate on the Scottish Variable Rate (SVR) on 24 November, following the election in May 2007 I was told that the earliest tax year in which the SVR could be introduced reliably was 2009-10, at a cost of &pound;2.9 million for IT infrastructure work. I was also offered the option of paying &pound;3.4 million (excluding contingency) to prepare the SVR IT systems for use in tax year 2008-09, but I was warned that there was a material risk that the systems might not be delivered on time and would not operate reliably, and that as a result of these risks potential tax income of between &pound;10 million and &pound;26 million could remain uncollected. Were a decision to be taken not to invoke the SVR it was recommended that IT infrastructure work costing around &pound;1.2 million be undertaken to ensure the SVR 10 month state of readiness was available to the following parliament.</p>

  <p>I was further briefed that, were we to decide to exercise the power to vary the Scottish tax rate, there would be additional, non-IT, costs associated with introducing and operating the SVR. These non-IT costs would include &pound;6 million for implementation activities (contact centres, project management) and &pound;4 million annually thereafter for post-implementation costs (network/operations).</p>

  <p>This Administration decided in 2007 not to exercise the power to vary the Scottish tax rate, and sought to secure the maintenance of the SVR capability for the next parliament at the lowest cost to the taxpayer. The Scottish Executive in 1999 and 2003 had made the same decision. In the event the cost associated with re-establishing a 10-month, state of readiness with effect from May 2011 rose to &pound;7 million and we were asked to commit this sum in August 2010, 20 months before the beginning of the first tax year in which the power could be exercised. Officials asked HMRC for meetings to discuss the issue and the costs associated for a number of months but received no response until the Secretary of State&rsquo;s intervention.</p>
