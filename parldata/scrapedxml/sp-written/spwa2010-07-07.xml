  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what consideration has been given to a further examination of the Forth Road Bridge to reconsider whether extra remedial work might extend its safe use for all vehicles.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-07-07.S3W-34723.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80393" speakername="Stewart Stevenson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa0707.htm#1">

  <p>The Scottish Government and Transport Scotland routinely liaise with the Forth Estuary Transport Authority (FETA) in relation to the condition of the Forth Road Bridge and will continue to do so. These discussions were well summarised publically during a recent Forth Crossing Bill committee meeting where the Forth Road Bridge chief engineer and bridgemaster gave strong and compelling evidence of the structural and operational problems facing the existing bridge. The following link refers to this Committee meeting.</p>

  <p><a href="../../../s3/committees/forthXbill/or-10/fcb10-0202.htm#Col7">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/s3/committees/forthXbill/or-10/fcb10-0202.htm#Col7</a>.</p>

  <p>Such evidence reinforced our existing, considered conclusion that the type of extensive remedial work required to extend the use of the Forth Road Bridge for all vehicles would have severe economic implications, accordingly no further re-examination of the bridge for such purposes will be pursued.</p>

  <p>The standard of maintenance of motorways and trunk roads by the Trunk Road Operating Companies is independently monitored and audited by the Performance Audit Group (PAG) on behalf of Transport Scotland. PAG&rsquo;s assessment of the performance of the operating companies is published in its annual report, which is available online at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.performanceauditgroup.co.uk/publicat.htm" target="_blank">http://www.performanceauditgroup.co.uk/publicat.htm</a>.</p>

  <p>The most recent PAG annual report (2008-09) notes that overall, the operating companies carried out maintenance of the network well and that the standard of workmanship by the operating companies, their sub-contractors and works contractors was generally good.</p>
