  <p>The General Register Office for Scotland (GROS) has no plans to make online access to the 1901 census through the Scots Origins website available free of charge to schools.

  <p>The number of dentists working in Scotland has increased constantly over the last 30 years and by 300 in the last eight years, and we are committed to increasing numbers further. The Scottish Advisory Committee for the Dental Workforce (SACDW) advises on the most effective way to achieve this.</p>

  <p>The size of the graduate output is only one of the various factors which influence the supply of and access to practising dentists. The current target output of 120 is considered to be the level appropriate to expected demands, on the information currently available. Scottish Council for Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education with ISD Scotland are improving the information available by mapping the characteristics and supply dynamics of the dental workforce. Once this information is available, SACDW will consider the findings and will recommend on the most appropriate method to increase the number of dentists working in primary care in Scotland.</p>

  <p>There is no distinction drawn between clinical and medical cases. Over the last three years there has been a fall in the number of cases intimated to the NHSScotland.</p>

  <p>In addition to completing the three Health Technology Assessments currently on its work programme, HTBS will add further Health Technology Assessments to its work programme, continue to provide HTBS Comments on NICE Guidance (eight published last year and approximately 30 anticipated this), and develop and support the work of the Scottish Medicines Consortium.</p>

  <p>The Health Technology Board for Scotland (HTBS) informs the public and clinical communities about its assessments in a variety of ways. These include: involving health professionals and patient representatives throughout assessments in the Topic Specific Groups formed for each assessment; publishing regular updates on its website; announcing key developments in press releases; conducting focus groups with patients; circulating work programmes and updates; and holding public consultation meetings at the beginning of the public consultation phase for each assessment. For example, in November last year, more than 130 health professionals and patients and carers attended HTBS workshops about its assessment of the organisation for services for diabetic retinopathy screening.</p>

  <p>Additionally, HTBS draws on the expertise of its Public Involvement Working Group, NHS Reference Group, Advisory Council, and Communications Reference Group to improve, continuously, information provided to the public and clinical communities.</p>

  <p>These figures do not include the planned expansion of intensive care units in order to manage winter pressures. These plans allow ICUs in Scotland to expand to around 145 beds for extended periods, stretching to around 170 beds for short periods.

  <p>The Scottish Executive has to be satisfied that its legislative proposals are compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. It has been aware from the outset that the legislation on the Crofting Community Right to Buy would require to be formulated carefully to achieve compliance with the convention. Ministers have sought and been given legal advice on the provisions necessary to achieve that outcome.</p>

  <p>I have asked Graeme Munro, Chief Executive of Historic Scotland to answer. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Action to protect listed structures, such as those parts of Craigmaddie and Mugdock Reservoirs, may be taken under powers set out in the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) (Scotland) Act 1997. Such action is, in the first place, the responsibility of the relevant planning authority, in this case East Dunbartonshire Council. I understand that the proposals affecting Craigmaddie and Mugdock Reservoirs are still under active consideration by East Dunbartonshire Council.</p>

  <p>In addition, a Strategic Change Fund of &#163;3 million over three years has been announced for the sector. The criteria for access to the fund are being developed by Scottish Museums Council at present.

  <p>The National Cultural Strategy undertook to increase access to collections by means of ICT, including securing the future of SCRAN (the Scottish Cultural Resources Access Network). The Executive has now awarded a grant of &#163;120,000 to SCRAN.</p>

  <p>Scottish Museums Council is the Executive&#146;s main adviser on local museums and the main channel of Executive support for Scotland's 400 or so local museums and galleries. Scottish Museums Council is conducting the national audit of the museums sector, and is leading on developing the criteria for the Strategic Change Fund, and sits on the steering group for industrial museums. Officials have regular meetings with Scottish Museums Council to discuss key policy issues. I have agreed to meet next month with the Director, Jane Ryder, to discuss future developments in the museum sector.</p>

  <p>There could be difficulties in deciding how international best practice can inform the development of national policy on museums in Scotland. We will take account of best international practice taking appropriate account of the differences in historic pattern of provision, legal and financial frameworks between Scotland and other countries.</p>

  <p>I have no plans to visit Kilmartin Museum. The Scottish Executive has responsibility for the National Museums and Galleries, whereas responsibility for the 400 or so non-national museums lies with local agencies.</p>

  <p>I understand that arrangements had been made for Allan Wilson in his capacity as Deputy Minister for Sport, Arts and Culture to visit Kilmartin Museum but the visit had to be cancelled due to pressing parliamentary business. Subsequently, a meeting with ministers was offered in either Glasgow or Edinburgh. The offer was not accepted.</p>

  <p>In the current financial year &#163;2.15 million has been allocated for the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs Interim Committee, with further funding of up to &#163;350,000 made available for the Gateway Centre at Lomond Shores. For 2002-03 an allocation of &#163;3.8 million has been made in respect of both the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs and the Cairngorms National Parks. We shall keep the budget under review but can make no commitment at this stage to making additional assistance available.</p>

  <p>The table shows the percentage increase, or decrease, in the average whole time equivalent of agency nursing staff in 2000-01 compared with 1999-2000 by trust. The percentage increase for 1999-2000 compared with 1998-99 is not available due to the reconfiguration of trusts in 1999. Information on agency nurse usage within NHSScotland will be routinely published on ISD&#146;s website at:</p>

  <p>The audit of mobile phone base stations set up in response to the recommendations of the Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones (the Stewart Group) is being carried out by the Radiocommunications Agency (RA).</p>

  <p>The RA, when conducting its initial audit of mobile telephone base stations on school sites, did not automatically calculate the amalgam of cumulative emissions at peak times. The audit was designed to measure accurately all emissions received at the measurement location at the time when the audit was undertaken.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, the RA was alert to the possibility that at the time of each audit not all channels from any particular base station would, necessarily, be transmitting. Consequently the RA decided to carry out more detailed measurements where the measurements taken were found to be higher than 1/100th of the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) guidelines. However, these additional measurements did not prove necessary as during the course of the many thousands of measurements made during the 101 audits, the highest measurement recorded was 1/279th of the ICNIRP guidelines. Typically measurement levels were found to be many thousands of times below the ICNIRP guidelines.</p>

  <p>This is a matter for West of Scotland Water. The Chief Executive&#146;s response is:</p>

  <p>The criteria used to short list the potential development areas for the Katrine Water Project are detailed in Table D6.2 of the Environmental Statement for the project, together with the primary observations made under each criteria against each area. The criteria can be grouped under three main headings:</p>

  <p>Economics: The total comparative cost of developing a scheme around a potential development area, including capital and operating costs for the lifetime of the works.</p>

  <p>Environment: Impacts on people, the natural and cultural heritage and energy use.</p>

  <p>Engineering: The anticipated ground conditions, available land, topography, local services and service corridor for connection of infrastructure.</p>

  <p>As described in appendix D6.1 of the Environmental Statement for the project the study area extends from 2.5 miles West of Milngavie to Balmore WTW 5 km East of Milngavie. The study area naturally derived itself from consideration of several fundamental criteria, namely; location of raw water supply (i.e. existing Milngavie raw water reservoirs), location of water distribution infrastructure (i.e. existing Milngavie Water Treatment Works and existing Glasgow bulk water supply pipework) and the elevation relative to Milngavie reservoirs. In addition, other considerations included use of existing assets (i.e. existing Balmore Water Treatment Works), land ownership, current land use and land character. On this basis no significant economic, environmental or engineering benefit was identified in extending the study area beyond that considered.</p>

  <p>This is a matter for West of Scotland Water. The Chief Executive&#146;s response is:</p>

  <p>(a) Energy consumption is one of many environmental criteria considered in the selection of the preferred option for the Katrine Water Project. Question S1W-22092 (answered on 4 February 2002) sets out the methodology used to consider all environmental criteria.</p>

  <p>The preferred option, like many other options considered, uses available treatment capacity at Balmore Water Treatment Works (WTW). In so doing these options significantly reduce the overall energy consumption of the Loch Lomond Water Supply Scheme from current levels. Present predictions indicate that this benefit could offer a potential annual saving in the order of 8.5 kWh from current energy levels in the Lomond Scheme if 100 Ml/d is transferred to Balmore WTW from Katrine aqueducts.</p>

  <p>For all those options considered that use available treatment capacity within Balmore, the total energy consumption ranged between 14.5 million kWh/annum and 23.8 million kWh/annum (based on estimated average water consumption). The energy consumption for the preferred option is estimated as 19.7 million kWh/annum) which lies in the mid-range of options.</p>

  <p>Using government figures<sup>1</sup> the following annual CO<sub>2</sub> consumption equivalents are calculated;</p>

  <p><table border="BORDER" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="100%">
<tr>
<td width="61%" valign="TOP" height="16">
<p>Energy consumption of Options (using Balmore):

  <p>1. Conversion factors of 0.43 kgCO2/kWh, DETR/DEFRA publication Guidelines on Reporting of Greenhouse Gas Emissions.</p>

  <p>2. Rounded to nearest 1000 tonne.</p>

  <p>(b) Pumping and pipework elements formed an integral part of all options considered for the Katrine Water project. In relation to maintenance of pumping infrastructure and other pipework, the preferred option compares favourably in a number of areas with other options considered (e.g. number of pump installations, integration with existing infrastructure, pipe pressures, network pressure stabilisation etc.).</p>

  <p>A descriptive summary of how the pumping and pipework maintenance requirements of the preferred option relate to the short-listed options can be found in appraisal Table D9.2 of the <i>Environmental Statement</i> for the project which may be viewed at the planning offices of East Dunbartonshire Council. This information is also presented in Table B2 of the advance extracts of the <i>Environmental Statement</i> which were distributed at a public meeting of the 26 September.</p>

  <p>No. The powers in the Weeds Act 1959 arise from the need to safeguard commercial food production.</p>

  <p>In nature conservation terms, Japanese Knotweed is listed in Schedule 9 to the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and under this act it is an offence to accidentally or deliberately release the species into the wild.</p>

  <p>The Executive is participating in a GB-wide review of the current and potential threats posed by invasive non-native species, including Japanese Knotweed. The review will consider and identify appropriate preventative and damage minimisation strategies and will report to Scottish ministers later this year.</p>
