  <p>We will be implementing the CAP subsidy rules as flexibly as possible where producers have been unable to comply with these due to the foot-and-mouth disease restrictions.

  <p>The Executive has not yet made a decision on whether to replace the external adjudicators of Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise with an ombudsman. The question was discussed in the Executive&#8217;s consultation paper <i>Modernising the Complaints System</i> . The closing date for comments was 10 January 2001 and we are currently analysing the responses. The Executive aims to publish a second consultation paper in the spring, setting out detailed proposals based on these responses.</p>

  <p>In terms of Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR), whatever complaints system is put in place after the consultation, whether a continuation of the current system or otherwise, will be compliant with ECHR.</p>

  <p>The full range of cod recovery measures has yet to be agreed: the closed areas in the North Sea and off the west coast represent initial, emergency measures to help protect cod stocks.

  <p><i>The Code of Practice on Openness for the NHS in Scotland</i> makes a presumption of openness and accessibility of information.

  <p>Requests for information are considered on an individual basis and decisions on whether to provide information depend on the subject matter and content.

  <p>Inequalities in health are reflected in many different aspects of people&#8217;s health. For example, the proportion of babies born with low birth weight is higher among people living in relatively deprived areas. The incidence of many diseases including lung cancer, coronary heart disease and respiratory diseases is also much higher in deprived areas. Mortality rates are higher and as a result the average life expectancy of people living in deprived areas is less than that of people living in more affluent areas. There is, therefore, no single measure of health inequalities but rather a wide range of measures that must be taken into account to reflect the influence of socio-economic circumstances on health.</p>

  <p>Tackling inequalities is a key priority for the Scottish Executive and our long-term aims for tackling poverty and injustice were set out in <i>Social justice&hellip; a Scotland</i> <i>where everyone matters</i>. Several of the milestones in the Social Justice document are important measures of health. <i>Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change</i> reinforces our commitment to tackling health inequalities within Scotland, and states that &quot;we will develop the health indicators within our Social Justice framework of targets and milestones to track progress in tackling health inequalities&quot;.</p>

  <p>The concord drafted by the UK Metatagging in Education Group (MEG) is not a data input standard. It is a series of principles underpinning the work of the group in developing and promoting guidance on the use of descriptive standards, or &quot;metadata&quot;, for meaningfully and usefully describing educational content. The National Grid for Learning (NGfL) in Scotland already uses a set of metadata standards closely based on existing international standards, and adoption of these is now normal for schools material commissioned by the Executive and by Learning and Teaching Scotland. The Executive has been represented at all meetings of UK MEG, and we expect that the NGfL Scotland standards will be influential in shaping wider agreement on metadata for content intended for schools.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-8534 by Mr Jim Wallace on 6 July 2000, whether any cases in the last six months have been abandoned because of a breach of statutory time limits and, if so, how many.</p>

  <p>Between 1 August 2000 and 31 January 2001, 1,113 cases are recorded as having been marked no proceedings by Procurators Fiscal on the ground that they had been reported to the fiscal after the expiry of the relevant statutory time bar.</p>

  <p>No cases are recorded as having been marked &quot;no further proceedings&quot; on the ground that there had been a breach of a statutory time limit, but it is almost certainly the case that the imminent expiry of a time limit has contributed to decisions to discontinue proceedings in which there have been other problems (for example, lack of success in serving a summary complaint).</p>

  <p>The available information, from the annual statistical returns made by the district courts, is shown in the table. Only incomplete data are available in respect of 1995-96 and 1996-97.

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The data on the value of money received relates to court-imposed fines (including back-duty), registered fines, compensation orders, police and procurator fiscal conditional offers of fixed penalties and police fixed penalty notices.</p>

  <p>2. The amount retained by the courts will not be exactly the difference between the amount received and the amount remitted to Exchequer, as this may not all have been collected in the year in which it was remitted. In addition, missing data must be considered, as indicated in footnote 3.</p>

  <p>3. Value received excludes some types of fine for the following district courts for the following years:</p>

  <p>1997-98&#8212;Angus, East Renfrewshire, Glasgow, Midlothian, North Lanarkshire, South Ayrshire, West Dunbartonshire.</p>

  <p>1998-99&#8212;Fife, Glasgow, Midlothian, North Lanarkshire.</p>

  <p>1999-2000&#8212;Fife, Glasgow, Midlothian, North Lanarkshire.</p>

  <p>4. 1999-2000&#8212;Inverclyde - value received includes an amount received from Glasgow in respect of allocation of undistributed balances over 12-month period for fixed penalty notices for non-endorsable traffic offences.</p>

  <p>In pursuing Best Value local authorities should consider all routes to service improvement. They are expected not to discriminate between potential means of service delivery on any grounds other than those prescribed by statute or directive.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&#8217;s approach to Best Value in local government is not prescriptive about tender exercises to any great degree, but where sheltered employers such as Remploy and Blind Workshops are eligible to compete for contracts and meet the basic criteria set by the invitation to tender, we would certainly encourage local authorities and other public bodies to allow them to do so.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&#8217;s own procurement guidance encourages buyers to include sheltered employers on tender lists wherever possible.</p>

  <p>As I made clear in my statement to Parliament on 14 February and previously in correspondence with COSLA, local authorities will not, as a result of the McCrone settlement, be expected to make any contribution from their budgets beyond that which they would normally be expected to make.</p>

  <p>All of the projects are being monitored by the Executive and the project plans, along with progress reports for each of the projects, will be published on the Executives 21st Century Government website.</p>

  <p>We have no plans to publish a further technical report on the Arbuthnott formula. The first report, published in 1999, was accompanied by a very detailed technical report which explained fully the sources of data, methods of analysis and results. The data sources and methods of analysis used in the further work were largely similar to those used in the first report. Any technical changes are explained in the final report which contains a number of technical appendices.</p>

  <p>The key influences on the relative health care needs of each health board&#8217;s population are population, the age and sex structure, morbidity and life circumstances, and remoteness. The specific factors that were taken into account by the steering group in assessing the influence of these factors are described fully in the first report (and accompanying technical report) and in the final report.</p>

  <p>The most significant change in the final report is the use of a single index (the Arbuthnott index) to reflect the influence of the factors that influence health care needs. This is based on four indicators: mortality rates among people under 65, unemployment, elderly people on income support, and households with multiple indicators of deprivation. The development of this index is set out in the final report.</p>

  <p>The unemployment rate is one of the factors that are taken into account in calculating the Arbuthnott index, and this index is used to assess the influence of morbidity and life circumstances on the need for health care. It is not used in any other part of the formula and therefore unemployment rates are not double-counted.</p>

  <p>The first report considered a number of indicators of the influence of remote and rural areas on the costs of delivering health care. During consultation, several suggestions were made for further analysis of this issue, and the additional evidence considered by the steering group showed that the number of road kilometres per 1,000 population is a slightly better indicator of remoteness than the indicators that were considered in the first report. This change and the reasons for it are described in the final report.</p>

  <p><i>Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change</i> has as amongst its core aims involving people and communities in the design and delivery of health services. The plan therefore commits the Executive to a number of initiatives aimed at improving the way in which the NHS consults on service developments. These include reviewing the statutory guidance on formal consultation to ensure that it meets the needs of modern health care systems, and takes into account the changes to NHS planning announced elsewhere in that plan. We will also provide guidance, training and support to local NHS leaders to enable them to involve the public effectively in the management of changes to local services.</p>

  <p>The guidance to education authorities and schools emphasises that sport and other forms of physical education make an essential contribution to pupils&#8217; health and general well-being. The context and opportunity for this lies within the national priority &quot;to teach pupils respect for self and one another and their interdependence with other members of their neighbourhood and society and to teach them the duties and responsibilities of citizenship in a democratic society&quot;.</p>

  <p>Increasing the amount of time devoted to sport could, however, only be done at the expense of other areas of the school curriculum.</p>

  <p>There are no plans to review current arrangements for providing physical education programmes in the school curriculum. However, <strong></strong>sportscotland is working closely with education authorities in a number of programmes to promote sporting and physical activity in schools.</p>

  <p>The provision of such activities is a matter for each local authority to consider, but the Executive recognises the significant contribution that sport has to make to various aspects of Scottish life.</p>

  <p>Detailed targets for taking forward the ambitions of sport in Scotland are set out within <i>Sport 21: Nothing Left to Chance</i>, the national strategy for sport. In particular, <i>Sport 21</i> contains a target to increase the number of people who participate in sport from a number of groups including rural communities.</p>

  <p><strong></strong>sportscotland, through the Lottery Sports Fund, is leading the work in taking forward this target. It has invested some &#163;98 million, over 21%, of Lottery capital grants for new facilities in deprived areas throughout Scotland.</p>

  <p>The core telecommunications networks in Scotland provided by operators such as BT, Thus and Energis, all are engineered as Integrated Digital Networks. The fibre backbone extends from Wick in the Highlands, through central Scotland and into Galashiels in the South of Scotland. The principle challenge is to ensure that advanced digital services are extended out to individual customers &#8211; the so-called &quot;last mile&quot; problem. The Scottish Executive is working to promote conditions for the most rapid and comprehensive provision of such services.</p>

  <p>A definitive list of consultees has not yet been finalised but it is anticipated that a wide range of organisations representing all aspects of Scottish society and business will be directly consulted in relation to the revision of the private water supply regulations. In addition, the consultation paper will be made available through the Stationary Office Bookshop, appropriate libraries and the Executive&#8217;s website, thereby allowing the widest possible consultation to be undertaken.</p>
