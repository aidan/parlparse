  <p>The list of artworks will be completed when resources allow. Publicity for the list has still to be determined but it will be published on the Scottish Government website.

  <p>From 1999-2007, no payments were available to kinship carers where the child was referred to as &quot;looked after&quot; or subject to a residency order. As part of the concordat, a kinship carer of a looked-after child and approved by the local authority will be eligible for receipt of a kinship care allowance.</p>

  <p>A looked after child is subject to:</p>

  <p>A supervision requirement made by a children&rsquo;s hearing under section 70 of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995, or</p>

  <p>A child accommodated by the local authority under section 25 of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995, or</p>

  <p>Disclosure is a vitally important aspect of criminal procedure in Scotland. The principal purpose of disclosure is to secure the fair disposal of criminal proceedings in accordance with the accused&rsquo;s rights at common law and under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and to ensure that justice is done.</p>

  <p>The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service complies with Article 6 of ECHR in terms of the disclosure of evidence in criminal proceedings in Scotland.

  <p>Physical punishment of children cannot be identified separately from other types of assault recorded on the Scottish Government court proceedings database.</p>

  <p>Section 51 of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2003 provides for a defence in certain circumstances to a charge of assault in cases involving the physical punishment of children. This section also clarifies the circumstances in which physical punishment of a child will never be justified, and provides a non-exhaustive list of the factors which are to be taken into account by the court when considering whether such punishment in other circumstances is justifiable.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Law Commission (SLC) have not been asked specifically to review the requirement for corroboration in sexual offences.</p>

  <p>In 2004, the SLC received a reference from the Scottish ministers to examine the law relating to rape and other sexual offences and the evidential requirements for proving such offences and to make recommendations for reform. The SLC published their final report on rape and other sexual offences in December 2007.</p>

  <p>However, the SLC concluded in that report that issues relating to the law of evidence, such as mutual corroboration and character evidence would be better considered across the whole spectrum of criminal offences and not solely in respect of sexual offences. Accordingly, the SLC did not make any recommendations with regard to reform of the law of evidence in sexual offences in their final report.</p>

  <p>On 20 November 2007, I wrote to the chairman of the SLC, inviting them to undertake a review of certain aspects of the law of criminal procedure and evidence. The terms of the proposed reference were as follows:</p>

  <p>&quot;To consider the law relating to:</p>

  <p>Judicial rulings that can bring a solemn case to an end without the verdict of a jury, and rights of appeal against such;</p>

  <p>The principle of double jeopardy, and whether there should be exceptions to it;</p>

  <p>Admissibility of evidence of bad character or of previous convictions, and of similar fact evidence; and</p>

  <p>The Moorov doctrine,</p>

  <p>and to make any appropriate recommendations for reform.&quot;</p>

  <p>The chairman of the SLC responded on 20 November, accepting the terms of the reference. In his response, he indicated that the SLC would be interested to examine the operation of the Moorov doctrine in the context of an examination of the law of evidence more generally, including the requirement for corroboration.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Standard prisoner admission procedures include searching, recording and storing prisoner property and cash, anti-suicide/self-harm procedures admission interviews, and healthcare screening by nursing staff on admission followed by a doctor&rsquo;s assessment within the first 24 hours. Prisoners are also given an opportunity to contact family or friends on admission.</p>

  <p>These admission procedures are followed within 72 hours by a more in-depth core screening interview as part of the integrated case management process. This interview is normally conducted in the prison links centre and is used to identify issues such as housing, employability and substance misuse. There is also a national induction package which provides general information about prison regimes, supplemented by local information about the prison of admission.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises the valuable contribution made by Scotland&rsquo;s mountain rescue teams to the safety and wellbeing of the public. The voluntary service provided by team members ensures that many thousands of people can participate in outdoor activities safe in the knowledge that expert assistance is at hand should the need arise.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to providing substantial levels of support to our mountain rescue service and funds totalling &pound;300,000 will be provided to the mountain rescue committee of Scotland during 2008-09.

  <p>The official source of information on the number of people in employment is the labour force survey (LFS). The LFS also collects information on whether people are currently studying. The latest available data from the LFS, relating to the period October to December 2007, estimates that 110,000 full-time students, including school pupils, were in paid employment in this period.</p>

  <p>The exact number of students who earn over &pound;5,225 in the financial year 2007-08 is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>However information from the 2004-05 students&rsquo; income, expenditure and debt survey shows that the average Scottish full-time student earned &pound;1,693 during term time and only 25% earned amounts greater than &pound;2,848. Full-time further education students earned less, &pound;948 on average, with 25% earning amounts greater than &pound;1,085.</p>

  <p>In combination these figures support the conclusion that the vast majority of students earn less than &pound;5,225.</p>

  <p>: The Environmental Performance Manager is currently carrying out a scoping exercise to ascertain exactly what would be involved in setting up such a scheme.</p>

  <p>The SPCB encourages the use of bicycles as a means of travelling to work and provides facilities to support this. In addition it will provide up to &pound;400, which can be paid back in instalments over a 12 month period, to anyone on the parliamentary payroll who may wish to purchase a bicycle.</p>
