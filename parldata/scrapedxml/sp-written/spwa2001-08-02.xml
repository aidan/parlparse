  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-16459 by Mr Jack McConnell on 4 July 2001, whether the target for reducing exclusions from schools by one third by 2002, as announced by the Minister for Children and Education on 13 September 1999, no longer applies.</p>

  <p>The target referred to in September 1999 reflected the target for exclusions which was announced in 1998 following publication of a social exclusion unit report to the UK Government.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive reviewed a number of targets established by the UK Government on what subsequently became devolved issues in the course of the preparation of <i>Social Justice&hellip;a Scotland where everyone matters</i> in November 1999. This document contains a revised target of reducing by a third the days lost every year through exclusion from school and truancy and this is the target to which the Scottish Executive has worked since then.</p>

  <p>Any such collation would be for health boards and education and/or social work authorities to agree locally, and the Executive does not hold information on whether and how it is done. Consultation between health, education and social work authority would normally take place on an individual basis, depending on the needs of a particular child.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2001-08-02.S1W-16828.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80167" speakername="Iain Gray" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-01/wa0802.htm#4">

  <p>The proposal to abolish the board reflects the fact that the policy of introducing competition with solicitors in relation to conveyancing and executry services has had very limited success. Since reopening for business in March 1997 after a period of suspension, the board has only registered 13 practitioners, of whom three have since resigned. Of the 10 practitioners currently registered, nine are employed by law firms; only one is practising independently, and thus providing a degree of competition to solicitors in the area in question.</p>

  <p>The annual operating costs of the board currently fall to be met by the taxpayer and are approximately &#163;130,000. The annual cost of the board to the taxpayer is thus disproportionate to the overall level of competition being provided by independent practitioners to date. The board&#8217;s own forecasts do not suggest that the position is likely to improve significantly or to reach the stage in the foreseeable future by which the board will become self-financing, as originally intended.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive why the functions of the Scottish Conveyancing and Executry Services Board are being passed to the Law Society of Scotland and how the board&#8217;s role of providing low cost conveyancing options will be maintained.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2001-08-02.S1W-16829.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80167" speakername="Iain Gray" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-01/wa0802.htm#4">

  <p>The board was established to regulate the provision of conveyancing and executry services by persons who are not solicitors, the policy intention being to promote competition in relation to such services. The expectation was that the board would become self-financing in due course from income from the registration fees paid by qualified conveyancers and executry practitioners.</p>

  <p>The very low numbers of practitioners who have registered with the board since 1997 have not allowed the board to become self-financing or to provide any significant level of competition for solicitors. Only independent qualified conveyancers can provide such competition, but only one is currently registered with the board, 10 out of the 11 registered practitioners being employed by law firms. This position indicated that alternative more cost-effective arrangements should be considered.</p>

  <p>The Law Society of Scotland has indicated that it is prepared in principle to assume responsibility for qualified conveyancers and executry practitioners. The society has in place a regulatory structure for solicitors and their employees and the regulation of qualified conveyancers and executry practitioners can be seen as a natural extension of its activities. Discussions will be taken forward on suitable arrangements for transfer. It will be important in that context that the interests of the consumer in terms of service and cost are fully considered.</p>
