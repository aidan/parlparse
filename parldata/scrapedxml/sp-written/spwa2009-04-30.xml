  <p>We want to promote a viable and dynamic agricultural tenancy sector. I therefore welcome the work of the Tenant Farming Forum on these issues and hope that the forum will be able to reach a consensus on the way forward. I have made clear that the government is prepared to look at bringing forward legislation if and when such a consensus is reached.</p>

  <p>Alcohol misuse affects all of society and that is why our framework takes a whole population approach rather than focusing only on our young people.</p>

  <p>Our framework does, however, contain a range of actions specifically aimed at reducing and addressing alcohol misuse among young people, including: investment in diversionary activities for children and young people; reducing the impact of alcohol advertising on young people; reviewing current advice for parents and carers, and working with our partners at national and local levels to improve substance misuse education in schools. In addition, at our request, Young Scot has set up a Youth Commission to explore the issues faced by young people in relation to alcohol misuse.</p>

  <p>We provided &pound;3.4 million of funding (an increase on the previous year of 200% via NHS Lothian, to the Lothian Alcohol and Drug Action Teams in 2008-09, with whom the responsibility for commissioning local services lies. Local partners are best placed to commission appropriate services in line with assessment of local need and priorities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service has recently undertaken new TV and radio advertising campaigns as well as campaigns for schools and universities and a &quot;Missing You&quot; initiative which have all been highly successful. In the longer term, the SNBTS strategy 2009-14 plans to modernise the blood collection process by deploying a range of measures, including better use of technology, designed to reach out to new donors and retain them once recruited. These will give donors more choice in where, when and how they can donate blood.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to announce that today the Scottish Government is publishing its summary report on the responses to <em>Strengthening for the Future:</em> <em>consultation on the reform of the Children&rsquo;s Hearings system</em> . The document is available on the Scottish Government website at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/childrens-hearings-bill" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/childrens-hearings-bill</a>.</p>

  <p>Copies of the report have been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 47908).</p>

  <p>We are grateful to everyone who responded to the <em>Strengthening for the Future</em> consultation. We have carefully listened to the responses and taken the time to adapt our policy to more closely address the concerns and issues raised.</p>

  <p>A locally delivered, nationally supported children&rsquo;s hearing system that provides streamlined and strengthened support for Scotland&rsquo;s most vulnerable children is our aim. The key proposals which we are bringing forward are:</p>

  <p>Panel Members will benefit from more consistent support and training in order to make the important decisions that can have such a positive effect on children&rsquo;s lives.</p>

  <p>A new body, the Scottish Children&rsquo;s Hearings Tribunal, will be responsible for all functions associated with the Children&rsquo;s Panel, including recruitment, selection and training of panel members. The Tribunal will be led by a president who will have the power to work with volunteers to exercise its key functions.</p>

  <p>People who wish to volunteer to become panel members will continue to be recruited, selected, trained and sit on hearings on a local basis.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Children&rsquo;s Reporter Administration will continue to deliver the Children&rsquo;s Reporters service.</p>

  <p>The management and provision of Safeguarders will remain with local authorities.</p>

  <p>The procedural changes proposed in the consultation, such as providing an option to speed up the process for establishing grounds where child is too young or incapable of understanding them, will be taken forward.</p>

  <p>We intend to introduce the Children&rsquo;s Hearing Bill to the Scottish Parliament in the autumn.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has no plans to monitor light pollution using satellite technology but recognises that poorly designed, excessive and badly aimed lighting can have an adverse environmental effect. That is why we have recently introduced new legislation to include light pollution within the Statutory Nuisance regime as part of the Public Health etc (Scotland) Act 2008. The approach taken on light pollution is the most comprehensive in the United Kingdom with only lighthouses being exempt from the new nuisance provisions. Detailed guidance to accompany the provisions was published in January 2009 and can be found at:</p>

  <p>In his statement to the Scottish Parliament on 1 April 2009, the First Minster set out in detail the full extent of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s involvement in this matter.</p>

  <p>Following initial information from the Dunfermline Building Society that it required additional capital to meet the Financial Services Authority (FSA) stress test requirements, Scottish Government officials undertook a series of meetings and discussions both internally and with Dunfermline Building Society and its representatives to establish what, if any, intervention could appropriately be made by the Scottish Government to assist.</p>

  <p>On 16 March 2009, Scottish Government officials had meetings with the FSA and HM Treasury and advised that the Scottish Government was willing to provide capital investment of &pound;25 million to the Dunfermline Building Society, subject to a number of guarantees on social housing loans if that would help find a solution. A number of proposals were put forward by Scottish Government Officials, the most likely being that we would use our end-year flexibility to achieve this.</p>

  <p>From then on, Scottish Government officials were in constant contact with the FSA and the Treasury to seek to reach a positive conclusion. The First Minister spoke to Adair Turner of the FSA on Sunday 22 March and met with the Chancellor of the Exchequer in London on Wednesday 25 March. Further discussions took place after this stage.</p>

  <p>On 1 April 2009, the First Minister and the Cabinet Secretary for Finance met with senior representatives from Nationwide Building Society to discuss the impact of the merger on Scotland in terms of both employment and HQ function. Nationwide confirmed that all Dunfermline staff have transferred to the Nationwide; there will be no compulsory redundancies among Dunfermline branch staff in the next three years, and that there will be opportunities for Dunfermline staff to apply for vacancies within Nationwide going forward.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has established a Finance Sector Jobs Taskforce to consider specific issues in relation to securing jobs and assist with retaining people and skills from the financial services industry in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Health for all Children (Hall 4) Guidance issued in April 2005 sets out the minimum programme of screening, surveillance and health promotion checks which every child should receive. The guidance does not stipulate a minimum level of home contact by health visitors.</p>

  <p>Health for all Children Guidance recommends that services are targeted according to need and that Public Health nurses (Health Visitors and Nurses who provide care in schools) will therefore determine the nature and frequency of contacts beyond the core programme on the basis of each individual family&rsquo;s needs. This is supported by the recommendation in Equally Well, the Report of the Ministerial Task Force on Health Inequalities, to provide services to identify and provide support to the most vulnerable children and families.</p>

  <p>Households on low to moderate incomes can buy their home through our Open Market Shared Equity Pilot and New Supply Shared Equity scheme within the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Low-cost Initiative for First Time Buyers (LIFT). From 1 April, the Open Market scheme has been temporarily expanded from the previous ten council areas to the whole of Scotland with an increased budget of &pound;60 million.</p>

  <p>In addition, our Mortgage to Shared Equity scheme opened for applications on 16 March, as part of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s concerted action to address repossessions. It allows Scottish ministers to take an equity stake in a home owner&rsquo;s property, thus enabling them to remain in their home by reducing the level of debt secured against it to a more manageable level.</p>

  <p>I know Stewart Maxwell has been a strong advocate of the benefits of using anonymised injury data collected in hospitals to inform local police action. This approach, based on groundbreaking work in Cardiff, is one we fully support and the Scottish Government has been working in partnership with the National Violence Reduction Unit to introduce it more widely throughout Scotland. Initial pilots in hospitals such as the Glasgow Royal Infirmary have shown the approach can be labour intensive, diverting clinicians from their primary tasks. That is why we are supporting a fully electronic system in the NHS Lanarkshire area, which will overcome these issues.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has reviewed, or intends to review, the requirements under the Police, Public Order and Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2006 for traditional galas, common ridings, ridings of the marches and Remembrance Day parades to be notified to the relevant local authority.</p>

  <p>I recently discussed the current notification system with the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland (ACPOS) and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA). COSLA and ACPOS have advised me that it would be premature to make amendments to the legislative framework after the relatively short period since the law was changed, either on a local or national basis. I agree with this view.</p>

  <p>There are important reasons why even non-contentious marches and parades need to be planned carefully. An integrated approach by all involved is essential to achieve this, and I understand that the notification requirements, as amended by the Police, Public Order and Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2006, have contributed to improving joint working across Scotland.</p>

  <p>The notification process, as the Guidance to Local Authorities on Marches and Parades makes clear, is intended to provide local authorities with discretion to deal flexibly with public processions in their areas.</p>

  <p>I will review the situation in due course.</p>

  <p>We have recently made significant improvements to the financial eligibility rules for civil legal aid which should help ensure that a million more Scots have access to subsidised legal representation.</p>

  <p>There are important distinctions in the way in which publicly funded legal representation is provided in civil and criminal cases which take account of the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights and of differences between civil and criminal procedure.</p>

  <p>The following table shows for each council the budgeted interest payments for 2008-09 as a percentage of budgeted net expenditure. Actual costs for 2008-09 are not yet available.</p>

  <p>The interest costs used to calculate the percentages are interest costs on local authority borrowing. The interest costs do not include PPP/PFI repayments unless the PPP/PFI is on balance sheet. If the PPP/PFI is on balance sheet the arrangement is treated as a finance lease and the local authority is required to separate out the interest cost from the principal repayment cost. In such cases the interest cost will be recognised and included with the total interest cost for the local authority.</p>

  <p>At present, there are no waiting times targets for access to clinical psychology services.</p>

  <p>The NHS is working to achieve the Scottish Government&rsquo;s target of a maximum waiting time of 18 weeks from referral to treatment by the end of 2011. This target relates to acute hospital care and excludes mental health services, homeopathy, assisted conception, obstetrics and organ and tissue transplants.</p>

  <p>I recognise the importance of mental health services as a national priority and as a first step we are developing a referral to treatment waiting time target for specialist Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) for 2010-11.

  <p>I am satisfied that Scottish ministers, in relation to the Aviemore Highland Resort&rsquo;s planning applications, acted at all times in accordance with their responsibilities and accountabilities. In these circumstances, I believe it would be an inappropriate use of parliamentary time to make any Statement to Parliament on this matter.</p>

  <p>The woodfuel demand and usage study reported increasing levels of demand for woodfuel. While the report of the Wood Fuel Task Force report indicated that there are substantial additional supplies of woody biomass. It recommended a number of actions which have been taken forward over the last year by the Task Force Steering Group.</p>

  <p>Forestry Commission Scotland (FCS) is working with a number of stakeholders to increase material from small under-utilised woodlands to develop the potential of energy forestry. FCS is also working with local authorities to improve data on wood waste and other currently unused woody material such as arboricultural arisings. Support is provided through the Scotland Rural Development Programme (SRDP) for improved management of woodlands, which can bring additional material to market, and support the development of the supply chain infrastructure. FCS continues to support the development of a strong, sustainable woodfuel industry to stimulate the use of currently underutilised resources.</p>

  <p>There are a total of 60 interpreters and 10 apprentices currently registered in Scotland. There is an uneven spread of interpreters with some rural areas and the Scottish Islands having very limited provision. With the support of our BSL and Linguistic Access Working Group, the Scottish Government is actively working to increase the numbers of interpreters nationally. We are doing this by putting in place an infrastructure which will increase the numbers of both BSL/English interpreters and the number of tutors able to teach BSL at advanced level and we have allocated &pound;1.5 million over 2008-11 to support this work.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government funded a pilot online interpreting project in 2008 to explore the potential for remote interpreting. Further work on this is now being undertaken by the voluntary organisations and private businesses involved in interpreting to consider the implications of this model of service for deaf people.</p>

  <p>The drafting of the constitutive deed which sets out the real burdens (for example in relation to the maintenance of open spaces in a development) is part of the conveyancing process carried out by a solicitor and during which both the sellers and the purchasers will be advised about their rights and obligations. This practice is the same as it was prior to the Title Conditions (Scotland) Act 2003. The Scottish Government cannot intervene in private disputes about these legal rights and obligations, and there are no plans to change the law in this area.</p>

  <p>Examples of current practice include the work of Irvine Bay Regeneration Company which has committed funding to improve the design quality of public realm and the urban environment of Kilwinning. This has been developed in collaboration with local businesses and has involved extensive community engagement in determining local priorities. And we recently presented a Scottish Award for Quality in Planning to those partners behind the Ellon Masterplan, Pattern Book and Model; a project which was developed using a collaborative planning and public engagement tool and design workshops to ensure that design is placed at the heart of the development process.</p>
