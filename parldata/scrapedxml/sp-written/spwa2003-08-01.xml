  <p>Following further negotiations with industry organisations, the other devolved administrations and DEFRA a revised financial framework has been agreed and an announcement was made on 24 July that a UK-wide national scheme would be set-up. This will be administered by a company limited by guarantee which will have industry and official representation on the board. The projected date for starting the scheme is January 2004 and officials and industry representatives will focus on finalising operational rules and other details in the run up to that date.</p>

  <p>Establishing a UK service has been a main objective for the Executive for many months and I very much hope that producers will take full advantage of the central funding being directed to address the problem of disposal of fallen stock and subscribe to this scheme.</p>

  <p>The Executive does not intend to include a condition along the lines indicated by the member to achieve the publication of individual payment details. Notwithstanding such a condition, the Executive is required by the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) regime for wider subsidy payments, which supports Less Favoured Area Subsidy Scheme (LFASS) payment administration, to take the measures necessary to protect the data collected (Articles 9 and 9a of Council Regulation (EEC) 3508/92). In addition, the Data Protection Act 1998 requires SEERAD to process personal data, in this case payment details, fairly and lawfully, only for specified and lawful purposes and not in any way that is incompatible with those purposes.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is represented on a working group which is overseeing a UK-wide study of the environmental and health impacts of waste management, including incineration. The draft report, by a consortium led by Enviros Consulting Ltd, was recently passed to the Royal Society of Chemistry for peer review.</p>

  <p>This research builds on the work of the UK Government&#39;s Small Area Health Statistics Unit whose report <em>Cancer incidence near municipal solid waste incinerators in Great Britain</em> appeared in the British Journal of Cancer, Volume 73, pp702-710.</p>

  <p>The environmental and health impacts of energy from waste schemes are considered on a case by case basis by the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency when it issues or reviews permits for facilities. The Pollution Prevention and Control (Scotland) Regulations 2000 require that applications for permits shall contain information about any foreseeable significant effects of emissions on the environment and on human health.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what research is being undertaken to establish whether women are at risk from synthetic progestins; what guidance is being issued by the Chief Medical Officer to medical practitioners about using products containing such progestins, and what public information is being made available in order to enable members of the public to make informed choices about pharmaceutical products containing synthetic progestins.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2003-08-01.S2W-697.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80018" speakername="Malcolm Chisholm" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-03/wa0801.htm#4">

  <p>The safety of medicines is reserved and is the responsibility of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The MHRA has advised that research into the risks associated with synthetic progestins is conducted in the UK and worldwide on a continuous basis by a variety of research bodies, including pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, universities and other independent researchers.</p>

  <p>The National Research Register (NRR), a UK wide database of all publicly funded research of relevance to the NHS, records that there are currently seven projects on-going in the UK on the effects of synthetic progestins.</p>

  <p>Details of these projects are available from the NRR, a copy of which is in the Parliament&#39;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 17404).</p>

  <p>In the UK, a study (The Million Women Study) involving around one million UK women aged 50 and over is on-going and aims to answer many outstanding questions about the factors affecting womens&#39; health in this age group. In particular, the study is looking at how hormone replacement therapy (HRT) affects a woman&#39;s health. This study was set up in 1996 by Cancer Research UK, the National Health Service Breast Screening Programme and the Medical Research Council. Over one in four women in the UK in the target age group are now participating in the study which means that the Million Women Study is the largest study of its kind in the world.</p>

  <p>In 2001, a European-wide review of all the available evidence regarding HRT use was initiated in order to produce consistent information for health professionals and women throughout Europe. The UK has had significant involvement in these discussions and has provided advice from the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) Expert Working Group (EWG) on HRT.</p>

  <p>In July 2002, the combined (oestrogen and progestogen) HRT arm of the Women&#39;s Health Initiative (WHI) trial, a study that was set up to investigate the long-term effects of HRT in healthy post-menopausal women in the USA, was prematurely stopped because a pre-defined threshold of harm was reached. In the UK, the WISDOM trial, which was similarly designed to assess the balance of risks and benefits of long term HRT, was subsequently stopped as it was considered unlikely to provide substantial evidence to influence clinical practice in the next ten years.</p>

  <p>When the findings of the WHI trial were published, they were immediately considered by the CSM. Preliminary urgent advice was issued to all UK health professionals later that same day, together with a fact-sheet to help advise women who may have been concerned about the implications of these findings.</p>

  <p>The EWG on HRT has met three times since July 2002 to examine in detail these trial findings together with other recent data on the long-term risks associated with HRT and their implications for the safety of HRT in the UK. Their conclusion was that these data confirm what is already known about the small increase in risk of breast cancer and venous thromboembolism (VTE) and the lack of protection from coronary heart disease. Importantly, they also confirm protection against hip fracture and reduced incidence of colorectal cancer but provide new evidence for a small increase in the risk of stroke and ovarian cancer.</p>

  <p>In light of these data, the CSM advises that the benefits of taking HRT in the short-term outweigh the risks for the majority of women who use it. However, the risks of HRT increase with long-term use and so treatment should only continue as long as the benefit in alleviating symptoms continue to outweigh the possible risk. For women with osteoporosis, the risks and benefits of HRT should be considered alongside those of alternative treatment options and each patient&#39;s treatment should be reviewed at least yearly.</p>

  <p>The CSM advises that HRT continues to have a useful role in alleviating menopausal symptoms and helping prevent osteoporosis. However, in an effort to maximise the safe and judicious use of HRT, women are encouraged to make the decision to take HRT jointly with their doctor, taking into consideration her personal and family history, their general health, concomitant medication and personal preferences and, importantly, to review the need for continuing therapy at least annually.</p>

  <p>The new advice has recently been published in the MHRA&#39;s safety bulletin, &quot;Current Problems in Pharmacovigilance&quot;, which is distributed to all GPs, pharmacists, dentists and coroners in the UK. This information, together with an article specifically for women, has been posted on the MHRA/CSM website (<a href="http://www.mhra.gov.uk/" target="_blank">www.mhra.gov.uk</a>).</p>

  <p>These important messages have also been included in the British National Formulary (BNF) and are being added to the information for prescribers and the patient information leaflet that should be included with each pack of HRT.</p>

  <p>The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) (the former Medicines Control Agency) licenses products on the basis of safety, quality and efficacy. The Agency does not take into account comparative efficacy or cost benefit.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) reviews newly licensed products using the evidence available at the time of marketing to establish the benefits and costs for NHSScotland. This enables the NHS to plan the speedy introduction of beneficial treatments where appropriate.</p>

  <p>Once sufficient evidence is available, the SMC initial advice might be the subject of a further assessment by NHS Quality Improvement Scotland or by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE), which produces guidance for the NHS in England and Wales.</p>

  <p>Information about products not recommended by the SMC for use within NHSScotland can be found on their website <a href="http://www.htbs.co.uk/smc" target="_blank">www.htbs.co.uk/smc</a>.</p>

  <p>There is no statutory requirement but it is normal practice for the First Minister to offer the Prime Minister a choice of names to fill vacancies for the office of Lord President and Lord Justice Clerk.

  <p>The Executive is committed to the release of factual information that informs ministerial decisions. Accordingly, the Executive&#39;s refinement and analysis of the discounted costs of the various relocation options identified in the DTZ Pieda study was placed in the Parliament&#39;s Reference Centre on 20 March (Bib number 27058).</p>

  <p>All decisions on whether to publish documents are taken in line with the provisions of the Code of Practice on Access to Scottish Executive Information. The general approach under the code is that information will be released except in cases where disclosure would not be in the public interest. The proceedings of the Scottish cabinet are exempt from disclosure under Part 2 of the Code. This is in line with the longstanding principle that it is not in the public interest to disclose private deliberations of government as disclosure would harm the frankness and candour of internal discussion.</p>

  <p>For the last two years, the way in which changes in charges have affected business customers are shown in the table. Figures for the change between 2000-01 to 2001-02 cannot be provided because of the introduction of a new billing system by one of the former water authorities.</p>
