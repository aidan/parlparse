  <p>We anticipate that across Scotland we will exceed the HEAT target to increase the number of people with a diagnosis of dementia by March 2011. Some NHS boards have already met their target and all are working hard towards meeting them by March 2011.</p>

  <p>The most recent information about performance against the HEAT target is available at:</p>

  <p>All boards have plans in place to deliver their targets. Many are now on, or ahead of, trajectory. One board has already met its target, ahead of schedule. We anticipate that the national target will be met by end March 2011.</p>

  <p>This was a development target and delivering the target has, as expected, generated valuable lessons about how to deliver most effectively. This learning has been incorporated into the guidance for boards to support delivery of the new HEAT target on Child Healthy Weight, 2011-14.</p>

  <p>In addition to a survey of all Scottish local authorities referred to in that answer, Health Protection Scotland is also undertaking a survey of a cross section of sunbed premises in order to gauge how businesses are complying with the legislation and whether there have been any difficulties with implementing the statutory requirements.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the Scottish Government is in discussion with Cancer Research UK to determine whether they can undertake some additional work with sunbed users, to explore social norms concerning sunbed use, such as whether under 18s have changed their perceptions and/or actions as a result of the regulations.</p>

  <p>HEAT 3 was a development target which required NHS boards to set up what were, in the majority of cases, entirely new services. It was therefore expected that much of the delivery would be in the second half of the three-year target period. This has proved to be the case.</p>

  <p>To ensure maximum support for boards the Scottish Government appointed a Child Healthy Weight National Co-ordinator within the Scottish Government in January 2010.</p>

  <p>As a result of the efforts of boards, supported by the steps the Scottish Government has taken, we anticipate successful delivery of the target by end March 2011.</p>

  <p>The target to reduce the time from referral to treatment for a psychological therapy to 18 weeks will be included in the HEAT targets for the first time from April 2011, to be achieved by December 2014. While NHS boards have made good progress in improving access to psychological therapies since 2006, and some are already providing access to some psychological therapies within 18 weeks, they will have to do some service redesign to increase their capacity to deliver a range of appropriate psychological therapies, including ensuring that they have sufficient staff who are trained and competent to deliver psychological therapies and to provide clinical supervision. In order to meet the target boards will also have to develop their information systems to measure waiting times and track progress.</p>

  <p>The HEAT target is framed to encourage the development of proactive community support; planning ahead to manage anticipated crises; earlier access to specialist assessment and treatment at home, in the accident and emergency unit or within hospital, and better co-ordination of health and social care support to enable a timely, safe and supported return home.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is allocating &pound;70 million from within the NHS budget to a Change Fund in 2011-12 which will enable NHS boards and partner local authorities, together with the third and independent sectors, to redesign services in support of improved care outcomes for the growing older population. The Change Fund will assist partners in achieving the HEAT target and in ensuring older people receive the best possible care whenever they need it.</p>

  <p>Guidance issued jointly by the Scottish Government and COSLA on accessing this fund requires all partnerships, by 28 February 2011, to prepare and submit Change Plans setting down how their allocation will be used to achieve a shift in the balance of care. We will work closely with partnerships to develop these plans.</p>

  <p>This is a matter for individual planning authorities. Planning legislation specifies that if an applicant has not complied with the statutory requirements for pre-application consultation (PAC), or any additional requirements requested by the planning authority, the planning authority cannot process the planning application.</p>

  <p>Where members of the public feel their concerns about the proposal itself have not been addressed by the prospective applicant as a result of PAC, they should make representations to the planning authority on the eventual application. The authority can give due consideration to such representations when deciding whether or not to grant planning permission.</p>

  <p>Since the bill was first introduced to the Scottish Parliament, the Protecting Vulnerable Groups (PVG) Scheme has been the subject of wide ranging communications and consultation activities with the voluntary, public and private sectors across Scotland.</p>

  <p>Communications activities have included information events, both open and targeted to specific interests, publication of a regular newsletter and web-based materials and editorial and direct mail activities.</p>

  <p>A comprehensive package of guidance and training materials, developed in partnership with a group of representatives from the public and voluntary sectors, has been available and publicised since summer 2010. Also since the summer 2010, Disclosure Scotland has been operating a PVG telephone and email helpline service dealing with specific queries. A parallel service has been operating for the voluntary sector via the Central Registered Body in Scotland (CRBS).</p>

  <p>All of these materials have targeted the public, private and voluntary sectors using an extensive database of over 9,000 contacts which is added to daily by individuals and organisations registering on the PVG Scheme information website.</p>

  <p>Additional support has been made available to the voluntary sector through CRBS, which provides information, support and training to third sector groups and organisations. To date, more than 1,400 people who work and volunteer with vulnerable groups have attended PVG Scheme training sessions run by CRBS.</p>

  <p>In the run up to commencement, public awareness raising activities include advertising in the Scottish daily press, editorials in local press, adverts on local radio and also direct mailing, web and public relations activities to reach less visible groups and organisations.</p>

  <p>NHS Lanarkshire put in place a number of continuity measures to ensure staff were fully supported in reaching patients during the recent severe weather conditions.</p>

  <p>The board identified key clinical staff and their home addresses so that they could be reallocated to their closest place of work. This allowed them to minimise the numbers of staff having to travel any significant distance, while still maintaining business continuity in the key areas.</p>

  <p>They also identified staff with four-wheel-drive (4x4) vehicles which assisted in transporting other staff to and from hospitals, health centres and other work places, as well as assisting with transport for home visits, specimen collection and other key work.</p>

  <p>Additional 4x4 vehicles from NHS Lanarkshire&rsquo;s out-of-hours service and Property and Support Services Department were used to assist in transportation. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency also used their 4x4 vehicles to help staff get to work. Discussions took place with the British Red Cross and the Army to have additional 4x4 vehicles on standby.</p>

  <p>The board worked with North Lanarkshire Council to request targeting road gritting and clearing for patients requiring dialysis.</p>

  <p>In the community, the focus was on the provision of clinical support to the most vulnerable patients including elderly people, insulin dependent diabetic patients, and patients with palliative care needs. District nursing teams and palliative care teams walked to patients in estates which were inaccessible by cars due to the weather.</p>

  <p>NHS Lanarkshire also introduced a service to deliver medicines and dressings to patients within the community where these were urgently required. This was in addition to the usual delivery service provided by community pharmacies, and was targeted at patients who had no other means of receiving their medication.</p>
