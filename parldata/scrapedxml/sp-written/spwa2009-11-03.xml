  <p>The Scottish Government is working with the Violence Reduction Unit to address the particular challenges associated with tackling violence in domestic settings, violence which often takes the form of domestic abuse. For example, following the successful pilot of the Caledonian System in Edinburgh, a comprehensive approach to helping the victims of domestic abuse and reducing re-offending, we are investing &pound;2.4 million in rolling out the project in the rest of Scotland.</p>

  <p>The General Dental Council (GDC) determines the appropriate UK standard of proficiency required for a person to practise competently and safely, and also the content and standard of the education and training (including practical experience) it considers is necessary for imparting the knowledge and skills required for individuals to obtain that proficiency.</p>

  <p>Presently there are two GDC approved courses available to NHS employees wishing to manufacture and fit dentures. The Edinburgh Dental Institute (EDI) offers a 37-week full-time course and Kent, Surrey and Sussex Deanery (KSSD) offer a two-year distance learning programme.</p>

  <p>Those who successfully complete GDC approved educational and training requirements which qualify them to manufacture and/or fit dentures, including those who become NHS employees, are expected to maintain their skills and knowledge as necessary through continuing professional development.</p>

  <p>Further information is available from the GDC website <a href="http://www.gdc-uk.org/" target="_blank">http://www.gdc-uk.org/</a>.</p>

  <p>The current economic downturn is affecting labour markets across the globe, but Scotland&rsquo;s employment continues to be higher than the UK, and there continues to be a significant number of job opportunities across the country.

  <p>In Scotland, there is currently one adult extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) machine in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary and two in Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.</p>

  <p>As respiratory ECMO for adults is a rare and highly specialised procedure, it is available for Scottish patients through the UK ECMO centre at Glenfield Hospital in Leicester, which comprises a dedicated unit of highly trained and experienced staff with the range of skills required to deliver treatment. Given the recent increase in demand for ECMO as a result of the pandemic, UK health ministers have agreed to double ECMO facilities at Glenfield hospital to 10 beds, following recommendations from the UK Critical Care Clinical Group.</p>

  <p>Additional short-term capacity has also been commissioned at the Royal Brompton and Papworth Hospitals in England which can provide another four beds.</p>

  <p>Scottish adult patients can also receive treatment at the designated European ECMO centre in Stockholm where there are two beds.</p>

  <p>In Scotland, Aberdeen Royal Infirmary is the only site with both adult ECMO machines and a clinical team trained by Leicester to provide respiratory ECMO. ECMO can be provided in Aberdeen if additional capacity is required, but only with the agreement and ongoing support and advice of Leicester clinicians.</p>

  <p>The one respiratory ECMO machine at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh is used primarily for cardiac use. There is not a trained specialist team for adult respiratory ECMO in Edinburgh.</p>

  <p>In addition to these adult machines, there are also five paediatric/neonatal ECMO machines at Yorkhill Hospital in Glasgow.</p>

  <p>The Well Men Services initiative ran from 2004-06, when the policy was superseded by the more targeted Keep Well Anticipatory Care Programme.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is now providing a range of health and supporting services which are particularly sensitive to men&rsquo;s health needs. Keep Well is targeted at 45 to 64-year-olds (both men and women) in the 15% most deprived communities in Scotland. The programme aims to engage individuals who do not take full advantage of the health care services available to them. Patients who attend a Keep Well health check are assessed for their risk of current and future ill health. Those found to be at risk are referred to supporting services including weight management, smoking cessation and brief alcohol interventions or prescribed medication.</p>

  <p>Other funded services sensitive to men&rsquo;s health needs include NHS24, Breathing Space and Men&rsquo;s Health Forum Scotland.</p>

  <p>In July 2003, the Scottish Government published the <em>NHS Code of Practice on Protecting Patient Confidentiality</em> , which sets out when to obtain consent from patients regarding the disclosure of their information.</p>

  <p>When information is shared within the NHS, the legal position is that the patient&rsquo;s implied consent is all that is required. Nevertheless, the wishes of the patient will always be listened to and discussed. The disclosure of information outwith the NHS e.g. to care homes, usually requires permission from a patient or their representatives except where disclosure is required by law or there is an overriding public interest.</p>

  <p>A premises licence or personal licence once revoked cannot be reallocated. Following revocation, a new application may be made to the licensing board but there is no guarantee that it will be granted.
