  <p>In Scotland, much has already been done to increase professional awareness of oral cancer. The launch of the oral cancer training initiative in February 2000, distributed to all primary care dentists, doctors and pharmacists, has prepared the ground for substantial improvements in the early diagnosis and referral for oral cancer.</p>

  <p>Opportunistic screening for oral cancer is already carried out as part of the routine oral examination.</p>

  <p>Our second Programme for Government, <i>Working Together for Scotland</i> , promised that the Scottish Executive would have the capacity to conduct 90% of its low value, high volume procurement transactions electronically by the end of 2001. Since the introduction of a new finance system at the end of 2001, the Executive has had that capacity. The Executive, working in partnership with a range of other Scottish public sector bodies, is introducing an e-procurement service which will offer a single interface between public sector purchasers and their suppliers. The first transaction through the system was made by the First Minister at the Convention of the Highlands and Islands at Portree on 25 March 2002 at the launch of the service in The Highland Council. The Executive is currently in discussion with its major suppliers regarding their early adoption onto the system.</p>

  <p>The Executive's progress in the delivery of its services electronically is detailed in the Electronic Service Delivery Progress Report which was published on 16 November 2001 and is available on the Scottish Executive website and on the OpenScotland website at <a href="http://www.openscotland.gov.uk/">www.openscotland.gov.uk</a>. The second Electronic Service Delivery Progress Report is currently being prepared and will be published shortly.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what guidance or charging directions the Crown Office gives procurators fiscal regarding cases concerning road traffic accidents involving a fatality; when an assessment into the application of such charging directions was last conducted; by whom any such assessment was conducted, and when the next such assessment will be conducted, detailing the reasons behind its response.</p>

  <p>In Scotland, the final decision on whether any prosecution will arise from a fatal road traffic accident rests with Crown counsel. The procurator fiscal will investigate the death and will prepare a report which is submitted to the Crown Office. Crown counsel will then decide whether proceedings should take place, and if so what charges the accused should face and in which court. Accordingly, the Crown Office does not give procurators fiscal guidance for charging directions on this matter nor is there any intention to re-assess this position.</p>

  <p>However, procurators fiscal are issued with guidance on the investigation of deaths, and following a review into the investigation of road traffic deaths, revised guidance is due to be issued shortly.</p>

  <p>As indicated in the answer given to question S1W-13602, the proposals for a Tenement Bill will require to be redrafted in the light of the Title Conditions (Scotland) Bill as it is passed by Parliament. Some technical redrafting has already occurred, and it is likely that more will be required once the Title Conditions Bill is passed. As intimated in the answer given to question S1W-14294, we hope to bring the Title Conditions Bill before Parliament as soon as an opportunity arises in the legislative programme. It is envisaged that a Tenement Bill will be introduced after the Title Conditions Bill is passed, but it is impossible to predict an exact date as it will depend upon legislative time being found. The updated version of the Tenements (Scotland) Bill is available on the Scottish Law Commission&rsquo;s website at <a href="http://www.scotlawcom.gov.uk/index-1.htm">http://www.scotlawcom.gov.uk/index-1.htm</a></p>

  <p>Collating information on the number of redundant fridges and freezers held in storage at any given time does not help to manage the problem, and asking local authority personnel to supply information which changes by the day merely diverts their attention from doing so effectively.</p>

  <p>What is important is knowing the scale of the problem and ensuring that local authorities have the financial support they need to deal with it. The Executive&rsquo;s research has identified the number of waste fridges arising in Scotland and we have been able to model those numbers against local authority area. It is planning tools of this nature which local authorities and the waste management industry need. Having quantified the scale of the problem in this way, and having consulted local authorities on their likely costs, we were then able to provide them with an appropriate level of financial assistance.</p>
