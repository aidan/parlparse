  <p>No date has yet been arranged for a meeting of the cross-sector steering group referred to in Action 54 of <i>A Forward Strategy for Scottish Agriculture</i> . The main trade union involved with the agriculture industry was offered the opportunity to contribute to the development of <i>A Forward Strategy for Scottish Agriculture</i> . They did not submit a response to the consultation document, but I will continue to ensure that they are involved in the process.</p>

  <p>I am well aware of the contribution women make to Scotland&#146;s farming and food industries, and I will continue to try to ensure that this is reflected across the range of bodies established by the Executive.</p>

  <p>There are no specific plans for a route development fund. The Scottish Executive works in partnership with the Enterprise Networks, VisitScotland and the airport operators on how best any available funding can be deployed for the greatest benefit of the Scottish economy and tourism. The Scottish Executive continues to encourage the development of more commercial and cost effective air services from Scotland for the benefit of the travelling public and the Scottish economy.</p>

  <p>The Executive expects education authorities to develop policies on health education that will ensure that their health education programme effectively meets pupils' needs and develops pupils' ability to take responsibility for their health. To assist education authorities, <i>Health Education 5 -14 National Guidelines </i> have been published, together with <i>Guidance for Teachers and Managers.</i></p>

  <p>Alongside this the Executive is encouraging education authorities to adopt a multi-agency approach to meeting the needs of the whole child, including through New Community Schools which bring together education, health, social work and other services for children and their families.</p>

  <p>The policies are monitored through annual reports and Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education inspections of schools, including New Community Schools, which would include the planned programmes, procedures and provision of health education and the integration of services.</p>

  <p>A swimming questionnaire is currently being piloted in Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dumfries and Galloway. Comments on the structure and content will be used to produce a revised questionnaire which will be issued to all local authorities in November. I would expect to be able to announce the results early next year.</p>

  <p>The announcement on 22 August was about the School Buildings Improvement Fund, which provides for capital grants to education authorities under the Grants for School Improvements (Scotland) Regulations 1997 for expenditure on school buildings. These resources are being distributed to authorities on the basis of the education element of the formula, which is at present used for the allocation of capital consents on non-housing programmes under section 94 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. Full details of the grant arrangements are set out in Scottish Executive Education Department Circular 6/2001, copies of which are available in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre. The following table shows the distribution of the grant for financial year 2001-02.</p>

  <p>The Food Standards Agency advises that the Meat Hygiene Service no longer relies on spot checks of consignments of imported carcass beef. In light of SRM (portions of spinal cord) failures in consignments of beef from several other EU member states the MHS checks all consignments of imported carcass beef arriving at licensed cutting premises.</p>

  <p>Since the beginning of this year there have been 20 cases where consignments of carcass beef imported into the UK from other EU member states have been found with SRM attached. The cases involved different meat plants from Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy, Denmark and Republic of Ireland.</p>

  <p>Where consignments of carcass beef imported into the UK from other EU member states have been found with SRM (portions of spinal cord) attached, the Food Standards Agency has taken up the matter vigorously, in each case, with the authorities of the member state concerned, and reported the discovery to the European Commission. It is the responsibility of the relevant national authorities to ensure that meat plants in their territory comply with the EU rules. Seven of the plants have had their operating licences suspended as a result.</p>

  <p>Detail of the subsequent action taken in a number of the cases are set out in the following table:</p>

  <p>On matters of food safety and standards, the Scottish Executive is advised by the Food Standards Agency. Currently, the Food Labelling Regulations (1996) require particulars of the place of origin or provenance of a food to be shown, as failure to give such information might mislead the purchaser to a material degree as to the true origin or provenance of the food. The agency is committed to pressing for changes in EU rules to widen the requirement for origin labelling, particularly of processed foods.</p>

  <p>All imported meat and meat products are subject to inspection at Border Inspection Posts. These inspections consist of documentary checks on all consignments and additional physical checks on 20% of all consignments.</p>

  <p>Meat produced within the European Union must be produced to the standards required by the relevant EU laws. These are enforced by the individual member state, and require that carcasses are properly inspected at the slaughterhouse whether in the UK or another member state.</p>

  <p>In light of failures to properly remove specified risk material in consignments of beef imported from several EU member states, and following instruction from the Food Standards Agency, checks on carcass beef imports have been increased to 100%.</p>

  <p>Local authorities have also been advised to step up checks on bone-in-beef and sheep meat and the health marking of all meat in the premises they supervise.</p>

  <p>Meat imported from non-EU states is controlled by EU rules, which require that the meat must have been produced to standards at least equivalent to those required by the EU meat hygiene Directives. Again, carcasses must be inspected at the slaughterhouse of production.</p>

  <p>Regardless of whether a bid is made to host the European Football Championship in 2008, we will continue to support the development of football at all levels including the provision of facilities.</p>

  <p>Since 1995, over &#163;34 million of Lottery Sports Fund and Exchequer monies has been invested in football in Scotland. <strong></strong>Sportscotland has allocated &#163;7.6 million per annum to the schools/community strand of the sports facilities programme.

Football is also a core sport in the Scottish Institute of Sport.</p>

  <p>There are questions about the financial viability of developing full-size indoor training facilities. However, the Scottish Football Academy strand of the Lottery Sports Fund has been allocated &#163;6 million over three years to provide 60m x 40m indoor structures as an integral part of the individual training facilities eligible for support. The maximum award level has recently been increased to &#163;1 million per project.</p>

  <p>The genetically modified herbicide tolerant crops currently grown in Scotland are tolerant to only one specific herbicide. Cross-pollination with a related, sexually compatible species could produce a hybrid with the same tolerance. Separation distances around GM trials are designed to minimise this possibility although the expert advisory body, ACRE, is satisfied that such hybridisation does not pose a safety threat to the environment. Control of these plants is possible through the use of any method other than the application of the herbicide to which they are tolerant.</p>

  <p>Yes. A detailed summary of the tests considered by the Advisory Committee on Pesticides (ACP) when the herbicide, Glufosinate-ammonium, was first evaluated for safety and effectiveness in commercial use has been published. The tests led the ACP to recommend that the use of the pesticide, subject to the conditions imposed on its approval, posed no unacceptable risk to humans, wildlife, or the environment. These recommendations were agreed by ministers, and approvals for glufosinate ammonium-based pesticides were granted.</p>

  <p>Genetically modified crops have been bred to be resistant to Glufosinate-ammonium so that, when herbicides containing the compound are applied to them, they are not killed. Other crops, whether they are conventionally bred, or contain a genetic modification that does not confer resistance to the herbicide, will be killed by it if it is applied in sufficient quantity. A detailed summary of the data on the compound that were considered when approval for its use on non-GM crops was initially sought, including details of its effects on: water sources and supplies (b); other affected farm products (c); and farmland wildlife (d) is available in the published evaluation document on the compound.</p>

  <p>Our policy is to ensure that all staff have the opportunity to contribute appropriately to the decision-making process in NHSScotland, without favouring one profession over another.</p>

  <p>Specifically, all 15 new NHS Boards include &#150; as a full member &#150; the Staff Side Chair of the Area Partnership Forum, to further reinforce the importance of partnership working.</p>

  <p>Additionally, each NHS Board is creating an Area Clinical Forum, which will bring together the chairs of all the local professional advisory committees, including the Nursing &amp; Midwifery Committee. The Chair of the forum has a full seat on the NHS Board.</p>

  <p>Responsibility and accountability for direct patient care is still led at NHS Trust level. The trust board has been replaced by a trust management team, which must &#150; by law &#150; include a registered nurse or midwife as an Executive Director.</p>

  <p>On a national level, we plan to strengthen the role of nurses and midwives in policy development by establishing a new Nursing and Midwifery Forum, details of which will be discussed with the main professional, academic and staff representative bodies.</p>

  <p>Yes. I received a full report from the Chief Executive of Lanarkshire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust at the time the said articles first appeared, and my officials continue to closely monitor the position and liaise with the trust.</p>

  <p>Where there are matters that still require attention, the trust is urgently addressing them with its contractors. In many cases, however, the press articles have been exaggerated, inaccurate or refer to matters that were resolved by the trust several weeks before they were reported in the press. The people in Lanarkshire are now benefiting from an excellent new NHS hospital at Hairmyres that will serve them well into the 21st century.</p>

  <p>Four hundred and sixty-three existing adult mandatory life prisoners are affected by the transitional provisions of the Convention Rights (Compliance) (Scotland) Act 2001, in as much as they will require to have a punishment part set at a hearing before the High Court of Justiciary. In addition, there are 24 such prisoners, who have the right under the Act, to waive their entitlement to a hearing, in which case their punishment parts will be deemed to have been fixed by other methods set out in the Act. The Scottish ministers are required to refer the cases of those affected to the High Court of Justiciary but arrangements for the hearings are the responsibility of the court.

  <p>I have asked the Health Technology Board for Scotland to provide NHSScotland with a Scottish Comment on the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance on beta interferon and glatiramer when this is available. As with all medicines, the decision whether or not to prescribe beta interferon for an individual patient depends on the clinical judgement of the specialist concerned, in consultation with the patient.

  <p>The figures are based on Grant Aided Expenditure, which is the maximum level of expenditure supported by police grant. In 2002-03 and 2003-04 the average funding per head of population will be &#163;160.74 and &#163;165.17. Decisions have yet to be made on the allocations to individual forces.</p>

It is estimated that a saving between some &#163;190 and &#163;480 will be realised in the lifetime of each vehicle. This takes into account the cost of conversion and the savings on fuel.</p>

  <p>There are no plans to issue such guidelines. The Special Educational Needs (SEN) <i>Manual of Good Practice</i> emphasises the need for appropriate training for all staff.</p>

  <p>All teachers should, as part of their Initial Teacher Education (ITE), receive some grounding in special educational needs. The Ministerial Continuous Professional Development committee is looking at Continuous Professional Development requirements for all teachers (but not support staff).

  <p>The Executive has not issued guidance on this issue.</p>

  <p>Under the implementation agreement, <i>A Teaching Profession for the 21st Century</i>, teachers are not expected to be routinely involved in the direct and regular supervision and support of pupils during non-teaching periods. These duties are usually undertaken by a range of support staff, including classroom assistants and special needs auxiliaries.</p>

  <p>However, the report of the Discipline Task Group makes it clear that schools should ensure shared responsibility between staff for supervision of pupils during non-teaching times of the day.</p>

  <p>BT is responsible for the operation of the Public Switched Telephone Network which handles the 999 service in Scotland. I am advised that it has built up contingency plans over many years to take account of known risks and unforeseen events. These include the use of a helicopter to transport BT people to site when no other means of access is possible.</p>

  <p>Under major failure conditions, when exchanges are isolated from the network due to cable damage or other faults, customers continue to be able to make calls to telephone lines served by the same exchange. By implementing a call re-routing process in the isolated exchange, 999 calls can be diverted to a dedicated telephone line in the exchange itself. Where a link to the national network can still be established, perhaps by a non-standard route, the call is automatically forwarded, via the dedicated telephone line, to 999 emergency service operators in Inverness.</p>

  <p>Where no network link is possible, a BT engineer will staff the dedicated line and take details of any emergency calls. These are passed to 999 emergency service operators in Inverness, using either a cellphone or a satellite telephone. BT has three satellite phones which are deployed from Inverness, Fort William and Edinburgh.</p>

  <p>In parallel with these engineering activities, BT advises the affected Emergency Authorities of the loss of access to the 999 service in all cases where the duration of the loss exceeds 30 minutes and the number of customers lines affected is more than 500 or 50% of the exchange capacity, whichever is the less. The BT Network Management Centre starts the reporting process within 15 minutes of detecting the loss of access to the 999 service if the failure reporting criteria have been reached. It provides update reports to keep all affected emergency authorities informed of progress. A final report is distributed when service has been restored.</p>

  <p>The total cost of publishing and printing the English version of the <i>Scottish Parliament Annual Report 2000 to 2001 </i> was &#163;30,862. The distribution costs were &#163;2,450. The number of reports published was 2,500. Reports were distributed widely and, for example, were sent to organisations, representatives from which had appeared before committees as witnesses, to Scottish MPs and to international contacts.</p>

  <p>We will continue to review and assess the most cost-effective way of producing an annual report which fulfils its role of helping to inform the Scottish people of the Parliament&#146;s work.</p>
