  <p>In 1999 the National Audit Office reported in its publication <i>The Scottish Ambulance Service: A Service for Life</i> that approximately one-third of patients calling for a 999 emergency ambulance had no or only minor illness. This was based on analysis of a sample of patients who had used the service. The Scottish Ambulance Service is carrying out a more detailed analysis of the nature of calls made to the service as part of its investigation into the case for introducing a priority-based dispatch system for emergency ambulances.</p>

  <p>The UK National Screening Committee (NSC), which was established in 1996, advises Health Ministers about the modification or extension of existing screening programmes. I understand that the NSC are considering the possibility of including human papilloma virus testing within the routine cervical screening programme. I will consider carefully any recommendations from the NSC in due course.</p>

  <p>Any new developments which could improve the quality and accuracy of reporting cervical smears is welcomed. The National Co-ordinator of the Scottish Cervical Screening Programme and the National Advisory Group reviewed a range of automation options in 1998 and are currently considering the case for introducing a demonstration project to assess the feasibility of introducing liquid based cytology as a method for testing.</p>

  <p>There is no information held centrally on the number of patients with multiple sclerosis who may be eligible for Beta Interferon treatment.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-5176 by Mr Jack McConnell on 31 May 2000, whether it will place in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre a detailed analysis of the computation of the estimate of &pound;1,550 million in respect of non-domestic rate revenue in 2000-01; whether this estimate was obtained using information obtained from local authorities or assessors and to give details; whether it will also provide a detailed breakdown for each local authority of the estimated non-domestic rate revenue for 2000-01, and what its estimates are of any expected losses from (a) appeals and (b) transitional relief for (i) Scotland and (ii) each local authority.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-08-01.11.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80201" speakername="Mr Jack McConnell" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa0801.htm#7768">

  <p>The calculation of the estimate of non-domestic rate income used in financial planning for 2000-01 is detailed below. Estimates were made at a Scotland level, not for individual authorities. A breakdown of estimated rate revenue for 2000-01 for each local authority is not available.</p>

  <p>Gross rate income for 2000-01 &pound;1,921 million</p>

  <p><i>minus</i> Transitional Relief &pound; 70 million</p>

  <p><i>minus </i> Mandatory Reliefs<sup>1</sup> &pound; 205 million</p>

  <p><i>minus</i> Other reductions<sup>2</sup> &pound; 55 million</p>

  <p><i>minus </i>Prior-year adjustments<sup>3</sup> &pound; 40 million</p>

  <p>Net rate income for 2000-01 &pound;1,550 million</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Unoccupied/partly unoccupied property, churches, charities, rates rebates and rural rate relief.</p>

  <p>2. Hardship, charities and other organisations, sports clubs, rural rate relief, rates written off and provision for write-offs, refunds of overpayments interest, bad debts previously written off now payable, late additions to the valuation roll now payable and appeals.</p>

  <p>3. The main element of prior-year adjustments is the repayment of rates for earlier years as a result of successful appeals.</p>

  <p>To calculate the <u>gross rate income</u> an estimate of the total rateable value in Scotland in 2000-01 was multiplied by the poundage rate. The rateable value in 2000-01 was based on the rateable value in 1999-2000 (obtained from annual returns made by the Assessors) adjusted by the estimated 12% revaluation factor arising from the revaluation of Scottish business properties in 2000. The rate poundage, set with a view to maintaining the total tax take in real terms, was adjusted to take account of inflation (1.1%) and the ultimate losses to the rates base due to successful appeals (3.6%).</p>

  <p>Estimates of the costs of the <u>2000 Transitional Relief</u> scheme are modelled using the sample survey of 10% of non-domestic subjects in Scotland. Other estimates (including estimates of the continuing costs of the 1995 Transitional Relief scheme) are based on estimates returned by authorities in previous years.</p>

  <p>The reduction in income in 2000-01 from appeals following the 2000 revaluation is estimated to be less than &pound;0.5 million. As appeals losses transpire they will be included in the prior-year adjustment figures for subsequent years. Experience of the 1995 revaluation has shown that the main reductions from appeals are likely to fall in 2001-02 and 2002-03.</p>

  <p>A paper showing how the Scottish Executive calculated the revaluation factor, the rate poundage and a description of the 10% survey of non-domestic subjects is currently available from SPICe.</p>
