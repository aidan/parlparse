  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-3497 by Mr Jack McConnell on 25 January 2000, whether it will describe, elucidate and specify any instances where ministerial access has been, or may in future be, granted to papers dated before 1 July 1999, particularly in relation to the Agricultural Business Improvement Schemes, both original and revised, and, if not, why not.</p>

  <p>My answer of 25 January to S1W-3497 outlined the position, and I can, therefore, confirm that pre-1 July 1999 papers relating to the Agricultural Business Improvement Schemes are treated no differently from other pre-1 July papers.</p>

  <p>I believe that Electronic Identification of the Scottish Cattle Herd in tandem with Electronic Data Transfer is capable of delivering significant benefits and would put Scotland&#8217;s farming industry at the forefront in world terms, for traceability and efficiency. Following overwhelming industry support to move forward now, I was delighted to announce at the NFUS AGM on Friday 3 March that the Scottish Executive will be taking this initiative forward at an expected cost of up to &pound;6 million over two years.</p>

  <p>In January 2000 I announced that I have invited Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd to conduct a review of the effectiveness of its CFARES policy. In doing so I asked the company to consult widely with ferry users and other interested parties. Detailed decisions concerning who should be contacted, when conducting this evaluation, are a matter for the company. I have asked the company to provide its preliminary findings to the Scottish Executive by July 2000.</p>

  <p>The Executive is aware of concerns about delays in dealing with alleged breaches of community service and probation orders in some areas of Scotland. It recognises the need to ensure speedy processing of such breaches in order to maintain public confidence in the acceptability of community disposals and maximise their use by sentencers. It is in discussion with the relevant agencies in order to determine the nature and scale of any problems. In the light of these discussions it should be possible to determine whether any action needs to be taken to deal with delay. I shall write to the member to let her know of the outcome.</p>

  <p>I am delighted to report that the negotiations to secure a rescue package for Hampden Stadium and its owners Queen&#8217;s Park Football Club reached a successful conclusion last Friday evening.</p>

  <p>All the elements of the restructuring were in place by Friday night. The deal was finalised this morning and the transfer of the co-funders&#8217; financial contribution in accordance with the terms of the settlement has now been made.</p>

  <p>The restructuring proposals were formally approved at a meeting of QPFC&#8217;s creditors, called by the administrators (originally appointed on an interim basis in January) on 29 March. The administrators will now be applying to the court for the administration order to be discharged.</p>

  <p>I described the broad structure of the rescue package in my statement to Parliament on 16 December 1999. Since December, however, the funding gap has increased for a number of reasons including the worsening financial position of QPFC and its subsidiary TNS. Because of this the Scottish Executive agreed in March to contribute an additional &pound;600,000 and Glasgow City Council agreed to increase its contribution by the same amount. The additional &pound;1.2 million was not sufficient to close the funding gap but the administrators have negotiated successfully with other parties to achieve this. The Directors of both QPFC and TNS are also now fully committed to the deal.</p>

  <p>I hope that confidence in the project will be quickly restored and that the Scottish public and the corporate sector will recognise the benefits of involvement with a magnificent national asset, as existing sponsors such as BT and Coca Cola have done. When the Museum of Football, the lecture theatre and the sports injury clinic become operational and the football bodies move into office accommodation there, Hampden will enjoy a level of daily activity it has never had before.</p>

  <p>We have no plans to require Trusts to identify and report the average cost of advertising, recruiting and providing induction training per newly-recruited nurse.

  <p>Road Network Management and Maintenance Division (RNMMD) advise that the construction of the A701 improvement, because of its short length, is in itself unlikely to have any traffic impact on the City Bypass. RNMMD have also asked that, as the detailed design for the scheme is progressed, they are consulted to discuss the effect which the construction work of the scheme may have on the slip roads connecting to the City Bypass.</p>

  <p>In addition, a contract has just been placed for the &pound;3.7 million Hawick Traffic Relief Scheme on the A7 trunk road. Funding for this will be shared by the Scottish Executive (61%) and Scottish Borders Council (39%). This scheme is scheduled for completion by the end of this year.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive (and previously the Scottish Office) also provides support for local authority capital investment by way of capital allocations. This is a single allocation covering all services (except housing for which there are separate arrangements) and it is entirely a matter for individual local authorities to allocate the overall amount reflecting local priorities for services. Under the Transport Challenge Fund, a competition administered by the Scottish Office, Scottish Borders Council was awarded additional capital allocations totalling &pound;6.5 million in financial years 1997-98 and 1998-99 for the Kelso Bridge and Bypass project. Since 1998-99 grant of &pound;158,000 per annum has been paid to the council to aid rural public passenger transport services. This grant is principally to be used for revenue purposes. However, in 1998-99 up to 20% and in 1999-2000 up to 10% of the grant could be used for capital purposes. During 1998-99 a grant of &pound;8,000 was made from the Cycle Challenge Fund to the Forestry Commission (Forest Enterprise South Borders Forest District) for the purpose of creating a historical cycle route from Peebles passing through Glentress Woodland Park.</p>

  <p>In both 1998-99 and 1999-2000, grants totalling &pound;3.5 million were made available to local authorities for Rural Public Passenger Transport Services and, although these were mainly for rural bus services, local authorities have the flexibility to use the funding to support ferry, air and rail services. On 1 March 2000, I announced that, subject to approval of a Special Grant Report by the Scottish Parliament, the total funding available to local authorities in 2000-01 will be increased by 6% to &pound;3.710 million. The rural transport funding is additional to what local authorities spend on rural bus services as part of their support for bus transport. A research project to evaluate the Rural Transport Funding Package is currently under way and this is due to report in October 2000. This will help the Executive consider the issue and level of funding for rural transport for 2001-02 and beyond.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive currently funds the 42 rural and semi-rural Councils of Voluntary Service. Each CVS receives a varying amount of grant, with the average being about &pound;25,000. There is no single model applying across the country.</p>

  <p>The Review of the CVS network that was published for consultation last November identified three models of funding. The first was matching funding, involving equal contributions from the Scottish Executive and local authorities. The second was funding entirely by the local authorities. The third was a shared funding approach, aligned around community planning boundaries, that would involve the Scottish Executive, local authorities and other key agencies.</p>

  <p>These options and others are currently being considered by the Scottish Executive and a response to the review will issue shortly.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to broadening the range of people to be considered for public appointments made by Ministers.</p>

  <p>Appointments to the Water Industry Consultative Committees are made by the Water Industry Commissioner, rather than by Ministers. The Commissioner makes appointments in light of Guidance issued to him by Ministers. Among other things, the Guidance requires him to take account of the principles governing public appointments laid down by the Commissioner for Public Appointments. It also places some restrictions on the Committees' membership to make it clear that the Committees are independent of the Scottish Executive and the water authorities in advising the Commissioner on the interests of customers. The Executive believes that these restrictions are important in safeguarding the interests of customers.</p>
