<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-01-12.S3W-19572.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80396" speakername="Nicola Sturgeon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa0112.htm#1">

  <p>The public inquiry into infection with hepatitis C/HIV from NHS treatment with blood and blood products will be set up on 13 January 2009. The Right Honourable Lord Penrose has been appointed to chair this Inquiry, to be known as the Penrose Inquiry, and the Instrument of Appointment (Bib. number 47332) and Terms of Reference (Bib. number 47333) have been laid before Parliament today. As I indicated in April, it is not intended to appoint additional panel members. However, the chairman may wish to appoint a medical assessor to assist him.</p>

  <p>It is for Lord Penrose to conduct the inquiry independently and as thoroughly as he feels necessary. He has advised me that, due to the timescales involved in this inquiry requiring examination of documents dating back to the early 1980s, it is likely that the review of the documentation may take some time to complete.</p>

  <p>In my statement on 23 April 2008, I indicated that the sum of three million pounds had been included in the current Spending Review for this exercise. The purpose of this inquiry is to investigate this matter thoroughly, and the necessary resources to do so will be provided to the Inquiry from the Health budget. The Inquiries Act 2005 requires that unnecessary costs be avoided and the Scottish Government will monitor the progress and costs of the Inquiry.</p>

  <p>The appropriate documents, in accordance with Section 6 of the Inquiries Act 2005 are laid before Parliament today under the numbers:</p>

  <p>SG/2009/3 - Public Inquiry into Hepatitis C/HIV infection from NHS treatment with blood and blood products - Instrument of Appointment of Chair to the Inquiry</p>

  <p>SG/2009/4 - Public Inquiry into Hepatitis C/HIV infection from NHS treatment with blood and blood products - Terms of Reference for the Public Inquiry into Hepatitis C/HIV infection from NHS treatment with blood and blood products.</p>
