  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what additional measures it will take in respect of its Fresh Talent initiative, in light of Robert Wright&rsquo;s statement in the Scotecon research report, Population Ageing and Immigration Policy, that &quot;the number of net migrants such a policy is likely to generate falls well below what is required to have a significant impact on population ageing&quot;.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-07-15.S2W-17616.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80077" speakername="Mr Tom McCabe" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa0715.htm#1">

  <p>Long-term population trends like those in Robert Wright&rsquo;s report are notoriously difficult to predict and, by necessity, are based on a number of assumptions. However, it is encouraging to note that the latest midyear population estimates published by the General Register Office for Scotland on 27 April 2005 reflect, amongst other things, an increase for the last two years in the number of births in Scotland and that we are already attracting more migrants from the rest of the UK and overseas. And, of course, population statistics themselves are not a qualitative measure of the value that migrant labour brings to Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Fresh Talent Initiative is a long-term project to address our long-term demographic trends, but we have set no limits on our ambition for numbers of eligible migrant workers under the initiative. I am confident that over time Fresh Talent will help to enrich our cultural diversity and increase our economic competitiveness in the global market place.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many people in Scotland have no access to broadband because of their locations and what action it will take to increase broadband availability in rural areas.</p>

  <p>Our commitment is to ensure every community in Scotland will have access to broadband by the end of this year. This increased access is being delivered through the Executive&rsquo;s &quot;Broadband for Scotland&rsquo;s rural and remote areas&quot; procurement and contract award to BT, which will bring ADSL broadband to 378 rural exchanges in Scotland.</p>

  <p>BT have themselves committed to try and provide broadband to any UK household served by an enabled exchange. Some people, who live a considerable distance from their exchange, may however experience difficulty in receiving a broadband connection. There is no available figure on the extent of this problem, as it will only be confirmed once customers actually place orders for broadband and their line is tested for broadband connectivity. Nonetheless, we are actively working to ascertain the location of any Scottish communities who are &quot;out of reach&quot; of ADSL technology. In these cases, the Executive will work with BT to identify solutions appropriate to demand.</p>

  <p>Our commitment is to ensure every community across Scotland will have access to broadband by the end of this year. This has been taken forward via the Executive&rsquo;s &quot;Broadband for Scotland&rsquo;s rural and remote areas&quot; open procurement which was technology neutral and where, ultimately, ADSL technology was judged to provide the best solution for increasing broadband coverage.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive provides funding to the Scottish Road Safety Campaign for the development of key road safety education initiatives and publicity messages. Progress on implementing the recommendations in <em>Parental Attitudes to Road Safety Education</em> has been delayed due to vacancies, which have now been filled, in two key posts in the campaign.</p>

  <p>In the current financial year, the campaign will review the research and begin preparatory work on taking the recommendations forward.</p>

  <p>We are tackling congestion caused by the school run by encouraging walking and cycling to school and promoting road safety initiatives, including funding to local authorities for school travel co-ordinators and for 20 mph zones and other safety-related schemes around schools.</p>

  <p>Data about injury road accidents are collected by the Police and reported to the Scottish Executive using the "Stats 19" statistical report format. For the purpose of these returns, a casualty is only identified as being a "school pupil" if he/she was aged up to and including 16 years of age and was on a journey to or from school at the time of the accident. The numbers of such casualties killed and seriously injured in 2002 and 2003 are given in Table 44 of <em>Road Accidents Scotland 2003</em> , published by the Scottish Executive, copies of which are available in the Parliament's Reference Centre (Bib. number 34523). The corresponding numbers for 2004 are: one killed; 78 seriously injured.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is providing additional resources to local authorities for a range of initiatives which contribute to making journeys to and from school safer for school pupils. These include the introduction of 20 mph speed limits around schools; safer routes to school schemes; cycling, walking and safer streets projects; child pedestrian training schemes; and school travel co-ordinator appointments.</p>

  <p>The Executive also provides funding to the Scottish Road Safety Campaign for the development of key road safety education initiatives and publicity messages. The campaign is implementing a strategy for road safety education in the school curriculum, the aim of which is to ensure that a core of road safety is taught to all children in Scotland.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what impact the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route will have on the infrastructure costs of, and potential for, commercial and industrial development at Dyce Drive in Aberdeen.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-07-15.S2W-17485.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80109" speakername="Tavish Scott" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa0715.htm#7">

  <p>The Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route (AWPR) will provide existing commercial and industrial development at Dyce Drive with improved access to the trunk road network and consequently safer and more reliable routes to local and national customers and markets. The road will reduce congestion and allow the development of high quality public transport links to and from the City as part of the modern transport system for Aberdeen. Both of these factors will allow the further development of the area encouraging investment and creation of jobs.</p>

  <p>In the absence of the AWPR it is likely that there would be a greater burden on developers in providing infrastructure as part of any planning permission for development.</p>

  <p>The circumstances of this accident have been investigated and discussed with Dumfries and Galloway Police. It has been established that this accident was not caused by any physical characteristic of the trunk road. Therefore the Executive, as trunk road authority, has no plans to take any action.</p>

  <p>Scottish Ministers have already secured the agreement of the UK Government that Scotland&rsquo;s contribution to sports Lottery funding for the Olympics of around &pound;25 million will be retained and spent in Scotland on Scotland&rsquo;s athletes.</p>

  <p>The UK Government is hopeful that the introduction of new Lottery games will continue to boost overall Lottery ticket sales which rose by around 3% in 2004-05. Income to the existing good causes is expected to remain close to projected levels until 2009 &ndash; the end of the current Lottery licence period &ndash; despite the introduction of new Olympic Lottery games.</p>

  <p>The National Lottery share for the existing good causes is guaranteed until 2009. Beyond 2009, the UK Government has announced a consultation on the future shape of Lottery funding for arts, film, heritage and sport, with decisions to be announced in June 2006.</p>
