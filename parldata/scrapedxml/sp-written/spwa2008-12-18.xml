  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what progress it has made in developing a legacy plan setting out what Scotland and the people of Scotland should expect as a legacy from the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow in 2014.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-12-18.S3W-19139.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80396" speakername="Nicola Sturgeon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa1218.htm#1">

  <p>I am pleased to say that we have today published our interim Games Legacy Plan. This is the forerunner to what will be the more detailed full Games Legacy Plan to be launched in summer 2009.</p>

  <p>It is a national plan and is focussed with realistic ambitions. The interim plan was developed by a comprehensive group structure - comprising internal and external representatives &ndash; taking account of feedback from the games legacy consultation process (our consultation paper, 16 public meetings across Scotland and Young Scot&rsquo;s parallel consultation).</p>

  <p>It has health as the unifying theme; has five key underpinning principles, and outlines the seven key legacy programmes we aim to take forward to help deliver a legacy across Scotland from the Glasgow 2014 and London 2012 Games (and other major events). These programmes cover sport; health; education and learning; culture; volunteering; the greener agenda, and business, tourism and skills/employment.</p>

  <p>We believe that by using the excitement of the games, we can get more out of existing resources to deliver a legacy. In shaping our legacy programme ideas, we have therefore aimed to be imaginative in how we can use the games to lend impetus to existing or planned programmes. As we flesh out the legacy programmes over the coming months, we will explore other possible funding routes to turn what would be a good legacy into a great legacy. We have already bid for the return of &pound;150 million lottery funds diverted from Scotland to help fund the London 2012 Games and will explore with the private sector and other potential funders possible ways in which they can support the development of community-based legacy.</p>

  <p>As described within one of the key underpinning principles, &quot;Enhancing Partnerships&quot;, we recognise that collaboration of all kinds is essential to achieving our ambitious legacy. Success depends on everyone being committed to the Plan and playing their part in making it work at a national and local level. We have aimed to ensure our group structure includes all the relevant organisations and representative groups, particularly COSLA and other local authority representatives. That same group structure will help develop the detail of the full Games Legacy Plan and, as importantly, deliver it.</p>

  <p>A copy of the interim plan, the reports from the consultation, and the membership and remit of our group structure are on our website at:</p>

  <p>Legislation in relation to wheelchair accessibility on buses is reserved to Westminster. The Scottish Government is committed to encouraging bus operators to meet all relevant regulations within the timetables set although ultimately this is a matter for individual bus operators. The information requested on compliance with statutory provisions for wheelchair users is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it plans to reinstate restrictions on the movement of honeybees in and into Scotland.</p>

  <p>There are currently no plans to reinstate movement controls for honeybees. The rules governing the import of honeybees are set out in community legislation with which the Scottish Government is legally obliged to comply.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is currently analysing comments received on its draft Honey Bee Health Strategy and will consider any views expressed on movements. The strategy recognises the need for good communication and effective surveillance and monitoring of bee health in order to minimise the risk of importing and spreading bee diseases or bee pests.</p>

  <p>The varroa mite is now considered to be widespread in Scotland and so no useful purpose would be served by reinstating notifiable status to this bee pest.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does however recognise the importance of effective management of this pest in the hive and for that reason funds the full time post of a bee specialist at the Scottish Agriculture College who provides free of charge training, education and advice to Scottish beekeepers.</p>

  <p>Bird poisoning cases are recorded by the Division of the Scottish Government which deals with Science and Advice for Scottish Agriculture (SASA). The most recent report shows that in 2007 there were 24 incidents involving birds of prey being killed by deliberate misuse of pesticides and two incidents of red kites being poisoned by anticoagulant rodenticide. The report does not attribute cases to forests or other land types.</p>

  <p>In the past 20 years three birds which died from poisoning have been reported on the national forest estate, but there is no indication that they were poisoned on the estate. We have no records of persecution on the national forest estate.</p>

  <p>There are several agencies involved in supporting the broadcasting industry in Scotland, including Scottish Screen and the Enterprise bodies. The Scottish Government is establishing Creative Scotland as a publicly owned limited company by the turn of the year to progress the transition from Scottish Screen and the Scottish Arts Council.

  <p>Offering management leases and cutting rights is a potential option for releasing capital from the national forest estate which could be used to fund woodland creation projects to help mitigate climate change. This option is included in a public consultation currently being carried out on <em>Climate Change and the National Forest Estate</em> . The consultation closes on 27 January 2009. All responses will be carefully considered and will be taken into account as part of a wider options review being carried out by Forestry Commission Scotland <em>.</em></p>

  <p>The consultation exercise and options review will help inform Forestry Commission Scotland&rsquo;s deliberations on the detail of lease arrangements, should the leasing option be taken forward. The consultation document is on the website at <a href="http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/INFD-7KUMVM" target="_blank">http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/INFD-7KUMVM</a> and is open to anyone to submit comments.</p>

  <p>The Climate Challenge Fund is administered on the Scottish Government&rsquo;s behalf by Keep Scotland Beautiful (KSB), which provides advice and support and acts as a single point of contact for community groups.</p>

  <p>KSB supports community groups in developing applications for funding and directs groups to the relevant members of the Climate Challenge Fund Supporting Alliance for more specific advice. KSB also provides initial assessments of applications and presents these for consideration by the independent Climate Challenge Fund Grants Panel, which recommends to ministers which projects should be supported.</p>

  <p>Members of the grants panel are chosen for their knowledge and expertise in community action and carbon reduction. The panel currently comprises:</p>

  <p>Simon Pepper (Chair) - Environmental consultant;</p>

  <p>The Scottish timber industry alone provides 13,200 full-time jobs and is worth &pound;460 million by the latest estimate. The National Forest Estate (NFE) currently produces 44% of the timber in Scotland, so a reasonable estimate would be that the NFE contributes around &pound;200 million GVA (gross value added) per year.</p>

  <p>Also, nearly 20,000 jobs are attributed to tourism and recreation spending, which is estimated at &pound;209 million. The bulk of recreation and tourism related spend from forests is on the NFE, so if a figure of 75% of this spending is used, the NFE contributes around &pound;150 million GVA. Thus the total GVA generated by the NFE using the above assumptions is &pound;350 million per year.</p>

  <p>If, however, powers under the Climate Change Bill were obtained and used to lease land, then the use of funds would need to relate to climate change. The period of any lease might affect the amount of money available, but it would not affect the way in which the money could be used.</p>

  <p>NHS boards must ensure that local surveillance mechanisms are in place to identify any potential areas for improvement in infection control practice, and this includes surveillance to link cases of Clostridium difficile to specific hospitals, wards and beds. Whenever a patient is transferred to another area or discharged, the bed and clinical area they occupied undergoes a thorough terminal clean. If the patient was C. diff positive then this would additionally include the use of chlorine based cleaning agents, which are a proven method of killing C. diff spores, to ensure the bed is completely decontaminated and prepared for the next patient to occupy.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is also making available &pound;2 million to NHS boards in the current financial year to support the further development of robust local surveillance systems, and NHS board practice in this area is the subject of review by the HAI National Taskforce, chaired by the Chief Nursing Officer.</p>

  <p>The primary purpose of the advert is to engage the public in Scotland, encouraging them to invite friends and family home and to take part in events themselves. By encouraging them to participate actively in Homecoming, the intention is to help boost domestic tourism. It is also important that people in Scotland are fully engaged with the initiative so that they can provide a true Scottish welcome for those who come home in 2009.</p>

  <p>For this reason, the advert is not being played on television or in cinemas beyond Scotland at this stage. However, the advert is being promoted internationally through websites. A link to the advert has been included in VisitScotland&rsquo;s dedicated Diaspora e-newsletters which are circulated to 2,500 diaspora organisations across the world. In addition, over one million people in over ten countries will have the opportunity to see the advert through VisitScotland&rsquo;s international e-communications programme and via visits to VisitScotland&rsquo;s many international websites where the advert is hosted. We are actively considering other opportunities for increasing exposure to the advert, both at home and outside of Scotland.</p>

  <p>Sections 17 and 18 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 deal with the abandonment and ensuing repossession of properties under the Scottish secure tenancy. The information is not held centrally for local authority landlords; however, information on the number of abandonments following the start of evictions proceedings by local authorities is collected and is set out in the following table.</p>

  <p>The City of Edinburgh Single Outcome Agreement commits the City Council and its partners to a series of important local outcomes related to their policy priorities which include:</p>

  <p>The protection of children and vulnerable adults and early intervention with vulnerable families.</p>

  <p>Supporting educational excellence at all levels.</p>

  <p>Tackling deprivation, inequality and disadvantage in the community across a number of programmes including the Fairer Scotland Fund, helping long-term unemployed back to work and closing the attainment gap.</p>

  <p>Working with the community and voluntary sector, supporting vulnerable people and increasing service quality in neighbourhoods.</p>

  <p>I would expect provision of community learning and development (as community education is now described) by the council and its partners to contribute significantly to delivering on these priorities. A number of important specific contributions are detailed in the single outcome agreement (please refer to information provided below). Equally it is important to note that COSLA and the Scottish Government have agreed that Single Outcome Agreements are intended to be high-level strategic documents setting long-term outcomes for local priorities. Much of the contribution that community learning and development will make to the priorities should therefore be detailed in supporting plans and strategies for the city and for specific areas. You should of course be able to access these through Edinburgh&rsquo;s Community Planning Partnership.</p>

  <p>The City of Edinburgh single outcome agreement is available to the general public on the Improvement Service Website using the following link:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.improvementservice.org.uk/component/option,com_docman/Itemid,43/task,cat_view/gid,561/dir,DESC/order,date/limit,5/limitstart,10/" target="_blank">http://www.improvementservice.org.uk/component/option,com_docman<br /> /Itemid,43/task,cat_view/gid,561/dir,DESC/order,date/limit,5/limitstart,10/</a></p>

  <p>The following information summarises what the single outcome agreement says about the provision of community learning and development in the City of Edinburgh.</p>

  <p>Within the Single Outcome Agreement, Community Learning and Development (CLD) is reported to contribute to the following national outcomes:</p>

  <p>National Outcome 4<em> -</em> Our young people are successful learners, confident individuals, effective contributors and responsible citizens.</p>

  <p>Work is underway by CLD staff in partnership with youth agency colleagues to set up Local Youth Forums in each community planning partnership area. There is activity surrounding the Duke of Edinburgh awards scheme as equipping young people with a range of relevant life skills. Relevant indicator used to measure progress in the single outcome agreement is the number of young people achieving the Duke of Edinburgh Awards. Required action by local partners includes: commitment to develop more qualitative measures using local forums; make arrangements to obtain young people&rsquo;s views, and develop measures to assess the extent to which they are achieving the outcome in relation to confident individuals.</p>

  <p>National Outcome 5 - Our children have the best start in life and are ready to succeed.</p>

  <p>Required action by local partners commits to delivering the Early Learning and Literacy programmes along with NHS Lothian and the Council&rsquo;s Services for Communities. There is also commitment to deliver the Live Literature programme, supporting greater access to reading for customers; as well as commitment to improve support for young children and their families so that children are ready to succeed.</p>

  <p>National Outcome 7 - We have tackled the significant inequalities in Scottish society.</p>

  <p>Edinburgh&rsquo;s SOA acknowledges significant literacy and numeracy needs. CLAN Edinburgh works with literacies learners, creating individual learning plans and personal targets. The local outcome is to improve adult literacy and numeracy.

  <p>We are working closely with NHS Education for Scotland and NHS boards to develop a range of initiatives to support the development around our commitment to increase access to and availability of evidence-based psychological therapies, including cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), in a range of settings and through a range of providers. This includes increased access to appropriate training for staff and in 2007-08 we provided funding for an additional 50 CBT training places and 26 new CBT supervisors.</p>

  <p>We are also investing &pound;3 million in two pilot projects for new, innovative approaches to delivering CBT to help those specifically with anxiety and depression.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-18456 by Kenny MacAskill on 10 December 2008, whether the proposed HM Prison Grampian will have a comparable role to that of HM Prison Peterhead in the housing of serious sex offenders.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>As intimated in the reply to question S3W-18456 the planned use for HM Prison Grampian will be as a community facing prison for North East Scotland.</p>

  <p>Therefore it will not fulfil the same role currently delivered by HM Prison Peterhead, which holds the majority of sex offenders serving custodial sentences in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The community facing role for HM Prison Grampian may require it to hold sex offenders from the region.</p>

  <p>As the community facing role for HM Prison Grampian may require it to hold sex offenders from the region SOTPs or other public protection arrangements may be delivered at the prison for that group of prisoners.&quot;</p>
