  <p>RSA forecasts are calculated quarterly and these figures relate to the amount committed at the start of October 1999. The committed percentages will tend to increase each quarter as new RSA offers are made and accepted. The assessment of committed expenditure takes into account the fact that grants are typically paid over a number of years, and that a proportion of projects will not go ahead as planned.</p>

  <p>The Executive has received no reports of flooding adversely affecting the business of the courts or information on other bodies such as tribunals. Therefore, no steps have been taken to assess the impact of the recent flooding.</p>

  <p>Scotland House is leased by Scotland Europa and sublet to its resident members and the Scottish Executive EU Office. As stated in my answer to question number S1W-3174, the budgeted and actual costs of acquiring Scotland House are a matter for Scotland Europa.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what benefits to the Scottish economy it anticipates as a result of the recent visit to Prague by the Minister for Finance.</p>

  <p>I visited Prague to meet the Minister for Regional Development and to launch, with him, the Twinning Covenant for the preparation of the Czech Republic to administer structural funds. The purpose of these European Commission funded Twinning Covenants is to establish good administrative practices in these specialised areas in the accession countries. This ensures that EU funds are spent as effectively as possible.</p>

  <p>It is hard to quantify now the economic benefits to Scotland of securing such a prestigious project in one of the first wave accession countries. However, business contacts will extend well beyond the Government departments concerned, to supporting agencies and others.</p>

  <p>The value of the Twinning Covenant is &#8364;2 million over 20 months. The Scottish Executive leads a three Member State Consortium, with France and Ireland, and will administer the funding for all of the countries. The fact that Scotland is leading this exercise reflects very positively on the Scottish system for administering the structural funds.</p>

  <p>It is for local authorities themselves to decide what provision to make for pay awards and redundancy costs when setting their budgets. The local government settlement for next year will allow spending to rise to &pound;6,746 million, an increase of 3.7% over the comparable figure this year and higher than the forecast increase in the RPI.</p>

              1993 and March 1999, &pound;3.4 billion was collected by unitary authorities; 

              &pound;2.4 billion by Regions.</li>
<li>Amounts uncollected are before any 

              provision for bad or doubtful debts, or amounts written off. Up 

              to 1995-96 the figures for amounts billed and collected include 

              Council Water Charges. Authorities are asked to exclude surcharges 

              from amounts billed, collected and uncollected but not all authorities 

              are able to do this.</li>
<li>Aberdeenshire has supplied estimated

  <p>The terms of this Regulation are identical to those of the Directive.</p>

  <p>This legislation requires that the whole body or any part edible separately is tested. The testing regime in Scotland is directed to the gonad since research has shown that, of the most commonly eaten parts of the scallop, this tends to have the highest concentrations of toxins.</p>

  <p>Employment Policy is reserved to the UK Government which therefore takes the lead on the funding and delivery of the New Deal throughout Great Britain, although in close consultation with its partners, including the Scottish Executive. Many partner organisations at local level also provide New Deal services under contract or provide funds and other resources, including training funds to enhance the quality of New Deal in their areas. The public and voluntary sector organisations which contribute to the New Deal in this way fall within the remit of the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>The number of young people in Scotland who had secured sustained jobs through the programme to the end of September was 12,930 and the number of companies which had signed New Deal employer agreements was 10,094.

  <p>As from 28 February, pet owners in Scotland will be able to travel with their cats or dogs to and from the designated countries in exactly the same way as owners from elsewhere in the UK. Entry during this pilot phase will be through a number of ports selected for their profile of passenger movement. This will ensure that the practical operation of the new arrangements planned as an alternative to the present six months quarantine requirements are fully tested before the full scheme comes into operation in 2001.</p>

  <p>On 20 December I addressed a conference on modernising government. I set out the Scottish Executive&#8217;s strategic vision for modernising government. The Executive is determined that Scotland has a 21st Century government to meet the challenges and the changing environment that it now faces. The Scottish Executive has a key role to play in taking this message to the wider public sector in Scotland. 21st Century Government in Scotland will be about, working in partnership; openness and accountability; inclusion; and, delivery. In taking this forward the Scottish Executive will encourage innovation and creativity in government; identify and remove blockages; share knowledge; and, put the citizen at the centre.</p>

  <p>A copy of the full speech is available in SPICe and on the Scottish Executive website.</p>
