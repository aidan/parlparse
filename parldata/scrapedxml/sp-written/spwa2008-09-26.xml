  <p>LMOs is a non-discretionary scheme and there is thus no approval process. Land managers apply and are paid provided they comply with the LMO rules. Eleven applications were rejected (0.28%) mainly because they were not submitted by the deadline. An applicant&rsquo;s maximum allowance is calculated according to the amount of land they have. The total available maximum allowances for LMOs (after deducting the amount used for existing LMCMS commitments) for those individuals who applied was around &pound;7,600,000. The total applied for was &pound;4,803,000, which is 63.27% of the total they could have chosen to apply for.</p>

  <p>Funds are not allocated specifically to Land Managers Options (LMOs) and spend will be dependent on uptake. Land Managers Options is one of a number of delivery mechanisms in the Scotland Rural Development Programme and is non-competitive. However, spending across the other delivery mechanisms could influence spending under LMOs.</p>

  <p>The review panel has met with representatives of the agricultural industry in Scotland, England, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland as well as a number of representatives from European farming unions. It also held discussions with Scottish Government officials and their counterparts in other UK administrations and Ireland.</p>

  <p>In addition it undertook a survey of individual farmers in Scotland who had used the appeals process to help it identify areas of concern and where improvements might be made.</p>

  <p>The panel is currently finalising its report and I expect to receive its findings within the next two to three weeks.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not hold information on the presence of asbestos in public or other buildings. The presence of asbestos in buildings does not of itself present a risk to health. The risk arises if fibres are released and inhaled. The Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations 2006 place a duty on those who have the responsibility for building maintenance and repair to manage the risk from asbestos. It also includes the requirement to prepare a plan setting out in detail how the risks from these materials will be managed; take the necessary steps to put the plan into action; periodically review and monitor it and the arrangements for acting on it so that the plan remains relevant and up-to-date, and provide information on the location and condition of the materials to anyone who is liable to work on or disturb them.</p>

  <p>We have made no representations to the European Union on this issue so far. I understand that this question has been raised in the context of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s consultation on the Future implementation of the Common Agricultural Policy in Scotland. The consultation closed on 5 September 2008. Around 50 responses were received and are currently being analysed. It would not therefore be appropriate to pre-empt the outcome of the consultation before the responses have been analysed.</p>

  <p>The matter of fuel prices is reserved.
