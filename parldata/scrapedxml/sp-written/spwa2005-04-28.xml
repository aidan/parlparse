  <p>The EU agricultural subsidies appeals procedure has been in operation since November 2000 and I have no plans to make any changes to the structure of the procedure itself. In March this year, the legislation was amended to extend coverage of the procedure to the new Single Farm Payment Scheme and Scottish Beef Calf Scheme. The extension of the procedure to the Land Management Contracts Menu Scheme should take place shortly.</p>

  <p>My officials record and monitor appeals lodged by scheme, scheme issues (e.g. livestock record keeping) and the grounds of appeal. They also monitor appeal outcomes. This information allows them to determine whether any changes are required to our scheme management and administrative procedures or to the appeals procedure.</p>

  <p>The procedure has to date not identified any serious shortcomings in our systems, although at times backlogs of appeals have built up and it has taken us longer to process cases than we would like.</p>

  <p>Whilst the agriculture sector benefits from reduced duty on red diesel, worth over 40 pence per litre compared to most other industries and private motorists, the Executive is aware of the issues surrounding the rising cost of fuel, as it impacts on both the price paid for diesel by farmers and the transportation costs of their suppliers and customers. However, given that fuel costs affect all sectors of the economy and are determined by factors outwith Scotland, more detailed analysis of specific sectoral impacts has not been undertaken.</p>

  <p>The EU Agricultural appeals procedure was set up to review decisions in relation to the refusal, recovery and reduction of a producer&rsquo;s EU subsidy and ensure that my officials reached the correct decision.

  <p>There has been no formal assessment of satisfaction. However, the appeals secretariat gains informal feedback by speaking to appellants who have appeared in person at a review. Most appellants have expressed satisfaction about the thoroughness of the procedure although understandably those whose appeal is rejected feel dissatisfied at the outcome.</p>

  <p>For the past few years, the Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department has undertaken a Customer Satisfaction Survey to gauge satisfaction levels with its administration of grant and subsidy schemes. The latest survey was undertaken in February this year and early indications are that overall satisfaction levels remain very high.</p>

  <p>There have been 4,230 applications to the single farm payment national reserve. The processing of the applications has started. Where possible, the aim is to inform farmers by 16 May 2005 of the result of their application, where that has an impact on their land holding. The target is to complete the processing of the applications by 31 July 2005. This completion date has been discussed with stakeholders.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive consulted with the NFU Scotland and other organisations about whether to go for a historic or area-based system of awarding entitlements after the reforms to the CAP were announced in 2003. The historic system means that subsidy is based on historic claims rather than land held. There was a consensus in favour of the historic system, which allows farmers to adjust to decoupling and avoids redistributive effects. Since then there has been consultation on the operation of the National Reserve, with the result that arrangements have been made to enable new entrants to farming during the transitional period to apply for entitlements.</p>

  <p>There was a formal consultation period with the agricultural industry between 28 April 2004 and 21 June 2004. Subsequently, there have been regular meetings with relevant organisations in the form of the single farm payment implementation advisory group. There were also, road shows targeted at advisors, consultants and the relevant organisations in autumn 2004 and April 2005.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally. In order to accurately estimate the financial consequences of disregarding the value of care home resident&rsquo;s former homes from the financial assessment, it would be necessary to obtain detailed information on the income and capital of residents who currently only benefit from free nursing and personal care payments.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has not issued guidance specifically on the education of adopted children. Local authorities have a duty to provide support after adoption to children and their families, and this could include any educational needs. The Scottish Executive&rsquo;s adoption policy review group will report shortly and will make recommendations on improving arrangements for adoption support. Adopted children can access general education support in the same way as any other child.</p>

  <p>Regular checking of sprayers and operators makes sense from both an environmental protection and an economic viewpoint. The farming industry&rsquo;s Voluntary Initiative on Pesticides includes a National Sprayer Testing Scheme and the National Register of Sprayer Operators. As the name suggests, the Voluntary Initiative is not part of pesticide regulation as such but the Scottish Executive wishes to see the initiative succeed and has urged pesticide users to take part. In view of this we have no plans at present to introduce either mandatory sprayer testing or operator registration in the use of pesticides into Scotland.</p>

  <p>There is a long-standing policy of minimising the use of pesticides in Scotland and elsewhere in the UK by encouraging farmers and others to use pesticides in ways that will have the least adverse impact. The latest development in this policy is a draft strategy for the sustainable use of plant protection products which has the overall aim of minimising the hazards and risks to the environment from the use of such products without putting necessary crop protection at risk.</p>

  <p>The current system of equine passports is laid out in The Horse Passports Order 1997 which was introduced to facilitate trade in pedigree horses and the movement of horses for competition.

  <p>The number of recorded crimes and offences involving airweapons and unidentified weapons in the last five years is given in the table.</p>

  <p>There have been changes in recording practices which have affected the number of recorded crimes and offences involving airweapons in recent years. In Strathclyde, prior to 2001, and Lothian and Borders, prior to 2002, if a weapon was not seen or seen but not established, an assumption was made about what type of weapon this was. It was usually assumed that it was an airweapon and was recorded as such in the statistical return. However, this recording practice was changed, and if a weapon was not seen or seen but not established, it is now recorded as such and no assumption is made about what the weapon was. This had the effect of decreasing the number of incidents involving an airweapon and increasing those involving an unidentified weapon.</p>

  <p>In 2003 Lothian and Borders police began recording details of incidents using crime reports from members of the public. The complainants may identify the firearm involved as an airweapon, based on the type of damage caused, even if they have not seen the firearm. This has led to an increase in the alleged use of airweapons and a decrease in the alleged use of unidentified firearms.</p>

  <p>Within the Executive there are funding programmes that do not have a specific Gaelic designation, but a proportion of the funding will go to Gaelic education. Examples of this would be pre-school funding, HM Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) activity, National Grid for Learning, Scottish Qualifications Authority examinations, school materials, teacher training, classroom assistants and further and higher education funding.</p>

  <p>The parts of the bill which relate to the tolerable standard and which allow local authorities to require owners to repair or improve sub-standard houses will apply equally to tied houses and to dwelling houses situated on crofts as they do to other houses. The same is true of the provisions relating to houses in multiple occupation, where the house meets the definition of a house in multiple occupation.</p>

  <p>Other provisions apply to any tenancy of a house let for human habitation except Scottish Secure Tenancies and certain other exceptions which are not relevant here. Those provisions are the landlord&rsquo;s obligation to meet the repairing standard and the landlord&rsquo;s obligation not to refuse unreasonably to consent to works by the tenant to make the house suitable for a disabled occupant</p>

  <p>Those provisions will apply to a tied house if in the individual case the terms of the contract between the employer and the employee are such that a house made available under that contract is the subject of a tenancy. Similarly, they will apply to a dwelling house on a croft if in the individual case the house itself is the subject of a tenancy.</p>

  <p>The tenant of a croft is to be treated in the same way as an owner for the purpose of the scheme of assistance for housing purposes, subject to provisions avoiding duplication of assistance under the bill and compensation under the Crofters (Scotland) Act 1993. The eligibility of a tenant of a tied house for grant or loan will be the same as that for other tenants in terms of section 89 of the bill.</p>

  <p>The Executive believes that employment is the best route out of poverty for the vast majority of people, and that meaningful employment allows people to sustain themselves and their families in a lifestyle free from poverty. That is why the Executive&rsquo;s new Closing the Opportunity Gap approach puts employability at the very heart of the Executive&rsquo;s efforts to tackle poverty and disadvantage.</p>

  <p>However, we fully appreciate that disabled people and their families, like other vulnerable groups in society, can face particularly significant barriers to accessing employment. That is why we are developing an Employability Framework that aims to improve the co-ordination of services that can improve the employment prospects of those in our society facing the greatest barriers to employment, including disabled people.

  <p>The Scottish Executive Financial Partnerships Unit monitors PPP contracts routinely as part of its polices on standardisation of PPP procurement terms but no specific monitoring of confidentiality clauses has been undertaken. The unit has discussed the implications of the Freedom of Information Act 2002 with commercial and public sector legal advisers who support such procurements and with HM Treasury and PartnershipsUK, who have a similar interest relating to PPP contracts elsewhere in the UK. These discussions led some time ago to incorporation of wording relating to the 2002 act in PPP contracts.</p>

  <p>Further, guidance issued in December 2004 by the Scottish Procurement Directorate advises that the conditions of any public sector procurement should clearly explain that information provided to the public body by the bidder may be subject to disclosure under the act. PPP terms are consistent with that guidance. These terms will be kept under review as practice under the act develops.</p>

  <p>Research has identified only one instance where a contract between the Scottish ministers and Thunderchief Pictures Limited was unsigned but proceeded on the basis of a draft contract issued by the Scottish Executive. There may of course be other circumstances in which signing is delayed, perhaps due to disagreements between the parties, on the detail and/or interpretation of the contract.</p>

  <p>The Executive does not regard leaving contracts unsigned and undated as good practice. Occasionally, however, circumstances arise in which signing is delayed, perhaps due to disagreements between the parties on the detail and/or interpretation of the contract. The fact that a contract may be unsigned or undated may not necessarily mean it is legally invalid.</p>

  <p>There is no need to publish an updated version. The information is correct and the figures are given in full-time equivalent terms and apparent discrepancies result from rounding up or down in both the data and the totals.</p>

  <p>The 2004 Teacher Census provides an update of this information on teachers in publicly funded primary schools. Again the data in tables may not sum to the totals because of rounding.

  <p>The Executive is aware of the allegations of ill-health in proximity of the TETRA mast at Drumcarrow, Fife. The issue has been raised in both the Scottish and Westminster Parliaments, and highlighted in the media.</p>

  <p>In keeping with the normal approach to local health concerns this issue is being addressed by the local NHS board. We are advised that the Director of Public Health, NHS Fife has set up an Environmental Hazard Investigation Team with a remit to look at allegations of ill-health in the Drumcarrow area of north east Fife. This team includes representation from the public health department, councillors, community councillors, local pressure groups, Health Protection Scotland (formerly SCIEH), Fife Council and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency.</p>

  <p>A separate technical sub-group of the Environmental Hazard Investigation Team has been collating information provided by local community councils and residents in the Drumcarrow area and has also examined available health statistics relevant to the alleged ill-health in the area. A report has been prepared by the sub-group which is due to be considered at the next meeting of the Environmental Hazard Investigation Team.</p>

  <p>It is an offence under section 1(1) of the Control of Pollution (Amendment) Act 1989 (the &quot;1989 Act&quot;) to transport controlled waste to or from any place in Great Britain unless registered as a carrier of controlled waste in accordance with the Controlled Waste (Registration of Carriers and Seizure of Vehicles) Regulations 1991.
