  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what information it has on the volume of travellers between Scotland and the EU accession states; what action it has taken to promote new direct flights to these states, and what strategy it has for obtaining information on movements between these destinations and for providing direct flights.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-06-10.S2W-16909.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80115" speakername="Nicol Stephen" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa0610.htm#1">

  <p>Direct air links between Edinburgh-Prague and Glasgow-Prague have already been established. Any approach by an airline to commence services from Scotland to the other EU accession states will be considered.</p>

  <p>In the 12 months to the end of March 2005, some 78,150 passengers travelled between Edinburgh and Prague while 71,133 passengers travelled between Glasgow and Prague. There is a mix of point to point services provided by Flyglobespan, and there are network services provided by CSA Czech Airlines to its hub in Prague. The CSA Prague hub provides onward services to many of the new entrant EU States as well as other Eastern European States.</p>

  <p>Information about the volume of travellers between Scotland and the EU accession states, particularly those in Central and Eastern Europe, is very limited. The Executive is, therefore, part funding a detailed survey of the main Scottish airports which is being conducted by the Civil Aviation Authority during 2005. The survey will cover a wide range of issues including the origin of the traveller as well as the reason for travel, and the results will lead to a better understanding of the potential for the development of new routes.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, with reference to the letter of 16 May 2005 to me from the Minister for Communities which states inter alia &quot;You queried the applicability of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 to children in Dungavel. The Act does not apply to Dungavel Immigration Removal Centre as immigration is the responsibility of the Home Office&quot;, whether chapter 3 of the act and, in particular, section 52, relating to children requiring compulsory measures of supervision and referrals under the act to the Principal Reporter to the Children&rsquo;s Panel, do not apply to those children and, if so, when this interpretation was adopted.</p>

  <p>In his letter of 16 May the Minister for Communities said that the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 did not apply to Dungavel Immigration Removal Centre as immigration is the responsibility of the Home Office. The terms of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 do apply to the children of asylum seekers in Scotland, wherever they are located, except where disapplied by UK legislation.</p>

  <p>The Minister for Communities wrote to you again on the 6 June to clarify his original letter.</p>

  <p>The welfare of persons detained in Dungavel is a matter for the Home Office, and it is for them to respond to questions about the operation of the Immigration Removal Centre.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to providing modern high-quality education facilities to encourage people to take up the development opportunities offered by our lifelong learning agenda. This will provide a sound basis to stimulate economic growth and tackle problems associated with exclusion. I can report that I have approved substantial funding to assist in the relocation of the Borders College. An award of up to &pound;2,821,568 will be made from the European Regional Development Fund to assist in the provision of a modern facility in new build at, and the refurbishment of part of the Heriot-Watt University campus at Netherdale, Galashiels. The application also involves the creation of a new Community Learning Centre in Hawick which will replace the existing Henderson Building and include the Knitwear Design and Technical Centre.</p>

  <p>The network of Global Friends and its complementary website help to promote Scotland as an attractive place in which to live, work, study, visit, invest and do business. It is not the specific aim of the Global Friends of Scotland initiative to encourage immigration. The Fresh Talent initiative aims to attract bright, hard-working and motivated individuals to live, work and study in Scotland. Details of how the Fresh Talent initiative plans to evaluate its overall success are given in the answer to question S2W-16982 on 6 June 2005.

The complementary website, which acts as a dynamic showcase for the best that Scotland has to offer the world, is accessed by a largely international audience. At least 75% of the readership is based overseas. Visitors spend around 25 minutes on the site.</p>

  <p>I welcomed the vision outlined in the Kerr report in my statement to Parliament on 25 May. The Scottish Executive is currently considering the report in detail and has no plans to issue immediate advice or guidance. The Executive&rsquo;s response to the report will help to shape NHS boards&rsquo; strategies in the future and a detailed implementation plan will be presented to Parliament in due course. In the meantime, it is expected that all NHS boards will take account of the report&rsquo;s recommendations when planning services and implementing service change strategies.</p>

  <p><em>Building a Health Service Fit for the Future</em> is the product of the collective effort of over two hundred individuals who sat on Professor Kerr&rsquo;s national advisory group or one of the group&rsquo;s work-streams, as listed in Appendix 2 of the Kerr report. None of these individuals represented private sector organisations.</p>

  <p>Professor Kerr&rsquo;s group looked at a number of international healthcare providers for examples of best practice, this inevitably included both public and private healthcare providers. Various pieces of work were also commissioned from academics on issues such as the affordability of the report&rsquo;s vision, integration within health care systems, and the relationship between volumes of a particular procedure and outcomes.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has made no such estimate. The Executive is in discussion with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar about the council&rsquo;s planned recovery package following the January 2005 storm which relates to infrastructure repair costs and the costs of certain infrastructure improvements. The Executive is also expecting claims from Highland Council and Orkney Islands Council for emergency financial assistance under the terms of the Bellwin Scheme in connection with the storm. Even once concluded, however, these contacts would only enable a partial estimate of the overall cost of the storm damage to be made.</p>

  <p>Subject to on-going discussions between the Scottish Executive and Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, an initial announcement on the Executive&rsquo;s contribution to a recovery package is planned for later this summer. Highland Council and Orkney Islands Council are planning to submit claims for emergency financial assistance under the terms of the Bellwin Scheme and any decision on the extent of any funding contribution from the Executive would have to await consideration of those claims. We are aware of no other claims in connection with the January 2005 storm.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not have plans to develop a parkway station at Musselburgh and has not therefore explored possible passenger use and cost. The business case for any such proposals should be made in the first instance by local promoters rather than the Executive.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the estimated annual monetary value will be to First ScotRail of reduced discounts, which are given to season ticket holders as a result of failure by ScotRail to meet its punctuality targets, following the introduction of the planned two-minute addition to journey times of Fife to Edinburgh services.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-06-10.S2W-16500.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80115" speakername="Nicol Stephen" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa0610.htm#12">

  <p>Discounts to First ScotRail passengers in Fife, which are paid under the Passengers Charter, will only reduce when punctuality levels of 87% are reached across the relevant group of services.</p>

  <p>In order to achieve this saving, First ScotRail will need to bring about significant improvement over a number of months to the punctuality of the east service group of which Fife services form part and which also includes services to Bathgate, Dunblane, Newcraighall and North Berwick. It is highly unlikely that this level of improvement could be achieved solely by increasing Fife service journey times.</p>
