  <p>In April 2002, we introduced the Community Safety Partnership Award Programme which will provide local authority-led partnerships with &#163;12 million over the next three years for crime prevention and community safety initiatives. The partnerships can use their allocations to fund crime prevention and community safety priorities as specified in their community safety strategies and action plans. We do not prescribe what those priorities, which have been identified through a local audit process, should be. It is for local authorities to determine priorities, and allocate resources accordingly.

  <p>It is widely acknowledged that bees foraging on oil seed rape may disperse pollen beyond the trial site no matter what separation distances are in place. The Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment considers this issue as part of the environmental risk assessment, which is an integral part of the approval process.

  <p>There are no plans to introduce statutory provisions allowing claims for compensation for contamination specifically by a genetically modified organism.</p>

  <p>It is recognised that some GM crops produce pollen, very small quantities of which may be dispersed by operation of nature beyond the trial site. The consequences of this are considered carefully before consent for release is granted. On the basis of this assessment, the Executive is unaware of any safety or legal reasons why the GM crops which have been approved in Scotland should have an adverse effect on beekeepers or non-GM growers in the vicinity of trial sites.</p>

All courses and component parts of courses delivered at the college are subject to the same evaluation process which includes a reaction evaluation or workplace evaluation of a percentage of courses delivered by the college. Any deficiencies identified through that evaluation process are then dealt with in a way commensurate with the issues raised. This allows training to be tailored to workplace and operational requirements.</p>

  <p>At the end of each course, students are asked for their reactions as to the benefit, challenge and satisfaction that they perceived that they derived from the courses. Students are asked to rate each category in terms of how the course met their needs from zero <i>(</i>Not at All<i>)</i> to four <i>(</i>Completely<i>)</i>. The following table lists the three courses delivered by the college which include the investigation of rape and sexual assault, and shows the average results obtained, together with a mean value of how each course was rated in 2001-2002.</p>

  <p>Reducing unnecessary bureaucracy in the police service is clearly an important matter and we are always open to ways to reduce this. The Policing Bureaucracy Task Force, set up by the Home Office in 2001 to consider ways of increasing police officer visibility in England and Wales, collected information on the number of pro forma documents as part of its work.

  <p>Reducing unnecessary bureaucracy in the police service is clearly an important matter and we are always open to ways to reduce this. HM Inspectorate of Constabulary for Scotland (HMIC) has made clear the importance it attaches to ensuring that the Scottish Police Service achieves best value and primary inspections of Scottish forces now include a joint review of best value practices with Audit Scotland. HMIC is also due to publish the results of a thematic inspection into public reassurance and police visibility in Scotland in November 2002. The terms of reference for that thematic included the identification of good practice within forces with a view to improving service delivery.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>This will, like all other inputs, be a matter for the successful tenderers as they will be taking the risks of not delivering the outputs demanded in the contracts. We will look for evidence of good employment practices when considering tenders for the new private prison, and key elements of successful bids will be built into the resulting contracts.</p>

  <p>The Executive is in regular contact with the UK Government on a wide range of issues, including public appointments. Kay Hampton was appointed in April 2002 to the Commission for Racial Equality as having special knowledge of Scotland. Rowena Arshad was appointed as the Scottish Commissioner for Equal Opportunities Commission in 2001. In June 1999, Alan Dickson, an existing member of the National Disability Council was designated as the member with special knowledge of Scotland. The National Disability Council was abolished in April 2000 following the establishment of the Disability Rights Commission (DRC). The new position of DRC Commissioner with special knowledge of Scotland was filled for the first time in April 2000 by Elaine Noad. There are no Scottish positions on Research Councils.</p>

  <p>All applicants completed political activity declaration forms. The information provided plays no part in the selection process. Candidates agree that this information will be made publicly available if they are appointed and the information for the successful candidates in the 2002 appointments round for SHEFC is as follows:</p>

  <p><table border="BORDER" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="100%">

  <p>The News Release announcing these appointments indicated that there was no recorded political activity declared by any of the appointees, when in fact one candidate had declared political activity for the Labour Party. This was an administrative error in the compilation of the News Release, and those involved accept full responsibility. Steps have been taken to ensure such a mistake does not recur. I apologise for the release of this inaccurate information.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive website is undergoing a programme of continuous development under the direction of the web editorial board. This has resulted in a significant increase in activity on the website. The number of page impressions per month averaged 1 million in 2000, rising to 2.25 million in 2001 and to 2.91 million in the period from January to August 2002. The development programme is closely integrated with the work on building and maintaining the website. Given that the work falls to the same team, we do not separate the costs of development from the on-going costs. The Scottish Executive has spent &#163;580,000 on building, maintaining and developing its website since May 1999. This figure is broken down in the table.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers, prior to the establishment of the Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care (Care Commission) on 1 April 2002, published national care standards covering a wide range of care provision. The Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001 defines the services to be regulated by the Care Commission against the National Care Standards.</p>

  <p>While sheltered housing provision is not defined specifically within the act if they met the definition of, for example, a housing support service or alternatively a care home, the relevant national care standards would apply. It is for the Care Commission to make decisions on registration and other issues such as staffing levels based on the statement of function and purpose and other information provided by the services as part of the application process.</p>

  <p>An extensive study into Repeat Homelessness by Heriot Watt University for the task force estimated that some 27% of current homelessness applications are repeat applications, and that most of these are separated by relatively short time periods between applications. In most cases, the inter-application period is six months or less, and in only three per cent of cases is it more than three years.</p>

  <p>Social Justice Target 6 will focus effort on preventing repeat homelessness, an area where there is a clear need to improve homelessness performance and which also lends itself to a target-setting approach. New statistical information from the Homelessness Electronic Data System introduced in December 2001 will for the first time enable measurement of the extent of repeat homelessness.</p>

  <p>The Homelessness Monitoring Group, set up to oversee progress in the delivery of the task force recommendations, will play a key role in monitoring progress against this target. The monitoring group will also monitor wider performance on homelessness against other homelessness indicators recommended by the task force in areas where the task force considered it was not appropriate to set specific targets.</p>

  <p>Under the terms of the Model Contract for Special Advisers (Bib Number. 22440 in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre), Advisers are required in certain circumstances to obtain agreement before accepting an offer of employment outside the civil service which would start within two years of leaving Crown employment. It is the personal responsibility of all former special advisers to ensure that they comply with these requirements.</p>

  <p>Comprehensive records of contacts are not held centrally. However, I am aware of two contacts on official business since John McTernan left his post as a Special Adviser to the First Minister. The first of these was a meeting with an official for a general discussion on the work of the Scottish Council Foundation. The second was contact with the office of the Deputy Minister for Finance and Public Services to make necessary arrangements relating to the Deputy Minister&#8217;s participation in a seminar entitled &quot;Choice in Public Services&quot; aimed at NHS senior managers and practitioners in Scotland. Mr McTernan subsequently attended the seminar as did the Deputy Minister.</p>

  <p>Yes. As the Executive&#8217;s Transport Delivery Report, <i>Scotland&#8217;s Transport: Delivering Improvements</i> indicates, we will strive to stabilise road traffic at 2001 levels by 2021 by modernising and improving public transport, promoting alternative modes of transport to the private car, and making targeted motorway and trunk road improvements. The recent substantial increase in our transport budget, to more than &#163;1 billion by 2005-06, will provide the resources to allow us to take forward these priorities.</p>
