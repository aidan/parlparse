  <p>Biodiesel as a blended transport fuel with standard fossil and mineral diesel is already sold in outlets across the UK without the need for separate labelling or pumps. The biofuel component of blended fuels will increase to 5% as part of the Renewable Transport Fuels Obligation (RTFO) target by 2010. New vehicle engine warranties would be invalid if biofuel content greater than 5% were used. To provide further certainty to transport fuel suppliers and stimulate production, the Chancellor of the Exchequer extended the period of RTFO fuel duty incentive of 20p per litre on biodiesel and bioethanol production until 2009-10.</p>

  <p>We are developing plans to consult with key stakeholders to consider what reasonable steps can be taken to encourage wider use of higher blends of biofuels for all road vehicles. We continue to monitor UK and European discussions aimed at increasing the RTFO target beyond 2010.</p>

  <p>The Renewable Transport Fuels Obligation (RTFO) provides the key stimulus for obligated transport fuel suppliers to invest in biodiesel and bioethanol production to meet the 5% biofuel target by 2010. The Chancellor of the Exchequer extended the period of RTFO fuel duty incentive of 20p per litre on biodiesel and bioethanol production until 2009-10 to provide further certainty to transport fuel suppliers.</p>

  <p>In Scotland, INEOS Enterprises were granted &pound;9 million Regional Selective Assistance last year to develop biodiesel production at its Grangemouth site and aim to be in operation in 2008. This facility will be the largest in Europe and will meet 35% of the UK demand.</p>

  <p>Biodiesel as a blended transport fuel with standard fossil and mineral diesel is already sold in outlets across the UK, and without the need for separate labelling or pumps. We are developing plans to consult with key stakeholders to consider what reasonable steps can be taken to encourage wider use of higher blends of biofuels for all road vehicles as part of our manifesto commitments.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not set staffing targets. The relationship within the Scottish Government between the activities of the organisation and the number of staff employed in the delivery of particular objectives and functions is kept under continuous review. There is therefore no static view of the right number of staff either in total or in specific parts of the organisation.</p>

  <p>The number of staff in any public sector organisation should flow from the right financial decisions about the budget for that organisation and the right operational decisions about the functions and organisational structure of each organisation. We are pursuing efficiency in the costs of all parts of the public sector. We have also begun our programme of streamlining the structure and operations of the public sector, within the context of the government&rsquo;s commitment that there will be no compulsory redundancies. Within the Scottish Government, we have set an example by reducing the number of Cabinet Secretaries. There have been corresponding changes in the number of civil service posts at Director-General level.</p>

  <p>The following table sets out the number of permanent staff currently employed in the Scottish Government, broken down by Cabinet Secretary portfolio.</p>

  <p>Permanent Staff (Full-Time Equivalent) at 1 September 2007</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government also uses agency workers through its contracts with Pertemps (clerical and administrative staff) and Hays (interim managers). The numbers of agency workers in core Directorates at 1 August 2007 were 194 Pertemps staff and 35 Hays staff working in core Directorates. Changes in these numbers over time will be determined within the general principles set out above.</p>

  <p>Where any change has an impact on job roles the Scottish Government will meet its statutory and contractual requirements and will consult as required with the Council of Scottish Executive Unions and staff. Where there is no change in the job weight (grade) then there will be no impact on the individual&rsquo;s salary. Where job weight changes substantially, either upwards or downwards, the normal process would be to rematch the job to someone within the appropriate grade and to rematch the individual post holder to a job of the appropriate weight.</p>

  <p>Similarly, section 10 of the Water (Scotland) Act 1980 (as amended) sets out the arrangements for compensation for damage resulting from the exercise of Scottish Water&rsquo;s powers under this act.</p>

  <p>Both acts confirm that claims for compensation should be made to Scottish Water within 24 months after the date in which the alleged loss, injury or damage sustained has occurred. In the case of dispute about the facts or as to the amount of compensation, provision is also available for arbitration.</p>

  <p>Project Scotland is a company limited by guarantee and registered as a charity whose aims and objectives are to promote the welfare and relieve the needs of the population in Scotland by encouraging and assisting young people to provide their skills and services voluntarily to charitable organisations. Full information about the work of Project Scotland is available from its Chief Executive at 49 Melville Street, Edinburgh, EH3 7HL.</p>

  <p>The Chief Executive advises that: &quot;From the inception of Project Scotland to the end of the latest tax year (2006-07) we placed 1,292 volunteers which, dividing total expense by the number of volunteers, shows an average cost of &pound;8,934 per volunteering opportunity of 30 hours per week for six months. Having put the necessary infrastructure in place, the cost of an average volunteering opportunity in the current tax year is forecast at &pound;4,995&quot;.</p>
