  <p>The UK Health and Social Care Bill proposes to include the provision of certain care home services purchased by a local authority from an independent care home provider within the definition of a function of a public nature for the purposes of the Human Rights Act 1998.

  <p>The revised Code of Practice on Part 5 of the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000, published on 11 March 2008, notes that the use of covert medication is permissible only in certain limited circumstances, for example to safeguard the health of an adult who is unable to consent to the treatment in question and where other alternatives have been explored and none are practicable. The revised code of practice can be accessed at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.sehd.scot.nhs.uk/mels/CEL2008_11.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.sehd.scot.nhs.uk/mels/CEL2008_11.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p>The code of practice refers practitioners considering the use of covert medication to guidance documents prepared by the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland (MWC): <em>Consent to Treatment</em> (2006) and <em>Covert Medication &ndash; a Legal and Practice Guide </em>(2006). Both documents are available on the MWC&rsquo;s website at <a href="http://www.mwcscot.org.uk/GoodPractice/GoodPracticeintro.asp" target="_blank">http://www.mwcscot.org.uk/GoodPractice/GoodPracticeintro.asp</a>.</p>

  <p>The European Convention on Human Rights was incorporated into domestic law by the Human Rights Act 1998. It is open to an individual who believes that his or her rights under the convention have been breached by a public authority to bring an action against that authority in the Scottish courts.</p>

  <p>The Care Commission and the MWC are working together to examine the issue of chemical restraint and consent in the administration of medicines in care homes for older people, including a series of focused inspections of care homes to be undertaken later this year. We will consider the findings when the organisations report.</p>

  <p>On 7 June, we ran a national conference for parents and Parent Councils which attracted around 150 delegates from all over Scotland. The Cabinet Secretary addressed the conference and made clear that it is not for government to take snap decisions and impose our view of a national body on parents before they are ready to decide what they want. What she did promise was to reflect on what conference delegates had said and suggest, in a post conference report that would be sent to all Parent Councils, how best the government could offer support in helping to establish a national body for parents.</p>

  <p>That would depend on how we define deprived areas, but for example if we consider schools where 40% or more of pupils are registered for free school meals, Glasgow has 84 such schools, of which 32 have P1 to P3 classes over 25.</p>

  <p>The review of asset management across the public sector encompasses several distinct pieces of work:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government asset management review, which looked at the Scottish Government own built estate, was carried out last year, reported to me in January 2008 and was published on 30 January 2008. It is available at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/01/AMR" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/01/AMR</a>.</p>

  <p>A review of asset management by local authorities also carried out by the Improvement Service for Local Government in 2007, and their report entitled <em>Property Asset Management in Scotland&rsquo;s Councils</em> was published on 19 March 2008 and is available on their website.</p>

  <p>The Improvement Service for Local Government has also carried out a separate study of the management of common goods assets and funds. Their report is currently being finalised and due to be published imminently.</p>

  <p>Information on the amount of money collected by each commission area district court and forwarded to HM Treasury is provided to the Scottish Government by the individual local authorities in each commission area. They do not detail the specific criteria they have used in making these returns, however the basis on which money could be retained or forwarded in 2006-07 and previous years was as follows:</p>

  <p>Local authorities were allowed to retain all income from fiscal fines and from fines imposed upon conviction for common law offences. They also retained a set proportion of income received for fixed penalty notices for certain road traffic offences. This proportion was set at 10%, but increased to 33% in the case of penalties for stationary vehicles where the fine became registered. Money received from fines imposed upon conviction for statutory offences was forwarded to HM Treasury, as was the balance of fixed penalty notice payments for road traffic offences.</p>

  <p>The answer requires interpretation of legislation which ultimately is a matter for the courts. However, the drafting intention was for the commercial or public areas of premises which are used for both domestic and non-domestic purposes to fall within the scope of &quot;relevant premises&quot; under the Fire (Scotland) Act 2005 and the Fire Safety (Scotland) Regulations 2006. Private areas are regarded as domestic premises and are therefore largely exempt.</p>

  <p>The grant allocation at the beginning of each financial year is a single figure which includes provision for all relevant elements of the Affordable Housing Investment Programme (AHIP).

  <p>Travel is always made with a view to supporting the efficient conduct of government business. Wherever practicable cabinet secretaries and ministers use public transport and walk to their engagements. 8,243 car journeys were taken by Scottish ministers and law officers between the period 16 May 2007 to 31 March 2008, this compares with a total of 8,931 car journeys during the comparable period in the previous year. This is a reduction of 7.7% over the period.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s response to the Crerar Review was published in January 2008. The response deals with each of the 42 review recommendations and makes clear that 30 have been accepted in full for implementation. The response identifies a further five recommendations which have been accepted in principle, pending consideration of the practicalities in more detail. The remaining seven recommendations required further work before a view could be reached on acceptance and implementation by government.</p>

  <p>On dates, some recommendations have already been implemented, while others require legislation, or rely on detailed work being undertaken with delivery partners and so will take longer to achieve. This government is determined to make progress as quickly as possible, but has listened to the advice given in Parliament on the need for caution and consideration on changes which could impact on vulnerable service users.</p>

  <p>The planned efficiency savings of &pound;2.156 million in 2008-09, &pound;4.265 million in 2009-10 and &pound;6.327 million in 2010-11 have already been factored and redistributed into the relevant budgets as part of last year&rsquo;s spending review. These efficiencies have contributed to new investments set out in the Scottish budget for student support including: additional support for part-time students; abolishing the graduate endowment fee; and &pound;30 million to aid the transition from loans to grants in 2010-11.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what specific arrangements are in place for local authorities to maintain teacher numbers in the face of falling school rolls, as set out in the concordat with local government.</p>

  <p>Local government will receive a record funding settlement of &pound;34.9 billion over the spending review period, halting the recent decline in local government&rsquo;s share of the Scottish budget. Under the terms of the concordat local government is able to retain efficiency savings in order to meet local priorities and the substantial reduction in ring fencing allows local government more control over how it uses its resources. Sufficient funding has been provided for authorities to maintain teacher numbers.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has increased the number of teachers being trained in Universities which now have the capacity and resources to train enough new teachers to replace all of those who retire.</p>

  <p>Demographic changes and the reduction in class sizes in P1 to P3 will require accommodation alterations in some schools and the substantial increase in the capital funding available to local authorities together with the increased flexibility of its deployment should allow authorities to prioritise such investment.</p>

  <p>We expect to publish or support publication of a number of reports which relate specifically to the third sector during 2008. These include:</p>

  <p><em>Enterprising Third Sector Action Plan</em>, published 18 June 2008;</p>

  <p><em>Health Case Studies</em>, published by Senscot, April 2008;</p>

  <p><em>Social Enterprise Business Models: An Introduction to Replication and Franchising</em>, to be published by CEiS, Summer 2008;</p>

  <p><em>Evaluation of the Futurebuilders Scotland Funding Programme - Social Research</em>, Summer 2008;</p>

  <p><em>Business Development Needs of Social Enterprises in Lowland Scotland</em>, to be published by Rocket Science, Summer 2008, and</p>

  <p><em>Social Enterprise Activity in Key Market Areas in Scotland</em>, to be published by Rocket Science, Summer 2008.</p>

  <p>However, third sector activity contributes to government priorities across portfolio responsibilities and directorates. This means that the sector&rsquo;s roles and contributions will be considered in numerous reports during the year.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not hold accurate data on total food waste arisings in Scotland in each of the last five years. However, the amount of household food waste generated in Scotland is estimated by Waste Aware Scotland&rsquo;s &quot;Love Food, Hate Waste Campaign&quot; to be 587,000 tonnes per year. In addition to that figure, data is collected by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) about commercial and industrial (C&amp;I) food waste.</p>

  <p>Waste Data Digest 7 indicates that the food and drink sector produced 430,000 tonnes of waste in 2005. SEPA is working to improve the quality of C&amp;I waste data.</p>

  <p>With the recent opening of the retail market to competition, billing of non-household customers is entirely an operational matter for retail services providers in this case Scottish Water&rsquo;s retail subsidiary, Business Stream.</p>

  <p>We understand, however, that nil rated bills are issued to customers who are exempt from paying for their water services. This is to maintain contact with these customers, encouraging them to advise the retail services provider should their circumstances, and therefore their eligibility for the scheme, change. We also understand that costs associated with billing these customers are minimal.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government commissions research on a range of issues across our policy areas. A key strategy for developing our research programmes is the environment biology and agriculture research strategy 2005-10. The work programme on environment - land use and rural stewardship has a number of work packages, two of which are dedicated to research on Scottish soils. The link attached provides further details of the programme.</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Research/15597/23153" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Research/15597/23153</a>.</p>

  <p>One area of research focuses on the management of soils to enhance function and value. Research outputs will include the prediction of land-use change upon soils, the consequences for soil functions and provision of recommendations on the protection of soil biodiversity. The second area of research focuses on establishing risk-based methodologies to assess soil quality and includes the development of indicators of soil health and function, as well as the development of methods for soil monitoring. Both these areas of research are being undertaken by the Macaulay Land Use Research Institute.</p>

  <p>Additionally the Scottish Government has commissioned a project to calculate the carbon savings from wind farms on Scottish organic soils, particularly peatlands, the contractor is the University of Aberdeen.</p>

  <p>Currently there is no further research planned on soils in relation to vibration impacts.</p>
