  <p>We are currently implementing the environmental noise action plans produced under the Environmental Noise (Scotland) Regulations 2006. These regulations implement EU Directive 2002/49EC relating to the assessment and management of environmental noise. We in Scotland were one of the first administrations in Europe to submit action plans produced under the terms of this directive. Further details can be found at <a href="http://www.scottishnoisemapping.org/" target="_blank">http://www.scottishnoisemapping.org/</a> .</p>

  <p>A variety of measures is available to local authorities to monitor and control noise, including measures introduced in 2005 to tackle anti-social noise. These go beyond any scheme in EC in providing a fixed penalty notice deterrent for domestic noise offences and set objectively measured noise limits for any part of the day or night.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s view is that the noise impact of airport operations in Scotland is best dealt with locally and it is for the airport to provide adequate facilities for consultation and discussion with users of the airport, local authorities and local representative organisations. Both Edinburgh and Glasgow airports are designated under section 35 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982 and consultative committees, independent of the airports&rsquo; operator, are established at both for this purpose.</p>

  <p>BAA as operator, is the competent authority for producing a noise action plan under the Environmental Noise (Scotland) Regulations 2006. Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Aberdeen airports have published noise action plans in December 2008 which are available on their websites. Further details on noise from the major Scottish airports can be found at <a href="http://www.scottishnoisemapping.org/" target="_blank">http://www.scottishnoisemapping.org/</a>.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally by the Scottish Government. Sportscotland maintains a range of information relating to sports facilities including swimming pools and I would encourage the member to contact sportscotland direct to establish whether the specific information is readily available.</p>

Any issues arising from the Stage 1 application are a matter for the applicant, Aberdeen City Council, and the funding body, sportscotland.</p>
