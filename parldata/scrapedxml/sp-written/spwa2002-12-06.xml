  <p>The taxi accessibility provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 will, when implemented, greatly improve the accessibility of taxis for people with disabilities. Responsibility for implementing these provisions is reserved to the Westminster Parliament. In the meantime, we have written to local authorities, offering informal advice as to the steps they can take to improve the accessibility of taxis in their area within the framework of the existing legislation. There are no general grants available to increase the number of taxis accessible to people with disabilities. However, if a case is put to us by the taxi trade for the introduction of such grants we will consider its merits.</p>

  <p>The pay band structure consists of three bands, but provided for a fourth to be used if departments perceived a need. The Scottish Executive decided to use all four bands as a way of providing more flexibility.</p>

  <p>The non-consolidated bonus pot was predetermined for all departments, although there was some flexibility on how it would be distributed. The Scottish Executive decided to award &#163;3,000 or 3% of salary, whichever was the higher, to top-tranche performers and &#163;2,000 or 3% of salary, whichever was the higher, to around 33% of the middle-tranche performers.</p>

  <p>Since the tragic events of 11 September 2001, the Scottish Executive has been working with UK Government and relevant national and local bodies to strengthen plans against any deliberate release of biological agents, including smallpox.</p>

  <p>We have no evidence of a specific threat of a smallpox attack on Scotland, or any other part of the UK. However, it is sensible and prudent to ensure that NHSScotland can deal effectively with any potential threat.</p>

  <p>There are three components to the Executive&#146;s preparation for response to a possible smallpox emergency: improved vaccine stocks, a plan of action and a cohort of immunised staff who could deal safely with any potential smallpox cases.</p>

  <p>Working with the UK Government, we have already taken action to substantially increase stocks of smallpox vaccine.</p>

  <p>The Executive is today publishing an interim plan of action for discussion and comment over the coming month. Under this plan, it is intended to establish Smallpox Response Groups on a regional basis around Scotland. They will consist typically of an infectious diseases physician, a paediatrician, a public health physician, an acute care nurse and an infection control nurse.</p>

  <p>This core group of perhaps 50 NHS staff in Scotland will need to be immune from smallpox and therefore able to react quickly and work safely with patients with actual or suspected smallpox. Preparations for the vaccination of these key workers are now under way. This will be on an entirely voluntary basis with informed consent. As such, while we are determined to implement these arrangements as quickly as possible, the precise numbers of health care workers to be vaccinated, and the timetable for vaccination, depend significantly upon the comments we expect following publication of the interim plan.</p>

  <p>The plan also explains how smallpox cases would be handled in various scenarios. The Executive&#146;s primary strategy would be to contain and "ring vaccinate" around any outbreak. The teams of vaccinated health care staff are central to delivering this strategy.</p>

  <p>These plans are a practical precaution designed to ensure that Scotland is prepared for any possible smallpox emergency. They are in line with World Health Organisation advice and will be kept under active review.</p>

  <p>The term industrial fishery encompasses a wide range of fisheries destined for purposes other than human consumption. The most important industrial fishery to Scotland is the blue whiting fishery. Thirteen Scottish registered vessels landed significant tonnages of blue whiting into Scotland in 2001. Three Scottish registered vessels landed sandeels into Scotland in 2001. There were no significant landings of Norway pout.</p>

  <p>In anticipation of that, and the relevance of the associated data, UKRep had previously written to the Commission about associated details on 2 August 2002.

  <p>I had previously announced to Parliament in May that the second round of the Modernising Government Fund had up to &#163;30 million at its disposal. The challenge was for public sector bodies to use this fund to work together and form partnerships that would deliver Scotland-wide solutions to modernise our public services.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to announce today that the public sector across all of Scotland has reacted positively to this challenge, bringing forward proposals costing some &#163;39.5 million. These proposals are cross-cutting and will support key policy objectives at both the national level and the local level. For that reason I have been able to look across the Executive and bring in &#163;9.5 million of additional funding, underpinning the Executive's commitment to joined-up working and joined-up services.</p>

  <p>The key outcome is a co-ordinated approach to service delivery including:</p>

  <p>joint working between the Health Department and local authorities for the secure sharing of health and social work information, helping to deliver a single shared assessment process for elderly and children's services and reducing the need for multiple interventions;</p>

  <p>a 32 council partnership to develop youth services and a young persons smartcard and employing young people themselves in delivering services in a way that is meaningful to young people;</p>

  <p>a partnership of 21 councils will be working together to improve how they deliver services, to speed up customer transactions and to deliver better - measurable - outcomes for customers;</p>

  <p>a further 11 councils will lead the way in developing a Scotland-wide electronic citizen's card to improve access to education and transport services, and</p>

  <p>a local authority-led public sector partnership to deliver a standardised land and property database, reducing multiple records and helping to improve land and property management across Scotland.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Kilmarnock Prison Services Limited advised the SPS in November 1999 that the possibility of financial restructuring/refinancing was being considered. Details of the outcome for the Home Office are shown in Figure 8 of the National Audit Office (NAO) report <i>PFI Refinancing Update</i> published on 7 November 2002.</p>

  <p>Similar arrangements were put in place in respect of HM Prison Kilmarnock. This matter was discussed with the Managing Director of KPSL at the Justice 1 Committee meeting on 30 October 2001.</p>

  <p>The NAO report is available on the NAO website at:</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how the &#163;4 billion additional spending on public services up to 2005-06 as a result of the UK spending review has been, or will be, allocated and how much has been, or will be, allocated to the Renfrewshire Council area.</p>

  <p>Every area of Scotland will benefit for our plans for investing in Scotland over the next three years, as our budget rises to over &#163;25 billion by 2005-06. As I have made clear, this investment will be matched by delivery on our priority targets - bringing better schools, more effective transport services, better health, lower crime and continued growth in opportunities for all. All of Scotland will benefit from the better public services that we will deliver.</p>

  <p>The resources committed to individual areas will depend on a wide range of detailed programme allocations, some of which have yet to be made. For example, the local government revenue and capital allocations for East Renfrewshire Council for the next three years were announced on 4 December. More details of the Executive&#146;s other spending plans for the period up to 2005-06 were published in <i>Building a Better Scotland: Spending Proposals 2003-06</i> on 12 September, and in <i>The Scottish Executive: Draft Budget 2003-04: Detail</i> on 31 October. And further details on individual programme allocations will be made in due course.</p>
