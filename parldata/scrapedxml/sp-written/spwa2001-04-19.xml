  <p>The role of the Defence Diversification Agency (DDA) is not to reduce the dependence of certain companies on defence, but, inter alia, to facilitate the transfer of technology into and out of the defence sector in order to help ensure UK industry remains competitive in the changing global market place. In so doing in Scotland, the DDA works closely with Scottish Enterprise, in accordance with the regional development strategies of the Scottish Executive. The information requested cannot be made public, as to do so might harm the competitive position of the companies involved.</p>

  <p>Students in higher education receive help with child care costs, regardless of their age. Support from the Dependants&#8217; Grant and Lone Parent&#8217; Grant is available to eligible students in addition to any bursary or loan entitlement. From 2001-02, students who receive a Dependants&#8217; Grant for a child at school between the ages of three and 16 will also receive the new School Meals Grant. This will ease the transition from benefits to full-time study and will help all student parents on low incomes.</p>

  <p>From autumn 2000 funding of &#163;3 million per annum has been made available to FE colleges to assist all FE students, regardless of age, faced with study-related childcare costs. A priority for these funds has been part-time students, particularly those from socially and economically disadvantaged backgrounds. However, this has not meant the exclusion of resources for needy full-time students.</p>

  <p>Additionally, bursaries provided by FE colleges to students can include a dependants allowance which is given to students who have a legal or financial responsibility for a dependant partner, adult or child.</p>

  <p>Developing corporate governance arrangements should be seen as an evolutionary process, both as councils develop their performance management systems under Best Value and policy development and decision-making structures following the McIntosh Report. The Leadership Advisory Panel has been working with councils as they have undertaken self-reviews of those structures. The key areas which have formed the basis of councils&#8217; reviews and the work of the panel have been openness, accountability and transparency. We look forward to seeing the panel&#8217;s report.</p>

  <p>2. Excludes home births and births at non-NHS hospitals.</p>

  <p>The latest take-up data provided by the New Opportunities Fund (NOF) confirmed that 11,927 teachers and school librarians had signed up for the programme in Scotland at 31 December 2000. Figures from NOF are based on returns made by approved training providers. Data for the next period are due in mid-May 2001.</p>

  <p>The 27 evaluation questionnaire responses in Scotland represent too small a statistical sample from which to draw any firm and accurate conclusions about the training. The NOF is currently looking at options for encouraging greater take-up of the evaluation questionnaire.</p>

  <p>In addition, HM Inspectorate of Education is currently conducting a Scottish electronic survey of trainees&#8217; views on the quality of the training as part of its remit to provide quality assurance of the programme in Scotland, and a UK-wide Aspect Report will be produced within a few months.</p>

  <p>The figures quoted by the Deputy Minister on 4 April were supplied by the water authorities. They are based on reliefs actually granted to the relevant customer group. Though no assessment of the economic impact of the proposals has been made, the withdrawal of reliefs is being phased over five years to give the affected organisations time to adjust.</p>
