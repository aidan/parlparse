  <p>Our guidance indicates that meals on wheels services are not included in free personal care.

  <p>The guidance in question was issued by COSLA, not the Scottish Executive. It sets a framework of minimum standards for the protection of clients&rsquo; resources by local authorities. Service users are not adversely affected by the guidance as local authorities retain the discretion to set charging policies which are more generous than those minimum standards. The guidance includes advice to local authorities on helping clients to claim the benefits they are entitled to.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive and COSLA jointly reviewed the implementation of the guidance by surveying local authorities in 2004. Following discussions between Executive and COSLA officials about the content of the guidance and its implementation by local authorities, COSLA is currently deciding how to change its guidance in response to the review.</p>

  <p>It is anticipated that the third tranche of dentists from abroad will be taken up by NHS boards covering remote and rural areas. The Executive have asked all NHS boards to identify their needs. As yet, there has been no request made to the Executive from NHS Dumfries and Galloway to employ dentists from Poland.</p>

  <p>I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that specific monitoring in Scotland due to the Chernobyl incident is limited to sheep on a few remaining restricted farms. These farms are subject to statutory controls under the terms of the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985, which require sheep to be monitored prior to being moved off farm. Additionally, an annual whole flock survey is carried out during the summer on selected farms to assess whether they are suitable for derestriction. The results of this year&rsquo;s survey are currently being prepared by Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department who undertake the monitoring on behalf of the Food Standards Agency Scotland. Radiological monitoring of food and the environment throughout the UK, including a section on Chernobyl, is reported annually in the <em>Radioactivity in Food and the Environment</em> (RIFE) series of reports, the latest of which (&quot;RIFE 10&quot;) is due for publication at the end of October 2005.</p>

  <p>I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that immediately following the Chernobyl incident, agricultural produce, other foodstuffs and water supplies were monitored so that action could be taken as necessary. In Scotland during 1987, raised levels of radioactive caesium were found in sheep in south-west and central Scotland. These farms had restrictions on sheep movements imposed. Sheep from these farms must be monitored for radioactivity prior to being moved off farm. Additionally, annual surveys of whole flocks are carried out on selected farms to assess whether they are suitable for derestriction.</p>

  <p>I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that following the Chernobyl incident, agricultural produce, other foodstuffs and water supplies were monitored so that action could be taken as necessary. In Scotland, initial restrictions on sheep movements affecting 2900 farms were put into force on 24 June 1986 and subsequently lifted. Restrictions were re-introduced in 1987 on 73 farms in south-west and central Scotland when monitoring indicated raised levels of radioactive caesium. Subsequent annual monitoring, as detailed in the table below has reduced the number of remaining restricted farms in Scotland to 11.</p>

  <p>Property obtained through unlawful conduct can, without the need initially to secure a criminal conviction, be recovered by the Scottish ministers through their powers of civil recovery under part 5 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. Civil recovery does not proceed on the basis of a person having been convicted for a particular offence and it is not necessary for the Civil Recovery Unit to specify the particular unlawful conduct which gave rise to the acquisition of an asset.</p>

  <p>I can, however, confirm that since part 5 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 came into force, &pound;988,581.99 has been realised through the powers of civil recovery. A further &pound;1,800,854.61 has been forfeited to the Scottish ministers through the cash seizure powers contained in the act.</p>

  <p>The position is unaltered from the answer to question S2W-17214 on 20 June 2005. This data is not currently available, however the Improving Mental Health Information Programme is working with the NHS boards to standardise the information. Data sets are now being tested with outcomes expected by 2007.</p>

  <p>There has been a range of recent National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance relative to cognitive behavioural therapy and NHS Quality Improvement Scotland will continue to comment on and commend relevant aspects for NHSScotland as appropriate. Scottish Executive guidance has issued to help agencies in Scotland further develop and improve local access to a range of psychological interventions, including CBT.</p>

  <p>Access to services has been improved through the Doing Well by People with Depression Project; which already includes new cognitive behavioural therapy supported self-help and therapies at 10 sites across Scotland. Work is also underway with NHS Education Scotland to increase access to clinical psychology training places and to support the new psychology graduate training course which focuses on CBT and other therapies for adults in primary care settings.</p>

  <p>Yes. Since the act came into effect on 1 January this year, the SPCB has been constantly monitoring its effect on members, staff and parliamentary resources. Our aim, since the creation of the Parliament in 1999, has been to live up to our principles of openness and transparency and the act was passed by the Parliament in that spirit.</p>

  <p>Based on our experience of implementing the act to date, the SPCB is of the view that the current administration of the allowances scheme does not fit easily with the new freedom of information regime. We are &ndash; rightly in a democratic society &ndash; under intense scrutiny from the media and the SPCB is concerned that there is potential for the Parliament to suffer damage unless we act to alter the way in which we administer the scheme.</p>

  <p>We have therefore decided to move to fuller disclosure of allowances information. It is our view that the Scottish Parliament is already ahead of the field in relation to the amount of information that is published in this regard but we have decided to go further.</p>

  <p>A detailed breakdown of claims for the last financial year (2004-05) will be published in December. We will then move to a position where we publish information, with supporting vouchers and receipts, for 2005-06 onwards as soon as possible in 2006.</p>

  <p>Clearly, there are difficult issues around personal security, bank account details and third parties which need to be addressed. Allowances staff also need to address the issue of how information is to be gathered from members in order to ensure disclosure along the lines described above. We will therefore set up a joint MSP/parliamentary staff working group to consider and report on these issues, including an analysis of best practice worldwide.</p>

  <p>We will keep members informed of developments on a regular basis and I am writing today to all members to set this out more fully.</p>
