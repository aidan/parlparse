  <p>The Scottish Executive funds the air services between Glasgow and Barra, Glasgow and Campbeltown and Glasgow and Tiree. In addition, our subsidy to Highlands and Islands Airports Limited, which was some &#163;15.1 million in 2000-01 or &#163;55.77 per arriving passenger at HIAL&#8217;s airports, results in lower costs to airlines than if the full economic costs of providing airport infrastructure services were applied.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive meets airlines on a regular basis to discuss a range of aviation matters. The issue of air services between Inverness and Gatwick is amongst those we have discussed with British Airways who recently acquired the British Regional Airlines Group. Regional air services are also among the issues we regularly discuss with the relevant UK and EC authorities.</p>

  <p>With the lifting of the small remaining infected area around Annan, the whole of Scotland now qualifies to be treated as foot-and-mouth disease free. This means that the movement and other controls which apply to our livestock sector are much less prohibitive than previously, allowing transactions by various means. Large numbers of livestock are now being moved as a result of private sales, video sales, sales by description and through collection centres and auction markets. In addition, the Livestock Welfare Disposal Scheme &#8211; Light Lambs should absorb large numbers of light and surplus lambs. In these circumstances I do not envisage the need to provide assistance for the purchase of additional fodder.</p>

  <p>My officials have met with industry representatives and the department is looking at detailed options along with the Deer Commission for Scotland to support carcase disposal should that prove necessary. The Executive has already approved funding for a wild venison marketing initiative within the UK through the Marketing Development Scheme and will consider further applications should the industry wish to do so.</p>

  <p>It is planned that the exhibition in Fochabers will coincide with publication of the draft road orders for the Fochabers and Mosstodloch bypass in October.</p>

  <p>The cancellation of the exhibition accommodation that had been booked provisionally for September was to allow further work to be undertaken on the environmental statement that is required to be published at the same time as the road orders.</p>

  <p>Parents of disabled children can obtain advice in relation to the choice of a school primarily from their education authority. Parents and children can also obtain independent advice from the Enquire helpline, from the Disability Rights Commission, from the organisation Enable or from any other voluntary sector organisation or parents&#8217; group specialising in children with special educational needs. Education authorities should offer parents details of any such relevant sources of advice and support.</p>
