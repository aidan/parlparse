  <p>The allocation of public funds to RSPB by Scottish Natural Heritage is made on exactly the same criteria as for any other applicant. Applications for funding are subject to a detailed assessment process, the key criterion of which is that the project for which funds are being sought should contribute to SNH&#8217;s policy objectives and priorities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive gives a grant to RSPB for work connected with the prevention and detection of wildlife crime in addition to several small payments amounting to some &pound;2,620. These small payments are contributions towards work undertaken by the RSPB at the behest of the Executive or one of its working groups established to consider specific policy issues such as the Scottish Biodiversity Group. The main criterion used for any payments made to the RSPB is if the work undertaken is consistent with the policies of the Executive or the relevant working group.</p>

  <p>With regard to the allocation of funds from the National Heritage Lottery Fund, this is a matter for them.</p>

  <p>Figures for police raids are not collected centrally. Neither is it possible to determine the number of occasions on which a member of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds may have been present during a raid.</p>

  <p>Figures for the number of prosecutions and convictions for offences against birds under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 are given below. All wild birds enjoy protection under the Act, although there are special penalties for certain types of offence and for offences against certain species.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what responses it has received to the consultation paper regarding proposals to extend the opening hours of casinos in Scotland.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-03-31.5.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80252" speakername="Mr Jim Wallace" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa0331.htm#5789">

  <p>We published this consultation paper on 10 November 1999 and the consultation period ended on 31 January 2000. The Executive received 15 responses.</p>

  <p>Of the responses three were against the proposal, three were in favour and the remainder were neutral. Objections to the proposal centred around concerns about public order, the adverse affect on those with gambling problems and the impact of longer hours on casino staff within the casino industry. There were also concerns that there is little demand for increasing opening hours.</p>

  <p>In opposing the change, the General Municipal and Boilermakers Trades Union (GMB) Scotland drew attention to the lack of consultation with casino staff about the proposed changes and to the lack of recognition of trades unions for collective bargaining over such issues as staff terms and conditions of service in the casino industry. GamCare (the National Association for Gambling Care) believe that the change is unlikely to increase the incidence of problem gambling nor significantly exacerbate the problems of those already affected by a gambling dependency. The Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland sees no reason to object to the change in hours.</p>

  <p>Having considered these responses, the Executive has decided that the relatively modest changes to casino opening hours proposed should be made so that casinos have more flexibility to meet consumer demand.</p>

  <p>We do not think that an extension from 4am to 6am is likely to have an impact on public order. Under the current legislation licensing authorities can impose restrictions on the hours casinos open if they think it is necessary to prevent disturbance to the residents of premises in the vicinity. That will remain the case.</p>

  <p>The Executive has taken account of concerns about the impact of additional operating hours on casino staff. However, the legislation on casino opening hours provides a public interest framework for gambling. It is not designed to regulate normal employer/employee relations. That is the role of the Employment Relations Act.</p>

  <p>While we originally proposed to implement the change by spring 2000, we have now decided in the light of the representations made to us by GMB Scotland that the longer hours should not be available until the end of July. That should enable the concerns of casino staff and the Unions representing them to be pursued through the provisions of the new Employment Relations Act.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no such plans. However, the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations published Guidance Booklet 10 <i>Good Practice in dealing with Domestic Abuse</i> on 10 March 1999 and this Guidance Booklet was drawn up with the assistance of Scottish Women's Aid. While not statutory, it is part of the compliance test applied to all housing associations registered with or wishing to become registered with Scottish Homes. Additionally, the Scottish Partnership on Domestic Abuse will issue Good Practice Guidelines and Service Standards for all Agencies concerned with domestic abuse.</p>

The Scottish Executive maintains regular contact with Her Majesty&#8217;s Government on a wide range of issues including matters relating to maritime safety and the protection of the marine environment.

  <p>The Regulations which transpose EC Directive 96/59/EC on the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls and polychlorinated terphenyls into Scots law have been laid before Parliament and will come into force on 8 May 2000.</p>

  <p>Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are stable organic chemicals, used widely as fluids in electrical equipment such as transformers and capacitors, which pose a threat to the environment through their toxicity, persistence and their tendency to bioaccumulate. The Regulations will have the effect of curtailing discharges of PCBs, and so lowering their concentration in the environment, including in relation to sea mammals in which PCBs have been found in significant quantities.</p>

  <p>PCB contaminated equipment of more than five litres capacity must be registered with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) by 31 July 2000 so that an inventory of this information may be produced. SEPA also have powers connected with charging, monitoring and enforcement.</p>

  <p>A person who does not register contaminated equipment with SEPA by 31 July 2000 or who does not safely dispose of contaminated equipment by 31 December 2000, is guilty of an offence and liable to a fine and/or imprisonment.</p>

  <p>Certain exceptions exist within the Regulations. For example, decontaminated transformers (which may be used to the end of their useful lives), businesses concerned with safe disposal/decontamination of PCBs, and research into PCBs.</p>

  <p>The capital resources available for investment in the NHS in Scotland, against actual capital expenditure, during the period 1997-98, 1998-99 and 1999-2000 totalled &pound;136 million, &pound;136 million and &pound;156 million respectively.</p>

  <p>In addition, a total of &pound;41.5 million will be spent over the next three years on Health Service modernisation initiatives.</p>

  <p>The variance between the capital provision and actual expenditure in any one year can be attributed to either the slippage of capital shemes where the planned expenditure in one year falls to be met in the following year or the transfer of capital resources to NHS Trusts revenue allocations to enable minor works to be carried out that do not add capital value to the NHS estate.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The table does not show the median wait where fewer than three patients in a health board area had a triple by-pass operation during 1999. This applies to Orkney (Nil), Shetland (two patients) and Western Isles (one patient).</p>

  <p>2. Triple by-pass operations are defined as OPCS4 K40.3, K41.3, K42.3, K43.3 or K44 as main procedures (K44 will include operations other than triple by-pass operations, but many triple by-pass operations may have been coded thus due to lack of detail in case notes).</p>

  <p>3. Relates only to NHS patients routinely admitted from the waiting list. Admissions via transfer are excluded.</p>

  <p>I am advised by North Glasgow University Hospitals NHS Trust that a rise in demand for specific specialist services has resulted in an increase in waiting times.</p>

  <p>To address this, a major strategic review of dental services is currently being undertaken by the Trust to explore a number of related issues including staffing. A report on the review's findings and recommendations will then be considered by the Greater Glasgow Health Board and the Trust.</p>

  <p>In the year ending 31 March 1999, the percentage of patients waiting more than 18 weeks for a first outpatient appointment increased in Scotland in 11 of the 15 health boards. This performance has to be set against an increase in the total number of outpatient appointments of over 32,000 (2.4%) in that year.</p>

  <p>It is the total waiting time which is of most importance to patients, and that is why we are working with the NHS in Scotland to establish national maximum waiting times, to be delivered from 31 March 2001, in the clinical priorities of heart disease, cancer and mental health. In addition, the establishment of additional one-stop clinics, the introduction of walk-in/walk-out hospitals and the redesign of services to improve the patient pathway will speed treatment and reduce waiting times.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has provided &pound;292,000 to Lanarkshire Health Board for orthopaedic services under the waiting lists initiative. This has enabled Lanarkshire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust to appoint an additional consultant and support staff. In the last full year, 64% of orthopaedic outpatients were seen within three months. All patients requiring inpatient or day-case treatment received this within the Charter guarantee throughout 1999.</p>

  <p>We have provided &pound;0.5 million to Highland Health Board for orthopaedic services under the waiting lists initiative. This has enabled Highland Acute Hospitals NHS Trust to increase staffing, including staffing at consultant level, and to reduce significantly a backlog of cases that existed until 1999. 64% of people requiring inpatient and day-case treatment and 68% of outpatients are now seen within three months. The board and the Trust are striving to make further improvements and to bring waiting times to within the Patients&#8217; Charter standards. Initiatives include a closer integration of primary and secondary care services in orthopaedics.</p>

  <p>A development proposal for the waterfront at Port Glasgow for mixed use development including retail, leisure, and residential, was called in at the end of October 1999 by Scottish ministers for their determination. The proposal was called in because of its possible implications for national and local industrial and retail policies. Following the announcement, in the Greenock Telegraph on 18 February 2000, that a Public Local Inquiry into the development proposal would start on Tuesday 4 April 2000, two representations have been received. This brings the total number of representations received to 51, most of which have come from local individuals, businesses and organisations. Particular concern has been expressed about the relocation of the parking areas, the loss of trade to the town centre and detriment to residential amenity.</p>

  <p>Police forces will pay non-domestic rates from 1 April 2000 following the abolition of Crown Exemption from non-domestic rates for all properties. Sufficient additional provision was included in the police Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE) settlement for 2000-01 to cover in full the estimated extra cost to each force. The amount that police authorities estimate they will spend in cash terms, as a result of this change and as a proportion of their budget, is shown in the table below.</p>

  <p>From the academic year 2000-01 the minimum entry requirements to Postgraduate Certificate in Education (Secondary) courses will be increased. Applicants will require within their degrees three teaching subject qualifying courses (TSQCs), with one TSQC at Scottish degree level two or above and one at level three or above. Previously only two TSQCs were necessary and one had to be at Scottish degree level two or above. These requirements are set out in the <i>Memorandum on Entry Requirements to Courses of Teacher Education in Scotland</i> .</p>

  <p>The increase in the minimum entry requirements is designed as a contribution to raising standards in the teaching workforce and was the outcome of a working group and a comprehensive consultation with all interested parties including further and higher education institutions, the teacher education institutions and the General Teaching Council for Scotland.</p>

  <p>I understand that Railtrack have concluded a feasibility study on behalf of Strathclyde Passenger Transport Authority to identify options for infrastructure improvements to increase the capacity of the line from Barrhead to Kilmarnock. The study is currently being considered by SPTA. No application has been received by either the Scottish Executive or the Shadow Strategic Rail Authority for public funding to assist with infrastructure costs.</p>

  <p>There is already statutory basis for funding voluntary organisations such as Rape Crisis or Victim Support services. Section 10 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968, makes provision for financial assistance by way of grant or loan to be provided to voluntary organisations whose sole or primary objective is to promote social welfare.</p>

  <p>The origin of equipment installed on wind farms is entirely a matter for the developers. The Scottish Executive is, however, keen to see an indigenous industry being developed to benefit from any opportunities which could emerge from renewable sources of energy being developed. Where appropriate, Locate in Scotland and the Enterprise network are assisting with this.</p>

  <p>Consideration was given to removing the prohibition on leasing milk quota whilst still maintaining the ring fence for permanent quota transfers. This would have allowed milk producers on Shetland to lease out quota on a year-by-year basis to the mainland. It was decided not to pursue this option as quota, and milk production, would still have been able to leave the Islands and the milk producers would have been denied the opportunity to sell their quota and then use the cash realised to assist in business restructuring.</p>

  <p>I met representatives of Glasgow City, South Lanarkshire and Renfrewshire Councils on 21 December 1999 to discuss the Strategic Roads Review decision on the M74 Northern Extension. I indicated then that I wished my officials to offer advice and assistance to the councils as they developed their thinking on the M74 proposals. As a result, Scottish Executive officials have since met the councils on a number of occasions and are keeping closely in touch with progress.</p>

  <p>There are 41 routes in the statutory list of trunk roads. The length of trunk roads, including motorway slip roads, is 3,439km (2,137 miles) which represents approximately 6.5% of the public road network. The number of trunk roads built or roads reclassified as trunk roads over the last 10 years would only be available at disproportionate cost. A number of roads were reclassified in 1996 under the &quot;Shaping the Trunk Roads Network&quot; initiative. This exercise involved both trunking and detrunking of existing trunk roads to create a network which would:</p>

  <p>provide the road user with a coherent and continuous system of routes which serve destinations of importance to industry, commerce, agriculture and tourism;</p>

  <p>define nationally important routes which will be developed in line with strategic national transport demands; and</p>

  <p>ensure that those roads which are of a predominantly local importance are managed locally.</p>

  <p>A list of roads which were trunked and their length in miles is given in the table below.</p>

A trunk road is a national road for through traffic and, in determining whether it is expedient for a road to be a trunk road, I require to take into account local and national planning including the requirements of agriculture and industry.</p>

  <p>Local economic development opportunities associated with the provision of the M77 were considered in the Strategic Roads Review and reported in the Appraisal Summary Table for the scheme published in <i>Travel Choices for Scotland, Strategic Roads Review</i> . Such opportunities are generally identified in local plans in the area; for example the Kilmarnock Local Plan has identified development opportunities to the north of Kilmarnock that relate to the improved strategic access that the M77 extension will provide.</p>
