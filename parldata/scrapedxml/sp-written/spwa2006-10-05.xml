  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how ministerial confidence in the Executive&rsquo;s financial planning can be reconciled with the data in <em>Statistics Release: Free Personal and Nursing Care Scotland 2002-2005</em> which omit figures for West Lothian in Table 13 and also imply that in 2004-05 the (a) gross cost per hour, gross of all on-costs, of delivering personal care in the domestic situation in Renfrewshire and (b) net cost per hour, net of all on-costs, in the largest authority, Glasgow City, was less than the hourly minimum wage.</p>

  <p>The statistics mentioned are based on information provided by and quality assured by local authorities. They are not published as National Statistics as there are known problems with coverage and data quality which are gradually improving over time. All figures are provisional and subject to possible change in next year&rsquo;s publication as local authorities continue to improve their data collection systems.</p>

  <p>The Executive&rsquo;s financial planning uses data from a variety of different sources and does not just rely on reported past expenditure. The distribution of funding to local authorities follows the Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE) allocation process and for social work services in 2004-05 this amounted to a total allocation of &pound;1.7 billion.</p>

  <p>GAE lines are agreed by the Executive in consultation with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA) and are set using a number of indicators. The GAE lines for Social Work services are not ring-fenced allowing local authorities to set budgets and manage their finances according to local priorities and needs.</p>

  <p>Recent reports of a shortfall in the local government finance settlement in respect of children&rsquo;s services were misleading.

  <p>Previous exhibitions and tours include the <em>Celebrating Scotland&rsquo;s Crafts</em> exhibition at the NMS in June 2000 which subsequently toured Scotland and the USA in 2002-03.</p>

  <p>The NMS have an international collection of craft items, which includes many Scottish crafts and has been involved in showcasing Scottish crafts at both the Smithsonian Institute and during Tartan Week.</p>

  <p>Scotland&rsquo;s indigenous crafts are also well represented in collections in non-national museums throughout Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Arts Council (SAC) supports many traditional craft makers and organisations. Indigenous craft makers are also supported through wider crafts initiatives such as the web promotion tool www.craftscotland.org. This web resource, initiated by SAC as part of its Creative Industries strategy, provides makers with a means to promote their work nationally and internationally.</p>

  <p>A conference for indigenous craft makers in 1996 revealed a rich diversity of crafts nationwide. In September 2005, the SAC hosted the <em>Living Traditions</em> Indigenous Crafts Conference at Birnham, Perthshire. The purpose of this conference was to review developments in the sector and consider future needs.</p>

  <p>Since 31 July 2006 clinical dental technicians (denturists) have been required to register with the General Dental Council (GDC) before they can practise. Registration is on the basis of qualifications approved by the GDC.</p>

  <p>Registered dental technicians who wish to practise as clinical dental technicians will have to undertake further training to gain the clinical skills they need to register as such with the GDC. Discussions continue with NHS Education for Scotland, aimed at setting up a course in Scotland from as early as possible in 2007. This course will require GDC approval, and its viability will need to be demonstrated for the Scottish education sector. Interest to date has been low.</p>

  <p>For those who already have the Canadian George Brown qualification there is a &quot;top-up&quot; course available in England. Although a Scottish satellite of this course was planned, only one candidate has been identified. Discussions are on-going with a view to agreeing the best way of ensuring that this individual can pursue the course.</p>

  <p>There is no inconsistency between the answers to the two questions S2W-28278 and S2W-28279. The rules for assessment of disposable income for advice and assistance and civil legal aid are different.</p>

  <p>Question S2W-28278 related to legal aid. Schedule 2 of the Civil Legal Aid (Scotland) Regulations 2002 governs the assessment of disposable income for civil legal aid. Pension credit is not included as a disregarded benefit in this Schedule and is therefore counted in the assessment of disposable income for civil legal aid.</p>

  <p>Question S2W-28279 related to advice and assistance. Schedule 2 of the Advice and Assistance (Scotland) Regulations 1996 governs the assessment of disposable income for advice and assistance.

  <p>The final report of the feasibility study into the provision of a new park and ride station at Allandale was submitted to the Scottish Executive by consultants acting on behalf of Falkirk Council earlier this year.</p>

  <p>The report, which took the form of a STAG appraisal, considered the feasibility of a station and park and ride at Allandale, the impact of this site on other rail stations and the overall use of the rail network and the feasibility of other stations on the rail line at Bonnybridge and Abronhill. The study was also expanded to include the operational feasibility and economic appraisal of a station and park and ride site at Bannockburn.</p>

  <p>The report concluded that the development of an alternative park and ride facility at Bannockburn would provide best value for money and that this option should be taken forward to a Design and Development Appraisal stage.</p>

  <p>No significant improvement schemes on the A701 trunk road have been completed since 1999, are currently underway or are planned to commence by 2008-09.</p>

  <p>However, between 2001 and 2005 the Scottish Executive carried out works on the route to the value of &pound;3.153 million, of which &pound;2.898 million was spent on surfacing projects.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland has operational responsibility for this area, and can be contacted for more information if required.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what action it is taking to provide financial support for Scottish snowboarders who have secured the Olympic Gold Passport, in light of reports that one team member has been awarded &pound;5,000 from <strong></strong> sportscotland whereas English snowboarders have received &pound;10,000 from Sport England.</p>

  <p>The Olympic Gold Passport is a Great Britain wide scheme managed by the British Olympic Association which does not include a monetary value. All athletes across Great Britain are eligible for the World Class Podium, World Class Development or World Class Talent Programmes will receive a monetary award.</p>

  <p>In consultation with Snowsport Great Britain,<strong> </strong>sportscotland has offered &pound;5,000 Athlete Support to a Scottish snowboarder. However, there is no information available at this time about which English Snowsport athletes are eligible for Talented Athletes Scholarship Scheme support or how much that support might be.</p>

  <p>The funding to promote volunteering recently announced by the UK Government Cabinet Office was allocated from existing resources and does not therefore result in any consequentials for Scotland.</p>
