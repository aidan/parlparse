  <p>The Finance Minister&#8217;s announcement on 27 June stated that the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Department will receive an additional &pound;14 million, &pound;4 million and &pound;3 million over 2001-04 to fund foot-and-mouth disease recovery, cultural industries and assistance for child care for further and higher education students. However, provision for student loans will be reduced as a result of accounting changes and Regional Selective Assistance provision will be reduced to meet forecast demand. These realignments will produce &pound;10 million, &pound;17 million, and &pound;20 million, giving a net change of &pound;4 million, -&pound;13 million and -&pound;17 million over the same period. The new Departmental Expenditure Limits (DEL) plans will be &pound;2,051.8 million, &pound;2,088.1 million and &pound;2,155.1 million over the three years from 2001-02.</p>

  <p>The revised budget for the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Department will be contained within the Executive&#8217;s draft budget which will be published in September 2001.</p>

  <p>We recently laid before the Scottish Parliament legislation to provide for a Scottish decommissioning scheme. Amongst other things, the legislation will lay down basic eligibility criteria for the Scottish scheme. These will require that an applicant&#8217;s vessel is registered and:</p>

  <p>is over 10 metres in length;</p>

  <p>has a category A licence (except a pelagic licence);</p>

  <p>has spent a minimum number of days at sea on fishing trips during 1999 and 2000;</p>

  <p>is at least 10 years old;</p>

  <p>has a safety certificate or letter confirming completion of a satisfactory survey, and</p>

  <p>is Scottish based (defined in the legislation).</p>

  <p>The legislation is being introduced following consultation with industry interests. Further consultation is currently under way on the approach to be taken to the evaluation and ranking of individual decommissioning bids. Once the consultation is complete, proposals for the scheme will be finalised, detailed scheme documentation prepared and the scheme opened to bids &#8211; probably during August or September.</p>

  <p>The NHS24 concept was the product of an extensive public consultation process across Scotland involving a wide range of public and service stakeholders in national and local seminars.</p>

  <p>The NHS24 Project team has adopted a similar open and inclusive approach in designing and developing NHS24 as a new service. A Project Advisory Group has been created to engage and involve key stakeholders with an interest in NHS24 and its development. The group&#8217;s broad membership includes the following organisations:</p>

  <p>Scottish Association of Health Councils</p>

  <p>Scottish Consumer Council</p>

  <p>Association of Directors of Social Work</p>

  <p>Scottish Partnership Forum</p>

  <p>British Medical Association</p>

NHS24 has begun discussions with health boards and other partners on the nature of the link they wish to have with NHS24. Local Implementation Teams drawn from the local NHS and its partner agencies are being formed to reach agreements on service delivery arrangements and plan the introduction of the service in each health board area.

  <p>Huntington&#8217;s Disease (HD) is a particularly distressing later onset hereditary illness caused by a faulty gene, which affects progressively the individual&#8217;s ability to function physically, mentally and emotionally. There is no cure at present. Palliative care for victims of HD is a matter for health boards. A Scottish Needs Assessment Programme (SNAP) on HD and conditions which produce similar clinical problems, Acquired Brain Injury and Early Onset Dementia, was issued in February 2000. SNAPs provide health boards with good practice recommendations for the planning of services.</p>

  <p>There is a genetic test available which can detect whether or not a person has inherited the faulty gene. Through the four Regional Genetics Advisory Centres, comprehensive specialist genetic services are available to all affected individuals and their families in Scotland. These services include assessment, diagnosis, genetic counselling, the provision of genetic tests for pre-symptomatic diagnosis or pre-natal diagnosis for those who wish to be tested after careful counselling, and psycho-social support for families who need it.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive provides funding support to the voluntary organisation, Scottish Huntington&#8217;s Association, which offers help and support to those affected by HD, and their families.</p>

  <p>The Ebola virus has not been found in meat imported into the UK. In countries where Ebola occurs, it may affect non-human primates. It has not been found in any other type of animal. As such the virus could in theory be present in meat from primates in outbreak areas. Import of meat from affected animals is however extremely unlikely, not least because infected primates develop the same severe illness as humans. Moreover, as most viruses require living cells in which to survive, it is highly unlikely that the virus would survive in meat.</p>

  <p>We have no plans to encourage the establishment of a sports-specific first aid certificate for sports coaches. However, <strong></strong> sportscotland&#8217;s Coaching Team administer a number of workshops on behalf of the National Coaching Foundation. Injury Prevention and Management is just one in a series of 12 new workshops which consist of highly practical and applied three-hour sessions. On completion of this workshop coaches should be able to:</p>

  <p>Identify potential problems in training and/or competition which may lead to injury.</p>

  <p>Modify their practices and those of their performers to reduce the likelihood of injury.</p>

  <p>Assess the severity of injury and respond appropriately.</p>

  <p>Define the type and grade of, and deal with, soft tissue injury.</p>

  <p>Assess if a performer is ready to resume training and/or competition.</p>

  <p>In the financial year ending 31 March 2001, 183 coaches had successfully completed the Injury Prevention and Management workshop. The workshop was also made available to approximately 30 Millennium Volunteers aged from 16 to 18.</p>
