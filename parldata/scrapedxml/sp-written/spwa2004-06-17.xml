  <p>South Lanarkshire Community Learning Strategy Partnership has been allocated &#163;1.6 million over three years to March 2006 to help raise levels of adult literacy and numeracy. The partnership has submitted an action plan which estimates that over 6,000 adults across South Lanarkshire will be helped during this time. Over 1,200 learners in South Lanarkshire had their literacy and numeracy skills improved in the first two years since the launch of the national strategy in 2001.

  <p>Section 13 of the Building (Scotland) Act 1959 allows local authorities to take action requiring the repair, securing or demolition of buildings found to be dangerous.</p>

  <p>Local authorities have powers under Section 87 of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 to require the rectification of defects in buildings which they consider to be in need of repair.</p>

  <p>Section 179 of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 gives planning authorities powers to require that specified steps be taken to deal with the injury to amenity caused by the ruinous or dilapidated condition of any building in their district or caused by the derelict, waste or neglected condition of any land in their district.</p>

  <p>The Local Government in Scotland Act 2003 gives local authorities the power to advance the well-being of their area or the people in it. This is a broad enabling measure allowing local authorities the freedom to work in a more innovative and creative way in responding to the need of their communities. Well-being is dependent on many factors but may include environmental factors.</p>

  <p>As explained in the response to S1W-26341 in June 2002, data on the Sure Start Scotland programme is only available at a Scotland level. Raw data available at local authority level would not be of sufficient quality and completeness to support analysis or to allow conclusions to be drawn or comparisons with other data to be made.</p>

  <p>However, following a national mapping exercise a first stage evaluation summary published in May 2002 found that Sure Start Scotland had offered support to over 15,000 additional children in 2000-01 and 6,000 parents. The figures covered a wide range of provision which varied in intensity from one-off interventions to sustained support over a long period. Importantly, the evaluation summary noted that Sure Start Scotland had allowed a co-ordinated and comprehensive approach to services for the targeted group for the first time. We are currently considering whether to commission an update to the mapping exercise.</p>

  <p>The provision of advice and support for business start-ups and growing businesses in Scotland is primarily an operational matter for Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise. In the Scottish Enterprise area the Business Gateway provides a first stop shop for businesses seeking to access available support.</p>

  <p>I understand that in the Clydesdale area for the period 2003-04, 106 businesses have benefited from one-to-one business development support from a business adviser. Overall the number of start-up businesses supported by Scottish Enterprise Lanarkshire has increased from 830 in 2002-03 to 1,100 in 2003-04, an increase of 32.5%.</p>

  <p>The European Commission&#8217;s current regional aid guidelines, which determine where, how and in what circumstances regional aid can be granted, expire on 31 December 2006. The Commission have issued proposals for new guidelines to apply from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013. These would significantly reduce the areas where regional aid could be used in Scotland.</p>

  <p>State aid is reserved to Westminster under the Scotland Act. A UK-wide consultation on the Commission&#8217;s proposals starts this week. Comments are requested by 28 June to help inform the initial UK response to the Commission. The full consultation period will run up to 6 September and responses will be taken into account in the continuing UK discussions with the Commission. A copy of the consultation document has been placed in the Scottish Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 33021).</p>

  <p>We are in discussion with the UK government and with EU contacts, to represent Scottish interests; and we are writing to Scottish stakeholders to encourage them to participate in the consultation.</p>

  <p>The conservation of fossil sites in Scotland is the responsibility of Scottish Natural Heritage. Of the sites identified by the Joint Nature Conservation Committee Geological Conservation Review, 98% of those categorised as of national or international importance are found within Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs).</p>

  <p>The Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004, which was passed by Parliament on 5 May 2004, significantly updates and enhances those arrangements, including through the creation of new criminal offences to protect SSSIs.</p>

  <p>The act also makes provision for the production by Scottish Natural Heritage of a Scottish Fossil Code, which will provide advice, recommendations and information in relation to fossils and the protection of fossil sites.</p>

  <p>The unauthorised removal of fossils from private land may also constitute theft.</p>

  <p>The eligibility criteria for access to NHS funded infertility treatment are re-applied for each treatment cycle. Thus, for example, if the woman reaches the age of 38 or if her total number of unsuccessful embryo transfers reaches three, then the couple becomes ineligible for further cycles.</p>

  <p>The criteria were developed by an expert advisory group using the most up-to-date available clinical evidence. NHS boards have been asked to work towards the implementation of the criteria as existing resources allow and bearing in mind local and national priorities.</p>

  <p>The Executive is currently in the process of reviewing the criteria, including the age limit. I anticipate the review being completed later in 2004.</p>

When considering demand for forward years, projected figures may be used in place of the most recent mid-year estimates. When the mid-year estimate for a new year is published after the statistic, the latter may be revised at the next opportunity after the release of the latest population estimates. Some uses require small area population data at a level not routinely covered by the Registrar General&#8217;s mid-year estimates, so census-based figures or other sources may have to be employed.</p>

  <p>The Registrar General&#8217;s mid-year estimates are the normal source of information about the usually resident population, with students counted at their term time address. If the purpose requires a different population that can be estimated reliably and consistently for comparative areas, then other population counts may be justified &#8211; for example by counting students at the parental home based on census information.</p>

  <p>It is for public sector procuring bodies to ensure that they have the necessary expertise to undertake a public private partnership project, including the monitoring of value for money issues. As PPP projects usually involve large investments over a long period, and the procurement process can be complex, it is recommended that advisers are appointed to ensure that the base position for future value for money monitoring is soundly established. Guidance can be found in the Treasury Taskforce Technical Note No. 3 <em>How to Appoint and Manage Advisers</em> . Copies are available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 20723). The processes for monitoring delivery of service and value for money once the contract commences call for expertise and resources similar to conventional procurements, including for example budgeting, audit, and performance reporting arrangements.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive Financial Partnerships Unit will shortly issue a third Key Stage Review stage which aims to assist local authorities in their Schools PPP projects by assessing what systems and resources need to be put in place to support and manage their PPP contract after financial close. This has been produced in consultation with authorities and specialist advisers.</p>

  <p>The sale of student loan debt has transferred risk to the private sector and released resources for improving public services. Payment of subsidies is an integral part of the process. The Scottish Executive contribution to total subsidy payments from 1998 to May 2004 is just under &#163;62 million. Provision was made for the on-going payment of the subsidy when the debt was sold.</p>

  <p>The National Waste Plan sets out how we will achieve more sustainable management of Scotland&#8217;s waste, including our aim to reduce the proportion of municipal waste sent to landfill from around 90% to 30% by 2020. New landfill sites are subject to strict environmental controls under the Landfill (Scotland) Regulations 2003 and will require planning permission according to the usual procedures. The plan is available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 26101).</p>

  <p>Key aims of the National Waste Plan are to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfill and more generally to implement the best practicable environmental option for sustainable management of Scotland&#8217;s waste. Avoiding unnecessary transport of waste is one of the factors taken into account, but it is also important for local authorities to secure economies of scale through the joint provision of waste infrastructure. We are supporting the implementation of the Plan through the Strategic Waste Fund. The plan is available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 26101).</p>

  <p>Provision of disposal capacity for industrial waste is a matter for the waste industry and local authorities. The role of the Executive is to provide the regulatory and policy framework to secure sustainable management of waste. Our approach to that is set out in the National Waste Plan, which is available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 26101). Industrial waste, and other forms of non-municipal waste, are also considered in the 11 Area Waste Plans which together cover the whole of Scotland. These may be found on the Scottish Environment Protection Agency&#8217;s website at http://www.sepa.org.uk/nws/guidance/awp.htm.</p>

  <p>Certain forms of industrial waste are subject to particular study by the agency as priority waste streams, details of which are in the National Waste Plan. Data on industrial waste are collected by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. Information is available on the agency&#8217;s website at:</p>
