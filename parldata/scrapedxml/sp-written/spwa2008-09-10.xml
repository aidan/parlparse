  <p>I wrote to the Convener of the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee on 19 June 2008 setting out the process for implementing the Adoption and Children (Scotland) Act 2007. I intend to write again shortly to set out a more detailed timetable for laying the draft regulations and commencing the act, as well as the revised draft Looked After Children (Scotland) Regulations.

  <p>The Scottish Government is currently developing the regulations to support the implementation of the Adoption and Children (Scotland) Act 2007; this includes the regulations under section 74.</p>

  <p>Due to the nature of the regulations relating to section 74 we are working with the General Medical Council, the British Medical Association, the Royal College of General Practitioners and the Information Commissioner&rsquo;s Office in order to ensure that these regulations are fit for purpose. A consultation on the regulations will be published later this year, with section 74 of the 2007 act being implemented with the rest of the 2007 act early in 2009. We will ensure that Dr Richard Simpson receives the consultation paper when it is issued.</p>

  <p>The power to make regulations under section 74 of the Adoption and Children (Scotland) Act 2007 relate specifically to the &quot;disclosure of information about the health of the natural parents of a child who is to be, may be, or has been adopted&quot;.

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-09-10.S3W-16038.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80393" speakername="Stewart Stevenson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa0910.htm#2">

  <p>The consultation on proposals for a Scottish Climate Change Bill received 21,046 responses. Of this total, 318 were from individuals and organisations seeking to respond directly to questions asked in the consultation document itself and the remaining 20,728 were from participants in eight campaigns which put forward a limited number of requests regarding the content of the proposed bill.</p>

  <p>Of those responses which sought to answer the specific questions in the consultation document, 224 addressed directly or indirectly the question about whether the 80% target should be based on carbon dioxide only or on the basket of six greenhouse gases. Of that number, a large majority stated in full or in part, or inferred, support for using the basket of six greenhouse gases.</p>

  <p>In line with established good practice, the analysis of the responses to the consultation was a qualitative exercise designed to reflect the breadth and overall pattern of views expressed across the range of stakeholders who responded, rather than to measure and quantify these patterns. Campaign participants were encouraged to adapt a core script provided by the campaign organisers. The analysis of these responses took account of both the core script statement plus all amendments and additions by individuals.</p>

  <p>Three campaign texts explicitly supported the use of the basket of six greenhouse gases. In total, 907 responses were received from these campaigns.</p>

  <p>A number of additional responses, including the remaining five campaign texts, referred to &quot;greenhouse gases&quot;, rather than carbon dioxide or the full basket of greenhouse gases, without stating explicitly which gases they were referring to. In total, 19,812 responses were received from these campaigns.</p>

  <p>The open nature of the consultation questions meant that answers to one question often contained views relevant to another. In relation to support for a target based on all greenhouse gas emissions, a wide range of information from across the responses was considered in order to determine the level of support for this measure. In analysing the responses, the contracted analysts had to determine whether support was explicit, inferred, or expressed in response to another issue.</p>

  <p>Further information about the methodology used can be found in section 1 and annex 3 of the report of the analysis of the consultation responses, which can be found at:</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive why witnesses who have been cited formally as witnesses to attend court and are subsequently told not to attend court are told not to attend verbally by a third party and without confirmation in writing by the court.</p>

  <p>When a witness who has been formally cited by the Crown to attend Court is no longer required, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) uses a variety of methods to notify the witness depending on the circumstances of the case and the individual needs of the witness.</p>

  <p>In the case of civilian witnesses cited for Summary and Sheriff and Jury Trials, COPFS aims to countermand the citation by post, subject to the following exceptions:</p>

  <p>(a) Where there are less than three clear working days between the date of countermanding and the date of trial.</p>

  <p>(b) Where the witness is a child witness or a vulnerable adult witness.</p>

  <p>In Summary and Sheriff and Jury cases, where there are less than three clear working days between the date of countermanding and the date of trial or the witness is a child witness or a vulnerable adult witness, witnesses are notified verbally, by telephone or in person by COPFS staff or by the police on the instruction of the Procurator Fiscal. The police use a variety of ways of passing on this information to the witness and may do this by telephone or by attending at the home or business address of the witness to notify them in person.</p>

  <p>Postal countermands are not used for High Court cases. Witnesses cited by the Crown in High Court cases are either countermanded verbally, either by telephone or in person by COPFS staff or by the police using the methods outlined above.</p>

  <p>If a witness is no longer required to attend at court and is being informed of this verbally, it will always be by an employee of COPFS or the relevant police force, acting on the instruction of the Procurator Fiscal.</p>

  <p>Arrangements for cancelling or countermanding witnesses cited by the defence or by parties in civil cases are entirely a matter for them.</p>

  <p>The tender is focused on selecting the electricity supplier(s) for the national contract in accordance with the most economically advantageous tender. Energy reduction initiatives are defined, developed and monitored by individual public bodies and are carried out in line with their own policy and budget priorities.

  <p>Progress is being made on realising the renewable capability across the public sector in a number of ways:</p>

  <p>Through the Scottish Government&rsquo;s &quot;Leading By Example&quot; programme we are ensuring all parts of the public sector play an exemplary role in pioneering new greener behaviours. Generating more sustainable low carbon energy through renewables is an important element of the programme;</p>

  <p>We have extended the public sector fund to allow it to be used to support renewable technologies as well as energy efficiency;</p>

  <p>We have tripled funding for community and microgeneration, with &pound;13.5 million available each year compared to the previous administration&rsquo;s &pound;4.5 million;</p>

  <p>We are more actively promoting the UK Government&rsquo;s Low Carbon Building Programme which provides grants to the public sector for renewable technologies, and</p>

  <p>We are introducing dedicated School Development Officers to support the deployment of renewable technologies in schools.</p>

  <p>The national contract arrangements will help facilitate the development of renewable generation by ensuring appropriate tariffs are set for surplus electricity generated by public sector bodies fed back into the national grid, and thus support business cases for the installation of such technologies.</p>

  <p>Information gathered from market sources has indicated that specifying specific quantities of renewable electricity can lead to reduced competition. The upturn in demand for renewable electricity has resulted in reduced quantities being readily available leading to an increased risk that few, if any, suppliers could meet a large demand from the Scottish public sector.</p>

  <p>The national contract tender contains provisions to ensure that access to renewable electricity is not dependent on the renewable supplies available from any particular supplier at the time of submitting their tender. Innovative contract terms will ensure that other sources of supply can be accessed as necessary.</p>

  <p>At a national level, several of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s policies support local authorities and others in addressing the needs of the most vulnerable families.

  <p>For those families with children where vulnerability is persistent or particularly marked, the Scottish Government&rsquo;s <em>Getting it right for every child</em> approach emphasises that the child&rsquo;s needs should be at the centre of service delivery and that where more than one agency is required to provide the necessary support, this should be done in a co-ordinated way.</p>

  <p>In 2006-07, &pound;35 million was invested in colleges via the Scottish Funding Council to support over 25,000 enrolments in a wide range of child care and adult care related courses. The Scottish Government is also providing record levels of funding to local government, the majority of which is provided by means of a block grant. Local government, as part of our shared commitment to developing strong public services, invests significantly in the development of the child care and adult care workforces.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government also makes a range of supplementary investments to support skills and training in these sectors. For example, we provide &pound;6 million a year to five centres for excellence that have a focus on practitioner development in key areas, including residential child care and substance misuse. Learning networks, which support regional learning and development priorities across the sectors, receive &pound;1 million a year. &pound;1 million per annum is also provided via the Voluntary Sector Development Fund. Another &pound;1 million is available to national voluntary sector bodies to deliver innovative training. Other initiatives which support skills development in these sectors are set out in the answers to questions S3W-15919 and S3W-15920 on 10 September 2008.

  <p>The Scottish Social Services Council (SSSC) undertakes sector skills council responsibility in Scotland for promoting and developing education and training for the social services workforce. The Scottish Government expects all sector skills councils to ensure that employers have a say in the design and development of learning at all levels and in all settings. This will ensure a demand led education and training system that provides individuals with the knowledge and skills required by employers. The SSSC has produced a sector learning strategy for Scotland and is working closely with awarding bodies to ensure that qualifications that are relevant, accessible and achievable are available to the workforce and their employers.</p>

  <p>The SSSC also plays an active role in the development of awards in Scotland and participates in decision making forums regarding the accreditation/validation and approval of awards for the social care sector. They therefore help to complement the respective approval, accreditation and quality assurance roles of the Scottish Qualifications Authority in relation to SVQs and HNCs, which make up a significant percentage of the training courses relevant to the childcare and adult care sectors.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for the approval, monitoring, inspection and quality assurance of the social work honours degree programmes and, from its introduction in autumn 2008, the new early years and child care degree programmes, also lies with the SSSC.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to developing the social care workforce in line with the <em>Economic Strategy</em> and <em>Skills for Scotland: A Lifelong Skills Strategy</em> . We are working with stakeholders on a range of partnership approaches, policies and systems to create sustainable change across the sector. These include a continuous learning framework linked to core skills and competencies and creating career pathways; a leadership and management framework providing tools to assist leaders in meeting their development needs; a research and development strategy which seeks to build the workforce&rsquo;s capacity to engage with evidence-based practice; all of which are being developed under <em>Changing Lives:</em> <em>the 21st Century Social Work Review</em> . Additionally, support is provided to promote workforce development in the voluntary and private sectors; as well as a range of investment and quality improvement approaches which are set out in the answers to questions S3W-15918 and S3W-15919 on 10 September 2008.</p>

  <p>In the early years and child care sector we have developed a new standard for childhood practice. As part of that, we are working with the sector to develop a new degree programme for managers and lead practitioners, which will be available from September 2008. In due course, managers will be expected to achieve this qualification as part of registration with the Scottish Social Services Council.</p>

  <p>All recruitment to the Scottish Government is conducted in accordance with the Civil Service Recruitment Code. Successful candidates are selected on merit on the basis of fair and open competition.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s Equal Opportunities and Dignity at Work policies prohibit discrimination on grounds of age. In addition, our Diversity Strategy supports our aim of valuing everyone&rsquo;s individual contribution in the workplace.</p>

  <p>In line with our legal obligations, Diversity Strategy and Departmental Diversity Delivery Plan, the Scottish Government, as an employer, is committed to improving the diversity of its workforce.</p>

  <p>In 2002, the Scottish Government set up an Age Working Group of interested parties to consider the implications of Age legislation and to oversee the work of developing and implementing an Age Diversity Strategy.</p>

  <p>The work of the group also involved an initial audit of HR policies to assess the possible impact of the legislation. This was followed by a more detailed audit of all policies and procedures to ensure no disparate impact on staff of any age.</p>

  <p>Colleagues in Equality Unit and Older People&rsquo;s Team regularly meet with members of Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) both in London and Scotland to discuss all aspects including age. Our Older People&rsquo;s Team met with EHRC as part of a round table discussion on age on 24 June.</p>

  <p>From 1 October 2006 the Scottish Government introduced a &quot;no retirement age&quot; policy for band A-C staff in the Scottish Government main bargaining unit. This means that employees in those bands are free to continue in employment for as long as they wish subject to the normal Scottish Government conduct, performance and attendance procedures. Normal retirement age for the Senior Civil Service was raised by the Cabinet Office from 60 to 65.</p>

  <p>From 1 March 2008, the Scottish Government introduced &lsquo;partial retirement&rsquo;<strong>, </strong>this means that staff who agree with their manager to &quot;reshape&quot; their job, so that their earnings reduce by at least 20%, can draw some or all of their Civil Service pension and remain in work.</p>

  <p>We have no plans to introduce targets on age for staff recruitment or retention.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is already providing a tremendous incentive for the renewables industry to build new renewable generating capacity via our renewables obligation on all Scottish electricity suppliers. Recent information has highlighted that renewable or &quot;green&quot; electricity tariffs for renewable electricity do not lead necessarily to the production of additional electricity from renewable sources.</p>

  <p>Rather than paying what is likely to be a significant price premium for &quot;green&quot; electricity within the current tight financial settlement, the Scottish Government will divert resources towards energy management measures for its own estate, which will help protect the environment while reducing costs in the medium term via reduced electricity consumption.</p>

  <p>Market indicators have suggested that the demand for renewable electricity has significantly increased as both public and private sector organisations have sought to demonstrate green credentials. This has resulted in supplies of renewable electricity being constrained in the market place both in terms of total availability and the quantities available from individual suppliers. The request for information process therefore sought information from the market on availability of renewable electricity to inform the strategy for the national electricity contract for the Scottish public sector.</p>

  <p>The interventions proposed by Tactrans for consideration as part of the strategic transport projects review formed one source of such interventions. A wide range of interventions were proposed by various sources: duplicate or complementary interventions were packaged together, where appropriate. The full list of interventions will be detailed in the appendices to the reports which will be published later this year.</p>
