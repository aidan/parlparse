  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive when the best practice guidance for local authorities on how to tackle the problems associated with seagulls in urban areas will be finalised; whether such guidance will be published; whether the guidance will be issued in sufficient time to enable local authorities to implement it prior to the next nesting season, and whether the guidance will include a recommendation that licences be sought and obtained by local authorities well in advance of the nesting season to allow them to take specific action to cull seagulls where there are reports that such seagulls are attacking humans or property and what the reasons are for its position on this matter, particularly with regard to the benefits resulting from the guidance.</p>

  <p>Officials have already met with a number of directors of environmental health from local authorities, to discuss their current methods and best practices on dealing with this issue. In addition we are exploring potential research opportunities to assist in developing a range of solutions. The research will be completed in 2004 and is likely to lead to guidance from the Executive to local authorities on best practice. I expect this guidance note to be a public document.</p>

  <p>Local authorities already have the powers, expertise and knowledge within their environmental health responsibilities to deal with the nuisance caused by seagulls and many have already developed best practice guidance, which is freely available, to deal with their particular gull issues.</p>

  <p>In relation to licensing, the research work into best practice will consider current licensing provisions. All local authorities are annually already sent copies of Scottish Executive general licences which enable them to currently take action against Great Black-backed gulls, Lesser Black-backed gulls and Herring gulls under specified circumstances. For all other gull species, individual licences can be sought from the Scottish Executive and should be applied for before the start of the breeding season.</p>

  <p>This work is consistent with the assurances given by me to the Parliament in the debate on seagull nuisance held on the 7 November 2002.</p>

There is no estimate by the Executive of the notional cost of replacing this support with paid employees financed by the state.

  <p>The Executive provides Scottish Enterprise with funds for economic development, including cluster activity.</p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise invests in the strategic priorities of establishing Scotland as an international centre for design and innovation, evolving Scotland&#8217;s infrastructure to support its design and innovation strategy and its core manufacturing/supply base: providing an appropriate skill base to meet current and future needs and accelerating Scotland&#8217;s engagement with global optoelectronics industries.</p>

  <p>Over the three-year period 2001-04, Scottish Enterprise has spent approximately &#163;4.77 million directly on the optoelectronics cluster.</p>

  <p>This is a headline figure, more detailed information is an operational matter for Scottish Enterprise.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is providing assistance in a number of ways, in particular through grants under the crofting counties agricultural grants scheme.

  <p>The Executive is also able to be of some assistance to participants of the environmentally sensitive area (ESA) scheme where the floods have meant that compliance with scheme conditions will not be possible this year.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether assistance and compensation to farmers and crofters in south Shetland will be sought through Article 33 of EU Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 which states that support shall be granted for &quot;restoring agricultural production potential damaged by natural disasters and introducing appropriate prevention measures&quot;, following the recent severe flooding in the area.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Rural Development Plan, which sets out the uses of the available EC rural development money, does not provide funding for Article 33 measures. However, the farmers and crofters affected are likely to be able to get grant assistance towards making good the damage. Most of that assistance will be available through the crofting counties agricultural grants scheme.</p>

  <p>Safety of medical instruments is a high priority within NHSScotland, and there has been significant national and local investment in decontamination of instruments in recent years. A letter from SEHD to NHSScotland on 18 September (HDL(2003)42) gave details of the continuing and extensive programme of improvements in decontamination of instruments under the guidance of the Glennie Group, which was set up by SEHD in 2001. This requires primary care establishments to produce action plans for compliance with full Glennie technical requirements by 31 March 2004 and implementation by 31 December 2004. In broad terms, the Glennie Group encourages the use of single-use disposable instruments where practicable in terms of medical suitability and cost.</p>

  <p>With regard to cervical smear tests, a safety alert notice on decontamination of vaginal specula was distributed to NHSScotland in August 2003.</p>

  <p>It is very important that women continue to attend for a cervical smear tests when invited to do so and discuss any concerns they may have with their smear taker. NHS boards are responsible for the promotion of the cervical screening programme in their area.</p>

  <p>Winter always brings additional pressures on the NHS through for example seasonal increases in flu and respiratory diseases. This year, we are already seeing a marked rise in GP consultations arising from flu and flu-like illnesses. The NHS is making additional preparations through planning for extra staff, more beds, increased critical care capacity, additional nursing home places, and continued co-ordinated action on delayed discharge. This is supported by significant extra investment with health spending set to increase on average by more than &#163;630 million each year from 2003-04 to 2005-06, of which &#163;30 million has been allocated this year specifically to address delayed discharges from hospitals.</p>

  <p>Patients can respond better and perhaps faster to treatment if their mental health needs are addressed alongside their physical needs. A Scottish Needs Assessment Programme 2002 report <em>Liaison Psychiatry and Psychology</em> underlined the importance we attach to identifying the whole person needs of all patients in this regard. Product information for all atypical antipsychotic drugs has recently been updated to include warnings about the risk of hyperglycaemia and exacerbation of pre-existing diabetes.</p>

  <p>The Agenda for Change negotiations were completed last year and early implementation of the new pay system is now under way in England. In Scotland, the protection arrangements under Agenda for Change have been enhanced to ensure that no member of staff suffers a salary reduction.</p>

  <p>The Agenda for Change agreement will ensure that part-time workers will receive the same entitlements on a pro-rata basis as full-time colleagues and it will ensure that they receive no detriment.</p>

  <p>The new terms and conditions agreed under Agenda for Change also enhance out of hours payments for some staff. This may result in a reduction in payments for those who work predominately nights and weekends but in many cases the percentage reduction in the out of hours payments may be offset by new pay bands reflecting higher hourly rates. The potential impact on these staff and any recruitment and retention issues which may result are being clearly monitored through the early implementation process.</p>

  <p>Unnecessary bureaucracy will be reduced through having fewer separate finance, human resources and support services functions in each NHS board area, and by winding up separate trusts, each with a chair and a board and each required to produce separate audited accounts. Several NHS boards have already moved to single system working, with minimal disruption.</p>

  <p>Information about estimated financial savings from dissolution of NHS trusts is not collected centrally, since the achievement of financial savings is not an objective of the policy. Nevertheless savings are already being realised in NHS board areas where single system working is in place. The Executive expects these savings to be reinvested in patient care. Following dissolution of trusts, all trust staff are transferring to the relevant NHS board as the single NHS employer in the area. The principles set out in the NHS National Organisational Change Policy will apply.</p>

  <p>As was explained in the White Paper <em>A Partnership for Care</em>, published in February 2003, the move to single system working through dissolving NHS trusts is intended to create single NHS organisations at local level with a common set of aims and values and clear lines of accountability. This will help to strengthen corporate working and provide clear strategic direction.</p>

  <p>&quot;Precautionary&quot; is commonly defined as describing an action taken in advance to avoid potential risk or ensure a good result.</p>

  <p>Our strategy for encouraging the growth and sustainability of voluntary organisations involved in the delivery of public services was set out in <em>A Review of the Scottish Executive&#8217;s Policies to Promote the Social Economy</em> , which was published in January 2003. This is available from Scottish Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>We are currently developing an action plan to implement the specific recommendations of the review and hope to publish this shortly.</p>

  <p>Information on unmet training needs within the voluntary sector is not held. Training is a matter for the individual employer.</p>

  <p>In October 2003, the Executive announced an additional &#163;9 million over the next three years for local authorities to invest in training. It is anticipated that staff who work in partnership with local authorities, including independent providers from the voluntary and private sector will benefit from this additional funding.</p>

  <p>The Executive provide training grants under Section 9 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 to promote an acceptable level of practice competence in key areas of social work covered by the voluntary sector by enabling organisations involved to provide or secure training for their paid staff and voluntary workers which would not otherwise be available to them.</p>

  <p>Currently, the Scottish Social Services Council is undertaking an investigation of all the key funding streams available for training in the social work sector and this will include the voluntary sector.</p>
