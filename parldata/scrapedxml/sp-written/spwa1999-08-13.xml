It is intended to make this before the end of the year.

  <p>The existing contract between the First Minister and Glasgow Careers Service Company expires on 31 March 2000. The company will be asked to re-contract and it is expected that the contract documentation will issue towards the end of September. Providing Glasgow Careers Service Company are able to meet the contract conditions the new contract will take effect from 1 April 2000 and will last for a period of 5 years.</p>

  <p>As with all planning applications, each case must be judged on its merits. The publication of a tougher planning policy guidance framework for opencast coal on 31 March 1999 should ensure that applications are subjected to greater scrutiny. Developers will be expected to match the higher standards that are now expected so that greater protection can be given to communities and the environment. Where consent is granted, arrangements should be put in place to ensure development is carried out in accordance with the planning permission and various other control regimes. These are matters for the planning authority and the other control authorities such as the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, the Health and Safety Executive and other local authority departments. The relevant body should respond to breaches with speedy and robust action.</p>

  <p>Area Tourist Boards are local partnership organisations supported by the Scottish Tourist Board. They are core funded by the STB, by local authorities and by their own income. It is for the Scottish Tourist Board to determine the level of grant it provides to ATBs. In the current financial year, this totals around &pound;3.5 million. I am seeking views as to whether any change should be made in the way ATBs are funded.</p>
