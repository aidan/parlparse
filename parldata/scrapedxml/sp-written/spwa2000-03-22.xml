  <p>The Countryside Premium Scheme is a national scheme designed to deliver conservation benefits in the wider countryside. The arrangements for ranking applications ensure that the resources available are directed to those applications likely to deliver the greatest conservation benefit. In fact, ten applications were accepted in the Dumfries and Galloway area in 1999.</p>

  <p>Good progress is being made in negotiating, with the European Commission, proposals for a new Highlands and Islands Rural Development Plan drawn up by a partnership which includes the Rural Affairs Department, key public sector agencies, and representatives from the farming, crofting and landowning organisations in the Highlands and Islands. Further work is required on detailed scheme design, literature, domestic legislation and state aids clearance. It is hoped to open the new scheme for applications by the end of August.</p>

  <p>The number of applications met under the new plan will depend on a range of things, including the value of individual applications.</p>

  <p>The Department issued 543 grant approvals, for individual measures, in the last three months of the Agricultural Business Improvement Scheme (ABIS) prior to its closure on 31 December 1999. These approvals brought the total number of approvals since 1995 to 5,337. All grant available under the scheme was committed by 31 December 1999.</p>

  <p>Yes. The Scottish Executive commissioned and has now received a report from a panel of industry representatives on the red tape involved in paying EU subsidies.

  <p>The Scottish Executive, along with health boards and NHS Trusts, work in partnership to ensure the delivery of a responsive, high quality ambulance service. A range of measures with the Scottish Ambulance Service have been or are being taken to improve the service given to patients including:</p>

  <p>- changes to crew shift patterns and working practices</p>

  <p>- new radio and communications and control system</p>

  <p>- investment in ambulances and ambulance station and frontline staff</p>

  <p>For the future, the Ambulance Service&#8217;s revenue allocation for 2000-01 provides new development funding, including an extra &pound;500,000 to put 20 more frontline staff into Glasgow, &pound;115,000 in further support of the improvements being made to the Air Ambulance Service, and &pound;485,000 to enable the service to train an extra 75 paramedics in the coming year. This is in addition to the funding being provided to enable the service to investigate the case for introducing a priority-based dispatch system for emergency ambulances. Plans are also being progressed to provide new ambulance stations in Edinburgh.</p>

  <p>I refer you to my answers of 11 February and 13 March 2000 about Scottish Executive support for Neighbourhood Watch and other initiatives. Evaluations are undertaken to determine the effectiveness of all our major crime prevention initiatives.

UPDATE will receive funding of &pound;227,000 in 1999-2000, &pound;238,000 in 2000-01 and &pound;235,000 in 2001-02.</p>

  <p>There is a wide spectrum of needs amongst children with autism and a range of educational provision is required to meet these needs. The majority of children with Asperger&#8217;s syndrome or high functioning autism will be in mainstream schools. Most others will be in special units attached to primary or secondary schools catering for a range of special educational needs, including autism. Smaller numbers will be in two specialist schools in Scotland &#8211; Daldorch House School and Struan House School.</p>

  <p>The <i>Patients&#8217; Charter</i> guarantee of nine months for cataract surgery was breached during 1999 following the discovery of a cluster of cases of the eye infection "endophthalmitis" at Stonehouse Hospital. Routine operations were suspended while investigations were carried out to identify common characteristics of all such cases and to examine infection control procedures. The service was resumed in September 1999.</p>

  <p>In 1998-99 Lanarkshire Health Board invested an additional &pound;266,000 in improving local ophthalmological services and, consequently, adequate resources are in place to deal with the current backlog and to sustain compliance with Charter guarantees.</p>

  <p>A further ophthalmologist is due to take up post on 1 May and this, combined with the momentum created by the full restoration of cataract surgery, means that no patient should breach the Charter guarantee by the end of this year.</p>

  <p>HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary (HMCIC) will shortly commence an inspection of the Scottish Criminal Record Office (SCRO). It will cover the acquisition, examination and presentation of fingerprint evidence and include a review of the training, skills and quality assurance aspects of the SCRO operation. The fingerprint experts of Lothian and Borders Police raised concerns about SCRO&#8217;s handling of the fingerprint evidence in the case of Shirley McKie. The McKie case will be closely examined as part of the inspection process and recommendations will be made on any matters where there were shortcomings or scope for improvement. HMCIC&#8217;s report will be published.</p>

  <p>Decisions relating to Ms McKie&#8217;s employment by Strathclyde Police are matters for the Chief Constable and Strathclyde Joint Police Board. Ms McKie has appealed against the decision of the police authority not to grant her an injury award. Arrangements are being made to have the appeal determined by an independent medical referee.</p>

  <p>In the <i>Partnership for Scotland</i> agreement we made a commitment to promote lifelong learning through the introduction of individual learning accounts (ILAs), and we are committed to the development of a UK framework. The concept of ILAs was developed as a means of allowing people to take responsibility for, and invest in, their own lifelong learning. Accordingly we will now legislate this year to fulfil these commitments and a Learning Accounts (Scotland) Bill will be introduced shortly.</p>

  <p>This Bill will allow Scottish Ministers to prescribe regulations covering such issues as powers to pay incentives and discounts, as well as to define learning eligible for such incentives. We aim to have the necessary legislation in place in order to allow for the UK framework to be fully operational by autumn 2000.</p>

  <p>Local Authorities provide criminal justice social work services which are set firmly in the context of enhancing community safety and minimising the risk from offenders, including sex offenders. They work to National Objectives and Standards for Social Work Services in the Criminal Justice System in delivering these services.</p>

  <p>Additional guidance has been issued to local authority social work departments on the operation of the provisions in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 which allow courts to impose extended sentences which provide additional post-release supervision for violent or sex offenders where necessary.</p>

  <p>The report by the Chief Inspector of Social Work, <i>A Commitment to Protect,</i> contained proposals for more effective practice in the monitoring and the supervision of sex offenders. The recommendations of the report are being taken forward by the Expert Panel on Sex Offending under the Chairmanship of Lady Cosgrove, and have informed the development of social work practice in dealing with sex offenders.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive Social Work Services Inspectorate recently undertook an inspection of the management of sex offender cases by local authorities, which will be published soon. This will contain recommendations about the management of sex offenders.</p>

  <p>Copies of the documents referred to will be placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Household Survey is a continuous survey which started in February 1999 and interviews are being conducted each month. Three quarterly Bulletins have been published to date and the next Bulletin will be published in May 2000. An Annual Report and accompanying Technical Report will be published in August 2000, giving key findings from the survey for larger local authorities and groupings of smaller local authorities. By August 2001, a sufficiently large sample will have been collected and analysed to provide results for all local authorities.</p>

  <p>No. The proposals I announced in the chamber on 27 October 1999 do not entail removing existing permitted development rights, but include a procedure whereby developers will be required to obtain the prior approval of the planning authority before exercising these rights.</p>

  <p>No. The planning system exists to secure the efficient and effective development and use of land in the public interest. Refusal of planning permission or the imposition of conditions on planning permissions can be used to safeguard amenity and the environment. As far as masts are concerned, the present proposals for change will add refusal of prior approval regarding siting and design of permitted development to this list. However, these can all be appealed against and so cannot be interpreted as mechanisms for banning development.</p>

  <p>Planning legislation does not allow local authorities to ban development.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not carry out as a matter of routine national monitoring of reduced speed limits and traffic calming measures implemented by local authorities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is evaluating the effectiveness of the 20mph pilot projects implemented in a number of local authority areas throughout Scotland in 1998. A list of the authorities that have implemented 20mph pilot projects was given in my reply to question S1W-4975. The pilot projects are testing the effectiveness of 20mph schemes which do not include the use of relatively expensive engineering measures to force down the speed of traffic. The results will be available in September and the report will be published as soon as possible thereafter. It will be distributed to all local authorities in Scotland and other interested parties and copies will be placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre.</p>
