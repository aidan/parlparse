  <p>Education authorities have a duty, under the Education (Scotland) Act 1980, to secure adequate and efficient provision of school education for children and young people belonging to their area and this includes provision for special educational needs. School education is progressive education appropriate to the requirements of pupils, regard being had to the age, ability and aptitude of the pupils.</p>

  <p>As part of the normal process of inspection, Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) consider the adequacy of provision for special educational needs, including that for autism. In addition, the Scottish Executive has commissioned HMIE to conduct a specific inspection of educational provision for autism across Scotland. This will take place over 2005-06 with some preliminary work starting later this year. It is a matter for the professional judgement of HMIE to determine how they conduct inspections. Further information on current procedures is available at:</p>

  <p>In 2005-06, the Scottish Executive is piloting a new set of statistics on looked after children (including those receiving respite care) with the aim of introducing these statistics fully in 2006-07. This survey will collect (from each local authority) anonymised statistics for each looked after child and each episode of care they receive. It will record type of disability, from which to quantify the numbers of children with autism who are receiving respite care. When the full detail of what will be collected is agreed, this will be published on the Scottish Executive website.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The World age standardise rate (WASR) is the sum of age-specific rates per 100,000 weighted by the World Standard Population.</p>

  <p>2. Incidence rates are provided for 2001, the most recent year for which cancer registration is considered complete.</p>

  <p>3. Mortality rates are provided for 2003, the most recent year for which death information from General Register Office (Scotland) is available.</p>

  <p>4. Survival estimates are provided for cancer patients diagnosed between 1997 and 2001, at one and five years after diagnosis. While 1998 is the most recent year of diagnosis for which five-year follow-up is complete, patients diagnosed between 1999 and 2001 were followed up to 2003 and their survival experience is included in the analysis.</p>

  <p>5. The differences in the totals in tables (a) and (b) from those presented in parliamentary question. S2W-11029 are due to missing values. Deprivation category is derived from post-code of residence&ndash;for a very small proportion of cancer registration the post-code is not available and therefore the dep. cat. is not known. For a smaller number of registrations the health board of residence is also not known.</p>

  <p>2. Incidence rates are provided for 2001, the most recent year for which cancer registration is considered complete.</p>

  <p>3. Mortality rates are provided for 2003, the most recent year for which death information from General Register Office (Scotland) is available.</p>

  <p>4. Survival estimates are provided for cancer patients diagnosed between 1997 and 2001, at one year and five years after diagnosis. While 1998 is the most recent year of diagnosis for which five-year follow-up is complete, patients diagnosed between 1999 and 2001 were followed up to 2003 and their survival experience is included in the analysis.</p>

  <p>5. The differences in the totals in tables (a) and (b) from those presented inparliamentary question S2W-11028 are due to missing values. Deprivation category is derived from post-code of residence&ndash;for a very small proportion of cancer registration the post-code is not available and therefore the dep. cat. is not known. For a smaller number of registrations the health board of residence is also not known.</p>

  <p>Our national initiative to improve the collection and monitoring of waiting times for drug services in Scotland will, therefore, provide the Executive and Drug Action Teams with details of the number of people who wait for less than one week, less than two weeks, and so on, for up to four different treatment and support interventions.</p>

  <p>The national waiting times information framework for drugs services began in April 2004. The first information output will be available by the end of November 2004.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has introduced six major initiatives since 1999 which improve energy efficiency covering both the domestic and business sectors.</p>

  <p>Central Heating Programme: provides free central heating, insulation, advice and other benefits to householders in the private and social rented sector.</p>

  <p>Warm Deal: provides home insulation grants to low-income households and pensioners.</p>

  <p>Scottish Projects Fund: supports specific projects which address domestic energy efficiency issues, for example, in the private rented sector which are unique to, or particularly important in Scotland, or which have a Scottish dimension.</p>

  <p>Regional Business Manager Network: provides locally based access and support to business and the public sectors on resource efficiency issues.</p>

  <p>Loan Action Scotland: provides interest-free loans to Small- and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) to fund capital investments which improve their energy efficiency.</p>

  <p>Public Sector Energy Efficiency Initiative: a fund available to all Scottish local authorities, health boards and Scottish Water to implement capital investment and other measures which will reduce their carbon emissions and improve their efficiency.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Executive has supported a number of smaller projects such as the Federation of Small Businesses toolkit. It also fully supports UK programmes, for example, by directly funding the Carbon Trust&rsquo;s Energy Efficiency Programme in Scotland. It also takes full advantage of existing UK funding schemes including the Community Energy Programme which supports the introduction of district and community heating schemes.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how it will promote enhanced service levels for lifeline ferry services, in line with its policies on social inclusion and the promotion of public transport, if it accepts the lowest cost bid for services currently run by Caledonian MacBrayne.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2004-11-08.S2W-11390.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80115" speakername="Nicol Stephen" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-04/wa1108.htm#13">

  <p>The Executive is committed to the maintenance of affordable air and sea links to Scotland&rsquo;s islands and remote communities. Tendering will protect the lifeline ferry services in the Clyde and Hebrides by ensuring that they are in line with EC rules and thereby allowing subsidy to continue. The guidance provided by the European Commission in relation to the tendering of Public Service Contracts (PSCs) for ferry services requires that the tender is awarded (except in exceptional and duly justified circumstances) to the bid requiring the lowest financial compensation. However, whilst lowest financial compensation is a key criteria, the services provided must also be of sufficient quality to meet the requirements of the PSC.</p>

  <p>The tender and contractual requirements will ensure that bidders, and the eventual operator, must meet the requirements of a very detailed service specification for the ferry services.</p>

  <p>There have been a number of service enhancements in recent years and the Executive intends to build on the success of the current provision. Bidders for the services will be encouraged to consider the scope for innovation and improvement in services. Further, it is not intended that the services and timetables will be set in stone during the contract period. During this time there will be the opportunity for changes to be approved, provided that the operator has agreed these with the local communities concerned through the consultative mechanism and that the financial consequences are acceptable to the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>As set out in the reply to parliamentary question S1W-27085 answered on 27 June 2002 and in the 2002 consultation paper <em>Proposals for Tendering Clyde &amp; Hebrides Lifeline Ferry Services</em> it is intended that a publicly owned company (VesCo) will be established which will own the CalMac fleet and CalMac&rsquo;s piers and harbours. This approach will ensure efficient use of the existing fleet, offer service reliability and guarantee the long-term availability of vessels and harbour facilities.</p>

  <p>VesCo will also have a role in strategic planning. This will include vessel procurement to meet service delivery needs and the capital investment programme for its piers and harbours.</p>

  <p>You may wish to note that the European Commission published, in December 2003 and January 2004, revised guidance on the interpretation of the Maritime Cabotage Regulation. The guidance now provides that public service contracts may be placed for six years.</p>

  <p>The medical certificate of cause of death completed by doctors in Scotland conforms to World Health (WHO) recommendations. In Part I of the form doctors record up to four causes covering the sequence of conditions that led to death. Other significant conditions contributing to the death, but not related to the disease or conditions causing it, may be recorded in Part II of the form. It is a matter for the doctor&rsquo;s clinical judgement what conditions should be recorded.</p>

  <p>The General Register Officer for Scotland (GROS) codes causes of death recorded by the certifying doctor following the Tenth Revision of WHO&rsquo;s International Statistical Classification of Diseases ad Related Health Problems (ICD10). Currently there is no specific code for MRSA, though there are codes for less specific staphylococcus infections, including staphylococcus aureus. WHO has approved the use of more detailed optional codes to identify antibiotic resistance. These new codes will be introduced from January 2006 and will be used by GROS.</p>

  <p>It is assumed that the question relates to &quot;local child curfew schemes&quot; of the kind which are provided for under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, initially for under those under 10 years and then subsequently by amendment to those under 15. These provisions do not apply to Scotland and there is no separate statutory provision for local child curfew schemes in Scotland.</p>

  <p>In 1997 Strathclyde Police in partnership with South Lanarkshire Council introduced a child safety initiative within Hamilton. This was not a curfew and was developed out of community concerns relating to the safety of young children out unsupervised on the streets at night. The initiative has now been incorporated within the overall community policing strategy for the area. Whilst the Scottish Executive supported the principles underpinning the initiative, it is an operational matter for the individual Chief Constable in association with the local authority to determine whether such measures provide the means to address issues of particular concern in their areas. Information is not held centrally on the use of such initiatives by police forces.</p>

  <p>There are no plans at present to provide information on the performance of consultants. However, the Health Department is about to embark on a stream of work on workforce productivity and this is one of the many issues that will be considered under that agenda.</p>

  <p>Under the new consultant contract which came into effect on 1 April 2004 NHS managers will be able to explicitly and more effectively manage consultant activity in order to secure the capacity they require to improve services to patients. Managers will agree with consultants exactly how they fill their working week with programming of all activities, thus maximising direct clinical care and more transparent flexible working patterns. This will allow the working week and on-call responsibilities to be systematically managed and there will be extended opportunity for patient access (elective services) at evenings and weekends. The new contract should also lead to improved consultant performance measures and benchmarks and clearer rules for managing links to private work.</p>

  <p><a href="/webapp/wa.search" target="_blank">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a>.</p>

  <p>We do not know how many prescription items are not dispensed. If we did, we still would not know how many of those items would attract a charge because patients must endorse the back of the prescription form to make a declaration of exemption, or state that they have paid for their prescription. This is done when the prescription is presented for dispensing.</p>

  <p>Compulsory treatment orders may be made following commencement of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act in April 2005. The majority of patients who become subject to a Compulsory Treatment Order (CTO) will be detained in hospital and will receive their medication free of charge from that hospital. The 2003 act also makes provision that a patient on a CTO may live in the community and we expect a small number of such orders to be made. We estimate that at most 150 patients may be subject to a community based CTO at any time.</p>

  <p>There are no plans at present to exempt from prescription charges patients who receive treatment on the basis of a compulsory treatment order whether in hospital or in the community. However, the Executive&rsquo;s Partnership Agreement review of NHS prescription charges for people with chronic health conditions and young people in full-time education or training is now under way and as part of the review process, we will be consulting widely with patient, interest groups, NHS professionals and other key stakeholders. All the interests and concerns expressed, including those of patients subject to medical treatment under compulsory treatment orders, will be taken into account. The consultation phase of the review will begin in May 2005.</p>

  <p>For the purposes of the independent evaluation submitted to Parliament in September 2001, all persons eligible for criminal legal aid prosecuted in the Edinburgh courts between October 1998 and June 2000, and born in the months of January or February, were directed to use the Public Defence Solicitors&rsquo; Office (PDSO), subject to a system of waivers, primarily relating to clients with current related cases being dealt with by other solicitors. The number of cases taken on for clients directed to the PDSO in Edinburgh in each of the three financial years or part year during which direction operated were 305, 856 and 185 (in 1998-99, 1999-2000 and 2000-01 respectively). No clients have been directed to the PDSO since the system of direction was abolished in July 2000.</p>

  <p>The following table shows the total number of new cases taken on by the PDSO (whether or not under direction) in each year since it opened and the percentage this represents of the total number of acts of criminal legal assistance in each of those years. Criminal legal assistance includes grants of advice and assistance, assistance by way of representation, summary criminal legal aid and solemn legal aid, as well as clients represented by duty solicitors.</p>

  <p>We have made good progress. I am pleased to announce that we will relocate two Scottish Executive functions &ndash; the Crofting Building Grants and Loans Scheme (CBGLS) and the Central Enquiry Unit (CEU).</p>

  <p>The small unit administering the Crofting Building Grants and Loans Scheme will relocate to Tiree next summer. This is a small unit comprising eight full-time jobs. Tiree was chosen after an extensive scrutiny of 34 possible locations which concluded that a move to Tiree would deliver the greatest benefits.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&rsquo;s Central Enquiry Unit will relocate to Kinlochleven, with the move scheduled for the middle of 2005. The Central Enquiry Unit is the Executive&rsquo;s front door. It is the central point of contact for the Executive providing a switchboard service for telephone and e-mail enquiries. The CEU is currently based in Edinburgh and employs 9.5 staff.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to our relocation policy and to ensuring it is a policy for the whole of Scotland. Both these small unit relocations represent a significant step forward in the Executive&rsquo;s programme for moving public sector job opportunities across rural Scotland, and it is expected that these small numbers of additional jobs will make a significant difference to the social and economic conditions of both Tiree and Kinlochleven.</p>

  <p>The Forum for Renewable Energy Development in Scotland has been tasked with preparing proposals for the development of biomass energy in Scotland, with particular reference to the use of wood fuel. The Group is considering both the potential for the sector and the economic and environmental benefits that might accrue. I expect that its report will be published before the end of the year.</p>

  <p>Details of the video news release (VNR) were sent to 759 broadcasters in UK, Europe, Americas, Canada, Middle East, Asia and Australia and 30 copies of the tape were sent out.</p>

  <p>The film is also being sent to Embassies around the world for usage.</p>

  <p>Previous research has highlighted the relatively low level of awareness of modern Scotland amongst overseas media. The VNR is part of a two pronged approach to address this issue by: providing at relatively low cost footage of many aspects of modern Scotland which can be used by media, Scottish Executive and Embassies and; organising a series of targeted press visits for members of key international media &ndash; tailored itineraries to showcase aspects of modern Scotland and secure greater profile &ndash; of the right sort &ndash; in the international media.</p>

  <p>Permission was given by the Press Team at the Parliament for filming both within and outside the Scottish Parliament building. Film of the Parliament accounts for around one minute of the 11 and a half minute running time for the video news release.</p>

  <p>While we are anxious to bring this matter to a conclusion we remain concerned to protect, as far as is reasonable, the position of those, perhaps abroad, who have not yet claimed. &pound;250,000 will therefore be retained to cover later justified claims. This sum will be retained for as long as is reasonable to allow valid claims to be met. No conclusion has yet been reached about what will happen to any unclaimed funds thereafter.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-1153 by Ross Finnie on 4 August 2003, what the results were of Scottish Water&rsquo;s comprehensive evaluation of the impact and scale of leakage on the water network, broken down by area.</p>

  <p>I have asked Jon Hargreaves, Chief Executive of Scottish Water, to reply. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Improving leakage rates on the public water network is a long-term objective of Scottish Water and our evaluation of leakage on the network continues to be ongoing. A large part of Scottish Water&rsquo;s focus to date has been to establish District Metered Areas (DMAs) and during the current investment period (2002-06) DMAs are being set up on 60% of the water network. These DMAs support the development of area-specific leakage strategies, which can involve identifying and fixing leaks as well as installing pressure management systems to reduce the amount of water lost.</p>

  <p>The establishment of DMAs is being prioritised in areas where leakage is high as well as areas known to have a supply-demand deficit. Areas where we are establishing DMAs include Glasgow, Lanarkshire, Ayrshire, Argyll and Bute, Dumfries and Galloway, Inverness, Fife, Dundee, and Edinburgh. New corporate systems are being developed in parallel that will allow cost and leakage performance data to be captured and analysed. For each area this analysis of level of leakage and operational costs enables the determination of the economic level of leakage which will in future be used to prioritise investment in leakage reduction.</p>
