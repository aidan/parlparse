  <p>The Executive issued a consultation paper on a national <i>Plan for Action on Alcohol Misuse</i> to approximately 160 interested organisations and networks in February 2001. The consultation paper gives a full list of those consulted and is held by the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 11112). The Executive also arranged separate consultations with children and young people and alcohol misusers and their families. We expect to publish the <i>Plan for Action </i> by the end of the year.</p>

  <p>We invited comments on the report&#8217;s recommendations when it was published and the consultation period expired on 30 September.</p>

  <p>Initial indications from the consultation are that while the majority of respondents are content that the report of the Scottish Charity Law Review Commission correctly identifies current difficulties in the charitable sector, the solutions it suggests may require some refining before implementation. To do this we need to ensure that the voluntary sector and other key agencies have input to the development of both the policy and the legislation required to take forward the recommendations. We have therefore decided to set up a national advisory forum chaired by a senior official of the Justice Department on the implementation of the review of charity law. This will include representatives of the voluntary sector, key professionals, the existing regulatory bodies and officials. This advisory forum will take an overview of implementation issues and in particular advise us on the interaction between the Social Economy Review and the Charity Law Review. We also hope that it will be able to take on board the outcome of the Cabinet Office&#8217;s Performance and Innovation Unit&#8217;s review of the voluntary sector initiated earlier this year.</p>

  <p>The advisory forum will have three sub-groups, consisting partly of key members of the groups itself, and partly of additional members having expertise in specific areas. These sub-groups will concentrate on the three areas of implementation &#8211; the definition of &quot;charity&quot;; the role and functions of CharityScotland; and the regulation of public charitable collections. The composition of the main group and of the three sub-groups will be announced in November.</p>

  <p>We expect to publish a full response to the consultation once the advisory forum has completed its deliberations.</p>

  <p>The Action Plan for Dental Services, which was launched in August 2000, included a number of initiatives aimed at improving children&#8217;s oral health. As well as a range of initiatives affecting pre-school children, the caries prevention scheme, aimed at young children, and including the fissure sealing of permanent molars, will be launched shortly. The new caries prevention scheme should in due course have a direct impact on dental disease in 12-year-olds by protecting the most vulnerable teeth in the most vulnerable children before the disease begins.</p>

  <p>The content of the undergraduate medical curriculum is a matter for the General Medical Council (GMC), which is a body independent of government. Currently the GMC recommends that each university cover a core curriculum, encompassing the essential knowledge and skills and the appropriate attitudes to be acquired by the time of graduation. In addition, the core curriculum should be augmented by a series of special study modules, which allow students to study areas of particular interest. While it will not be possible or appropriate for all medical schools to provide training in rural health, it is already open to students and schools to access and provide this training on an individual basis.</p>

  <p>The GMC is reviewing its recommendations regarding undergraduate medical education at present and the Chief Medical Officer for Scotland represents the Scottish Executive&#8217;s interests.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Executive is working with a range of organisations, including the Remote and Rural Areas Resource Initiative (RARARI), to develop measures to support and improve health care in rural areas. This includes RARARI&#8217;s exploration of the scope for developing a multi-professional Faculty of Rural Health Care.</p>

  <p>As announced in the White Paper <i>Smoking Kills</i> , the Executive is providing &#163;8 million over three years for smoking cessation and prevention activities. This supports a range of initiatives including health board cessation services. Other Executive initiatives prior to July 2001 included the launch of the Voluntary Charter on Smoking in Public Places, a review by the Lord Advocate of guidance on the use of children in test purchasing exercises, and support of pilot youth card schemes in Glasgow and Angus. Delivery of health education and promotion activities through Health Education Board for Scotland (HEBS) includes mass media advertising &#8211; for example the successful Blue sticks and Stinx campaigns and Smokeline.</p>

  <p>We have also made NRT and Zyban available on prescription and targeted a proportion of the Health Improvement Fund to enable a stepping up of smoking cessation and prevention activities.</p>

  <p>1 August 2001 onwards:</p>

  <p>The Executive will continue to provide funding support for smoking cessation services and to HEBS for health education and promotion activities. Specific measures include the recently launched anti-smoking advertising campaign (Alien) targeted at young people, and further development of Smokeline to provide services to pregnant smokers and ethnic minority groups. A smoking cessation resource pack for health professionals, the development of health education and smoking cessation services for school-age children and a campaign to raise awareness of the risks of passive smoking are also in preparation. We will also continue to look at ways to improve enforcement of underage sales of tobacco. We will continue to support the activities of ASH Scotland. The Executive will continue to press the UK Government for the early reintroduction of a UK Bill to ban tobacco advertising and promotion.</p>

  <p>There is a wide variety of training available for qualified teachers, ranging from university courses such as the Post-graduate diploma in Special Educational Needs (SEN) and the Post-graduate certificate in Specific Learning Difficulties (Dyslexia) to courses/conferences/seminars run by local authorities, colleges and voluntary agencies in language and communication, moving and handling and Individualised Educational Programmes.</p>

  <p>Before qualifying, components within the core of courses of initial teacher education (ITE) consist, where appropriate, of inter-related units in special educational needs. Guidelines for initial teacher education in Scotland require teacher education institutions (TEIs) to prepare prospective teachers to be responsive to the needs of all pupils in respect of SEN. In line with the guidelines, teaching pupils with SEN is also an option for specialist study within Bachelor of Education primary courses.</p>

  <p>The Report of the First Stage of the Review of ITE made two recommendations on special educational needs, these being;</p>

  <p>Students should be provided by their overall ITE programmes with clear models of best practice in collaborative approaches which can benefit children with SEN, and which can support classroom teachers in a better understanding of their own role, and</p>

  <p>TEIs should offer visits to schools specifically to enrich the ITE experience of SEN (given the variability of placement experience) subject to appropriate safeguards for the dignity of the children involved.</p>

  <p>The consultation on the report recently ended and responses are currently being analysed. An Action Plan to implement the work on this report will follow shortly and a copy of this will be placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre.</p>

Scottish ministers are committed to taking forward entitlement to language learning for all children and young people. Whether or not particular pupils with special educational needs study foreign languages is a matter for the pupils, parents and school to consider.</p>

  <p>The normal expectation would be that the chairperson would be absent from board meetings only in exceptional circumstances.</p>

  <p>The Water Industry (Scotland) Bill proposes a power for Scottish ministers to remove a non-executive member of the board, if that member has been absent from meetings of Scottish Water for a period longer than three months without the permission of Scottish Water.</p>

  <p>As far as other meetings and official engagements are concerned, it will be a key role of the chairperson to keep in regular contact with stakeholders, and to play a representative role for Scottish Water throughout Scotland.</p>

  <p>No appointment can be made until Parliament has approved the Water Industry (Scotland) Bill. As announced on 8 August, ministers intend that the initial appointment should be remunerated at a daily rate of &#163;385, for three days a week in the first year, and for two days a week in the subsequent two years. There will also be pension entitlement equivalent to that currently available to existing water authority chairs.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer given to question S1W-17768, in which I made clear that the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments gave prior approval to a closed competition for the prospective chairmanship of Scottish Water. There were, therefore, no advertisements for the post.</p>
