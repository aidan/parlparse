  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has had any contact with community radio stations such as Lochbroom FM, Oban FM, Argyll FM, Caithness FM, Nevis Radio, Speysound Community Radio, Isles FM, Ross FM, Two Lochs Radio, Cuillin FM and Ness Community Radio and whether it has any concerns that the existence of any of these community radio stations could be jeopardised by the impact of charges made by Phonographic Performance Limited (PPL) and the Performing Right Society (PRS).</p>

  <p>Broadcasting is a reserved matter and is the responsibility of the Department for Media, Culture and Sport (DCMS).</p>

  <p>The Phonographic Performance Ltd (PPL) is a not for profit organisation that issues licences to play music in public places and collects royalties for the recording companies and performers for their rights in the sound recording. A PPL licence is therefore required when a radio station plays music or other sound recordings. The Performing Rights Society (PRS) issues licenses and collects royalties for composers and publishers.</p>

  <p>Any concerns about the impact of charges by these organisations should be raised with the independent regulator for the UK communications industries, Ofcom, through its website at <a href="http://www.ofcom.org.uk" target="_blank">www.ofcom.org.uk</a> or by writing to Ofcom, Riverside House, 2a Southwark Bridge Road, London, SE1 9HA.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Qualifications Authority and Learning and Teaching Scotland have distinctly different roles to perform but collaborate closely on key issues and increasingly share services through the co-location of their offices in Glasgow. Ministers have no plans to merge the two bodies.</p>

  <p>However, the identity of the driver requires to be corroborated (unless the accused has submitted a signed statement admitting that he or she was driving the vehicle at the relevant place and time).</p>
