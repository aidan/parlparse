  <p>On average we have increased the allocations to NHS boards by 7.8% for 2003-04. From this increase NHS boards have set aside around &pound;12 million to address specific winter issues, supported by the &pound;11 million spent by the Executive on the flu vaccination programme.</p>

  <p>There were a number of reasons for delaying the implementation of the EU Animal By-Products Regulation in Scotland until 1 October 2003. First of all the Scottish Parliament election meant that a consultation exercise could not be conducted during the purdah period. Secondly, I thought it prudent to delay implementation given that discussions within the EU on transitional measures for the regulation were not concluded until the late spring. Finally, I also wished to seek, and consider in detail, the views of stakeholders on the definition of the remote area derogation for the burial of fallen stock.</p>

  <p>As provided for under the Scottish Parliamentary Standards Commissioner Act 2002, the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB) has approved the Commissioner having a contract with Anderson Strathern to provide independent legal advice to him in his capacity as Parliamentary Standards Commissioner. It is not possible to provide the number of full-time equivalent legal advisers as this will depend on the number of issues the Commissioner seeks legal advice on. All costs for legal support will be met from the Commissioner's existing budget, and the contract has been let on a short-term basis to allow the Commissioner and SPCB to consider the usage of such advice and possible future options.</p>
