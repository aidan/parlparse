  <p>The centre incorporates the Safe and Healthy Working services which offers free, confidential advice on occupational health and safety to small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>

  <p>The centre also runs the Scotland&rsquo;s Health at Work Award Scheme which encourages employers to adopt policies aimed at protecting and improving the health and wellbeing of their employees.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-25442 by Lewis Macdonald on 8 May 2006, in what way the research strategy implemented by the Medical Research Council (MRC) in 2003 &quot;encourages&quot; a programme of specifically clinical research into the link between bowel disease and autism and what evidence of success can be demonstrated in this regard and, given that the MRC and Chief Scientist Office do not operate by commissioning research to address specific questions, what strategy the Executive has in place to encourage research into novel and innovative approaches to neurological problems in children that have been regarded as solely genetic in origin but may be caused by environmental factors such as heavy metal toxicity.</p>

  <p>In 2002-03, the Medical Research Council (MRC) hosted four research forums in order to stimulate discussion across all aspects of autism. One of those forums was specifically on gut function in children with autism spectrum disorders. Following those meetings, researchers were given advice on how to submit their research proposals to the MRC. As indicated in my answer to question S2W-25442, the MRC received only a few applications on bowel disease and autism and none were deemed of sufficient quality to receive funding. However, since 2003, the MRC has funded 12 research projects on autism covering a diverse range of projects. This represents a total commitment by the MRC of &pound;3.1 million to autism research as a direct result of the MRC&rsquo;s research strategy.</p>

  <p>The Chief Scientist Office (CSO) encourages research proposals to be submitted across a wide spectrum of health and healthcare issues. This role is well known and advertised throughout the healthcare and academic community. CSO would welcome research proposals on neurological problems in children which would be subject to the usual peer and committee review.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of significant evidence from the parents of autistic children and documented evidence in peer-reviewed and published literature that painful bowel problems are a feature of such children&rsquo;s condition and in light of any reluctance by paediatric gastroenterologists to examine these children, what immediate steps will be taken to set up an autism-specific gastrointestinal unit in a hospital to treat autistic children suffering from pain.</p>

  <p>Any child with a painful bowel problem would be referred to and seen by a Paediatrician or Paediatric Gastroenterologist regardless of whether or not they are autistic. There is no reason for separating autistic children from other children in this context.</p>

  <p>Chapter 7 of the <em>Review of Urban Gulls and their Management in Scotland</em> outlines the wide range of powers available to local authorities to deal with the various problems caused by urban gulls. Chapter 8 provides best practice recommendations, including guidance on various mitigation techniques.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive on how many occasions the Crofters Commission has used each of its enforcement powers in each of the last 10 years.</p>

  <p>The commission&rsquo;s powers of enforcement are contained in various sections of the Crofters (Scotland) Act 1993.</p>

  <p>There has been extensive use of the absentee powers and this information is reported in detail in the Crofters Commission&rsquo;s annual reports. The forcing of re-letting has been used extensively, often in conjunction with absentee action.</p>

  <p>The following table shows the number of:</p>

  <p>(1) crofts declared vacant by the commission &ndash; mostly through unresolved successions.</p>

  <p>(2) where the commission has instigated reletting action of the croft at its own hand following issue of a section 23 notice (action taken against owner-occupier absentees) seeking suitable reletting proposals. Since the absentee initiative started in 1997 the commission has issued a total of 44 such notices - 41 of which resulted in suitable reletting proposals and the three in the table where the Commission took the initiative to relet the crofts.</p>

  <p>(3) the absentee section 22 cases (action taken against absentee tenants) where the Commission terminated someone&rsquo;s tenancy.</p>

  <p>In addition, when the Crofters Commission carried out a Register Review exercise in the mid 90s it reminded landlords of their obligations in terms of section 40 (obligation of landlords to provide information) of the act. Last year the commission issued a formal notice on this basis to a landlord in Shetland.</p>

  <p>It is important to point out that contrary to popular misconception the Crofters Commission has no powers to tackle neglect or abuse of croft land. These powers rest with landlords.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The number of non-salaried and salaried NHS general dental service principals who terminated all list numbers in one NHS board area in the period 17 March 2005 to 31 March 2006.</p>

  <p>2. Some NHS general dental service principals may have terminated all list numbers in one NHS board area, but still provide NHS services elsewhere in Scotland.</p>

  <p>3. NHS general dental service principals may cease providing NHS services on a temporary basis.</p>

  <p>4. NHS general dental practitioners (GDPs) enter into an arrangement with their local NHS board. A GDP may have more than one arrangement with an NHS board if he/she has more than one practice, and an arrangement with more than one NHS board if he/she practises in more than one NHS board area.

  <p>Source: MIDAS (Management Information and Dental Accounting System). Data extracted on 26 May 2006.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The number of non-salaried and salaried NHS general dental service principals who were not active at any point in the year prior to 17 March 2005 in one NHS board area and who opened at least one list number in the corresponding NHS board in the period 17 March 2005 to 31 March 2006.</p>

  <p>2. Some NHS general dental service principals may have been providing NHS services in another NHS board area in the year prior to 17 March 2005.</p>

  <p>3. NHS general dental service principals may cease providing NHS services on a temporary basis.</p>

  <p>4. NHS general dental practitioners (GDPs) enter into an arrangement with their local NHS board. A GDP may have more than one arrangement with an NHS board if he/she has more than one practice, and an arrangement with more than one NHS board if he/she practises in more than one NHS board area. As a result, the sum of the number of dentists in each NHS board area exceeds the number of dentists practising in Scotland.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether, given that area management agreements (AMAs) are voluntary and their details are a matter for partners to tailor to their circumstances, the condition that an effective, integrated AMA should be in place is a sufficiently robust condition to impose in an assessment of a fish farm licence.</p>

  <p>The assessment of a fish farm license requires both a technical assessment and a decision making process. The decision making process has to be able to take account of stakeholder views and as such if the public raise issues related to area management agreements etc. then they can be taken into account.</p>

  <p>The potential for farmed cod to host the sea lice caligus elongatus and the impact this type of sea lice would have on Atlantic salmon was addressed in a 2005 report by the Fisheries Research Services. It was concluded that this strain of sea lice posed only a minor risk to farmed Atlantic salmon. Possible implications for wild stocks were not addressed, but it is reasonable to assume that these would be no greater than for farmed stock.</p>

  <p>The Regulatory Impact Assessment to accompany the Registration of Fish Sellers and Buyers and Designation of Auction Sites (Scotland) Regulations 2005 was sent to fishing industry representatives for comment during the consultation process rather than individual hoteliers and restaurateurs. However, during the summer of 2005 we placed adverts in the hospitality trade press to publicise the scheme and requested the assistance of the British Hospitality Association and VisitScotland to contact their members. Furthermore, we wrote to trade organisations on the recommendation of VisitScotland to publicise the scheme.</p>

  <p>In the Regulatory Impact Assessment which accompanied the Registration of Fish Sellers and Buyers and Designation of Auction Sites (Scotland) Regulations 2005 the Scottish Executive estimated that during 2004 there were in excess of 70,000 landings in Scotland and 20,000 were by under 10m vessels. All businesses affected by the scheme already made some resource available to collate landing information with a view to providing it to the fishermen who supply them. However, we were aware that the greatest scale of regime change would be in the sector which buys directly from vessels and we therefore provided them with additional time to make any necessary changes before they were obliged to submit sales notes. We have also provided sales notes and templates for use by businesses as well as developing an online sales note. It was on this basis that the costs to businesses were estimated to be minimal.</p>

  <p>The &quot;ringfenced&quot; Homelessness Task Force funding allocated to local authorities to tackle homelessness in their areas must be spent on the implementation of homelessness strategies, in a way which is consistent with the achievement of the recommendations of the Homelessness Task Force. The funding is subject to a set of standard terms and conditions as set out in the offer of grant letters which local authorities receive.</p>

  <p>Local authorities also receive funding which was originally associated with the Rough Sleepers Initiative, and a general homelessness allocation. These, like the Homelessness Task Force funding, are provided for the implementation of homelessness strategies. However, while badged for this purpose, these two lines are now distributed via the Revenue Support Grant which local authorities receive automatically on a weekly basis. As such they are unhypothecated, and local authorities are not obliged to spend these monies on homelessness activity.</p>

  <p>Other than the limited access junction at Dalshannon (Condorrat), which would be closed on safety grounds all existing accesses would be maintained or improved.

  <p>In presenting <em>The Scottish Fingerprint Service Action Plan for Excellence</em> to the Justice 1 Committee on 26 April 2006, Deputy Chief Constable Mulhern described the fingerprint service as &quot;a collective of people who are very keen to act corporately to take the service forward&quot;. The Plan, alongside the work that has already been undertaken and referred to in the answer to question S2W-23158 on 17 February 2006, is intended to command the confidence of the criminal justice system and the wider public in the fingerprint evidence presented to Scottish courts. Copies of the plan have been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 39556).</p>
