  <p>The importance of exports to the Scottish livestock industry and especially to sheep producers in the remoter areas is recognised fully by the Executive. Mr Finnie will be discussing with other UK Agriculture Ministers how best to put a case to the European Union aimed at reopening the export market.

  <p>This is a matter for local authorities in Scotland.

  <p>The serving of enforcement and improvement notices is one of a range of options available to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) to deal with contravention of licences it has issued. If operators fail to comply with the terms of such notices, further sanctions available to SEPA can include variation or revocation of the relevant licences, and reporting the case to the Procurator Fiscal. The choice of the most appropriate option in individual cases is an operational matter for SEPA.</p>

  <p>The foot-and-mouth disease situation in Scotland continues to improve. There have been no new cases of the disease in Scotland since 30 May, when the number of confirmed cases was 187. To prevent any further cases from occurring, I urge farmers and people who visit livestock farming areas to continue to maintain their vigilance against the disease, especially in relation to biosecurity, cleansing and disinfection and other disease safeguards. In partnership with farmers, local authorities, the army and others, the Scottish Executive and the State Veterinary Service remain prepared to deal swiftly with any further outbreaks of the disease should they occur.</p>

  <p>A wide range of measures has been introduced over the last month to assist livestock farmers to resume some of their normal activities, including shrinking of the Infected Area, further relaxations to the restrictions on animal movements, new arrangements for sheep shearing and dipping, and programmes of serological testing of sheep and cleansing and disinfection of affected farms. Subject to the disease situation remaining stable in Scotland and taking into account veterinary advice, we will continue to relax animal movement controls and other restrictions over the coming weeks.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to be able to announce today some further relaxations to the disease control arrangements which we intend to make over the next few weeks. The Infected Areas of Dumfries and Galloway and the Scottish Borders are being progressively shrunk as quickly as possible and with no further outbreaks of the disease we would expect to move virtually all of the remaining Infected Areas to At Risk status within the next month.</p>

  <p>Serological testing of sheep from the At Risk Areas is now nearly complete and all of the results from the Galashiels Division are negative. Provided the remaining test results from the Ayr Division are also negative and there are no adverse developments in the disease situation, I intend to move the Provisionally Free Area line southwards to the borders of Dumfries and Galloway and the Borders Administrative Regions to take in administrative areas which have never had any cases of foot-and-mouth disease. I hope to be able to do this in early July. When this happens, I will ensure that satisfactory arrangements are in place to continue to allow cattle from the Infected Area to be slaughtered elsewhere in Scotland. My aim thereafter will be to move the remaining parts of Scotland as quickly as possible to PFA status.</p>

  <p>Since the beginning of June movements of cattle only<strong> </strong>direct to slaughter<strong> </strong>from the Infected Area have been permitted under license and subject to strictly controlled conditions. SEERAD staff are monitoring these operations to ensure compliance with the conditions. During the course of June we have also announced further relaxations to the restrictions on animal movements, particularly in relation to pigs, and the remaining restrictions will be relaxed progressively as the disease situation improves, but we will not take unnecessary risks. As part of this process, we are also considering what steps could be taken to allow some controlled market transactions in livestock to resume in the autumn in recognition of the importance of breeding sales and stock markets. However, because of the disease risks associated with stock from around the country mingling together and then dispersing, we cannot run the risk of allowing an immediate resumption of markets.</p>

  <p>An important step in moving towards securing disease free status is to carry out extensive blood testing of sheep flocks throughout Scotland. In the Provisionally Free Area blood samples have been collected from 112 flocks and, as at 26 June, confirmed negative results have been received from 108 flocks, with only four results still awaited. In the At Risk Area, samples from approximately 120 flocks around three Dangerous Contact premises in Ayr Division and five in the Galashiels Division have been sent to the new laboratory facilities at CAMR Porton Down. As mentioned above, negative results have so far been logged from all of the samples from the Galashiels Division; the results from the Ayr Division are still awaited. The sampling schedule for the 3-10 km ring around the envelope of Infected Premises in the Infected Area is currently being developed. I am pleased to announce today that the Scottish Executive has agreed in principle with our counterparts in Northern Ireland that we can make use of their testing facilities which we hope will substantially speed up the time it takes to complete the necessary blood testing.</p>

  <p>Sheep shearing and dipping can present a significant risk of transmitting foot-and-mouth disease but, for animal welfare reasons, both operations need to be allowed to go ahead. The risk of disease transmission from a high to a low risk area is increased if those involved in shearing and dipping operate in different risk areas. Therefore, the Scottish Executive has introduced licensing schemes which will control the movement of shearers and dippers from Infected to Non-Infected Areas. This will greatly reduce the risk of transmitting foot-and-mouth disease.</p>

  <p>A major exercise is underway to cleanse and disinfect all of the farms which have been affected by the disease. Over 1,200 premises have been identified as requiring cleansing and disinfection; over half of these require full cleansing and disinfection in addition to preliminary procedures. In well over half of the total number of premises cleansing and disinfection has been completed and it is in progress on the vast majority of the remaining premises. Work has not yet started on only a handful of premises, usually because the poor physical condition of buildings on those premise raise specific technical difficulties in carrying out cleansing and disinfection to the required rigorous standards. Over 400 farmers are currently performing cleansing and disinfection work on their own or other farms. Any assistance which they require in doing this work is being provided by the cleansing staff of Dumfries and Galloway Council or by contractors.</p>

  <p>Many farmers are now considering when and how to restock their farms and it is essential that this is undertaken according to very detailed criteria. An Information Note setting out the options available to farmers and detailing the steps which they must take has now been prepared and is being issued to all farmers who have lost stock during the cull. Further information can be obtained by contacting the foot-and-mouth disease centres at the Galashiels or Ayr Animal Health Offices.</p>

  <p>An increasing number of routine farm inspections by SEERAD Agricultural Staff are also now being made, subject to suitable precautions.</p>

  <p>There is now a presumption in favour of public access to the countryside in both the Provisionally Free Area and At Risk Area. Local authorities are required to notify Scottish ministers of all official closures &#8211; those that have been approved both by the relevant local authority and the Divisional Veterinary Manager. From Friday 29 June, all official closures will be published on the Scottish Executive website (www.scotland.gov.uk) - with the exception of the Borders and Dumfries and Galloway, where the more complex and rapidly changing situation means that it is more practical for those two local authorities to provide information on their own websites. Only sites listed on the Scottish Executive website have force in law.</p>

  <p>Further information concerning the number and type of animals slaughtered as part of the cull and under the welfare disposal scheme, the number of animal movement licences issued and a range of other recent developments relating to the disease is contained in the various information notes which are lodged on a regular basis in SPICe and posted on the foot-and-mouth disease section of the Scottish Executive website. These information notes will continue to be updated during the summer recess, at intervals appropriate to the rate of change in the disease situation and I encourage members to make use of these sources of information.</p>

  <p>Following a commitment in <i>Our National Health</i> , the Chief Medical Officer has asked Professor David Lawson to lead work with the Health Technology Board for Scotland and with local area drug and therapeutic committees on removing inequities in prescribing practice across Scotland. As a result of this, a seminar was held on 16 May at which the concept of a Scotland-wide consortium of Area Drug and Therapeutic Committees - a Scottish Medicines Consortium - was launched. This would provide a single source of Scottish advice to clinicians as close to the time of marketing of a new drug as possible. The Health Technology Board for Scotland has agreed to provide administrative and methodological support to the consortium. Discussions are ongoing with local area drug and therapeutic committees and health boards across Scotland and it is hoped that the consortium could begin operating in the autumn.</p>

  <p>Eligible businesses are those with fish or shellfish sites registered prior to the outbreak of infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) under the Registration of Fish Farming and Shellfish Farming Business Order 1985, which have been affected by ISA whether through confirmation or suspicion of ISA in the stocks of the applicant business, or through movement restrictions.</p>

  <p>The New Deal for Disabled People will be extended nationally from July 2001 to all people claiming incapacity benefits which will offer new opportunities for people with mental health problems.</p>

The UK Government has asked the Disability Rights Commission to look at the Disability Discrimination Act&#8217;s coverage of people with mental health problems and will consider carefully any recommendations for legislative change that the commission makes.</p>

  <p>The UK Government has announced its intention to end in 2004 the exemption of small firms from the Disability Discrimination Act employment provisions and, when legislative time allows, the exemption of many occupations and types of employment. This will ensure that employees or job applicants in those areas who are disabled with mental health problems are protected from discrimination.</p>

  <p>Our objective for every discharge or transfer from hospital care is for the continuing care arrangements to fit the assessed needs of the individual. This is particularly true for those with a mental illness where needs can be complex and require co-operation and planning among a number of agencies. The aim always is to provide care, support and in some cases accommodation that matches needs and is both sustainable and responsive to changing needs.</p>

The objective is to ensure that properly designed and managed packages of health and social care are arranged for such people in appropriate accommodation in the community. No-one is included in the CPA without the agreement of a consultant psychiatrist and informed consent is sought wherever possible.</p>

  <p>Yes. A number of amendments were made to other enactments at Stage 2 of the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Bill, including an amendment to the Finance Act 2000. That amendment relates to a reserved matter and is therefore outwith the Parliament&#8217;s legislative competence. The Secretary of State for Scotland and I have accordingly agreed that this should be rectified by means of an Order which will be made by the Secretary of State under section 107 of the Scotland Act.

  <p>It is clear that, whilst obstacles in excess of 100 m in height, unlit by night and with the ability to cause interference to radar, are potentially of concern to the Ministry of Defence, each case will be considered on its merits. These matters should be resolved during the planning process.</p>

  <p>Some care home fees are being refunded because of a legal technicality in the Registered Establishments (Scotland) Act 1987 which was addressed by the 1998 Act of the same name. Only those establishments not providing substantial services to local authorities are entitled to a refund. Following legal advice, the Scottish Executive decided that 15% was a reasonable proportion of the business of an establishment to determine whether it was providing substantial services to authorities. As the legal technicality was closed by the 1998 Act there is no need for such a provision in the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Bill.</p>

  <p>Any transport authority seeking funding from the Scottish Executive for public transport schemes would need to demonstrate that such schemes contribute towards the objectives of its Local Transport Strategy. Projects would be expected to satisfy the five criteria for assessment of transport investment: value for money, integration, safety, environmental impact and accessibility. Projects which are awarded funding are required to submit regularly action plans and profiles of expenditure. It remains open to ministers to impose any additional conditions upon funding awards in the light of particular circumstances.</p>
