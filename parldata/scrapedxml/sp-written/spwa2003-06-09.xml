  <p>The information requested is not held centrally. However, numbers will have reduced since the introduction in July 2002 of free personal and nursing care, and new rules that allow residents to request a deferred payment agreement with their local authority, to avoid the need for their home to be sold in their lifetime.</p>

  <p>It is for local authorities to decide on how they provide day care services for individuals, in consultation with the users of those services and their carers. While day care centres may be one form of appropriate provision, service users are entitled to choice and services tailored to their needs. Achieving this can result in a move away from the provision of fixed services in day care centres and it would therefore be a retrograde step to consider statutory provision for funding of a form of day care which may not be every user's choice.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how much funding has been allocated to tackling drug misuse for each of the last four years, broken down into (a) enforcement and (b) treatment.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2003-06-09.S2W-415.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80018" speakername="Malcolm Chisholm" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-03/wa0609.htm#3">

  <p>Expenditure on tackling drug misuse comes from a wide range of specific and mainstream programmes, which are administered at national and local levels. It is, therefore, extremely difficult to provide comprehensive and robust aggregate figures. In addition, definitions can vary of activities that could be included under the broad headings of enforcement and treatment.</p>

  <p>However, a study undertaken by the Executive's Policy Unit at the end of 1999 estimated that annual expenditure on activities linked to enforcement amounted to &#163;65 million. The estimate for activities linked to treatment was &#163;54 million per annum. These sums are based on expenditure from specific and mainstream programmes supported by, for example, police forces, NHS boards, local authorities and prison services.</p>

  <p>Subsequent to the Policy Unit Study, the Executive allocated an additional &#163;128 million over three years to support delivery of Scotland's drugs strategy. The following table sets out the elements of this funding which are broadly comparable to the categories included in the Policy Unit Study:</p>

  <p>I understand that this question arises from concerns that landfill sites in the Fauldhouse area might adversely affect the health of the local communities. Research aimed specifically at identifying landfill-related public health effects has provided no compelling evidence that such a link exists.</p>

  <p>Additionally, in March 2003, the Information and Statistics Division (ISD) of the Common Services Agency responded to an enquiry from a research specialist at the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre on cancer incidence in this area. The ISD compared incidence rates for various cancers in Fauldhouse with those in Lothian and in the whole of Scotland and found no significant differences.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the Scottish Executive has no plans to extend the comprehensive health surveillance systems that currently operate in Scotland to provide a more detailed analysis for this specific locality.</p>

  <p>Foetal anti-convulsant syndrome describes the range of congenital abnormalities that can occur in children born to mothers taking anti-convulsant medication to control epilepsy during pregnancy. The syndrome is associated with a wide range of conditions and problems, including minor birth defects and physical and learning disabilities. The pattern of impairment also varies widely. Therefore, Executive policy on services for children with disabilities, or other needs for additional support for learning will apply to children affected by foetal anti-convulsant syndrome.</p>

  <p>These include our plans to introduce through legislation a new framework for meeting children's needs for additional support for learning, and our Integrated Strategy for the Early Years to improve the health and well-being of young children (aged 0 to five), recently published for consultation.</p>

  <p>Maintenance obligations relating to a property and any common ground in which it has a share are set out as title conditions in the relevant title deeds. These conditions form part of the agreement of sale of the property. Under current arrangements an agent acting on behalf of the purchaser will demand to have sight of deeds containing conditions of tenure as part of the process of concluding missives. This usually takes place after the purchaser has made an offer to buy the property.</p>

  <p>Solicitors and other purchasing agents should draw to the attention of their clients the obligations to which they will become subject when they purchase a house. Obligations for the maintenance of common ground should therefore be brought to the attention of a prospective purchaser prior to the conclusion of the sale of a property as part of the existing process of house purchase.</p>

  <p>The Housing Improvement Task Force which reported in March 2003 has recommended that sellers of residential properties should provide a &quot;Purchaser&rsquo;s Information Pack&quot; when the property is put on the market. The pack would contain standard documents and information including a statement of the obligations attaching to a property. The intention behind the recommendation is that prospective purchasers should be informed of any common property obligations before they make an offer to purchase. The Executive is consulting on the recommendations of the Housing Improvement Task Force and will come to a view on what action it should take later in the year.</p>

  <p>At present there are no obligations on developers to provide information to prospective purchasers on any planning conditions attached to the house.

  <p>Agents will at present ask to see copies of planning consents and building warrants relevant to work carried out on the property which is being offered for sale.

  <p>At present there is no legal obligation on developers to provide information to prospective purchasers on the arrangements for the maintenance of common ground and the adoption of roads.

It is up to the buyer (with the assistance of their agent, usually a solicitor) to satisfy themselves as to the suitability of the property they are buying.</p>

  <p>The arrangements for the maintenance of common ground and obligations on owners are usually set out as title conditions in relevant title deeds which should be brought to the attention of prospective buyers by their agents before missives are concluded. In the case of roads, the title deeds will usually provide for their upkeep and maintenance until such time as the roads are adopted by the local authority if that is the intention. If there is no undertaking or intention that the roads should be adopted by the local authority then the purchaser&rsquo;s agent should draw this to the attention of the prospective purchaser.</p>

  <p>The Housing Improvement Task Force, which reported in March 2003, raised a number of concerns about the sales contracts used by some developers. In particular, the task force noted evidence from the Law Society&rsquo;s Conveyancing Committee that deeds of conditions including important conditions relating to common maintenance obligations are not always prepared at the point of conclusion of missives and there is a concern that purchasers do not have all the information that should be available to them at the point of purchase.

  <p>As I announced on 7 November 2002, funding for improvement of housing conditions in the private sector is being transferred from local authorities&rsquo; general borrowing to a specific private sector housing grant. &#163;50 million is available in the current financial year, and &#163;60 million in each of the next two years. This compares to reported expenditure, funded through the single capital allocation by local authorities on equivalent activities of approximately &#163;45 million in 2000-01, the last year for which figures are available.

It also has a programme of Continuing Professional Development for its members.</p>

  <p>The Executive consulted extensively on diligence reform last year. This consultation included proposals for restructuring the oversight of standards of practice, training and continuing professional development programmes for sheriff officers. In this parliamentary year we will consult on and bring forward proposals for reform to the law on the enforcement of civil obligations in Scotland.</p>

  <p>In the answer given to question S1W-24583 on 28 March 2002, I undertook to continue to report quarterly on the numbers of letters received by ministers and our performance in answering them.</p>

  <p>In the quarter January to March 2003, 3,831 letters were received for ministerial reply of which 82% received a reply within 17 working days, slightly exceeding our published target of 80%; and 93% received a reply within 25 working days. This performance has improved against the targets compared to that in the fourth quarter of 2002 when 74% of letters received a reply within 17 working days and 91% received a reply within 25 working days.</p>

  <p>The timing of any submission of a planning application to the Scottish ministers is for the relevant local authority. Any submission during an election period would be handled in accordance with the election guidance for Scottish Executive staff. The guidance makes clear that ministers should only be invited to take decisions on issues during an election period where it is absolutely essential. Consequently, ministers were not asked to decide on any planning applications during April although officials continued to deal with certain routine cases under delegated authority.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to achieving sustainable economic development based upon the strategic priorities contained in <em>A Smart, Successful Scotland. </em> This includes raising the employment rate across Scotland and reducing gaps in unemployment rates between areas.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to the dispersal of public sector jobs through its relocation policy. Our policy covers all of Scotland and opportunities are considered on a case-by-case basis. Potential locations in West Lothian can be considered along with others from around the country.</p>

  <p>There is no statutory requirement for local consultation to determine the frequency and location of bus services. The provision of local bus services is generally a matter for individual bus operators who use their own commercial judgement as to the level and frequency of services to be provided. Beyond the commercial decisions of bus operators, it is the responsibility of the local transport authority to identify where there is a social need for a particular bus service and to make subsidy available, if it so chooses, so that appropriate additional services are provided.</p>

The latest of these is the report written by Ms Anne Black, which was received by the Executive on 29 May 2003. I have asked the Chief Social Work Inspector to examine the documents and report back to me.</p>

  <p>Local authorities receive a block allocation for a range of services, including transport. It is for each local authority to decide spending priorities on road safety, including the introduction of 20 mph speed limits around schools, based on local needs. The block allocation for this and the next two years includes additional funding of &#163;180 million for local quality of life priorities. A number of councils are using part of their allocations from these quality of life funds on road safety measures. The Scottish Executive also provides resources to local authorities, currently &#163;8 million per annum, for Cycling, Walking and Safer Streets projects. These resources, which are in addition to their block allocation, can be used for a range of measures including 20 mph speed limits around schools.</p>

  <p>Guidance on consultation about proposed 20 mph speed limits is contained in Scottish Executive Development Department Circular No.6/2001, copies of which are available in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 17781).</p>

  <p>Under the mortgage-style student loan system introduced in 1990, loans are repaid over a fixed period of five or seven years and will be written off when the borrower reaches 60 years old (or 50 if they received their last loan before they were 40 and the loan has been outstanding for at least 25 years).</p>

  <p>Under the current Income Contingent Repayment scheme introduced in 1998-99, student loans are repayable at a fixed rate on the marginal income above the threshold of &#163;10,000 and will be written off when the borrower is 65 years old.</p>

  <p>Under both systems the student loan debt will be written off if the borrower dies or receives a disability related benefit because he or she is permanently unable to work.</p>
