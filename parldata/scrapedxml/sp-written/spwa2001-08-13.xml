  <p>A range of options have been included in a consultation paper that was issued on 1 June 2001 and which invites responses on what would be the best way forward on implementing the uncultivated land and semi-natural areas provisions of the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive.</p>

  <p>Responses to the consultation paper are required by 31 August 2001 and a copy of the paper is available from the Parliament&#8217;s reference centre or the Scottish Executive website.</p>

  <p>The Commission issued a working document on 25 July, outlining the principles on which the proposed Directive on environmental liability could be based. This does not refer to &quot;public interest groups&quot;, but rather to &quot;qualified entities in the field of environmental protection&quot;. These are defined as:</p>

  <p>&quot;Any body or organisation which, according to the criteria, if any, laid down in national law, has an interest in ensuring that significant environmental damage is restored. Bodies and organisations whose purpose, as is shown by the articles of incorporation thereof, is to protect the environment should be deemed to have such an interest&quot;.</p>

  <p>The Commission will be consulting on this working document, with a view to bringing forward a proposed Directive on environmental liability, probably in early 2002. I shall be placing a copy of the working document in the Parliament&#8217;s reference centre.</p>

  <p>In 1998-99 an independent Bathing Waters Review Panel examined nominations for identification as bathing waters for the purposes of the Bathing Waters (Classification) (Scotland) Regulations 1991. The sole criterion, suggested by the panel, was that members of the public should use the site for bathing in significant numbers. The 37 additional identifications made in 1999 represent all those waters the panel recommended on that basis.</p>

  <p>Bathing waters, not beaches, are identified by the Scottish Executive for the purposes of the Bathing Waters (Classification) (Scotland) Regulations 1991. The regulations implement in Scotland the EC Bathing Waters Directive (76/160/EEC). The Directive is intended to apply only at more frequented locations, and exclusion from the list of bathing waters does not, therefore, imply that a location is unfit for bathing. Obviously there will be a strong correlation between locations too little frequented to qualify for identification and excellent water quality.</p>

  <p>For the criterion for identification I refer Ms McLeod to my answer to question S1W-17048.</p>

  <p>The four applications remain under review. One of the applicants was given a provisional offer of grant but the applicant subsequently changed the costing involved in the project and the application is being reconsidered. Another of the applications is being processed to a conclusion in conjunction with Department of Transport, Local Government and the Regions.</p>

  <p>There has been a reduction in referrals in some areas. The Scottish Executive is working to resolve the matter with the Information Commissioner by agreeing a system, which both complies with the Data Protection Act and improves the level of referrals.</p>
