  <p>The fruit and vegetable sector has historically been relatively unsupported. The 2007 reform of the EU fruit and vegetable regime will give growers greater flexibility as land used to grow fruit and vegetables will, from 15 May 2008, support Single Farm Payment Scheme claims. The Scottish Government is also committed to encouraging retailers and consumers to source and eat fresh, seasonal produce and this should have a positive effect on Scottish fruit and vegetable production.</p>

  <p>Through the concordat with COSLA we are moving to an outcomes-focused approach which empowers local authorities and gives councils flexibility to meet the Scottish Government&rsquo;s national outcomes and the national indicators in support of those outcomes, including the national indicators on crime reduction and the national indicator to reduce alcohol-related hospital admissions by 2011.</p>

  <p>Effective substance misuse education is important in helping young people to become confident individuals so that they can make informed choices about positive lifestyles and avoid future alcohol misuse. The <em>Curriculum for Excellence</em> will include a series of learning outcomes and experiences for health and well being that will provide teachers with an opportunity to develop young people&rsquo;s awareness of the risks to health associated with substance misuse. The Scottish Government is also actively working with key stakeholders to develop a programme of work to improve the effectiveness of substance misuse education in schools.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to announce that Scottish ministers intend to bring together the existing bodies which make up Scotland&rsquo;s distinctive Children&rsquo;s Hearings system of care and justice into a single body. We intend to do this in a way which ensures that local delivery and the links with local communities, which are vital to the system, are fully maintained. This will ensure a stronger and more consistent national approach to the work of the Children&rsquo;s Reporters service; to the delivery and administration of Children&rsquo;s Hearings, and to the recruitment, training and support provided to the volunteer Panel members who make the local decisions at hearings. By incorporating all these functions into one body we can refocus on the individuals who deliver the Children&rsquo;s Hearings system, rather than on the bodies of which they are members.</p>

  <p>Panel members will continue to be recruited from local communities, and will serve those local communities. Local authorities will continue to have a crucial role to play in ensuring that the system works effectively in their area.</p>

  <p>We plan to take the necessary steps, including bringing forward any legislative proposals, to give effect to this. In the meantime, we will work closely with COSLA and other key interests to develop the detail of the new approach.</p>

  <p>On 31 May 2007, the First Minister referred to the overwhelming evidence in relation to early intervention not simply the impact of class size reduction. There is a body of research evidence such as the student teacher attainment ration research in Tennessee and the class size and pupil ratio research in England that support class size reduction in the early years. With regard to pre-school education the Effective Provision of Pre-school Education project in England found high quality pre-school education enhances all round development in children. I would also refer the member to a literature review entitled <em>Early Years Education: Perspectives from a review of the international literature</em> in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government fully supports the principle of early diagnosis of long-term conditions such as diabetes, in order to improve quality of life and reduce the risk of complications. The National Screening Committee (NSC) advises that we should screen groups who are at high-risk of type 2 diabetes, for example those who are seriously overweight, who have a family history of diabetes or who have symptoms such as sudden weight loss or extreme thirst. Further advice is needed from the NSC, however, on the most effective mechanism to screen for diabetes.</p>

  <p>Many of those at risk of developing diabetes can be identified as part of the care delivered by the general practice team, through the primary medical services contract. GP Practices are also incentivised through the Quality and Outcomes Framework of the GMS contract and the Scottish Enhanced Services Programme to support early diagnosis and appropriate management of patients with diabetes.</p>

  <p>The &quot;Keep Well&quot; pilots identify those in the most deprived communities in Scotland at particular risk of preventable, serious ill health. The focus is on cardiovascular disease and its main risk factors, including diabetes.</p>

  <p>There are currently no effective therapies to prevent type 1 diabetes.</p>

  <p>Type 2 diabetes is associated with several factors, some of which are reversible and others, such as genetic associations, which cannot be influenced by lifestyle changes. Obesity is the single most important preventable predictor of type 2 diabetes, although smoking, lack of exercise, poor diet and excessive alcohol consumption are all associated with increased risk of diabetes.</p>

  <p>The <em>Better Health Better Care Action Plan </em>sets out the Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment to tackle the rising problem of obesity. Over the next three years we will be investing a further &pound;14.7 million, in addition to increased spending on healthy eating and physical activity, to tackle obesity.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to developing a new National Drugs Strategy, which is informed by evidence and built, as far as possible, around consensus. As part of developing our strategy we will consider how best the Scottish Advisory Committee on Drug Misuse, alcohol and drug action teams and other key stakeholders can assist in the implementation of a successful strategy. We will consider the potential role of a commission within that context.</p>

  <p>The new concordat between the Scottish Government and local government provides total funding of &pound;34.8 billion to local authorities 2008-11, an increase of 12.9% across the three year period. It will remove much of the ring-fencing which previously constrained local funding arrangements and will provide much greater financial freedom for local government, as well as significantly reducing related bureaucracy. We expect local authorities will apply these principles when allocating budgets to each school.</p>

  <p>These figures are not available centrally. However, the Scottish Court Service (SCS) is working with Justice Analytical Services to improve the accuracy and level of detail of the civil judicial statistics it collects, and as part of this work SCS has recently begun recording more information about craves in actions raised. This will enable researchers to identify all court actions initiated in 2008 onwards in which child contact is craved by the pursuer, and therefore which records to access for further information.</p>

  <p>For all 11 Regional Proposal Assessment Committee areas there is an on-going process of consultation on the development of the list of Regional Priorities involving the full range of stakeholder interests represented in rural Scotland. Representatives covering forestry interests are engaged in this process. Regional Priorities are being derived from existing priorities contained in a wide range of strategies relating to rural Scotland including the Scottish Forestry Strategy. Once completed, these Regional Priorities will be used, by Regional Proposal Assessment Committees, which includes Forestry Commission Scotland in the assessment of proposals for funding. The process of updating and refining Regional Priorities will continue throughout the Scottish Rural Development Plan funding period.</p>

  <p>We propose to revise the regulations Intensive Support and Monitoring (Scotland) Regulations 2006 to allow all local authorities to use Movement Restriction Conditions with an electronic tag through the Children&rsquo;s Hearings system for young people under 16-year-olds from April 2008.</p>

  <p>Where and when a Movement Restriction Condition with an electronic tag is to be used, the appropriate support must be in place to support the young person, in line with regulations. In many cases it is the view of many of those working with youngsters that it is the intensive support that is the cause of changed behaviour.</p>

  <p>To be eligible for a Movement Restriction Condition, young people will still have to meet the conditions set out in section 70 of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995, the same criteria that must be met for a young person to be authorised for secure accommodation. In effect, a Movement Restriction Condition would only be used where other interventions have not succeeded.</p>

  <p>I can confirm that discussions have taken place between the relevant parties in Scotland and that it has been agreed that the same Memorandum of Understanding which has already been agreed in England will also be adopted in Scotland. This will ensure that the supply of teaching and research staff employed by Universities to the NHS for patient care is outside the scope of VAT by treating such arrangements as joint employment between the university and NHS bodies involved. No VAT is in practice being paid in Scotland in these situations, pending agreement of the Memorandum of Understanding.</p>

  <p>The website has been the main focus of responses to the national conversation during its first phase, where the government&rsquo;s aim was to move from polarised debate to mature dialogue, and to start to engage the public, media and academics in the debate, as well as politicians.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the majority of responses received by the government to date have been via the website, which has proved to be one of the most successful ever operated by government in the UK. However, the government has directly received over 100 pieces of correspondence from individuals and organisations, about half of which have been by letter. Exact numbers of letters received are not available, due to the processes involved, which do not allow us to easily distinguish between the numbers of letters and emails received in this way. Officials are also in discussions with a variety of organisations with regard to their contribution to the debate, and how we may best ensure that everyone who has a contribution to make to the conversation has the opportunity to have their voice heard. This broadening of public engagement will be a key theme of the second phase of the conversation.</p>

  <p>I am aware that on 11 December, in giving evidence to the Europe and External Affairs Committee, I informed the committee that 400 letters had been received in response to the conversation. This was an unintentional misreading of the figures &ndash; 400 was the total amount of correspondence received (including ministerial correspondence, letters, emails, and &quot;join-in&quot; emails from the website).</p>

  <p>As I indicated in my answer to question S3W-1357, answered on 23 July 2007, the Environment and Rural Affairs Department generated underspends in 2004-05, 2005-06 and 2006-07 of &pound;39 million, &pound;46 million and &pound;54 million respectively. Of this &pound;36 million and &pound;9 million was returned to the Department as End Year Flexibility. Scottish Government central contingency funds held at HM Treasury are not under the control of individual Cabinet Secretaries but of Scottish ministers collectively. There will be no central contingency fund for the next three three years as all funds held centrally have been allocated as part of the next Spending Review.</p>

  <p>Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) is supporting a programme of research to monitor the operation and effectiveness of the Scottish Outdoor Access Code. In addition, a recent review undertaken by external consultants to consider the effectiveness of current promotion and education programmes concluded that the significant multi channel campaign delivered by SNH had succeeded in raising awareness and improved understanding of the code.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what its response is to concerns that land reform legislation and the Scottish Outdoor Access Code are not clear enough in providing guidance to members of the public about their access rights in fields occupied by livestock and specifically about the dangers that might be faced when accessing fields occupied by livestock.</p>

  <p>I am satisfied that existing guidance on this matter is satisfactory and proportionate. The Scottish Outdoor Access Code provides guidance on access to areas occupied by livestock and was developed in conjunction with land management bodies and the Health and Safety Executive. The National Access Forum which considers national issues relating to access rights, recently discussed access with dogs in areas with cattle in extensive open grazings. The Health and Safety Executive has also produced an Information Sheet on the topic of cattle and public access aimed at farmers including advice on sign posting alternative routes to enable the general public to avoid fields with livestock, without unreasonably interfering with responsible access. The National Farmers Union has distributed a <em>Public Access to Farmland</em> brochure which provides a brief introduction for farmers, crofters and growers on their rights and responsibilities.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-7961 on 18 January 2008. The Scottish Outdoor Access Code provides guidance on the possible dangers to members of the public of walking in fields occupied by livestock. In addition Scottish Natural Heritage has developed a range of signage templates for use by land managers which relate to commonly encountered access issues. These were advertised in farming papers and magazines and distributed free of charge. The templates can be downloaded from the Scottish Outdoor Access website <a href="http://www.outdooraccess-scotland.com/" target="_blank">www.outdooraccess-scotland.com</a> .</p>

  <p>There are no plans currently to amend the Scottish Outdoor Access Code. Scottish Natural Heritage is responsible for monitoring the operation of the code and for ensuring that all issues which require consideration will be considered as and when a formal review of the code takes place.</p>

  <p>Tourism is not an EU competence. However, officials keep in touch with developments affecting tourism across Europe, including on the subject of funding for tourism projects involving other member states. The EU organises an annual conference on tourism issues, and officials have in the past attended these when the agenda has promised to be of relevance to tourism issues in Scotland, using them as an opportunity to speak to representatives of other regional legislatures. In addition, delegations of ministers and officials with an interest in tourism from legislatures such as Catalonia visit Scotland from time to time, and these visits are opportunities for further exchanges of views.</p>
