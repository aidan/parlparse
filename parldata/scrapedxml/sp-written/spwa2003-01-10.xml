  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether, with regard to the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Bill and the absolute right to buy, it is making budgetary provision to cover any costs which might arise under the European Convention on Human Rights, given the comments made in the Rural Development Committee&#8217;s <i>Stage 1 Report on the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Bill</i> .</p>

  <p>The Executive is opposed to an absolute right to buy, which would undermine the aim of the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Bill to revitalise the tenanted sector. Our potential liability for compensation to overcome the risk of legal challenge under the European Convention of Human Rights arising from the creation of such a right is difficult to predict or control accurately, but we believe it could be substantial. Current Executive spending plans make no provision to meet such costs and no provision could be made without impacting on Executive support for other programmes. There is also a possibility, which we are investigating further, that such payments would in any case be unlikely to be acceptable for state aid purposes and would fail to meet EC requirements.</p>

  <p>For all of these reasons, we do not propose changes to our current spending plans to make budgetary provision for compensation that might be associated with the introduction of an absolute right to buy.</p>

  <p>Section 4(2)(b) of the Land Registration (Scotland) Act 1979 provides that an application for registration in the Land Register of Scotland shall not be accepted by the Keeper of the Registers of Scotland if it relates to land which is a souvenir plot, that is a piece of land which, being of inconsiderable size or no practical utility, is unlikely to be wanted in isolation except for the sake of mere ownership or for sentimental reasons or for commemorative purposes.</p>

  <p>The Island of Skye, being in the County of Inverness is subject to that act and accordingly the plots in question could not be registered. The operation of the Land Register will be extended to all the remaining counties of Scotland on 1 April 2003 at which point in time registration of souvenir plots will be impossible anywhere in Scotland. Inability to register a souvenir plot means that the purchaser can only get a personal right of ownership. He or she cannot get a real right protected by the state guarantee that underpins a registered title.</p>

  <p>The position of the Scottish Executive on the purported sale of souvenir plots is reflected in the terms of the above mentioned legislation. The Executive would advise that any individuals participating in transactions of this nature should be aware that there is no true purchase involved as no title can be obtained to the plot of land.</p>

  <p>In view of the fact that titles cannot be registered to the plots, it is not known what rights and responsibilities attach to the &quot;owners&quot; of the small plots of land, but any such rights and responsibilities would be of a personal nature. For the same reason is it not known what acreage of Scotland has been &quot;sold off&quot; in plots of a very small size.</p>

  <p>It is not known how many such schemes there have been in the last 20 years. The Registers of Scotland have no knowledge of any problems caused by them.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Established employees receive 182 days full-paid sickness and 183 days half-paid sickness entitlement, irrespective of service. This should not exceed 365 days, in total, in any four-year period.</p>

  <p>Where an employee has exhausted their entitlement to full and half pay, a further 12 months can be paid at Sick Pay at Pension Rate (SPPR). This is at the discretion of management and only applies where, following medical advice, there is a reasonable prospect of the employee returning to work.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>As I indicated in the answer given to question S1W-32017, and previously in response to question S1W-29749 on 7 October 2002, the number of prisoner places available in future years, with and without access to night sanitation, will depend on when new places become available and when it is possible to make temporary closures for upgrading other places. These decisions depend on a number of factors outside SPS&#8217;s direct control including future trends in the prisoner population and the timing and outcome of planning applications for new places. It is therefore not possible to make accurate projections beyond those given in the answer given to question S1W-32017.</p>

  <p>A contract with agreed levels of funding and an agreed Passenger Service Requirement is in place with ScotRail until April 2004 when the current franchise expires. Payment of the subsidy cost of the franchise is divided between the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) and Strathclyde Passenger Transport (SPT).

  <p>At present, comprehensive information in the form requested in this question, and questions S1W-32711, S1W-32712 and S1W-32713, is not available.</p>

  <p>Information on commercialisation of university research is available from the UK Higher Education-Business Interaction (HE-BI) survey, which is based on activities reported by universities. This annual survey was commissioned in 2001 by the Higher Education Funding Council for England on behalf of a group of stakeholders, including the Scottish Executive and the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council. The UK report was published in December 2001 by the Centre for Urban and Regional Development Studies at the University of Newcastle and is available at <a href="http://www.hefce.ac.uk/Pubs/hefce/2001/01_68.htm" target="_blank">http://www.hefce.ac.uk/Pubs/hefce/2001/01_68.htm</a>. Key Scottish results have been published in the Scottish Economic Report January 2002 and are available at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library3/finance/ser5-11.asp" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library3/finance/ser5-11.asp</a>, based on the responses from 17 Scottish institutions.</p>

  <p>For the academic year 1999-2000, 37 new spin-off companies were reported in which the Higher Education Institution (HEI) held equity, compared with a total of 54 in the preceding five years. There are presently no reliable data on the number of companies started where the HEI had some interest but no equity ownership. Of the 17 Scottish HEIs which responded to the survey, 16 had an equity share in at least one spin-off company. One hundred and twenty-two licensing agreements were reported by Scottish HEIs in 1998-99 and 114 in 1999-2000, the only years for which figures are available. Total revenues from Intellectual Property Rights (including income from licensing agreements as well as royalties on patents and copyrights) accruing to Scottish universities were reported as &#163;6.9 million in 1998-99 and &#163;7.7 million in 1999-2000. Results for the 2000-01 academic session are expected to be published for the UK shortly; the Scottish Executive will provide an analysis of the Scottish results.</p>

  <p>Information on the commercialisation activity of the Scottish Agricultural and Biological Research Institutes (SABRIs) has been collected since 2000 and is included in their annual reports. On average each year, for financial years 2000-01, 2001-02 and 2002-03 (estimate), the SABRIs have filed 10 new patents, there have been 70 new licences and two new spin-out companies. Income from Intellectual Property Rights has amounted to approximately &#163;650,000 annually.</p>

  <p>Improving the commercialisation of university and research institute research is a high priority for the Executive and we have set a target of assisting 150 joint academic and industry ventures by 2006. It is important that suitable measures are available to assess the extent and value of commercialisation activity. The UK HE-BI survey is relatively new, and the intention is to develop it further. At this stage it is not possible to say whether future surveys will include the additional items covered by these parliamentary questions, since the cost of collection and extent to which universities and other bodies are able to provide them will need to be assessed. Developing better measures of commercialisation activity is also currently being considered as part of the Review of the UK Research Assessment Exercise in which the Executive is participating.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for pay and other staff-related service conditions for the civilian staff at the Scottish Criminal Record Office formally rests with Strathclyde Joint Police Board. The board has, however, made available the following information in respect of the three fingerprint officers who gave evidence in the prosecution of Shirley McKie and a fourth officer who did not give evidence but who was involved in the process leading up to the prosecution and who was suspended with the other three officers:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Criminal Record Office has not made any financial contribution to the legal costs of the fingerprint experts involved in the prosecution of Ms McKie, nor has any other public body as far as I am aware.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has accepted responsibility for the defendants&#8217; legal cost arising out of the civil action raised on behalf of Ms McKie.</p>

  <p>The Chief Medical Officer has today issued revised guidance to NHS Scotland, which takes account of the latest advice received from the Expert Group on Cryptosporidium in Water Supplies, chaired by Professor Bouchier. The revised guidance takes account of the group&#8217;s clarification of issues around risk assessment, and the importance of taking account of local circumstances in order to arrive at speedy and appropriate decisions. The guidance also reflects the group's technical advice relating to the provision of laboratory support associated with the detection and identification of cryptosporidium in water supplies.</p>

  <p>The Executive will also take account of the strategic implications of Professor Bouchier's scientific advice in developing guidance on incident and outbreak management. This interim guidance will be published shortly, for consultation.</p>

  <p>These developments have been taken forward as a consequence of recommendations made by the Ad Hoc Group on Health and Public Water Supply, which was established following cryptosporidium-related incidents in Glasgow and Edinburgh in August last year.</p>
