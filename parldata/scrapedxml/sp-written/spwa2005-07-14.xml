  <p>The Scottish Executive works closely with construction industry stakeholders, including trades unions. The Union of Construction Allied Trades and Technicians (UCATT) is a member of the Scottish Construction Forum and is fully engaged in its work programme, including workforce development issues. Scottish Enterprise Glasgow also meets regularly with UCATT as part of the Construction Glasgow steering group.</p>

  <p>UCATT and TGWU are also represented on the Scottish Advisory Committee of the sector skills council for construction (CITB/ConstructionSkills), providing a formal interface between the construction industry, unions and CITB/CS thus allowing consideration of local training needs and priorities.</p>
