  <p>Locate in Scotland was an active member of the Prestwick Task Force, and has continued to work closely with the Ayrshire Location Service on the matter. Extensive marketing was carried out in Locate in Scotland&#8217;s main overseas markets promoting Scotland&#8217;s, and in particular Prestwick&#8217;s potential as a location of MRO (maintenance, repair and overhaul) aerospace activities. In addition, Locate in Scotland together with Ayrshire Location Service participated in the MRO Europe Exhibition and Conference in Limerick earlier in September to raise the profile of Scotland and Prestwick in particular.</p>

  <p>Locate in Scotland has also worked closely with existing aerospace employers at Prestwick to facilitate expansion of existing operations. Currently Locate in Scotland and the Ayrshire Location Service are pursuing some specific project opportunities, but it would not be appropriate to comment on these at this stage.</p>

  <p>Companies have clear equal opportunities policies and are encouraged to ensure that their staff maintain a full and up-to-date appreciation of equal opportunities issues.</p>

It contains a number of proposals and recommendations on post-school education and training for young people who have additional support needs, including those who have special educational needs. Ministers are now considering the recommendations in the report. Following a series of dissemination seminars, Ministers will publish an Action Plan in January 2000.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer what the cost is of each of the laptops purchased for MSPs and how this compares with current market prices for similar specification machines.</p>

  <p>All the laptop computers for MSPs were purchased in April 1999 by the then Scottish Office, under Government competitive procurement rules. Suppliers were invited to bid for supply of validated models meeting the precise specification required for compatibility with the Parliament network and dial-in service. As normal for specific, lower value procurements of this kind, bids were invited and submitted as &quot;Commercial in Confidence&quot; to ensure suppliers did not lose competitive advantage by disclosing prices for particular products to their commercial rivals. All bids were then evaluated for both technical quality and price, the successful bid being that offering greatest value for money. Owing to the inherently competitive nature of this procurement process, and the eagerness of suppliers to secure business with the new Scottish Parliament, the successful bid established an extremely advantageous price for equipment of this quality and specification.</p>

  <p>The ICT market is a highly volatile one. The cost of equipment decreases with its age whilst the quality of the equipment increases, and in both cases this change happens within weeks. It is therefore not meaningful to compare equipment or prices with those of six months ago, since, whenever IT equipment is specified and costed, it is most likely to be different from the specification and cost of equipment with similar functionality defined some months later.</p>

  <p>In a very short period of time, the Scottish Parliament was defined and its core functions and processes initiated and installed in the interim accommodation at the Mound. This was achieved thanks to a significant amount of work by the staff, which has ensured that the business of the Parliament was, and is, supported during this set-up period.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Parliament is a new and evolving organisation whose working culture and practices are still being settled and defined. The SPCB will undertake a cyclical review of the cost effectiveness and quality of all its services as part of normal business practice and has already commenced this by reviewing staffing complement and structures. In the meantime comments on, and proposals for, services are welcomed, and those pertaining to IT should be channelled in the first instance through the MSP IT User Group, or direct to either the Head of IT or the Director of Communications.</p>

  <p>Centralised provision is co-ordinated through the Public Information team. A main point of information at the Parliament site is the Visitor Centre in the Committee Chambers building. Remote access is available through the Enquiry Unit that answers written, email and telephone questions. A local rate number is available as well as a national rate number in order to offer a consistent service across Scotland. Public Information staff operate the main Switchboard ensuring easy access to basic information.</p>

  <p>Public information is also available through the Partner Library network of seventy-six public libraries throughout Scotland &#8211; one in each parliamentary constituency plus additional Partner Libraries in Portree, Dornoch and Ullapool to reflect the unique geographic and transport problems faced by constituents in the Highlands and Islands. Partner Libraries act as focal points in local communities for information about MSPs, the Parliament, it&#8217;s business and decisions. The Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe) has a dedicated Library Liaison Officer charged with developing the Partner Library network. All Partner Libraries have been offered a full collection of core parliamentary publications, funded from the SPICe budget. They all receive <i>WHISP</i>, SPICe research publications, and will shortly receive the video of the opening ceremony. The majority of Partner Libraries provide public access to the Internet enabling constituents to access the Scottish Parliament website.</p>

  <p>Wider public access to information about the Scottish Parliament is increasingly available through electronic community information programmes being developed in the Scottish public library sector as part of national information and lifelong learning strategies such as <i>New Library Network, Government</i> <i>Direct</i>, the <i>National Grid for Learning </i>and<i> Enabling Seamless Access.<br /> </i></p>
