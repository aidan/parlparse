  <p>All Scottish police forces use unique references to track incidents. These then form part of standard ISCJIS (Integration of Scottish Criminal Justice Information Systems) tracking numbers which can be used throughout the Scottish Criminal Justice System.</p>

  <p>All solemn and summary sheriff court cases and civil cases in the Court of Session and sheriff courts are allocated a unique reference number when the case is first lodged. The progress of a case can be tracked using the unique reference number.</p>

  <p>The proposals will require a solicitor in a defended action in the sheriff court to report to the Scottish Legal Aid Board when a particular procedural stage passes (for example, options hearing and closing the record); whenever a significant development occurs (such as when an opponent makes a tender), and in any event, where a case runs for a long time, to submit a report every 12 months.</p>

  <p>At the different stages, solicitors may be entitled to a payment to account, if appropriate, for fees for work done to the date of the relevant report. Any such payments would, of course, be deducted from the final account submitted at the conclusion of the case or where the civil legal aid certificate was terminated.</p>

  <p>The proposed new block fee system - which will replace one that is already in existence - will provide for a fee in respect of each major stage in a case. The relevant fees have been designed to cover both work in court and other work undertaken to progress the case.</p>

  <p>The new system will reward the efficient processing of business from the client&#8217;s and taxpayer&#8217;s point of view by paying for measurable blocks of work completed, rather than time spent or letters written. The current system does not do that effectively. In addition, the introduction of a binding quality assurance system will ensure that clients get the high quality service they are entitled to expect.</p>

  <p>The Executive will monitor the new system very closely and propose to carry out a thorough review after two years; this will provide an opportunity to assess the impact on clients, solicitors, and the wider justice system.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what investigations it has carried out, or is carrying out, on the recent closures of the A90 between Stonehaven and Aberdeen; what support it will give Aberdeenshire Council in making good any resulting damage to verges, drains and the road surface on the B979 between Stonehaven and Maryculter caused by additional heavy traffic loads, and whether it will impose a weight restriction on the B979 except for strictly local access.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive, before implementing the planned road closures on the A90 between Stonehaven and Aberdeen, investigated appropriate diversion routes which included discussions with the affected local road authority, Aberdeenshire Council. Appropriate diversion routes, to assist local traffic entering or leaving the affected section of A90, were identified and orders were promoted and published. The B979 is not part of the diversion routes.</p>

  <p>Local roads are the responsibility of local road authorities and it is for them to ensure that these roads are maintained and to identify any restrictions that require to be implemented in order to protect the road and its users.</p>
