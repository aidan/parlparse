  <p>COSLA and the Scottish Government are progressing with a review of information and advice provision, which will include an assessment of how current provision fits with needs. A major aim of the review is to ensure that public resources are being used effectively and efficiently, and that there is quality and consistency of service provision across Scotland. The review will be published by the end of 2009. One of the key objectives of the review will be the provision of uniform, high quality and joined-up services that are based on needs.</p>

  <p>Policy, implementation and evaluation of the uptake of benefits and tax credits remains the responsibility of the UK Government. The Scottish Government however is committed to action on a number of levels to tackle poverty and income inequality in Scotland as set out in <em>Achieving our Potential</em> .</p>

  <p><em>Achieving our Potential</em> commits significant new investment in 2009-10 and 2010-11 for income maximisation with a focus on benefits uptake for older people and other key groups. Key funding issued so far includes:</p>

  <p>&pound;1.1million to Macmillan Cancer to provide cancer patients and carers with advice and information on welfare benefits and other financial matters in the five cancer treatment centres in Scotland.</p>

  <p>&pound;160,000 to Citizens Advice Direct to provide free telephone benefit entitlement checks to those people that access the Energy Assistance Programme.</p>

  <p>&pound;700,000 to provide income maximisation advice and support to older people in deprived parts of Falkirk, North Lanarkshire, West Lothian and Clackmannanshire.</p>

  <p>These do not focus on specific benefits and tax credits but take a holistic approach to increasing overall income. We are considering other initiatives and interventions which will provide support to those people that are most difficult to reach.</p>

  <p>Central to the income maximisation programme is a commitment to target those vulnerable groups that are not accessing the benefits that they are entitled to, and to identify ways to ensure that all benefits are claimed. The Scottish Government is working with UK counterparts on areas of shared interest to promote this.</p>

  <p>Yes. This government is committed to reduce primary one to primary 3 class sizes to a maximum of 18. That commitment is set out in the concordat with local government. It has become evident that progress in meeting this commitment is being impeded because the statutory maximum for P1 classes remains at 30. I therefore intend to introduce regulations that will limit P1 classes to a maximum of 25 pupils as from the beginning of the next school year in 2010. Currently class sizes are governed in a number of ways from regulation, circular, terms and conditions and legislation and I also intend to establish a Class Size Review on how class sizes could be governed in the future. Further details of this review will be announced shortly.</p>

  <p>I announced on 22 September 2009 that Safer Streets funding of &pound;400,000 will be made available to support Community Safety Partnerships between November 2009 and March 2010. This brings our investment in Safer Streets since 2007 to &pound;2.6 million.</p>

  <p>It is to be divided between all 32 local authorities to fund community safety initiatives including high visibility police patrols in &quot;hot spot&quot; areas, street pastors, targeting of street drinkers, enhanced CCTV and late night taxi marshals. The proposed maximum funding allocation for North Ayrshire is &pound;15,758.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. This data set is for the first quarter of 1995. From April 1995, the data was recorded by financial year whereas previously it had been recorded by calendar year.</p>

  <p>2. Trends in the recorded crime and offences figures since 2004-05 have been affected by the introduction of the Scottish Crime Recording Standard which, as anticipated, increased the numbers of minor crimes recorded by the police, such as minor crimes of vandalism and minor thefts.</p>

  <p>Today in a speech to the Scottish Learning Festival in Glasgow, I will set out the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Assessment Strategy. A copy of the strategy has been placed in Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 49254). Additionally, we will publish our proposals today on the <em> Curriculum for Excellence</em> website at: <a href="http://www.curriculumforexcellencescotland.gov.uk" target="_blank">http://www.curriculumforexcellencescotland.gov.uk</a> . The overall vision and key principles is being published today. This will be followed later in the year by a Framework for Assessment to provide more detailed guidance.</p>

  <p>Assessment is one of three key strands of work in implementing <em>Curriculum for Excellence</em>. The other areas are curriculum guidance, which was published in the spring, and National Qualifications, for which I announced detailed plans in Parliament on 11 June.</p>

  <p>The strategy has been developed in conjunction with key stakeholders and practitioners working with children and young people aged 3 to 18.</p>

  <p>The strategic vision for Assessment sets out the purposes and principles of assessment that will govern the assessment system for Curriculum for Excellence 3 to 18. The four main changes to assessment in <em>Curriculum for Excellence</em> are:</p>

  <p>Assessment practices will follow and support the new curriculum. This will promote higher quality learning and teaching and give more autonomy and professional responsibility to teachers.</p>

  <p>Standards and expectations will be defined in a way that reflects the principles of <em>Curriculum for Excellence. </em>This will support greater breadth and depth of learning and a greater focus on skills development including higher order skills.</p>

  <p>A national system of quality assurance and moderation for 3 to 18 will be developed to support teachers in achieving greater consistency and confidence in their professional judgements.</p>

  <p>A National Assessment Resource will help teachers to achieve greater consistency and understanding in their professional judgements. There will also be a major focus on CPD to help teachers develop the skills required.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s ScotAction initiative is a skills support package for leading Scotland out of recession and on to economic growth. To help reduce the rate and impact of unemployment across Scotland the Scottish Government has:</p>

  <p>Changed the rules for Training for Work so that people are now able to access tailored, job-related training at the three months stage of unemployment. Employees on notice of redundancy can access this vocational training during the 90 day notification period.</p>

  <p>Created an additional 3,150 Training for Work places to offer job-focused training that is suited to the needs of individuals and employers:</p>

  <p>Introduced the Adopt an Apprentice scheme which provides &pound;2,000 to employers willing to recruit a redundant apprentice to enable them to complete their training.</p>

  <p>Provided &pound;16 million to recruit and support an additional 7,800 apprentices in 2009. This funding supports a two for one offer for Life Sciences apprenticeships, creating job opportunities in a sector that is key to Scotland&rsquo;s future economic growth.</p>

  <p>Extended the eligibility to Individual Learning Accounts (ILA) so that they can be accessed by more people. Through the ILA200 offer people can receive &pound;200 a year to take part in short, flexible pieces of work-focused training. In addition, ILA500 provides a grant of &pound;500 per year towards higher education study at college or university.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Funding Council has made &pound;7 million available to colleges throughout Scotland to support the training of people made redundant and Skills Development Scotland, with the support of &pound;1.4 million European Social Funding, is doubling the number of careers advisers which will help an additional 4,600 individuals facing redundancy.</p>

  <p>In addition, we are making best use of the European Social Fund to support individuals entering or remaining in work. In March the Scottish Government announced &pound;5.6 million for 33 projects supporting 7,000 people in the Highlands and Islands and in April the First Minister announced &pound;24.1 million to fund 79 projects supporting 75,000 people in the rest of Scotland.</p>

  <p>Coal will continue to form an important part of the energy mix in Scotland for some years. However, it must go hand in hand with the development of clean coal technology. Such technologies, including Carbon Capture and Storage, have the potential to both transform the way we generate power and also reduce emmissions significantly.</p>

  <p>Planning policies are in place to ensure opencast coal mining sites are only approved if they are environmentally acceptable or provide local benefits, such as jobs or land improvements, which clearly outweigh the impacts. It is right that the main responsibility for decisions on opencast mines lie with local authorities who are best placed to consider all the issues, whether environmental or economic.</p>

  <p>Specific guidance for NHS boards is contained in the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) publication <em>Postoperative Management in Adults - A Practical Guide to Postoperative Care for Clinical Staff</em> . This guidance is available from the SIGN website at: <a href="http://www.sign.ac.uk/pdf/sign77.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.sign.ac.uk/pdf/sign77.pdf</a> .</p>

  <p>In addition, as part of the Scottish Patient Safety Programme, the Surgical Site Infection Prevention Bundle has been developed and implemented by NHS boards to improve the consistency and standard of treatment given to patients and to improve patient outcomes.</p>

  <p>The Surgical Profiles Project also provides data to improve surgical care. This is a package of comparative clinical indicators on local surgical services that NHS boards can use to help improve the delivery and outcomes of patient care by identifying potential areas for attention and also areas of good practice. This project is being managed by NHS Health Quality. The link to this work is:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.nhshealthquality.org/nhsqis/3638.html" target="_blank">http://www.nhshealthquality.org/nhsqis/3638.html</a>.</p>

  <p>Good progress is being made in reducing the number of Surgical Site Infections (SSIs). The sixth national annual report on SSIs confirmed a downward trend in infection rates across all categories of surgery. Overall the figures show a significant decrease from 1.1% of all reported procedures in 2007 to 0.7% in 2008.</p>

  <p>Adequate fluid intake is fundamental to the care of all patients and as such is the responsibility of everyone involved in the care of patients. Accurate recording of fluid balance for those at risk of, or suffering from dehydration, is key to providing a safe level of care. Maintaining accurate records, including fluid balance charts, is a core responsibility of all registered staff who are accountable for their practice. It is also the responsibility of those who are employed within the NHS in the care team, such as health care assistants.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has not issued specific guidance to NHS boards on this matter. However, NHS Quality Improvement Scotland&rsquo;s Clinical Standards on Food, Fluid and Nutrition in Hospitals, (standard 3.6), provides NHS Scotland with a specific standard on fluid intake monitoring. All NHS boards are currently being peer reviewed regarding these standards.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The information in this table has been extracted from the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service&rsquo;s case management database. The database is a live, operational database used to manage the processing of reports submitted to procurators fiscal by the police and other reporting agencies. If a Procurator Fiscal amends a charge submitted by a reporting agency, the database will record details only of the amended charge.</p>

  <p>2. The database is charge-based. The figures quoted therefore relate to the number of charges rather than the number of individuals charged or the number of incidents that gave rise to such charges.</p>

  <p>3. Procurator Fiscal jurisdictions match sheriff court jurisdictions.</p>

  <p><strong>Frank Mulholland: </strong>The following table shows the number of charges of (a) assault and (b) assault to injury where the initial decision taken by the Procurator Fiscal was to deal with the offending behaviour by means of a direct measure.</p>

  <p>1. The information in this table has been extracted from the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service&rsquo;s case management database. The database is a live, operational database used to manage the processing of reports submitted to procurators fiscal by the police and other reporting agencies. If a Procurator Fiscal amends a charge submitted by a reporting agency, the database will record details only of the amended charge.</p>

  <p>2. The database is charge-based. The figures quoted therefore relate to the number of charges rather than the number of individuals charged or the number of incidents that gave rise to such charges.</p>

  <p>Specialist services include a CFS/ME Nurse Specialist in NHS Fife. NHS Lothian maintains a specific, specialist diagnostic assessment and review clinic for people with ME-CFS. Access to this clinic is governed by a specific ME-CFS protocol that has been agreed with GPs. It is routinely available to them and facilitates GP referral to specialist services.</p>

  <p>A Wellness Enhancement Learning Programme for people with ME-CFS has also been developed by the Centre for Integrative Care in Glasgow. We are funding an evaluation report on that programme to help promote its dissemination.</p>

  <p>In order to encourage further progress in the development of services, we commissioned the Scottish Public Health Network (SPHN) to undertake a needs assessment for ME-CFS. The SPHN draft report provides further details of services at NHS board level (Appendix 5). It can be found at:</p>

  <p>As the service has developed it was agreed that NHS Scotland should seek partnerships with Universities to broaden the research base and develop the evidence to support the increasing use of PET/CT in the future.

  <p>The direct line management responsibilities of the Permanent Secretary of the Scottish Government are primarily for the six officials in Director General posts within the Scottish Government and, within the framework of the independence of the Lord Advocate in relation to her functions, the Director General post of Crown Agent and Chief Executive of the Procurator Fiscal Service, but also extend to the Director of Strategy and Ministerial Support and to his Private Secretary within the Scottish Government, and to the Director of Government Skills within the UK Civil Service. Through these direct responsibilities, he has ultimate line management responsibility for all employees of the Scottish Government, except special advisers and with limitations on that responsibility in respect of staff employed in executive agencies or non-ministerial departments, and for the staff of Government Skills.</p>

  <p>Since May 2007, as part of a significant restructuring of senior management there has been a reduction of one in the number of Director General posts within the Scottish Government and the Permanent Secretary has ceased to have direct line management responsibility for the Director of Human Resources and Corporate Services, the Director of Communications and the Director of Culture, External Affairs and Tourism.</p>

  <p>His responsibilities for Government Skills have also been taken on since 2007. The Permanent Secretary&rsquo;s direct line management responsibilities are discharged principally through regular meetings with individuals and the Scottish Government&rsquo;s formal performance management arrangements, or their equivalent in relation to Government Skills, and his overall line management responsibilities through a variety of other means.</p>
