  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what plans the NHS has for any related future increase in demand for liver transplants if the excess alcohol consumption of a proportion of the population cannot be reduced and continues at the current rate.</p>

  <p>We are aware of concerns about the effect of increased levels of alcoholic liver disease on the need for liver transplantation.</p>

  <p>The number of liver transplants depends on the number of donor livers that become available. To coincide with the commencement on 1 September this year of the Human Tissue (Scotland) Act 2006, the Executive launched a nationwide advertising campaign to encourage more people to put their name on the NHS Organ Donor Register. Both the new legislation and the advertising campaign aim to increase the cadaveric organ donation rate in Scotland. Since 1 April this year the Scottish Liver Transplant Unit has been able to offer a living donor liver transplantation programme.</p>

  <p>The Executive is fully committed to promoting a more responsible approach to alcohol and reducing alcohol-related harm. The Plan for Action on Alcohol Problems, published in 2002, set out a wide range of action to help to build a Scotland in which alcohol is treated more appropriately. As part of the process to update the plan, the Executive is currently considering a wide range of further action, including research on the factors driving the increase in liver cirrhosis mortality rates (alcohol consumption, obesity and hepatitis C infection) so as to inform future prevention activity.</p>

  <p>Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) has played an important role in the development and management of many LIFE projects in Scotland and this involvement will be maintained in the lead up to and following the launch of LIFE+.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has received the recently published guidance on funding the Natura 2000 network, including the recommendation that structural, cohesion and fisheries funds should be incorporated as part of Natura funding arrangements, and, if so, what procedures it has put into place to ensure that the guidance is applied.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-10-30.S2W-28932.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80011" speakername="Rhona Brankin" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa1030.htm#7">

  <p>I can confirm that the Scottish Executive has received the recently published EC Financing Natura 2000 Guidance Handbook.</p>

  <p>The focus of Structural Funds for 2007-13 will be on the contribution to the EU&rsquo;s Lisbon Jobs and Growth Agenda. There will be a significant reduction in the resource available to Scotland and the Executive does not propose that Structural Funds should be used for projects whose sole purpose is Natura site conservation. However, funding may assist with conservation and biodiversity-based activities which contribute to the economic development of the programme regions. Additional public consultation on the use of Structural Funds in Scotland was launched on 24 October 2006.</p>

  <p>The Executive will also shortly publish a consultation document which will seek views on how the Executive intends to access the European Fisheries Fund. This will include consideration of the potential for the fund to promote marine nature conservation, including the management of marine Natura sites.</p>

  <p>The recent Executive consultation on priorities for the Scottish Rural Development Programme for the period 2007-13 included in its proposed national objectives that special features of Natura sites should be brought into, and maintained in, favourable condition. Funding details for the programme have still to be settled, however, the consultation proposed that measures under the programmes would be able to assist land managers in meeting these aims.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive and Scottish Natural Heritage will also continue to encourage potential applicants to the proposed EC LIFE+ programme which is expected to offer significant potential for funding conservation work associated with the Natura network. More detail on LIFE+ is provided in my answer to S2W-28933 on 30 October 2006.

  <p>Section 133 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 provides that the Scottish ministers shall pay compensation in cases where a conviction is reversed on the ground that a new or newly discovered fact shows beyond reasonable doubt that there has been a miscarriage of justice unless non-disclosure of the unknown fact was wholly or partly attributable to the person convicted. In addition, ministers may be prepared to make an ex gratia payment of compensation following a wrongful conviction or charge where this has resulted from serious default on the part of a member of a police force or some other public authority. There may also be exceptional circumstances that justify compensation in cases outside these categories.</p>

  <p>In all cases, claims for compensation are considered by the Scottish ministers following receipt of applications from individuals. If ministers determine that there is a right to compensation under either the statutory or ex gratia scheme, the amount of compensation paid is determined by an independent assessor. The assessment is based on a Memorandum prepared by the Justice Department, compiling information submitted by the applicant, other relevant papers and taking account of comments from the applicant. In considering claims, the assessor applies principles analogous to those on which claims for damages arising from civil wrongs are assessed. The assessor can also recommend interim payments to applicants where they provide evidence of immediate need.</p>

  <p>Under the statutory scheme the Scottish ministers have no power to vary the determination. In ex gratia claims the assessor's role is strictly to advise ministers of the amount to be paid, but ministers have agreed to be bound by the assessor's recommendation.</p>

  <p>It is Executive policy not to disclose details of the claims for compensation paid to individual applicants without the express permission of the applicant. Accordingly, because the number of cases is small, providing the requested information on an annual basis could lead to the identification of individual claimants.</p>

  <p>For cases concluded since the start of 2001, records show that it has taken between 10 months and four years from the date of application to the date of final payment of compensation for a miscarriage of justice. The timescale to complete a claim for compensation is determined by a number of factors including the complexity of the case, the availability of supporting evidence on pecuniary and non-pecuniary losses suffered by the applicant and how quickly applicants can provide the specialised reports they wish to commission for the assessor&rsquo;s consideration. Independent assessors can authorise interim payments to applicants when consideration of a complex case may be lengthy and the applicant can demonstrate a need for immediate funds in advance of a final settlement. In cases that have been referred to an assessor in the last five years, at least one interim payment has been authorised in every case.</p>

  <p>Work is well advanced to develop and implement a data collection system for waiting times for key diagnostic tests and procedures, including MRI scans. Central data collection is now underway and it is expected that provisional information will be published before the end of 2006.</p>

  <p>In June 2005, I announced a maximum nine-weeks waiting time target for eight key diagnostic tests, including MRI scans. This commitment will come into effect from the end of 2007. Meantime, NHS boards are working to reduce diagnostic waiting times for patients through service redesign, investment in capacity and more efficient working to ensure that the target is met.</p>

  <p>All requests for MRI scans made by clinicians, including GPs, are reviewed by experienced radiology staff - normally a consultant &ndash; before a scan is carried out to ensure clinical appropriateness. This is designed to ensure that scans are carried out in response to appropriate requests while minimising unnecessary use of diagnostic resources. The Scottish Executive has no evidence to indicate that MRI scans are being carried out unnecessarily or that waiting times are being extended due to inappropriate referrals. The Executive&rsquo;s published target for the NHS is that MRI scans, together with other key diagnostic procedures, must be carried out within nine weeks of referral by the end of 2007. The NHS is making progress towards achieving this target.</p>
