  <p>We are conscious that there is a pressing need to clarify the misunderstanding about the extent of the present controls. The 1995 act controls were intended to apply only to international rugby union matches played at Murrayfield and Hampden at senior men&#8217;s level and not to other representative matches such as women&#8217;s or U21 internationals. We shall lay soon a Statutory Instrument under the 1995 act which will remove any uncertainties about the extent of the designations.</p>

  <p>Local licensing boards have discretion to allow the sale of alcohol inside designated sports grounds for non-designated events. In reaching their decision, licensing boards are informed by advice from the police. That advice will now routinely include an assessment of the risk to public order and safety made for each event or category of event. This approach has been discussed and agreed with the Association of Chief Police Officers (Scotland). The most recent example of this approach being followed was the decision to allow the sale of alcohol at Murrayfield on the BT Cup Finals day.</p>

  <p>There has been a number of representations made to the Executive recently on this issue, including those made as part of the Nicholson Review on Licensing. The current arrangements have worked well, and continue to play an essential part in reducing drink-related disorder and the risk to public safety in and around these events. For these reasons, we see no merit in changing the position at this time.</p>

  <p>Decisions about the appointment of individuals to posts which involve working with children and vulnerable adults need to be considered very carefully and a range of pre-employment checks, including a criminal record check, should be carried out. Where, in exceptional circumstances, an employer feels it is essential to appoint an individual to such a post pending receipt of a disclosure from Disclosure Scotland, but after all other pre-appointment checks are completed, the employer should consider appointing the individual on a temporary contract and ensure that the person concerned does not work unsupervised when dealing with children or vulnerable adults.</p>

  <p>As part of our plans for dealing with bioterrorism, the Scottish Executive has today published a smallpox plan. The plan &quot;Guidelines for Smallpox Response and Management in Scotland in the Post-Eradication Era&quot; is a revision of the interim document published for discussion and comments in December 2002 and reflects views expressed in that process. The plan sets out the arrangements to be followed in responding to a smallpox incident. Vaccination against smallpox is being offered to a number of specialist healthcare and laboratory staff, who would be the first responders in investigating any suspected or confirmed cases of smallpox, and therefore need to be protected against the threat of disease. So far 40 staff have been vaccinated, with more awaiting vaccination.</p>

  <p>While there is no evidence of a specific threat of smallpox attacks on the United Kingdom, it is sensible and prudent to ensure that the National Health Service can deal effectively with any potential threat. This plan, which will be kept under review, will contribute to that end.</p>

  <p>Copies of the plan have been placed in Scottish Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 32712). It will also be available on both the Scottish Executive website and SHOW.</p>

  <p>I have asked Graeme Munro, Chief Executive of Historic Scotland to reply. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Historic Scotland does not have plans to recognise the Napoleonic connection at Dumbarton Castle, until a more complete picture of this period in its history emerges. Dumbarton has clearer associations with other high profile historical figures, such as Mary Queen of Scots. By promoting this legacy, we can continue to attract visitors to Dumbarton Castle.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the total cost has been of hiring private recruitment agencies in respect of the recruitment and selection of individuals for posts in the civil service in each of the last four years; which departments have been involved in such contractual arrangements, and which posts were filled in this way.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2004-05-14.21.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80057" speakername="Mr Andy Kerr" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-04/wa0514.htm#17">

  <p>: The Scottish Executive has in place contracts relating to the recruitment and selection of both temporary and permanent staff. All contracts were let through a competitive tendering process.</p>

  <p>In relation to temporary staff, the Scottish Executive has in place two contracts, one with Pertemps for the provision of admin and clerical (Scottish Executive grades A1 and A3) and Junior managerial (Scottish Executive grade B1) staff, and one with Hays for the provision of interim managers (at, or around, Scottish Executive grade C1). These contracts cover all Scottish Executive departments.</p>

  <p>In relation to permanent staff, the Scottish Executive has a contract with Capita for the provision of recruitment services. This includes the design and delivery of assessment centres and other selection tools and covers all levels of staff. Capita are involved in the recruitment and selection of generalist staff at all levels and have also been involved in recruitment and selection for certain senior specialist and professional posts. This contract covers all Scottish Executive departments.</p>

  <p>In relation to senior civil service staff a call off contract exists for the provision of executive search and selection services. The three participating contractors are Munro Consulting, Thomson Partners and Odgers Ray &amp; Berndtson. This contract covers all Scottish Executive departments.</p>

  <p>The total costs of these contracts for the Scottish Executive core Departments over the last four financial years has been as follows:</p>

  <p><table width="100%" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">

<td valign="TOP"> <p>Year</p></td>

<td valign="TOP"> <p style="text-align: right">922,109</p></td>
</tr>
</table></p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>Costs for the Pertemps and Hays contracts cover only the margin paid to the contractor and not the wage costs of staff supplied.</p>

  <p>Some of the costs in relation to the Capita contract relate to joint recruitment/promotion exercise where it is not possible to isolate the specific element relating to recruitment. In these cases total costs for the combined exercise have been included.</p>

  <p>The increase between 2000-1 and 2001-2 reflects the move to both more sophisticated selection processes and increased external recruitment. This is consistent with the need to ensure we are selecting the right people, meeting staffing needs following devolution and bringing in expertise from outside the civil service.</p>

  <p>The increase between 2002-03 and 2003-04 is principally as a result of a major SCS recruitment and promotion exercise using sophisticated selection techniques</p>

  <p>The 1998 Scottish Health Survey showed that 82% of boys and 85% of girls aged 8 to 15 reported that they often found themselves near people who smoke. This included 44% of boys and 40% of girls who reported often being exposed to smoke at home. The Scottish Health Survey does not have sufficient sample sizes to provide reliable results for each NHS heath board area.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is not aware of any other comprehensive and reliable information on children being exposed to passive smoking in each NHS board area in each of the last five years.</p>

  <p>Results from the 2003 Scottish Health Survey are expected in early 2005.</p>
