  <p>South Lanarkshire Council has already received additional funding of &pound;549,900 as its share of the &pound;9 million announced on 20 June 2007 to assist local authorities employ 300 additional teachers and &pound;949,000 as its share of the additional &pound;40 million for the Schools Fund capital grant against future capital implications of class size reduction.</p>

  <p>The Safer Communities budget includes funding for community safety, for tackling antisocial behaviour, and for tackling drug misuse.</p>

  <p>Up to and including the current year, the bulk of funding for community safety and for tackling antisocial behaviour has been transferred in year to fund local authorities&rsquo; activities in these fields. From 2008-09, this element of the budget has been incorporated into the overall local government finance settlement.</p>

  <p>The total package for funding for local government for 2008-11 will be &pound;34.7 billion, representing an increase of 12.6% across the period.</p>

  <p>The Safer Communities budget in future years includes &pound;2.8 million per year, to support nationally determined projects on community safety and antisocial behaviour.</p>

  <p>The element of the Safer Communities budget which relates to tackling drug misuse consists of &pound;29.5 million/&pound;32 million/&pound;32.8 million for the period 2008-09 to 2010-11. This represents a 14% increase against the comparable baseline. As at present, it is intended that the majority of resources within this budget will be released to health boards to fund drug treatment and rehabilitation services, with a small amount being retained to fund centrally determined projects.</p>

  <p>The draft budget contains provision for the continued operation of the existing drug courts in Fife and Glasgow. The position of these is due to be reviewed in spring 2009 against the progress made with the summary justice reforms. Meantime there are no plans for further drug courts and no budget provision has therefore been made, which would allow for extended coverage.</p>

  <p>All schools are expected to provide health education, which includes substance misuse education, as part of the 5 to 14 Health Education guidelines. Local authorities are encouraged to address health education within a comprehensive programme of personal and social education. Drugs education includes controlled drugs, safe use of medicines, alcohol, tobacco and solvents.</p>

  <p>Scottish Government sponsored research on the effectiveness of drugs education in schools (published in March 2007) found that 97% of primary and 99.7% of secondary schools in Scotland provide drugs education with all categories of substance (alcohol, controlled drugs, medicine, solvents and tobacco) covered in all years. The vast majority of special schools (41 out of 43 that responded to the survey) also provided drugs education to either their primary or secondary pupils.</p>

  <p>The Health and Wellbeing area of the new 3 to 18 curriculum is likely to include outcomes and experiences that will provide teachers with opportunities to develop young people&rsquo;s awareness of alcohol, drugs and other substances and the associated risks to health. It will remain the position that it is for individual authorities and schools to decide the best way of achieving those outcomes.</p>

  <p>A ministerial task force on health inequalities has been set up to identify and prioritise practical actions to reduce the most significant and widening health inequalities in Scotland. A key priority of the task force is to look at the implications for the way in which we design our services and distribute resources across the country. The task force will report to the Cabinet by May 2008.</p>

  <p>In primary care, for example, we are committed to targeting resources to deprived areas through a range of measures including further development of the new GMS (GP) contract, the new pharmacy contract, dental access initiatives and a new school-based dental service in the most deprived areas.</p>

  <p>Through the Keep Well programme we are addressing health inequalities by strengthening and enhancing primary care services in the most deprived areas and increasing the rate of health improvement for those aged between 45 and 64. Keep well is operating in parts of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Lanarkshire and Dundee and will soon extend to Fife, Ayrshire and Arran, Aberdeen and further areas within Greater Glasgow and Clyde.</p>
