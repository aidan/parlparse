  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what national guidelines have been issued regarding the restraint of children when a party is acting in loco parentis; what duty there is on local authorities or other agencies to issue such guidelines; which local authorities and agencies have done so, and what monitoring is done in relation to the implementation of such guidelines.</p>

  <p>The Executive has commissioned guidance on restraint from the Scottish Institute for Residential Child Care, which is due to be published before the end of the year. Currently all residential care services children are required to have a written restraint policy according to the National Care Standards, and the Care Commission inspect twice yearly inspection against those standards. Monitoring is through that regular inspection process.</p>

  <p>The report only provides an assessment of the UK position, which is ranked third, together with New Zealand, Switzerland and the US, behind Hong Kong and Singapore. This high ranking is encouraging, and represents a considerable improvement since 1980, when the UK was ranked 21st.</p>

  <p>The report suggests that the UK could do better by removing obstacles for new business. The Executive works to ensure that all regulations are fit for purpose. In particular, for regulations which impact on business, charities or the voluntary sector, the use of the regulatory impact assessments is designed to guarantee that regulations are proportionate, necessary and fit for purpose when they are introduced and that they remain so over time. The Executive&rsquo;s improving regulation unit works closely with businesses and their representative organisations ensuring that their needs, particularly small firms, are kept to the forefront of policy making throughout the Executive.</p>

  <p>At present there is no strategy specifically to reduce incidence of osteoporosis in women. However, the Executive's measures to improve lifestyle, generally, by encouraging people to eat healthily, stop smoking, exercise sensibly, and if they drink alcohol to do so in moderation should, in time, help reduce the risk of some people developing the condition.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answers to questions S2W-8489 and S2W-8491 by Malcolm Chisholm on 8 and 9 June 2004 respectively, whether all Scottish Prison Service institutions have access to, and provide, speech and language therapy services, given that 70% of young offenders have problems with poor literacy and numeracy.</p>

  <p>All prisoners in Scottish Prison Services Institutions have access to health services on a basis equivalent to NHS provision. Access to specialist services such as speech and language therapy are available based on individually assessed needs, in accordance with local arrangements. It is for NHS boards to determine the level of service for its population, including the provision of all specialist services to patients who are prisoners in their area.</p>

  <p>We are not aware of any plans to use underground transmission lines, but it is for the transmission companies involved to decide how best to meet the needs of their customers.</p>

  <p>Capital costs associated with installing and maintaining the electricity transmission infrastructure fall to be met in the first instance by the electricity transmission companies. The activities of these monopoly companies are regulated and the Office for Gas and Electricity Markets (OFGEM) has to be satisfied that the investment is necessary before the costs can be recovered from consumers.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has carried out no specific research into the cost differentials between overhead and underground high voltage electricity transmission lines. However, in December 2003 a report to the European Commission entitled <em>Undergrounding Electricity Lines in Europe</em> reported the following cost differential factors in European countries :</p>

  <p><table border="BORDER" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="50%">

<td width="60%" valign="TOP"><p align="RIGHT">10</p></td>

<tr>
<td width="40%" valign="TOP"><p>Italy</p></td>
<td width="60%" valign="TOP"><p align="RIGHT">5.9</p></td>

<tr>
<td width="40%" valign="TOP"><p>Norway</p></td>
<td width="60%" valign="TOP"><p align="RIGHT">6.5</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%" valign="TOP"><p>UK (National Grid)</p></td>
<td width="60%" valign="TOP"><p align="RIGHT">15-25</p></td>
</tr>
</table></p>

  <p>Costs are subject to many variable factors including the technology employed and the nature of terrain involved. The report suggested that a construction cost factor of 15 for a 400 kilovolt underground line could reduce to 7-12 owing to lower operational costs over its lifetime. It was also estimated that undergrounding 25% of the high voltage and extra high voltage network in the UK would increase the cost of electricity by 3-5%.</p>
