  <p>Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency (SCDEA) operations are national in nature, concentrating on tackling serious crime which affects more than one force area in Scotland. Any operational activity undertaken by the agency in the Milton area of Glasgow would be part of a wider investigation rather than focussing specifically on that geographical area. However, it would be inappropriate to disclose details of such operational activity as to do so would risk jeopardising the work carried out by the SCDEA by revealing potentially sensitive information particularly in relation to on-going operations.</p>

  <p>The group which took forward the review of the regulation of the non-medical health care professions, led by Andrew Foster at the Department of Health (DH) in England, included representatives from DH and the other UK health departments, including Paul Martin, Chief Nursing Officer and Interim Director of Workforce at the Scottish Executive Health Department. Other bodies represented were the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence, the Nursing and Midwifery Council, the Health Professions Council, the General Dental Council, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, and NHS employers. The group also benefited from a reference group of around 100 members, which met in two conferences. It received wide input from over 100 responses to a &quot;call for ideas&quot; from significant groups representing patients, professionals, employers and regulators. It took oral evidence from regulatory bodies and from <em>Which?</em> magazine. It commissioned research into public understanding and expectations of professional regulation, and information about the regulation of staff in other sectors with safety-critical work, including in social care and education. DH also commissioned research about the regulation of health professionals in other countries, which the group used in its work.</p>

  <p>NHS Lanarkshire has a statutory responsibility to secure primary medical services for the patients of the Harthill GP practice. The decision by the partners in the existing Harthill practice to dissolve their partnership left the board with no alternative but to seek a new provider.</p>

  <p>The average rates bill per subject in Scotland is already significantly lower than the average rates bill per subject in England, and that has been the position since devolution. The estimates for 2006-07 are &pound;9,284 and &pound;10,601 respectively. As I announced to Parliament on 13 December 2006, we are cutting the poundage rate for Scotland in 2007-08 to the same level as in England. Our number one priority is to grow the Scottish economy and this latest cut will give businesses in Scotland a further competitive boost.</p>

  <p>As there is no uniform business rate across the United Kingdom, it is not possible to provide the information requested. Rateable values are determined separately for Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland, as are poundage rates. The position is further complicated for Northern Ireland where businesses pay a national rate and a local rate.</p>

  <p>There has been no reduction in the number of installations under the Warm Deal programme after Scottish Gas was awarded the contract. The tender document, provided to Scottish Gas, contains details on the available Warm Deal budget for 2006-07 and 2007-08.
