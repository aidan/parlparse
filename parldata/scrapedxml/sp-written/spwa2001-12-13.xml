  <p>The lease rentals that provide income to Highlands &amp; Islands Airports Ltd at Inverness Airport are those relating to airline offices and check-in and concourse areas. No concessions provide income to Highlands &amp; Islands Airports Ltd at Inverness Airport.</p>

  <p>Eaga have installed 300 systems and surveyed another 1,100 houses. They will have central heating shortly and by 31 March a total of 3,500 owners and private renters will have benefited from the programme. We do not yet have figures for the number of council houses but most authorities tell us they are currently on target to improve a total of 5,000 across Scotland by 31 March.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has a good relationship with the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and the sharing of information between us is frequent. We received advice from the MoD on the answer given to the Scottish Executive question on 1 October. I am advised that the MoD considered the precise terms of the question that was answered by Her Majesty&#146;s Government on 12 November and decided that a more detailed answer could be given. There is no difference in policy between the Scottish Executive and the MoD on this matter.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not itself plan or carry out any emergency exercises. This is undertaken by the full range of emergency services, utilities, operators of sites subject to the Control of Major Accident Hazard Regulations and other agencies, usually through the auspices of one of eight strategic groups across Scotland. Most exercises focus on one specific incident in order to ensure clarity of objectives and targets but occasionally these have featured another incident to test resourcing, prioritisation, management and other related issues.</p>

  <p>Any requirement to seek help from agencies outwith Scotland would not be solely based on the scale of the emergency or coincident emergencies. It might equally be for specific resources or expertise to augment limited resources in any aspect of an emergency. There are standing mutual aid arrangements in place across all the emergency agencies both within Scotland and the UK which have been utilised on several occasions in recent years.</p>

  <p>The conduct of the exercise and the lessons learned are still under review by the various organisations which participated. It is, however, possible to reply now from the perspective of the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>(a) The exercise was seen to be of value in that a number of new as well as experienced staff from across the Executive were involved at the off-site centre and in the Scottish Executive&#146;s Emergency Room and that lessons were learned which will improve practice in future.</p>

  <p>(b) The exercise postulated a fire on a nuclear submarine which was contained within the hull and did not result in a release into the atmosphere.</p>

  <p>(c) Scottish Executive emergency planning staff from Justice, Health, Energy, Agriculture along with staff from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the Food Standards Agency took part.</p>

  <p>From 1 January 1999 all British registered fishing vessels over 10 metres in length and catching more than two tonnes of quota stocks have had to demonstrate an economic link with fisheries-dependent communities in the United Kingdom. This link can be demonstrated in a number of ways, for example by vessels landing at least 50% by weight of their quota catch into the UK or by employing a crew of whom at least 50% are normally resident in a UK coastal area.</p>

  <p>In 2000, 1,627 vessels caught more than two tonnes of quota stocks and in each case achieved a satisfactory economic link, primarily through landings into the UK. The economic link arrangements have maintained the increases in UK landings and expenditure achieved by foreign-owned UK-registered vessels in 1999. In addition, almost 400 tonnes of quota was made available for re-distribution to the UK fleet.</p>

  <p>A full report by the Fisheries Departments in the United Kingdom on the operation of the economic link measures and their impact in 2000 has been placed in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>The 15 new NHS Boards, established on 30 September 2001, have brought together and simplified the governance and accountability arrangements of 43 separate health boards and Trusts.

  <p>NHS Boards are built on partnership between the NHS and local communities. They meet in public and bring all stakeholders in the local NHS around a single table.

  <p>A specialist nurse is defined as a person who has successfully completed a post qualification course of study in a specific clinical field and who applies higher levels of judgement, discretion and decision-making in clinical care in order to improve the quality of patient care, meeting the needs of patients within the speciality and in the specific area of practice.</p>

  <p>In practice many specialist nurse roles have developed in order to improve the quality of health promotion and care to patients with particular diseases such as, for example, specialist nurses for diabetic patients, and for patients requiring palliative care, pain control, infection control or those with breast cancer.</p>

  <p>Recruitment and training of specialist nurses is primarily a matter for individual NHS Trusts to determine in light of the clinical needs and service developments of their area.</p>

As part of this strategy the Executive&#146;s Accident Investigation and Prevention Unit will continue to develop a programme of engineering measures to address specific accident types at locations on trunk roads identified by the annual interrogation of the accident database. It will also be examining, in the light of recent research, what other general measures may be taken on the trunk road network to improve safety.</p>

  <p>The Title Conditions (Scotland) Bill will codify and reform the rules governing the constitution, validity and enforcement of non-feudal real burdens on property which will remain following abolition of the feudal system. Real burdens are conditions and restrictions on the use of land which are imposed in title deeds when land is sold. They are therefore used as a means of the private regulation of land.

  <p>Considerable progress has been made on the Modern Transport System proposals, which have been developed by the local authorities and other partners to the regional transport partnership (NESTRANS). The Executive is working with the partners on a number of proposals, and is funding the development and extension of the Transport Model for Scotland to include the North East.</p>

  <p>As required under the Scottish Parliament (Financial Assistance for Registered Political Parties) Order 1999 (passed by the Westminster Parliament), funding for the qualifying political parties is calculated on a relevant amount for a period multiplied by the number of members of the Parliament who are connected with that party. The relevant amount this current financial year is &#163;5,248. Based on the existing membership of the respective parties in the Parliament, each party is entitled to claim up to the following maximum amounts for 2001-02:</p>

                  </p></td>

</table></p>

  <p>In 2002-03 the maximum amount which the respective parties are entitled to claim will be the calculation of &#163;5,248 uprated by the retail price index for March 2002 for each member associated with that party in the Parliament.</p>

  <p>Payments are only made when the relevant parties submit a claim. Under the Order each qualifying political party must provide an independent audit certificate of all claims made for financial assistance at the end of each financial year.</p>
