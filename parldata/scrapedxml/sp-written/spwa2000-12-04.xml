  <p>Each health board is responsible for developing and implementing, in conjunction with other interested bodies, a policy for dealing with headlice infestation. The policies are aimed at ensuring that schools, General Medical Practitioners, Community Pharmacists and the general public have a good understanding of their roles in tackling the problem of headlice.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive will be working with health boards to develop a national leaflet to provide advice to schools and parents on the treatment of headlice infestation.</p>

  <p>There were 340 drug-related deaths and 1,103 alcohol-related deaths in Scotland during 1999.</p>

  <p>Under the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), drug-related deaths may be coded to a number of categories. Information on a specific group of these codes is published each year in a short paper prepared by the General Register Office for Scotland (GROS). The total given above was taken from the latest paper, which was published in August 2000. A copy of this paper may be found in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. no. 8433) or on the GROS website:</p>

  <p>(www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/grosweb/grosweb.nsf/pages/99ddeaths).</p>

  <p>As with drug-related deaths, alcohol-related deaths may be coded to a number of ICD categories. The total above covers deaths from the following underlying causes (the relevant ICD codes - Ninth Revision - are given in brackets): alcoholic psychoses (ICD9 291), alcohol dependence syndrome (ICD9 303), non-dependent abuse of alcohol (ICD9 305.0), alcoholic cardiomyopathy (ICD9 425.5) and chronic liver disease and cirrhosis with a mention of alcohol (ICD9 571.0 &#8211; 571.3).</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the EC guidelines on state aid to maritime transport permit exceptions to competitive tendering for public service obligations and contracts &quot;in the case of island cabotage involving regular ferry services&quot; and whether it will identify the relevant section of those EC directives, regulations and the Treaty which persuaded it to advise in <i>Delivering Lifeline Ferry Services</i> that (a) the service currently delivered by CalMac requires to be tendered and (b) tendering the whole network as one would not meet the requirements of the above mentioned guidelines.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-12-04.S1W-9787.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80134" speakername="Sarah Boyack" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa1204.htm#3">

  <p>The Executive is aware of, and has considered, the exception mentioned. However, Article 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3577/92 provides that &quot;whenever a Member State concludes public service contracts or imposes public service obligations, it shall do so on a non-discriminatory basis in respect of all Community shipowners.&quot; It is considered that that requirement of non-discrimination could not feasibly be met in any way other than through tendering the services.</p>

  <p>No decisions have yet been taken on how services should be grouped for tendering purposes. Following representations to the European Commission, at both ministerial and official level, it appears most unlikely that the Commission would accept that tendering the network as a whole would meet their requirements.</p>

  <p>Information is not collected on &quot;drop-out rates&quot;. However, data published on 6 October 2000 for 1998-99 indicates that 7% of young entrants and 13% of mature entrants did not continue their studies following the year of entry to higher education in Scotland - an improvement on the 9% and 16% of the previous year. The data also projected that 16% of all full-time students starting a first degree course in Scotland are not expected to obtain a qualification nor transfer to another HE institution. The full report on the latest Performance Indicators will shortly be available through the Scottish Parliament Information Centre.</p>

  <p>The Glasgow Housing Partnership Steering Group was set up to develop a framework within which a transfer proposal could be developed. The work of the steering group ceased to function on the publication of the framework document <i>Better Homes Stronger Communities</i> in April 2000. Since then the Interim Management Committee of the Glasgow Housing Association was formed to take forward the development of the proposal. The names of the members of that committee are available from the Glasgow Housing Association.</p>

  <p>The following table shows the number of summary trials called and adjourned at Glasgow Sheriff Court during the period from September 1999 to August 2000. Trials can be adjourned for a variety of reasons including, for example, the unavailability of witnesses.

  <p>The attached table shows the number of civil proofs fixed at Glasgow Sheriff Court during the period from September 1999 to August 2000. The 12-week target was met throughout the period with the exception of December 1999 when the period increased to 15 weeks. The table also provides information on the percentage of proofs/debates adjourned due to lack of court time.</p>

  <p>While trial diets may be available within the 12-week period, dates for individual cases may be fixed outwith this timescale to suit the convenience of the parties to the action at the request of solicitors.</p>

  <p>Reports of suspected adverse reactions (ADRs) to medicines marketed in the UK are received by the Medicines Control Agency (MCA). A report may describe more than one ADR in an individual.</p>

  <p>As at 29 August, the MCA had received 7,742 reports of 16,527 suspected adverse drug reactions to the meningitis C vaccines authorised in the UK. Each report relates to one patient although any single patient may have had more than one suspected reaction. Of these reports, 625 were from Scotland and these correspond to 1,329 suspected ADRs, none of which were associated with a fatality.</p>

  <p>The <i>Framework for Mental Health Services in Scotland</i> set out a six-year implementation programme to September 2003.</p>

  <p>Progress has been good in some areas, less so in others. The Mental Health and Well Being Support Group has been established specifically to help agencies advance the implementation programme against the timetable and ambitions set out in the framework.</p>

  <p>The support group, chaired by Dr Ian Pullen, (Consultant Psychiatrist, Borders Primary Care NHS Trust) includes local authority and NHS professional membership, service user and carer representatives. The Chairman is also free to co-opt any individuals he considers appropriate to the delivery of the group&#8217;s task. The group have completed six visits of a rolling programme across Scotland to meet all partner care agencies and service user and carer representatives.</p>

  <p>The aim for all is full implementation by 2003 of a modern, flexible and responsive mental health service as set out in the framework.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-7241 by Susan Deacon on 1 August 2000 and the Scottish Needs Assessment programme report on multiple sclerosis (MS), whether it will assess the number of MS patients in each health board area who could benefit from prescription of Beta Interferon and what financial allocation will be made available for the prescription of the drug.</p>

  <p>Only certain patients with a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis are likely to benefit from the use of Beta Interferon. The question of whether an individual patient might benefit from this treatment is a matter for the clinical judgment of the specialist concerned, informed by advice and evidence about its use.</p>

  <p>Health boards receive a unified budget which includes provision for prescribing. These funds are intended to cover all pressures, including the provision of new drugs and the greater use of existing therapies.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-3949 by Mr Jack McConnell on 19 June 2000, to list (a) all Non-Departmental Public Bodies (NDPBs) which have awarded contracts in the absence of competitive tendering since May 1997 and (b) all such contracts involving NDPBs, giving the reason for not using competitive tendering in each case.</p>

  <p>The detailed information requested is not held centrally. I would refer Lord James to my previous answer. It is a current requirement that NDPBs ensure that appropriate procedures are in place in line with current Scottish Executive policy relating to procurement and tendering issues. The exact nature of the procedures and delegated limits agreed form part of individual Management Statements and Financial Memoranda. These documents not only set parameters within which bodies operate but also reflect the requirements and individual circumstances of each body. It is important to emphasise that in making such decisions all NDPBs have a responsibility to ensure fairness, accountability and value for money.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Information about staff turnover at Kilmarnock is not collected by the SPS as it is a matter for Premier Prison Services who operate the establishment.</p>

  <p>The level of staff turnover through resignations at SPS managed prisons was 4.6% for the financial year 1999-2000. Details for each prison and for previous financial years could only be provided at disproportionate cost.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive Rural Affairs Department currently has a &pound;300,000 contract with Lantra, the National Training Organisation for the land-based sector, which aims to promote the uptake of training in agriculture and production horticulture. The training is delivered by a range of organisations registered with Lantra, including colleges, employer-led groups, machinery rings and private training organisations. We fully support the inclusion of machinery rings in the group of training providers and have been encouraged to see the role and activities of rings expand in the past few years with the support of the Scottish Agricultural Organisation Society.</p>

  <p>Support for a flexible and skilled labour force in rural Scotland is one of many topics being addressed in the development of the new Strategy for Scottish Agriculture. The importance of training, and other related issues such as the development of business skills, better use of technology, communication and the transmission of best practice in the farming industry will be reflected in the strategy.</p>
