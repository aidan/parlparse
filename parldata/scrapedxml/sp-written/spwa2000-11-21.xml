  <p>Cancer is one of three clinical priorities for the NHS in Scotland and a specific research priority. The Executive&#8217;s approach to cancer research in general is set out in the answer to question S1W-10110.</p>

  <p>Prostate cancer presents particularly difficult challenges and is currently the subject of wide-ranging action and debate. In particular, the Department of Health (England) recently published a Prostate Cancer Action Plan which clearly sets out the issues surrounding the identification and management of cancer. &pound;1 million has been allocated for this and each of the next three years, specifically for prostate cancer, which will be of benefit to men throughout the UK.</p>

  <p>In Scotland we have established a Prostate Cancer Working Group to look at some of the issues in relation to prostate cancer, including patient treatment, specialist education and training and research.</p>

  <p>Scottish Trade International provides funding to Scottish Education + Training (SE+T) which is a joint initiative with the British Council Scotland and Scotland&#8217;s education sector. SE+T&#8217;s aim is to promote Scottish education and training expertise and in its first three years &pound;10 million of additional overseas earnings and 160 new entries to SE+T priority markets by Scottish institutions can be attributed to its activities.</p>

  <p>SE+T is also working with the Scottish Executive which is one of the funding partners, with UK Government Departments, the other devolved administrations and the British Council, in the strategy to attract more international students to the UK which was launched by the Prime Minister in June 1999. As part of the strategy, a three-year worldwide marketing campaign is being undertaken based around a UK Education Brand. A Scottish version of the Brand logo and a separate brochure promoting Scottish education have been produced.</p>

  <p>Scottish Trade International also continues to provide specialist advice and support to individual institutions and assistance towards participation in overseas missions.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the &pound;44 million in NHS cash balances referred to on page 15 of <i>Making a Difference for Scotland: Spending Plans for Scotland 2000-01 to 2003-04</i> could be used to repay debt in the health service.</p>

  <p>The NHS financial regime requires that Trusts make a 6% return on capital assets. This 6% is paid through a mixture of dividends on public dividend capital (effectively a payment reflecting the value of public sector capital tied-up in the Trust) and interest on debt. Even if the debt were repaid, a return of 6% would still be charged. There would therefore be no benefit if the NHS debt were repaid.</p>

  <p>The redeployment of this money was part of a general reallocation package announced on 6 October 1999, which included extra funds for health.</p>

  <p>The arrangement for using the money to redeem housing debt, as part of housing stock transfer schemes, is a novel scheme for making good use of money which would otherwise have had to be returned to the Treasury.</p>

  <p>This &pound;44 million surplus money arose out of the internal market in the NHS, created by the previous UK Government. Under Treasury rules the money was frozen and conferred no additional spending power, and ordinarily it would have been returned to the Treasury.</p>

  <p>In order to keep this money in Scotland, officials negotiated an agreement with the Treasury. As it conferred no additional spending power it was agreed that the money must be used in a way which does not count as public expenditure. The repayment of debt principal does not count as public expenditure and it was finally agreed that the Executive could use the money for the redemption of housing debt as part of the Housing Stock Transfer Scheme.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Forestry Strategy is being published today. Copies have been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre. The strategy contains a commitment to review the Woodland Grant Scheme and the Farm Woodland Premium Scheme to ensure that greater focus can be given to implementing the priorities identified in both the Forestry Strategy and the forthcoming Agriculture Strategy.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>There is no widespread implementation of videoconferencing, although there have been small scale experiments. Videoconferencing is one aspect of telemedicine and is part of the remit of the Scottish Telemedicine Action Forum (STAF). STAF has been established to fund and evaluate telemedicine projects and to nurture interest in using technology to support and develop clinical practice. The approach is to carefully evaluate patient care benefit from the use of such technologies.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Stone Liaison Group, funded by Historic Scotland, is considering a pilot project to quarry a small amount of Scottish slate. Such an exercise would involve discussions with Local Enterprise Companies. Scottish Enterprise is willing to consider proposals to establish individual operations for stone production, including slate, at Local Enterprise Company level, once the location is known and following the preparation of a business plan. This would enable a view to be taken on the commercial viability of individual proposals and a decision on the appropriate form of support which can be offered.</p>

  <p>The treatment and disposal of controlled waste is regulated under the Waste Management Licensing Regulations 1994. These activities normally require a Waste Management Licence issued by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), the waste regulation authority which monitors to ensure that conditions set in the licence are followed.</p>

  <p>In order to encourage the recycling and reuse of wastes, certain activities, such as the spreading on land of some wastes which provide agricultural or ecological benefit, may be exempted from the full waste management licensing regime. Examples of such wastes are waste foods, blood and gut contents from abattoirs, paper waste sludge.</p>

  <p>Before such activity may be carried out it must be registered with SEPA, which enters details of the exemption on a public register. SEPA has powers to monitor and where necessary will inspect and monitor the activity to ensure that there is no harm to health or the environment.</p>

  <p>The EC Landfill Directive requires significant reductions in the amount of biodegradable municipal waste sent to landfill sites. Sarah Boyack announced, in reply to question S1W-6441 on 2 May, the results of a public consultation that examined ways of meeting these targets. 84% of those who responded favoured the introduction of a system of permits issued to local authorities for the landfilling of biodegradable municipal waste. My officials are working closely with the Department of the Environment Transport and the Regions on the design of a permit system, including the nature of any penalties for non-compliance. I plan to launch a further consultation on the details of how such a permit system would work early in 2001.</p>
