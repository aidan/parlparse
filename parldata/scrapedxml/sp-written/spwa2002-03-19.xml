  <p>It is the policy of the Scottish Executive to encourage the preservation of archaeological sites wherever possible through the powers of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979, backed up by National Planning Policy Guideline 5 on archaeology and planning and the associated Planning Advice Note 42, and through other National Planning Policy Guidelines (NPPGs), particularly NPPG 18 on planning and the historic environment.</p>

  <p>Where preservation proves impossible in the face of threats from development, the guidance given to local authorities is that the developer should be made to ensure satisfactory excavation of the remains and publication of the excavations. Where it is not feasible to preserve an archaeological site in the face of threats from natural agencies it is our policy, wherever possible, to encourage and support excavation and reporting of excavation of the remains before they are destroyed.</p>

  <p>More generally it is our policy to encourage provision of information, advice, guidance, education and training to help preserve archaeology.</p>

  <p>I have asked Graeme Munro, Chief Executive of Historic Scotland to answer. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Most of Scotland's local authorities either maintain, or have access to, a professional archaeology service on the lines defined in National Planning Policy Guideline 5 on archaeology and planning. The four current exceptions are East Dunbartonshire, City of Dundee, West Lothian and Midlothian. The last-named is actively pursuing the acquisition of relevant data and is negotiating access to professional advice.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-22124 by Cathy Jamieson on 4 February 2002, what proportion of staff currently employed in council-managed homes for children hold no formal qualifications, and, given that the training of staff working in residential childcare is a priority for development, what target has it set for such staff to secure such qualifications in the future.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-03-19.S1W-23315.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80178" speakername="Cathy Jamieson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0319.htm#4">

  <p>Fifty-two per cent of staff in local authority homes hold no relevant formal qualification. For all homes, including those run by voluntary or private organisations, 60% of staff have no relevant formal qualification.</p>

  <p>Targets were set in 1993 following a review of Residential Child Care<em>, Another Kind of Home.</em></p>

  <p>These were:</p>

  <p>1. "Local authorities and independent organisations should aim to achieve a position in which 30% of all residential child care staff, and 90% of all senior residential child care staff, hold a Diploma in Social Work or equivalent."</p>

  <p>At the end of 2001 26% of all staff, and 40% of senior staff, had a Diploma or equivalent.</p>

  <p>2. "Local authorities and independent organisations should aim to achieve a position, in which 60% of residential child care staff are assessed as competent at HNC/SVQ level 3."</p>

  <p>At the end of 2001 40% of all staff were assessed as competent at HNC/SVQ level.</p>

  <p>Progress to achieve these targets was very slow and that is why, in 1999, the Executive set up the Scottish Institute of Residential Child Care. They have already established new training at all levels and conducted the first comprehensive qualification audit of residential child care in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982, does not include provisions relating to land use planning.</p>

  <p>However, the Executive is currently conducting a review of the legislative and administrative arrangements for strategic planning. This review is likely to have implications for the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 and related secondary legislation.</p>

  <p>The Executive is also engaged in a consultation exercise on measures to improve public involvement in the planning system. The closing date for comments has been extended to 21 April, and the consultation paper, <em>Getting Involved in Planning</em>, can be viewed on the Executive's website at:</p>

  <p>The audit element of the review has been constructed to incorporate the information gathered by the RNID research report <em>Audiology in Scotland 2001,</em> released on 6 February.

  <p>Our core message is that all drugs can be dangerous. Through mass media campaigns, a new information line and website, all using the "Know the Score" logo, we aim to raise awareness among the public of the risks which drugs pose, to provide facts about drugs and to provide details of where help and advice can be obtained across Scotland. We are already working with Drug Action Teams to develop local communications strategies tailored to meet local needs and priorities. Part of this work is improving the quality and availability of drugs information materials.</p>

  <p>Copies of the information pack, which will be distributed to the media later today, are available from the Parliament's Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>I have asked Douglas Osler, Chief Executive of HM Inspectorate of Education, to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>HM Inspectorate of Education issued its press statement on <em>Moving On - From School To College</em> at 10:00 on 19 February 2002. A copy of the report was made available in advance to one journalist, on the understanding that nothing would be published until later in the week. The journalist complied with this understanding. Informal briefings on the subject area were provided in advance to significant organisations in the sector. One of these organisations issued its own press statement, welcoming the report, under embargo until 19 February, but giving no specified time on that date. This party's assumption that this would be acceptable was a misunderstanding of HM Inspectorate's practice in issuing its reports.</p>

  <p>An administrative error within HM Inspectorate resulted in the copies for the Parliament's Reference Centre being placed on their standard distribution list, rather than the advanced distribution list. This error was made known to HM Inspectorate late in the morning of 19 February and copies were dispatched as soon as feasible by courier, arriving at the Parliament at 12:40.</p>

The provision of labour market information is a key function of NTOs, a role that will be taken on by the new Sector Skills Councils, when they replace NTOs from April 2002.</p>

  <p>The <em>Future Skills Scotland</em> unit has recently commissioned the first-ever Scottish Employers Skill Survey, the fieldwork for which will take place during April/May 2002.

  <p>Research was commissioned by the Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department (SEERAD) to quantify the effect of green cover strategies for non-rotational set-aside on losses of nitrogen and phosphorus to watercourses. The research was completed by the Scottish Agricultural College (SAC) in March 1998. Results from this study show that when set-aside land is sown with a dense green cover with a high content of ryegrass, it has the potential of minimising nitrate leaching to watercourses. If a cover crop is not established on the set-aside land and there is subsequent late ploughing, this results in a high loss of nitrate from agricultural land to water courses.</p>

  <p>The benefits of set-aside in minimising nitrate losses were also confirmed by earlier work commissioned from the SAC by the department (in 1993) which measured and modelled the nitrogen cycle in soils under various agricultural systems including set-aside over three to four years.</p>

  <p>The research and its conclusions have been taken into account by SAC in preparation of the draft Regulatory Impact Assessment commissioned by SEERAD for the proposed nitrate vulnerable zone action programmes.</p>

  <p>Poor forestry practices can lead to nitrate pollution and, although the EC Nitrates Directive does not apply to forests, the new revision of the Forestry Commission's Forests and Water Guidelines takes account of the directive, and recommends that foresters observe the restrictions placed on agriculture.</p>

  <p>The evidence from Scottish Environment Protection Agency sampling of surface waters in upland catchments, where forestry is prevalent, indicates low nitrate levels and that adherence to the guidelines is preventing pollution.</p>

  <p>No specific information has been gathered by the department on this matter. General advice on the exchange of water between groundwaters and watercourses has been obtained by the department from the British Geological Survey as part of its report <em>Groundwater nitrate vulnerable zones for Scotland</em> (Bib. number 18567). Groundwater is, of course, recharged with water from the soil and watercourses. In Scotland, however, rainfall is generally high and therefore main, trunk sections of rivers tend not to lose water to aquifers, but rather gain in volume through groundwater discharges along their length. The rate of this "baseflow" movement varies with a number of factors, including permeability of the aquifer. During periods of flood, river water can recharge river gravels, but only as temporary storage and within months the water generally returns to the river.</p>

  <p>Source: British Survey of Fertiliser Practice</p>

  <p>Annual changes in relative cropping areas, as well as any change in fertiliser practice for individual crops, may affect nutrient application rates when aggregated across the main crop groupings such as all tillage, all grass and crops and grass.</p>

  <p>Unusual seasonal weather can also influence fertiliser usage in some years.</p>

  <p>The unusually low overall nitrogen application rates for north east Scotland in 1997 is explained by the fact that there were very few fields sampled in that area that year (only 141 fields compared with 550 fields in the 2000 sample). Moreover, the fields that were sampled in the north east in 1997 predominantly grew spring barley and root crops for stockfeed, where nitrogen application rates are typically low. The 2000 sample on the other hand included fields growing winter wheat, winter barley and winter oilseed rape, where application rates are very much higher. The small number of fields surveyed and the small number of types of crop represented in 1997 means that the estimates for the north east for the overall "all grass" and "all tillage" nitrogen application rates are not very robust and will have associated large standard errors.</p>

  <p>The outcome of the review was an agreement by NHS Lothian to fund services for Lothian patients in 2001-02 at the same level as applied in 2000-01. NHS Lothian agreed to consider future funding levels for sleep disorder services, in the context of strategic and financial planning for 2002-03. The outcome of the review in respect of other NHS boards which send patients to the Sleep Centre, was that additional funding would be provided in 2001-02, with future funding levels being reviewed in the context of planning for 2002-03.</p>

  <p>Information about planned funding levels for 2002-03 is not yet available.</p>

It set out a series of changes and initiatives within the New Deal programme - "New Deal: Next Phase" - designed to tackle harder to help clients, as unemployment rates fall, and to focus on the needs of employers in sectors where there are employment opportunities.

  <p>The key developments in Scotland, under <em>New Deal: Next Phase</em>, are as follows:</p>

  <p>Local Account Managers have been appointed in all Employment Service Districts in Scotland, to secure engagement with employers. Business sector initiatives are being developed, to offer opportunities to New Deal clients and meet the skill needs of employers.</p>

  <p>Targeted assistance is being developed for people with drug problems. Five "Progress2work" pathfinders are in place in Glasgow North; Glasgow South; Tayside; Fife; and Dumbarton, Argyll and Bute. These will be extended to the rest of the country progressively by 2003.</p>

  <p>There will be two Step-UP pilots in Scotland in East Ayrshire and Dundee, to provide jobs for people who have not succeeded in finding employment after New Deal. These will provide stepping-stones to work through guaranteed jobs.</p>

  <p>There will be two <strong></strong>tailored pathway pilots in Scotland, in Glasgow and Dumfries and Galloway, to provide a more flexible approach to New Deal for Young People options. These will allow personal advisers to combine elements of the four options, to suit the needs of individuals.</p>

  <p>It is not the Scottish Executive's normal practice to issue publications and reports on an embargoed basis. Publications are available on the internet at the time of launch, as electronic publishing is the quickest way of making information available simultaneously, with any press statement or announcement.

  <p>The Trans-European Transport Network aims to ensure the sustainable mobility of persons and goods across the EU. It includes all transport links within the EU that are considered to be of common interest, including the Scottish motorway network and a number of trunk roads, including the A82 between Glasgow and Invergarry. The EU may contribute up to 10% of the project cost of schemes on these routes. The Executive currently has no plans to make an application for Trans-European Network support, for any scheme on the A82.</p>

  <p>The Transfrontier Shipment of Waste Regulations prohibit imports and exports of waste for disposal to and from the UK. However, there is no restriction on movement of waste between parts of the UK. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency has no powers to control the origin of waste deposited at a landfill site, this is a commercial matter for a landfill operator, as long as the site is operated in compliance with the waste management licence.</p>

  <p>The National Waste Strategy provides a policy framework for dealing with Scotland's waste. One aspect of the strategy is the "proximity principle" that waste should be treated or disposed of as near as possible to the point where it arises, although this has to be balanced against other issues such as cost and availability of suitable facilities. The importation of waste into Scotland is therefore neither banned nor encouraged in the strategy.</p>

  <p>The Transfrontier Shipment of Waste Regulations prohibit imports and exports of waste between member states for disposal. However, there is no restriction on movement of waste between parts of a member state and this is normally a commercial matter.</p>

  <p>The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 allow a producer to join a compliance scheme which will meet the producer's recovery and recycling obligations on its behalf.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency and Environment Agency have produced guidance on various aspects of the regulations, including statutory guidance on evidence of compliance. The accreditation system established in accordance with the guidance helps producers and compliance schemes to demonstrate compliance by obtaining <em>Packaging Waste Recovery Notes</em> from agency-accredited reprocessors.</p>

  <p>This is a matter for West of Scotland Water. The Chief Executive's response is:</p>

  <p>I refer you to the answers given to questions S1W-22821 (on 20 February 2002), S1W-22907 (on 22 February 2002), S1W-23119 (on 5 March 2002) and to my reply to his letter of 15 November 2001. The procurement process was undertaken in accordance with EU procurement requirements. In addition, the whole process was modelled on similar tendering routes for major works of comparable cost and scale elsewhere in the water industry. EC Harris, an internationally renowned Capital Project and Facilities Consultancy, was employed by West of Scotland Water at the inception of the tendering process to advise and oversee all stages of this procedure.</p>
