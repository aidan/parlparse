  <p>The Scottish Government has regular discussions with police forces and local authorities concerning alcohol-fuelled violence and anti-social behaviour and is working in partnership with them to tackle this problem effectively. In particular, the issue has been considered as part of the detailed discussions on the review of national anti-social behaviour policy, which will report to Parliament shortly. Meanwhile two direct examples of specific action we are taking to tackle this issue is the recently announced Safer Streets initiative, in which we provided &pound;660,000 across all 32 local authorities to help them tackle alcohol related violence in our town and city centres over the festive period, and the national Violence Reduction Unit&rsquo;s on-going anti-violence enforcement campaign, which delivers coordinated police action to target underage drinking and additional visits to licensed premises.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government and Scottish Natural Heritage are working in partnership with the Scottish Homing Union to assess whether capture and translocation of sparrowhawks would be a satisfactory solution to the problem of sparrowhawk predation on racing pigeons. The field work for the project will take place in the first three months of 2009. As far as is known, no other research on this potential solution has been carried out.</p>

  <p>Helping all young people into education, employment and training is a top priority for the government and we have a specific indicator to that effect in the national performance framework. To support delivery of this, on 28 November 2008 we launched &quot;16+ Learning Choices&quot;, which will be rolled out across Scotland by 2010. The new model will bring a particular focus to improving outcomes for young people who leave school at the earliest opportunity and for those who need additional support to make a successful transition.</p>

  <p>Support for people with disabilities is a matter for a number of agencies, including Skills Development Scotland, which comprises Careers Scotland, the Skills element of the Enterprise Networks and Learndirect Scotland. We have been working with Skills Development Scotland to ensure all equality issues are considered and reflected within their corporate plan, which is due for publication in April 2009.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Since the implementation of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003, the SPS has sought to put in place independent advocacy services for those who require it. SPS is developing a service that meets the needs of mentally disordered offenders in respect of independent advocacy and it is moving now to address the needs of other groups with special requirements, such as people with learning disability and difficulty. We have been working with a range of partner agencies and organisations to provide advocacy services.</p>

  <p>The provision of school transport in Scotland is a local authority responsibility. In terms of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980, authorities have a duty to make such arrangements as they consider necessary for the provision of school transport and in so considering to have regard to the safety of pupils <em>. </em> Authorities also have a general duty of care under the Schools (Safety and Supervision of Pupils) (Scotland) Regulations 1990 to take reasonable care for the safety of pupils when under their charge.</p>

  <p>Scottish Executive Education Department Circular (No.7 of 2003), a copy of which is available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 29135), offered extensive guidance on all aspects of school transport, as did the more recent <em>School Transport: Survey of Good Practice </em>booklet issued in March 2007 which is also available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 45729).</p>

  <p>Although parents will have a very close interest in all aspects of their children&rsquo;s welfare, the formal responsibilities for pupils&rsquo; welfare when on local authority provided school transport falls to the local authority and to the transport operator. Accordingly, parents have a right to expect that suitable arrangements for a safe school transport system will be made by local authorities, taking account of local circumstances.</p>
