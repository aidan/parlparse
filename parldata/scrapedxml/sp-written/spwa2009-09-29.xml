  <p>The Scottish Government relocation and asset management policy is aimed at ensuring the best use of the existing government estate, providing the best value for money for the Scottish Government as a whole, and maintaining or improving operational effectiveness. This approach means that relocation is an option that will be pursued following a rigorous and transparent process that shows there are efficiencies for Scotland and that the move provides best possible value for money. Opportunities for relocation continue to be assessed.</p>

  <p>Details of the decisions on relocation can be found at:<br /> <a href="../../committees/finance/papers-06/fip06-32.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/committees/finance/papers-06/fip06-32.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of the comments of the Cabinet Secretary for Justice reported on the BBC website on 17 September 2009 that the Serious Organised Crime Taskforce (SOCT) planned to &quot;send a clear message to organised criminals that there is no room in this industry for those who want to use taxi and private hire car firms as a front for illegal activities&quot;, what actions it anticipates that SOCT will take to achieve this.</p>

  <p>On 2 June 2009, the Serious Organised Crime Taskforce launched its strategy entitled <em>Letting our Communities Flourish: A Strategy for Tackling Serious Organised Crime in Scotland</em> . This can be found at the following link: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/274127/0081989.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/274127/0081989.pdf</a> .</p>

  <p>The strategy highlights the actions that the taskforce propose to take to tackle serious organised crime in Scotland, including work to support legitimate business.</p>

  <p>The taskforce has set up a sub group to look at procurement throughout the public sector in Scotland. Recommendations from this group, along with a proposed scheme to allow public sector bodies awarding large contracts to seek advice from the new Scottish Intelligence and Co-ordination Unit, should help ensure that organised crime groups do not benefit from public money.</p>

  <p>Furthermore from 16 November all taxi booking offices where bookings are taken for four or more taxis or private hire cars will require to be licensed. Licensing will provide that those responsible for the operation of a booking office are subject to criminal checks to ensure that they are a fit and proper person to hold a licence. The introduction of licensing will provide closer scrutiny of the operation of booking office businesses and should act as a deterrent to unscrupulous elements bent on infiltrating the trade as a front for their illegal activities.</p>

  <p>The Serious Organised Crime Taskforce&rsquo;s strategy for tackling serious organised crime in Scotland, <em>Letting our Communities Flourish,</em> was published on 2 June. This set out proposals for a small proportion of money recovered from proceeds of crime to be reinvested in police forces to help increase the amounts seized.</p>

  <p>The additional funding announced on 15 September followed discussions between the Scottish Government and Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland who identified the most suitable forces to benefit from this funding. The funding being provided by Scottish Government will be match funded by the police forces involved. This will result in 11 financial investigators in Strathclyde Police, five in Lothian and Borders Police and three in Tayside Police.</p>

  <p>The role of the financial investigators will be to identify ways to boost asset recovery at police divisional level. Their precise remit will be for the chief constable of the relevant police force to determine. No monetary targets will be put in place but the effectiveness of the pilots will be evaluated and the Scottish Government is discussing with Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland the necessary evaluation and performance monitoring arrangements.</p>

  <p>There will be no incentive element for any individual financial investigator, police force or any other agency. We will assess the impact of these additional investigators on asset recovery and if successful will consider whether there should be further reinvestment in the forces involved or rolled out to other forces. We are committed to the very successful Cashback for Communities scheme and have no plans for an incentivisation scheme in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Funds recovered under the proceeds of crime legislation are distributed via the Scottish Government Cashback for Communities scheme, using a formula that reflects need. The formula distributes funds across local authority areas based on the percentage of 10 to 19 years olds, deprivation and rurality. We believe this will ensure all our young people benefit, but those areas with more need will receive more support. We will of course keep an eye on the impact of this formula to ensure it is matching resources to need.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers are committed to the Cashback programme, however, a small proportion of the money recovered from proceeds of crime has been made available to the operational units under the direction of the Crown Office and also the police service to help bolster efforts to disrupt criminal activity and recover more assets and criminal profits and ultimately help increase the money available under the Cashback scheme.</p>

  <p>Note: 1. The recording of aggravators has improved with time therefore caution is needed when comparing changes over time. 2005-06 is the first year where it has been considered that the use and recording of domestic abuse aggravator codes from the Scottish Government Court Proceedings Database has been of sufficient coverage to be used.</p>

  <p>The decision to accelerate spending was taken in order to speed progress on a range of specific projects, and work is continuing to deliver these projects. The associated spending is being committed in accordance with government procurement and accounting procedures, and will be transferred to contractors&rsquo; and others&rsquo; accounts as invoices are presented. We forecast that all of the accelerated capital will be spent in the course of 2009-10, as planned.</p>

  <p>Since the Antonine Wall was inscribed as a World Heritage Site in July 2008, the partnership group responsible for the implementation of the World Heritage Site Management Plan (which includes Historic Scotland, Forestry Commission Scotland, the five local authorities and other interested organisations) has begun work to provide an action plan to ensure that there is a consistent approach to access and interpretation along the line of the Antonine Wall. The action plan, being led by North Lanark local authority, will be complete by November 2009. Presentation guidelines and an interpretation plan, being led by Historic Scotland, will be complete by April 2010 and September 2010 respectively.</p>

  <p>In order to raise the profile of the wall &ndash; as a single monument- a new logo has been designed and agreed to be used for the promotion of the wall by the local authorities and community projects.</p>

  <p>There has been no additional funding allocated to date and each of the organisations is contributing expertise or funding to the planning. However, once the action plan is agreed, the projects to deliver a rolling programme of improvement will seek funding and this is likely to come from a variety of sources, not just the public purse. In addition, there are a number of initiatives already being undertaken by individual local authorities, local community and interest groups. These include the Space Unlimited Project undertaken with young people from secondary schools along the wall and the recently started Central Scotland Forest Trust community engagement project. The work of the Management Plan Group is not to prescribe such projects, rather it is to give a coherence and support to them.</p>

  <p>Plaques, to be erected in each local authority area, marking the inscription of the new World Heritage Site have been manufactured and will be installed over the coming weeks.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not hold this information centrally and this is a matter for individual employers. The Scottish Government has supported NHS boards in developing their occupational health services including the roll out of the OHSxtra model that provides enhanced physiotherapy services for staff with musculo-skeletal problems. The minimum standard for the management of manual handling is set out in the Managing Health at Work Policy guideline and all boards have manual handling training programs. These training programs will include safe handling techniques, risk assessment and the use of lifting equipment.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government led a wide range of procurement initiatives over the period as part of its Public Procurement Reform Programme. Audit Scotland&rsquo;s report on the programme, published on 23 July 2009, commented on savings it had achieved since its inception in 2006. Efficiency savings achieved by public sector bodies in 2008-09 are due to be published by the end of October 2009.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s Procurement Directorate also led 20 separate common (or collaborative) contracting initiatives in 2008-09, on behalf of both the Scottish Government and its agencies and, in some cases, the wider public sector. The estimated savings of these initiatives, as well as transaction cost (costs of processing purchase orders and invoices) savings through the use of the e-Procurement Scotland system, are anticipated to be between &pound;31.7 million and &pound;35.6 million.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has a range of measures in place to ensure we are achieving the best value for money from the use of utilities. We have developed, and continue to develop, a range of initiatives aimed at improving the operational efficiency of our building stock and raising awareness among staff of the need to reduce consumption.</p>

  <p>We also take steps to ensure that our procurement of utilities provides the best possible value for money as follows:</p>

  <p>Following a competitive tendering process under EU procurement rules, Procurement Scotland has awarded a contract for the supply of electricity to Scottish Power and Scottish and Southern Energy.</p>

  <p>This new contract aims to reduce and manage financial risk in the current volatile market conditions by adopting a flexible procurement model. This involves purchasing tranches of energy over a longer period within a risk management framework, and is similar to that currently used by Office of Government Commerce (OGC) buying solutions and recommended by OGC as current best practice.</p>

  <p>The public sector working together has resulted in annual cost savings of approximately &pound;10 million through aggregation of demand and buying flexibly on the wholesale market</p>

  <p>Procurement Scotland is also currently undertaking a tender exercise for the implementation of national contract for the supply of gas. The procurement strategy will follow that of the electricity contract and will commence on 1 April 2010 for an initial period of three years to 31 March 2013.</p>

  <p>In addition, Procurement Scotland is currently analysing the water market to identify and develop a strategy in line with the Procurement Reform Programme which will provide opportunities for benefits to the public sector on a national level.</p>

  <p>Carlson Wagonlit Travel (CWT) were appointed to provide business travel services to the government following a competitive tendering exercise undertaken by the Office of Government Commerce Buying Solutions. All government agencies have the capability to use this collaborative contract.</p>

  <p>All government staff are encouraged to consider alternatives to business travel, such as telephone and video conference, and only to undertake travel where it is essential for the efficient delivery of government objectives. Where travel is considered to be essential the terms of the CWT contract requires them to ensure that the most economical fare options are offered. In addition, earlier this year all core government staff were given fresh instructions about the need to minimise the amount and cost of business related travel. Travel costs and the frequency of travel are regularly monitored by government senior management and new arrangements are being introduced to improve this monitoring.</p>

  <p>The recruitment and deployment of supply teachers are matters for local authority employers to determine.</p>

  <p>Two of the recommendations of the Teacher Employment Working Group report published last year referred to post probationers and supply work. These are:</p>

  <p>Recommendation 4: Local authority employers should wherever possible use post-probation teachers to fill supply vacancies</p>

  <p>Recommendation 5: Local authorities should consider making more use of permanent supply pools to ensure stable employment opportunities are available to post-probation teachers.</p>

  <p>The purpose of these recommendations is to help to develop more opportunities for those newly qualified by reducing the use of retired teachers in supply. The recommendations on supply are for local authorities as the employers of teachers to take forward while bearing in mind both employment and age legislation.</p>

  <p>We are taking forward the recommendations of the Teacher Employment Working Group. When the results of the 2008 teacher census became available the Scottish Government immediately recommended to the Scottish Funding Council that intakes for initial teacher education post graduate courses in 2009 be reduced by 500 places. Further reductions to training places will be made in 2010-11.</p>

  <p>The Ryder Cup 2014 will deliver significant economic impact to Scotland&rsquo;s economy and project the country, its golfing credentials and heritage around the world through extensive international press and broadcast coverage.</p>

  <p>All partners involved in the delivery of the Ryder Cup are working to ensure these benefits are maximised and the Scottish Government is represented on a Ryder Cup Steering Group, along with EventScotland, VisitScotland, SportScotland, Scottish Development International, Scottish Enterprise, Perth and Kinross Council and the Gleneagles Hotel.</p>

  <p>As part of the build up to the Ryder Cup in 2014, EventScotland has committed to developing a range of golf events hosted annually in Scotland. These include the Senior Open Championships, the Scottish Challenge, which is beneficial to Scotland&rsquo;s future golf stars, and the Ladies Scottish Open which demonstrates a commitment to women&rsquo;s golf in Scotland. This support package has been in place since 2003 and will continue to 2018 and beyond to ensure Scotland retains a portfolio of quality, sustainable golf events beyond the completion of the Ryder Cup in 2014.</p>
