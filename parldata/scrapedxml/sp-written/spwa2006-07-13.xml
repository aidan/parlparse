  <p>The individual would not be informed because of the possibility of prejudicing a criminal investigation. If a DNA stain taken from a crime scene matches a profile on the DNA database, the relevant police force would be informed. A new evidential DNA sample would be required from the individual before that evidence could be presented in court. This would apply equally to a crime stain from outwith the UK.</p>

  <p>I have responded to the Competition Commission&rsquo;s invitation to comment on its investigation into the retail grocery market in the UK. I recommended that the Competition Commission address the importance of encouraging collaborative trading relationships within the supply chain so that the commercial viability of primary producers is not undermined by short-term price pressures brought to bear by retailers. I also suggested that there is a need to develop a more effective mechanism for dealing with complaints under the Supermarket Code of Practice.</p>

  <p>My response is available on the Scottish Executive website and on the Competition Commission website:</p>
