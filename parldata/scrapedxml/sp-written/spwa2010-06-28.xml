  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-33328 by Richard Lochhead on 5 May 2010, which stages of the production process for Scottish farmed salmon must take place in (a) Scotland and (b) the protected geographical indication-designated area in order for the product to be classified as Scottish farmed salmon.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government acknowledges that there are discrepancies between the single document and the specification, but European law makes clear that it is the specification that defines the terms of the PGI. It was always the intention of the applicant group that the early stages of production could take place outside the designated geographical area and that the saltwater stages of production are to be within it, and the specification reflects this.</p>

  <p>We would welcome industry efforts to address the discrepancies between the single document and the specification.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what preventative action it is taking in light of projections from the Royal National Institute of Blind People Scotland that the number of people with sight loss could double to almost 400,000 by 2030.</p>

  <p>There are a number of measures already in place in Scotland to help prevent sight loss, including free NHS eye examinations for all and diabetic retinopathy screening.</p>

  <p>The NHS eye examination is tailored to meet the needs of the patient, taking into account their history and symptoms, allowing the patient to receive, free of charge, an appropriate health assessment of their whole visual system and allowing for early diagnosis of potential sight threatening disease.</p>

  <p>Diabetic retinopathy is regarded as the leading cause of blindness in people of working age. It is therefore essential that retinopathy is detected and treated as early as possible.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Diabetic Retinopathy Screening (DRS) programme aims to promote accessible and equitable delivery of diabetic retinal screening across Scotland.</p>

  <p>The DRS programme is widely regarded as a world class service and has robust processes in place to ensure that all people who are eligible for diabetic retinopathy screening are offered it on a regular basis. The programme&rsquo;s report for 2008-09 states that 83% of eligible people with diabetes in Scotland were screened for retinopathy, exceeding the NHS Quality Improvement Scotland standard of 80%.</p>

  <p>This programme is very much a part of our wider commitment to ensure that people with diabetes get the best possible care, and we will continue to monitor its progress through the annual Scottish Diabetes Survey.</p>

  <p>NHS eye examinations, which allow the patient to receive an appropriate health assessment of their whole visual system, are free to all in Scotland. They are already making a significant contribution to the prevention of sight loss in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Work is currently underway on a revision to the leaflet <em>Your guide to free NHS eye examinations in Scotland</em>. Supplies of the leaflet will be sent to opticians and to GP practices and to CHPs to distribute locally to vulnerable groups. We will consider whether a wider circulation should be undertaken. In addition, there are some projects being developed through pump-priming funding, such as the Glasgow Ethnic Minorities eye care project, which encourage people to attend for NHS eye examinations</p>

  <p>We recognise that smoking can be a contributory factor to vision loss in some cases. The smoke-free legislation has increased the awareness of the risks associated with smoking and in particular the dangers of passive smoking.</p>

  <p>The forthcoming smoking cessation marketing campaign, planned for launch in the autumn, aims to increase referrals to NHS Stop Smoking Services to build upon the ever increasing reach of those services.</p>

  <p>Work is also ongoing to increase the number of brief interventions and referrals for specialist smoking cessation support delivered by all health professionals. Included in that would be the range of professions involved in the assessment and treatment of patients where there may be a risk of sight loss.</p>

  <p>Vision screening programmes are in place including, pre-school screening, screening for those on specific drugs and diabetic retinopathy screening.</p>

  <p>It is a central role of diabetes services to help support people with diabetes and make sure they are aware of the importance of achieving good control of blood glucose levels. This is essential to ensuring that the risk of complications such as diabetic retinopathy and sight loss are minimised.</p>

  <p>Diabetic retinopathy is a major cause of blindness. Our Scottish Diabetic Retinopathy Screening programme offers retinopathy screening to all eligible people with diabetes in Scotland.</p>

  <p>A number of initiatives are in place to ensure early diagnosis and treatment of sight threatening conditions, including:</p>

  <p>the NHS eye examination, which is free to all in Scotland, allows for early diagnosis of potential sight threatening disease. Optometrists can directly refer patients to the hospital eye service;</p>

  <p>the Scottish Diabetic Retinopathy Screening programme which aims to promote accessible and equitable delivery of diabetic retinopathy screening across Scotland. Diabetic retinopathy is regarded as the leading cause of blindness in people of working age. It is therefore essential that retinopathy is detected and treated as early as possible;</p>

  <p>a waiting time standard of 18 weeks from referral by a GP or optometrist to cataract surgery;</p>

  <p>treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration, where detected quickly. Treatment does not restore any lost vision but has the potential to prevent further loss.</p>

  <p>the Scottish Uveitis Network which, through collaboration and multi-discipline working, will result in significant improvement in the outcome of people with sight-threatening uveitis, and</p>

  <p>NHS boards can make arrangements with optometrists to provide services on their behalf which are normally carried out in a hospital setting. Under these services accredited optometrists with further training can provide a range of services on behalf of boards. A number of these services are in place, including low vision aid services, the Glasgow Integrated Eye Service, the Lothian Optometry Cataract Initiative and the Grampian Eye Health Network.</p>

  <p>In addition, NHS Fife has put in place a referral scheme whereby optometrists refer any eye problems directly to the hospital eye service by email. These referrals are screened by specialist nursing staff who allocate an appointment as appropriate. In some cases this allows non-sight threatening conditions to be monitored by optometrists in the community. Sight threatening conditions, are allocated an appointment within 48 hours.</p>

  <p>Recruitment and selection of staff is a matter for individual NHS boards. In the next few years it is anticipated that there will be considerably more doctors completing specialist training than expected vacancies. Boards should be able to design posts in order to attract the surplus of doctors available.</p>

  <p><strong>Frank Mulholland: </strong>COPFS receives reports of crime from Scottish police forces and a range of specialist reporting agencies. All such reports are considered carefully and decisions are taken as to whether it is in the public interest to prosecute or to take some other action. Each case is considered on its own merits. However, as an increase in the number of reports received is not anticipated, we are not forecasting an increase in cases taken to court during 2010-11.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how much has been invested in residential respite care in each year since 2007.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-06-28.S3W-34505.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80379" speakername="Shona Robison" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa0628.htm#8">

  <p>This information is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>Under the Concordat, the Scottish Government and COSLA committed to ensure progress towards delivering 10,000 extra respite weeks per annum. As part of the local government settlement, the Scottish Government has invested over &pound;4 million in the two years 2009-10 and 2010-11 to enable local authorities to deliver the increase by 2011. The funding is for overnight and daytime respite and for day care and care home, at the discretion of local authorities; it is not apportioned between residential and non-residential respite care.</p>

  <p>In addition to these specific resources provided by the Scottish Government, local authorities and health boards have spent their own resources on the provision of respite. Some of this will have been for residential respite care.</p>

  <p>Local authorities&rsquo; net revenue expenditure on support for carers, including respite care &ndash; some of which is residential care - was &pound;100 million in 2006-07, &pound;117.034 million in 2007-08 and &pound;134.740 million in 2008-09&sup1;.</p>

  <p>Note: 1 When comparing revenue expenditure levels in 2008-09 to previous years, there was a change to the local government funding structure in 2008-09, with the former ring-fenced revenue grants being rolled up into General Revenue Funding. As a result of this change, the figure in 2008-09 is not wholly comparable with the previous years&rsquo; figures.</p>
