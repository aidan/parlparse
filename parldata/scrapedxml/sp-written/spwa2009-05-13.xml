  <p>Improving levels of adult literacy and numeracy (ALN) is crucial to securing a competitive economy; promoting education and lifelong learning and tackling health and wellbeing.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government directly supports adult literacy developments in a wide range of contexts and settings through the work of the Learning Connections adult literacy team. These include:</p>

  <p>the Big Plus awareness raising campaign (with Skills Development Scotland);</p>

  <p>staff training and professional development opportunities for tutors;</p>

  <p>special projects concentrating on target groups such as the workplace, families, offenders, young people, and</p>

  <p>research and curriculum development .</p>

  <p>Community Learning and Development (CLD) Partnerships in each of the local authority areas comprising representatives from local authorities, colleges, third sector organisations, Jobcentre Plus and trade unions are currently responsible for delivery of ALN learning.</p>

  <p>Scottish Government funding for CLD Partnerships is provided as part of a block grant to local government and it is the responsibility of each local authority to allocate its resources on the basis of local needs and priorities.</p>

  <p>We have made available an additional &pound;4 million over 2009-11 to help improve skills for the adult literacies and CLD workforce.</p>

  <p>The current system of alcohol taxation is a historical anomaly in need of urgent review. Increasing taxes on alcohol shows that the UK Government agrees with our long-standing position that alcohol is not an ordinary commodity, but the UK Budget 2009 persists with the situation that allows high strength cheap cider to be taxed at a lower level than comparable beers and lagers. The Scottish Government wishes to link alcohol duty directly to alcohol content in order to better reflect the needs and interests of Scotland&rsquo;s economy and society.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s overall alcohol policy objective is to change Scotland&rsquo;s relationship with alcohol, and our <em> Framework for Action</em> (Bib. number 47805) sets out a series of measures to work towards achieving this. Some are specific legislative measures designed to effect change in the short-term and others focus on creating cultural change over a much longer period. There is strong and consistent evidence linking the price of alcohol to the demand for alcohol - increasing the price of alcohol reduces consumption and alcohol-related harm. That is why minimum pricing is one of the measures we are proposing to introduce. The increase in alcohol duty in the UK Budget 2009 is a 2% rise in all duty rates for alcohol, which maintains the position whereby, for instance, Scotch whisky is taxed unfairly compared to other alcohol products. A policy of minimum pricing targets price increases at drinks that are sold cheaply relative to their alcohol content, and cheaper alcoholic drinks tend to be bought more by harmful and hazardous drinkers than moderate drinkers. Studies show that such drinks are also attractive to young people.</p>

  <p>No assessment has been made of the impact on consumption of the rising cost of alcohol following the increase in alcohol duty in the UK Budget 2009. However, we note that the UK Government&rsquo;s position is that the purpose of alcohol duty is to raise revenue and not to tackle alcohol-related harm. In addition, any increase in taxation on alcohol is not always reflected in the price the consumer pays. Unlike minimum pricing, any increase in taxation on alcoholic drinks can be absorbed by the retailer, passed on to the customer through other products, or absorbed by the producer. Even with the tax rise, alcoholic drinks can still be sold at irresponsibly low prices.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government believes that the entire system of alcohol duty needs to be reformed. For example, it makes little sense to tax the alcohol content of Scotch Whisky more heavily than that of wine or beer, or to tax 4% ABV lager more heavily than 7.5% ABV cider. Across-the-board increases in alcohol duty, as foreseen by the duty escalator, fail to address this crucial issue and fail to support the Scotch whisky industry.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises that the links between animal and human health are important to the economy and puts significant effort into protecting public health from disease threats that are derived from animals. Examples of this are the veterinary surveillance operations carried out by the Scottish Agricultural College, the inspection work that is supported by the Food Standards Agency Scotland and carried out by the Meat Hygiene Service, and investment in research and development to develop more efficient and cost-effective diagnostic and pathogen typing tools.</p>

  <p>For the purposes of this answer, &quot;fragility fracture&quot; has been interpreted to mean a fracture that occurs, through minimal trauma, in bone that is pathologically impaired. The occurrence of a fragility fracture is often the first sign that an individual has osteoporosis and is at higher risk of sustaining a future fracture.</p>

  <p>According to the Information Services Division of NHS National Services Scotland, the number of hospital discharges in Scotland relating to fractures in which osteoporosis was also recorded was</p>

  <p>8,686 in 2006;</p>

  <p>8,586 in 2007, and</p>

  <p>8,412 in 2008.</p>

  <p>The vast majority of these fractures will relate to osteoporosis, although a small proportion will relate to malignant disease and other bone pathologies. Some may also relate to trauma.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government encourages the prescribing of generic medicines where clinically appropriate. However, where a branded medicine is still protected by patent generic copies are not available to be dispensed. Also, in certain circumstances, the use of the branded medicine is necessary for clinical reasons. Prescribing advisers within NHS boards and Community Health Partnerships support prescribers to make effective use of generic medicines.</p>

  <p>This is a matter for the Cairngorms National Park Authority to address in the Park Plan and the Local Development Plan. The Cairngorms Park Plan specifies affordable and sustainable housing as one of its seven priorities for action. The last annual report on delivery of the National Park Plan (2007-2008) sets out action taken to date on this issue, and is available through the following link <a href="http://www.cairngorms.co.uk/nationalparkplan/abouttheplan/" target="_blank">http://www.cairngorms.co.uk/nationalparkplan/abouttheplan/</a></p>

  <p>The Cairngorms Local Plan (currently entering its Public Inquiry phase) sets out policies for increasing affordable housing in the area.</p>

  <p>The National Park Plans were prepared by the National Park Authorities in partnership with many organisations, businesses and individuals. Similarly the implementation of the park plans is a collective effort and it is the National Park Authorities who are assessing progress in achieving plan outcomes for 2012. The Cairngorms National Park Authority published a progress report in 2008 and the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park Authority will be doing so in the course of 2009.</p>

  <p>In November 2008, Michael Russell the then Minister for Environment announced the recommendations of the National Parks Review, and expressed the view that these had significant potential to produce improvements in the delivery of national parks policy. In the light of this and in the interests of reducing bureaucracy, he decided not to proceed with a second stage of review.</p>

  <p>NHS boards consider applications to open community pharmacies in line with the NHS (Pharmaceutical Services)(Scotland) Regulations 1995. These provide the framework for the handling of applications and associated appeals and leave discretion with NHS boards to determine the outcome of an application. We have not issued further directions or guidance to NHS boards. They must satisfy themselves that the provision of pharmaceutical services at the premises named in the application is necessary or desirable in order to secure provision of pharmaceutical services in the neighbourhood in which the premises are located.

  <p>The cost of providing public services depends on many variables, including pay costs, the level of prices in the economy generally, and the standards of service provided. The number of people to whom a service is provided also affects overall costs. The biggest impact on future public services will not, however, come from changes to Scotland&rsquo;s population, but instead from the proposed &pound;500 million cut in Scottish spending next year and the forecast real terms cuts over the period of the next spending review.</p>
