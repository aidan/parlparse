  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will follow the advice of Friends of the Earth Scotland, the Scottish Climate Change Business Delivery Group, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and others and set a cumulative target for greenhouse gas reductions as well as a point target thereby fixing the trajectory of reductions over the long term.</p>

  <p>The annual target approach in the Climate Change (Scotland) Bill contains many of the key elements inherent in a cumulative emissions budget.</p>

  <p>By setting batches of statutory annual targets based on expert advice and designed to deliver the point targets prescribed by the Bill, there will always be between 12 and 17 years for which Scotland&rsquo;s total permissible cumulative emissions are defined. For example, by October 2011, ministers must have set annual targets up to 2027. That will fix almost half of the total emissions reduction trajectory to 2050.</p>

  <p>Crucially, however, the model in the Bill also provides the flexibility necessary to react to the many uncertainties which lie ahead in the four decades to 2050.</p>

  <p>International action to reduce emissions is vital in combating climate change.</p>

  <p>The Scottish ministers recognise the importance of showing leadership on climate change. That is why the Climate Change (Scotland) Bill commits to reducing Scotland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% by 2050 and sets an ambitious interim target of reducing emissions by at least 34% by 2020 with a statutory requirement to move to a reduction of at least 42% as soon as the European Union adopts a 30% reduction target for 2020.</p>

  <p>The Scottish ministers also recognise the importance of not waiting until the later years in the period to 2050 before making significant cuts in emissions. That is why the Bill requires statutory annual targets to be set in batches, with advice from an expert body and for these to be set so as to ensure delivery of the Bill&rsquo;s point targets, in particular in the context of early action, that for 2020.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it considers that setting point targets for combating climate change without considering cumulative emissions increases the possibility of climate feedback by exceeding a safer level of total emissions over the longer term and thereby mitigating any point reduction achieved.</p>

  <p>The cumulative effect of greenhouse gas emissions is recognised by the emissions reduction framework in the Climate Change (Scotland) Bill.</p>

  <p>By setting batches of annual targets based on expert advice there will always be between 12 and 17 years for which Scotland&rsquo;s total permissible cumulative emissions are defined. For example, by October 2011, ministers must have set statutory annual targets up to 2027. That will fix almost half of the total emissions reduction trajectory to 2050.</p>

  <p>In retaining the sensible flexibility necessary to respond to the many uncertainties which lie ahead in the four decades to 2050, the Bill contains the safeguard that the Scottish ministers must always seek expert advice before setting any batches of annual targets. The Bill also requires that the Scottish ministers must have regard to a number of target-setting criteria, the first of which is expert advice on climate change.</p>

  <p>To date, the Scottish Government has committed to invest over &pound;13 million in the CashBack for Communities programme which includes diversionary and participatory projects for young people across Scotland.</p>

  <p>&pound;3 million of this investment was allocated to YouthLink Scotland. Funding distributed through the YouthLink local youth project grant scheme is recorded by local authority rather than parliamentary constituency. The following organisations in East Ayrshire received funding in the 2009 phase:</p>

  <p>A further &pound;1 million has been allocated to YouthLink for a second grant programme which is currently open for applications.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Football Association (SFA) are using CashBack funding to deliver a programme of diversionary football activities in East Ayrshire including Midnight Leagues (eight venues in 2008 and three venues in 2009) and Street Football (11 venues in 2008 and 22 in 2009) which were allocated a combined total of &pound;8,800 for 2008-09.</p>

  <p>East Ayrshire also hosts the South West School of Football, which is based at Cumnock Academy and has been allocated &pound;18,200 in 2008-09. A total of &pound;6,675 has been allocated to the Soccer One programme in East Ayrshire, in which nine schools are participating. CashBack funding has also enabled SFA football development officers to work with East Ayrshire Council&rsquo;s New Sporting Futures team to increase existing successful activities. They have also collaborated to develop a pilot street football project called Killie Icon, which offers talented players the chance to win a full week&rsquo;s training with Kilmarnock Football Club.</p>

  <p>Scottish Rugby are investing &pound;7,082 of CashBack funding in a range of diversionary school and club rugby activities in East Ayrshire. Between August 2008 and April 2009, nine Street Rugby sessions took place and 2,212 primary and secondary pupils participated in school-based rugby activities. The local development officer, apprentices and community coaches are working together to ensure that there are sustainable opportunities for young people to pursue an interest in rugby long-term. Two young people who participated in Street Rugby sessions in Cumnock went on to join Cumnock RFC.</p>

  <p>Basketballscotland is working to promote basketball participation across Scotland through the deployment of four regional co-ordinators funded by CashBack, including one in west Scotland which will benefit young people in the East Ayrshire area.</p>

  <p>The second culture strand of CashBack was announced in March 2009. The Creative Identities Project is an 18-month programme of creative learning activities, targeting young carers in particular but open to all young people. East Ayrshire is included in the West Central Programme Plan, which will be led by Glasgow-based partners Tramway and Glasgow Film Theatre. They have been allocated a total of &pound;343,600 to deliver projects across the region.</p>

  <p>Over the five-year period 2004 to 2008, a total of &pound;125.4 million court fines were imposed. For those fines still to be paid, &pound;4.1 million (3%) is in the process of being collected through agreed instalments and &pound;7.9 million (6%) is currently in arrears, due to part or full payment default. As most fines are payable by instalments the time for repayment, provided by the court, can extend across a number of years.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what its response is to calls by the director of the Centre for Drug Misuse Research at the University of Glasgow for the introduction of mandatory drug testing for everybody who is arrested, to help tackle drug addiction.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-06-10.S3W-23312.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80306" speakername="Fergus Ewing" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa0610.htm#4">

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to the question S3W-23837 on 12 May 2009 in respect of the future of the existing mandatory drug testing of arrestees pilots. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="../../../Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx</a> .</p>

  <p>The evaluation of the pilots found that significantly fewer arrestees had been assisted into treatment than originally anticipated, especially those who had not previously engaged with treatment services. Of the 3,308 individuals tested, only 223 were reported to have engaged with treatment services. The study also found that comparing the cost effectiveness of the mandatory drug test of arrestees pilots against arrest referral in terms of individuals attending assessment and engaging with drug treatment, arrest referral schemes appeared to be more cost effective.</p>

  <p>The funding released as a result of the government&rsquo;s decision not to continue the pilots (&pound;1.8 million per year) is being reinvested to make community sentences more robust, particularly with regard to issues of immediacy, speed of completion and visibility. The termination of the pilots will also allow police officers in busy custody suites to have a greater focus on other key tasks.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has published guidance for local authorities and schools on health promotion to support the implementation of the Schools (Health Promotion and Nutrition) (Scotland) Act 2007. The guidance includes information on substance misuse, including the prevention and reduction of tobacco, alcohol and drug-related harm.</p>

  <p>Section 2 - Safety of Pupils of Circular (Number 7 of 2003) the Safe School Travel Pack, provided by the Scottish School Board Association and endorsed by the then Scottish Executive, suggests ways in which school staff can assist in the operation of a safe and efficient transport service. This includes ensuring observance of a No Smoking policy on school buses (for example, by using supervisors or liaising with drivers), taking firm action against any pupil found smoking and reporting any driver observed smoking to his/her employer.</p>

  <p>Scottish Executive Education Department Circular (Number 7 of 2003), which is available from the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 29135), offers extensive guidance on all aspects of school transport, as does the more recent <em>School Transport: Survey of Good Practice</em> booklet issued in March 2007 which is also available from the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 45729).</p>

  <p>Curriculum for Excellence offers opportunities for schools to support the development of qualities of resilience and adaptability in young people so that they are able to make informed choices to enhance their own health and wellbeing. Guidance on the health and wellbeing element of Curriculum for Excellence was issued to all teachers in May. Schools should be planning to introduce approaches based on the guidance from August 2009 and to plan fully on the basis of the guidance from August 2010.</p>

  <p>An expert steering group on substance misuse education in schools has been established, to produce advice, guidance and proposals aimed at helping schools and authorities to achieve improvements, in the context of Curriculum for Excellence and the concordat with local government.</p>

  <p>The concordat with local government recognises that progress on reducing P1 to P3 classes to a maximum of 18 will vary according to local circumstances. Aberdeen did not make progress on this concordat commitment between September 2007 and September 2008. The Minister for Schools and Skills met with elected members and senior officials from Aberdeen City Council on 26 May to discuss this and other issues. It is clear that Aberdeen City Council faces a substantial financial challenge to overcome budgetary problems that have built up over several years going back to at least 2002. The council has a recovery programme in place and has received substantial support to deliver the programme from COSLA. Responsibility for resolving the financial issues ultimately rests with the council so it is well placed to deliver high quality services that improve the lives of the people of Aberdeen.</p>

Responsibility for resolving the financial issues ultimately rests with the council so it is well placed to deliver high quality services that improve the lives of the people of Aberdeen.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is aware that there may be a number of benefits resulting from Gaelic-English bilingual education. No information is held centrally on the number or percentage of Gaelic-medium pupils in primary schools that are taught French. The Scottish Government would expect, however, local authorities to offer further language learning opportunities to Gaelic-medium pupils both at primary and secondary levels.</p>

  <p>NHS boards receive annual funding allocations for both revenue and capital expenditure on the basis of a formula that takes account of a range of demographic and geographical factors.

  <p>Over and above these allocations, &pound;30 million of capital resources are allocated across NHSScotland annually to support the purchase and replacement of medical equipment. NHS boards are required to plan and prioritise the use of capital resources locally.</p>

  <p>There are no appeal procedures in planning legislation which allow for communities to challenge decisions that have been made by planning authorities. However, objections and representations from consultees and the public are an essential part of the decision-making process on planning applications. It is for planning authorities to give due consideration to such views when reaching a decision on planning applications. Forthcoming changes to the planning system will provide the public with greater opportunities to influence proposals through pre-applications consultation and decision making through pre-determination hearings on larger scale developments. Changes will also involve more information being available on applications and on decisions and how they were reached.</p>

  <p>Individuals can challenge planning decisions made by local authorities through the courts.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is already supporting &pound;2 billion worth of construction on schools - &pound;1 billion in projects that we have signed off or are in the pipeline and the Infrastructure Investment Plan shows authorities plan to invest a further &pound;1 billion over the current five-year period.</p>

  <p>We are developing jointly with COSLA the new <em>School Estate Strategy</em>, which we hope to publish shortly. We have also indicated our intention to announce later this year the next part of our schools investment programme.

  <p>No. The waiving of SEPA&rsquo;s charges for registering septic tanks has already been extended by two months to 31 May 2009, in response to a significant increase in septic tank registrations at the end of March, when the overall waiver of SEPA&rsquo;s charges for most new permits ended. I believe a further extension of the waiver would be confusing to the public, and is unnecessary, as SEPA does not intend actively to pursue unregistered septic tanks.</p>

  <p>Figures held centrally are aggregates which is the level at which outperformance will be assessed. Scottish Water reiterated their commitment to outperforming the financial limits set out in the final determination in their Delivery Plan update for 2009-10. The full extent of any under or outperformance can only be determined at the end of the regulatory period.</p>

  <p>Keeping financial flows clearly distinguishable is only appropriate where the funds have been placed in investment securities, such as gilts. As noted in the answer to question S3W-23198, on 5 May 2009, these funds have not been used to purchase gilts. The full extent of under or out-performance will be determined at the end of the regulatory period and will be identified as appropriate in Scottish Water&rsquo;s accounts in due course.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-23197 on 5 May 2009. Out-performance funds are not identified as a separately identifiable cash reserve. Scottish Water&rsquo;s bank deposits vary from day-to-day in line with the cash flow requirements of the business.</p>
