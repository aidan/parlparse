  <p>Based on experience in other parts of Europe where bat rabies is widespread and cross-infection of other mammals, including rats and mice, is considered to be at negligible levels, no preventative action here is felt to be necessary.</p>

  <p>The distinction between residential care homes and nursing homes was removed on 1 April 2002, the day on which the new Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care (Care Commission) became operational. The removal of the distinction means that there will be no distressing moves for those whose care needs change.</p>

  <p>The single term &quot;care home&quot; is currently being used to describe establishments which were formerly known as either residential care homes or nursing homes, and from 2003 it is planned to conduct a regular &quot;care homes&quot; census which will replace the current census&#8217; of residential care homes (run by the Scottish Executive) and the nursing homes census (run by ISD, Scotland).</p>

  <p>The Executive is currently evaluating its own information needs, along with those of the NHS and the new Care Commission. The need to collect, analyse and disseminate the information published in Scottish Community Care Statistics remains.</p>

  <p>Some information on convictions by class of drug is available from statistics collected from Scottish police forces by the Home Office. The coverage of this data is known to be incomplete and so estimates derived from this source for areas below Scotland level are not currently considered to be sufficiently reliable.</p>

  <p>Information on the main drug type involved in convictions for drug offences has been included in the Scottish Executive Justice Department&#8217;s court proceedings database since early in 2001. However, this information is only available for those convictions where the codes used for the charges involved were recorded under the relevant Integration of Scottish Criminal Justice Information Systems (ISCJIS) data standards. It is anticipated that nearly all charges involved in court disposals will become ISCJIS compliant over the next couple of years. At that point, sufficiently complete statistical information will have built up to provide more reliable data on numbers of drug offence convictions by class of drug for areas below Scotland level.</p>

  <p>The general principle, reflected in section 52 (1) of the Scotland Act, is that statutory functions are normally conferred on the Scottish ministers collectively and are then exercisable by any member of the Executive. This reflects the principle of collective responsibility under which the Scottish Executive operates.

  <p>It is not possible to supply estimated costs without a more detailed specification of the work envisaged. However, it is important to note that there are only limited opportunities available in terms of new species to exploit onto which fishing effort could be diverted.</p>

  <p>In relation to re-seeding, our scientists believe that the current levels of farmed cod stocks are insufficient to make any such scheme a realistic proposition. There are also likely to be genetic differences between groups of farmed and wild cod stocks that make the value and sustainability of such schemes questionable.</p>

  <p>The National Waiting Times Centre was purchased by the Scottish Executive for NHSScotland in the course of the current financial year, and it is already making good progress towards the target of undertaking 5,000 procedures in its first full year of operation.</p>

  <p>As NHS boards had already agreed their financial plans for this year by the time of the purchase of the centre, they would have had to make reductions in other services if they had been required to pay for the extra activity at the centre. Consequently, no charges are being levied against NHS boards for their use of the centre in 2002-03.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are expected to build their costs for using the National Waiting Times Centre into their plans for future years.</p>

  <p>There is no proposal to replace the Pollution Prevention and Control (Scotland) Regulations 2000 (PPC). However, the Executive has consulted on amendments to the PPC Regulations, including to the transitional timetable set out in the regulations for a number of industrial sectors. It is expected that amendment regulations will be made in the near future.</p>

  <p>The PPC Regulations replace the previous Integrated Pollution Control (IPC) regime, which controlled emissions from larger industrial installations, and Local Air Pollution Control (LAPC), which regulated smaller processes. Under PPC, existing installations will transfer to the new pollution control regime on a phased, sector by sector basis between 2001 and 2007. It was recognised at an early stage that it would be impracticable to transfer all sectors to PPC simultaneously and that it would be necessary to phase in implementation over a number of years leading up to 2007, the final date for transferring existing installations allowed under the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directive.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The intention is that the new private-build, private-operate prison will become operational as quickly as possible. However, a timescale for completion of the detailed project plan and timetable for procurement of that prison has not been set, since the timing will depend on a decision yet to be taken on the site for that prison and thereafter on the obtaining of planning permission. The SPS do not anticipate publishing the detailed project plan and timetable.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>It would not be appropriate to disclose in advance of acquisition which sites have been identified as possible locations for a new prison, since to do so could increase the cost to the taxpayer of acquiring whichever sites are finally chosen.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Figures relating to item 2.4(b) were given in answer to question S1W-25569 on 24 May 2002, but due to a clerical error they were omitted from the response to question S1W-31088. This information is now included in the updated table in document (Bib. number 25435), a copy of which is available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>In compiling this table, a clerical error was noted in respect of 2.4(d). This has also been corrected in the revised table.</p>

  <p>Under the terms of paragraph 8.5 of the <i>Scottish Ministerial Code</i> there is no regular procedure whereby final proof versions of policy documents can be made available under embargo to the media before publication. Such use of embargoes is normally limited to the publication of complex statistical and research reports. Any such decision to issue statistical reports under embargo is taken on a case-by-case basis in line with the <i>National Statistics Protocol on Release Practices</i> and it is expected that the vast majority of statistical releases from the Executive will not be subject to embargo.</p>
