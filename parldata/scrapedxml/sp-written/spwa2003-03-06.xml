  <p>The Scottish Executive has no plans to establish a national service for people diagnosed with autistic spectrum disorder. The provision of services to meet the health and social care needs of people diagnosed with autistic spectrum disorders is a matter for local health and social care organisations.</p>

  <p>We have asked local authorities and NHS boards to conduct a joint audit of existing health, social care and children&rsquo;s services. Responses are due by the end of April and an analysis of the returns will inform the next steps for developing services.</p>

  <p>The UK has a Kyoto Protocol target to reduce emissions of the basket of six greenhouse gases to 12.5% below 1990 levels by 2008-12. This is a UK-wide target, and action taken to meet it will occur across all sectors of the economy and in all regions of the UK.</p>

  <p>The UK compiles an annual inventory of greenhouse gas emissions to assess progress towards meeting this target. The UK Greenhouse Gas Inventory is prepared according to international guidelines. It includes carbon dioxide emissions from domestic flights (both civil and military) between destinations in the UK, including take-off and landing and the cruise phase.</p>

  <p>The latest year for which published data are available is 2000. Emissions of carbon dioxide from domestic aviation in the UK were around 0.8 million tonnes of carbon equivalent in 2000, representing 0.4% of total UK greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

  <p>Emissions associated with aviation fuel loaded onto international flights are also recorded in the UK Inventory but, in accordance with reporting guidelines, are <em>not</em> included in the UK greenhouse gas totals.</p>

  <p>We have put record resources into policing. As a result police numbers are at an all time high.</p>

  <p>We are giving all council-led Community Safety Partnerships a share of &#163;12 million over three years to identify and address local community safety priorities.</p>

  <p>We have awarded &#163;10.3 million to some 161 CCTV systems and recently allocated &#163;2.5 million to upgrade, centralise and modernise some of these systems.</p>

  <p>As part of the Local Government Settlement, &#163;180 million of Quality of Life funding for local authorities has been allocated over the next three years on top of an extra &#163;95 million this year to improve the local environment and encourage children and young people to make healthy lifestyle choices. &#163;7.3 million of this was allocated to Neighbourhood Safety, CCTV improvements and to removing graffiti and reducing vandalism.</p>

  <p>In the 2002 Spending Review the Executive committed &#163;30 million in order to tackle anti-social behaviour, the poor quality of the environment and to help local people build strong safe communities. The Executive will be making an announcement shortly about proposals to extend Community Safety Warden schemes more widely across Scotland as well as other community-based initiatives to address anti-social behaviour.</p>

  <p>I announced in Parliament on 20 February during the debate on Stage 3 of the Criminal Justice Bill that the Scottish Executive would set up a working group to look at how the justice system deals with people within groups defined by gender, age, disability and sexual orientation. We made this decision following consultation with Robin Harper MSP, and taking into account representations from equality groups. Final decisions on remit and membership must wait until after the forthcoming Scottish Parliament elections.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Executive has recently commissioned a team from Edinburgh University to take forward a research project to examine the functioning of the Appropriate Adult Schemes in Scotland. Appropriate Adult Schemes are designed to assist people with learning disabilities or mental illness in their communications with the police. The findings of the research are expected in December 2003.</p>

  <p>Recognising the misery and distress that flooding can cause and having resolved to improve current arrangements to address flooding concerns, ministers have agreed to implement the recommendations of the Ad Hoc Committee on Flooding Issues in full. These decisions build on our existing strategic framework for addressing flooding based on awareness, avoidance and alleviation.</p>

  <p>We will improve awareness of the risks of flooding through the provision of better flood risk information and additional flood warning systems.</p>

  <p>We will publish revised national planning policy to strengthen the ability of planning authorities to prevent unsuitable further development where there is significant flood risk.</p>

  <p>In addition to investing &#163;40 million over the next three years to reduce flood risk for 1,850 properties, we will reduce the risk of sewer flooding by continuing to encourage the use of sustainable urban drainage systems and working with Scottish Water to ensure that such systems are properly maintained.</p>

  <p>We will manage flood risk better by improving national guidance and administrative procedures for promoting new flood alleviation schemes.</p>

  <p>We will ensure joint working between local authorities, Scottish Environment Protection Agency and Scottish Water to improve flood risk management and will establish a national technical advisory group.</p>

  <p>We are helping those who might be affected by flooding by encouraging the take up of insurance by householders, in particular those in the social rented sector. We will ensure better support to those affected by flooding.</p>

  <p>Implementation of these measures will strengthen the existing arrangements to address flooding and thereby reduce the risks and the impacts of flooding on those individuals and communities in vulnerable areas.</p>

  <p>The national report on adult renal services, published today by our independent clinical governance body NHS Quality Improvement Scotland, indicates a generally high level of compliance with most of the standards which apply to these services. The report also makes a series of recommendations for improving services, and we expect NHS boards to consider these carefully and implement them so that they are able to meet all of the renal services standards in future.</p>

  <p>I have asked Bob Millar, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Communities Scotland is investing &#163;11.405 million in new social rented housing provision within the Dumbarton constituency over the three-year period 2002-03 to 2004-05. This investment will provide 268 new houses within the constituency over this period. Communities Scotland&rsquo;s funding is channelled through four housing associations, and a detailed breakdown of units/spend by association is as follows:</p>

  <p>I am very grateful to Sheriff Principal Gordon Nicholson and his committee for the considerable commitment they have shown in completing their deliberations in this complex area of public policy, law and procedure within the 18-month timescale suggested by the Executive. The committee's consultation paper attracted over 200 replies and the committee also devoted eight days to taking oral evidence in addition to its own programme of meetings. The text of the report is undergoing final editing at present, but it will not be possible to publish the report before Parliament dissolves.</p>

  <p>It is too soon to say how the construction of these schemes will be procured.

  <p>The Executive is committed to promoting improvements to service delivery in our rural areas. Through our mainstream policies and programmes, for example in transport, health and modernising government, we are working to improve the access of rural communities to a wide range of services. We are also targeting the challenges facing our rural communities in accessing services, through specific programmes such as the Scottish Rural Partnership Fund and the Rural Transport Fund. This is in addition to the action we are taking to implement many of the recommendations of the report, <em>Services in Rural Scotland</em> , published by the Scottish National Rural Partnership in January 2001, aimed at encouraging more innovative approaches to service provision in rural areas.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has been in discussion with Scottish Water, local authorities, Scottish Environment Protection Agency and UK counterparts about odours from waste water treatment plants. This is because it has become apparent there may be a gap in legislation in Scotland for dealing with this problem. In particular, English case authority has confirmed that odour from waste water treatment works cannot be dealt with by local authorities under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 as they cannot be considered &quot;premises&quot; within the meaning of its provisions. This authority is persuasive in Scotland.</p>

  <p>On that basis, the Executive intends to launch a consultation exercise on proposals for the statutory control of odour from waste water treatment works. Such a consultation will have the aim of the Executive, thereafter, introducing enhanced guidance and improved legislation for remedying odour problems from waste water treatment works.</p>
