  <p>The Energy Savings Trust publish information from the Home Energy Efficiency Database (HEED) using a standard report system on their website. There is no record held centrally of who accesses this data and for what purpose.The Surveys Branch within the Communities Analytical Services Division also holds a copy of the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) dataset for existing buildings. The dataset was obtained for two purposes:to quality assure the Scottish House Condition Survey (SHCS) Data, andto provide case-level weights which could be used to gross up the EPC dwelling data to counter bias in the EPC distribution to provide a national picture of the energy efficiency of the Scottish Housing stock. It is hoped to do this annually to derive a time series of energy efficiency trends - with a longitudinal element to determine rates of improvements by specific dwelling types.The surveys branch has also made some use of HEED data when comparing the SHCS estimated level of installations in an area with the level of HEED recorded installations. As the SHCS data is from a survey, the HEED data may on occasion record rare energy characteristics which were not picked up by the SHCS. The two sources complement each other as the SHCS seeks to provide a statistically representative picture and the HEED data is more indicative of the level of activity in an area.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-35533 by Keith Brown on 30 August 2010, how many of the 1,000 volunteering opportunities for school leavers announced by the Minister for Skills and Lifelong Learning on 17 June 2010 ( <em>Official Report</em> c. 27425) had been delivered by 17 September 2010, broken down by local authority.</p>

  <p>Since the summer, the Scottish Government has been working hard to help school leavers secure a place in learning or training. As well as the range of opportunities we previously announced, we have tasked Project Scotland to work with Skills Development Scotland and partners in the voluntary sector to target volunteering opportunities at those summer leavers who have yet to secure a positive destination.</p>

  <p>Many of our young people have successfully taken up places in college or training; this is the right time to target these volunteering places at those still in need.</p>
