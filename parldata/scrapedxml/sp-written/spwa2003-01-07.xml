  <p>There are only four common reasons for refusing applications under the central heating programme from owner-occupiers and private renters. Because the applicant already has full or partial central heating. Because the applicant has not lived at the address for at least one year, in which case they are advised to re-apply after a full year&#146;s residence. Because the applicant is a local authority or housing association tenant, in which case they are told to apply to their landlord. Because the applicant is aged under 60, in which case they are advised to re-apply when they, or their spouse, if any, is 60. Eaga do not regularly collect statistics on the number of applications which are rejected for one or more of these reasons.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many pensioners in Renfrewshire have benefited from the (a) Warm Deal scheme and (b) central heating installation programme in each of the last five years and how many are expected to benefit in future years.</p>

  <p>The Warm Deal was introduced on 1 July 1999 and the central heating programme was introduced on 1 April 2001.</p>

  <p>The information at (a) cannot be provided because the Warm Deal is not exclusively for pensioners. However, over 4,700 households in all sectors of the stock in the Renfrewshire postcode area have benefited from the Warm Deal as administered by Eaga to date. Local authorities were also given cash resources to provide the Warm Deal package for their own tenants and 2,445 tenants of East Renfrewshire Council and Renfrewshire Council benefited from the scheme between 1999-2000 and 2001-02.</p>

  <p>Two hundred and ninety-two householders aged 60 or over in the private sector in the Renfrewshire postcode area benefited from the central heating programme in 2001-02, and a further 203 have so far benefited this year. There is no age criterion for the programme in the social rented sector and so a breakdown of the number of pensioner tenants who benefited is not available. However, a total of 182 tenants of East Renfrewshire Council and Renfrewshire Council benefited in 2001-02. Over 580 council tenants and 40 tenants of housing associations in the area are set to benefit this year (2002-03). For the reasons given in the answer to S1W-31646 today, we cannot estimate the number who will benefit from either programme in future years.

  <p>It is not possible to project how much of the available resources will be spent in the Renfrewshire area between 2003-06. But funding in the two years 2003-04 and 2004-05 will ensure that, by March 2004, all tenants of East Renfrewshire Council and Renfrewshire Council who want it will have a central heating system and all housing associations tenants in the area who also want it will have central heating during 2004. By March 2006 all over 60s in the private sector in the Renfrewshire postcode area who apply for a grant and are found to be eligible for the programme will have a central heating system installed.</p>

  <p>The purpose of the closure of some of the North Sea fishing grounds in 2001 was specifically to try to improve the spawning chances of cod with a view to enhancing future recruitment to the stock. Evaluations at the time predicted that, at best, a 5% increase in egg production might be expected in the North Sea cod stock.</p>

  <p>The cod stock is routinely monitored through the sampling of discards and marketed landings and during a series of research vessel cruises. Annual assessments take place within the ICES framework: a stock improvement of sufficient magnitude would be detected by this monitoring. Additional monitoring was not therefore carried out. It is still too early to draw firm conclusions on the efficacy or otherwise of the closure on the state of the cod stock although it is questionable whether such a small predicted benefit to egg production would lead to a detectable improvement in subsequent stock biomass.</p>

  <p>The UK Forest Partnership for Action is at the early stages of developing an action plan, based on the statement published at the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development in September 2002. In this spirit of co-operation, it is for each partner to bring forward actions which can be incorporated in the plan. Partners include a range of industry and environmental organisations as well as the Scottish Executive, other devolved administrations and UK Government Departments.

  <p>The terms of service for GPs are set out in the NHS (General Medical Services) (Scotland) Regulations 1995. Except where a GP wishes removal to take place with immediate effect because of violence or the threat of it, the regulations do not require GPs to give reasons for the removal of a patient and consequently no guidance has been issued from the Executive.</p>

  <p>The General Medical Council has issued guidance to doctors which states that they must not discriminate against patients on the basis of their lifestyle, culture, beliefs, race, colour, gender, sexuality, age, social status or perceived economic worth. The guidance makes clear that it refers in cases where patients are removed.</p>

It is not possible to give an accurate forecast outturn figure for 2002-03 because the position varies throughout the year. NHS boards are able to carry forward up to 1% of their unified budget allocations in any one year. Monitoring returns from NHS boards currently indicates lower levels of underspend than in previous years.</p>

  <p>The review is now complete and the report is being published today. The key recommendations of the report are as follows:</p>

  <p>1.1 Focus on users and carers. The report makes two recommendations to improve the representation of views from users and carers to the commission and one to improve information and guidance from the commission to users and carers.</p>

  <p>1.2 Operations, efficiency and review. The report makes two recommendations to support current action to improve processes and one to provide a better focus for on-going review of the organisation by commissioners.</p>

  <p>1.3 Staffing, skills and staff appraisal. The report recommends a senior management structure which continues the post of director or chief officer as the chief professional and policy adviser and responsible officer in the commission. To support the chief officer, a new administrative post of business manager is proposed with a standing delegation for all management matters. The report also recommends that the appraisal process for all commissioners is made consistent; that the pay of professional staff remains linked to that of their respective peers; that skills shortages in internal finance and in medical practice are addressed, and that action is taken to further improve the operation of secondments and the motivation and management of seconded administrative staff.</p>

  <p>1.4 External environment and partnership working. The report makes three recommendations to support improved partnership working in future.</p>

  <p>1.5 Transitional arrangements. The report suggests an amended pattern of committee responsibilities and meetings to involve and use the specialist knowledge of part-time commissioners better, and also suggests some priorities for current planning for change within the commission.</p>

  <p>The Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland have seen the report and in general accept the recommendations. The Scottish Executive will now work with the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland to ensure effective implementation.</p>

  <p>A copy of the report has been placed in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 25847) and is available on the Scottish Executive and Mental Welfare Commission websites.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally. Only certain patients with a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis are likely to benefit from treatment with beta interferon and patients&#146; eligibility for this treatment depends on the clinical judgement of the specialist concerned.</p>

  <p>The UK-wide risk-sharing scheme for beta interferon and glatiramer acetate allows such treatments to be prescribed on the NHS to patients who meet criteria set out by the Association of British Neurologists (ABN). The guidance which explained the scheme, Health Department Letter (2002) 6, which is available from the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 20653), estimated that the total number of patients in Scotland who fall within the ABN guidelines might be in the range 1,300 to 1,560. These figures do not take into account patients already receiving treatment with beta interferon or glatiramer acetate.</p>

  <p>The specific duties under the amended Race Relations Act to promote race equality imposed on key public bodies by Scottish ministers earlier last year will ensure that our public services are fair, accessible and sensitive to the needs of all our communities. The UN International Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination does not add to or detract from these responsibilities.</p>

  <p>Noise from wind farms is more appropriately controlled by considering proposals in relation to acceptable noise limits rather than imposing a specific separation distance. <i>Planning Advice Note 45: Renewable Energy Developments </i> confirms that <i>The Assessment and Rating of Noise from Wind Farms</i> (ETSU for DTI, 1996) can be regarded as relevant guidance on good practice. A copy of this document is available in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 25773).</p>

  <p>Our vision of a vibrant tenanted sector is not based on the percentage of farms being tenanted. It is instead reflected by a number of factors. We want landlords to be confident to let land and for there to be strong demand for tenanted land. We want to encourage increased investment in tenanted land by both landlords and tenants.</p>

  <p>It is also crucial that tenanted land is used in a way that best supports rural Scotland. In this regard, issues such as levels of income drawn from the land, employment opportunities and other benefits that arise for the surrounding community and the way in which the land supports the environment are particularly important.</p>

  <p>The rates of student loan support and the thresholds for parental or spouse contributions have been set in such a way that no graduating student should have more debt under the new student support arrangements than they would have had under the previous system. Almost all young students are expected to have less debt under the new arrangements.</p>

  <p>The number of students who will benefit from the new arrangements in each academic year to 2007-08 will depend upon the numbers applying to undertake higher education courses. The extent to which each will benefit from the new arrangements will depend upon their personal circumstances.</p>

  <p>The overall level of funding is based on the proportion of the student population expected to be eligible for support under Mature Students Bursary Fund (MSBF). Funds are redistributed from the Hardship Funds on the basis of the proportion of the higher education student population in universities and colleges which started courses since 2001-02. Allocations are then made to each institution on the basis of the proportion of their student population which is assessed by the Student Awards Agency as being independent of parental contribution or which receives a supplementary allowance in respect of their having dependent children or of their being a lone parent. Each of these three criteria is given equal weight.</p>

  <p>An additional allocation is made to provide each institution with a contribution towards the costs of administering and publicising the bursary. Each receives a basic amount (&#163;750 in the current year) with the balance of the total (&#163;200,000 in the current year) allocated to each based on the size of their MSBF allocation.</p>
