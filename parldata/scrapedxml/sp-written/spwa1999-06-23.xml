  <p>The five yearly review of the Crofters Commission falls due during 1999 and will start in July.</p>

  <p>The terms of reference for the first stage of the review will be:</p>

  <p>&quot;To carry out a study of the Crofters Commission&#146;s status and of the relevance of its functions (Prior Options Study) in accordance with Cabinet Office guidance and having regard to the needs of crofting and rural communities in the Highlands and Islands and to any views on the future of NDPBs, and the various potential alternatives to these, which may be expressed by the new Scottish Executive.&quot;</p>

  <p>As an essential part of the review process, officials will be consulting widely with interested parties.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive <strong> </strong> is committed to ensuring that Health Boards in Scotland continue to work with their local authority partners in addressing all avenues, including financial, to reduce delays in discharge from NHS care.</p>

  <p>Over and above the &pound;800 million available to local authorities for community care this year, the NHS makes substantial transfers of resources to local authorities for community care. These totalled nearly &pound;120 million in 1998-99. It is our intention that additional resources will transfer this year.</p>

  <p>Following the trial of Ronnie Coulter, who was acquitted by a jury in March of this year of the murder of Surjit Singh Chhokar, Crown Counsel instructed that further enquiries be carried out to consider whether any other person or persons should be prosecuted for crimes committed against Mr Chhokar.</p>

  <p>The Procurator Fiscal at Hamilton has been conducting these enquiries on behalf of Crown Counsel and his report was submitted to Crown Office last week. The case is presently being considered by Crown Counsel and a decision as to any further proceedings is expected shortly.</p>

  <p>I received the final report today and am placing a copy of it in the Parliamentary library. Copies are being sent out to all local authorities in Scotland, to all Members of the Scottish Parliament, to all Community Councils and to everyone who responded to the Commission&#146;s earlier consultation documents.</p>

  <p>I hope that all members will take the time to read this well-considered and important report and recommendations which if implemented would radically reshape the face of local government in Scotland. I very much endorse the report&#146;s call to local government to start immediately on the task of democratic renewal.</p>

  <p>It is fitting that the Scottish Parliament should take the earliest opportunity to debate its relations with the other democratically elected tier of government in Scotland; and I hope that there will be an early opportunity for that. Meantime I shall urgently consider the detail of the recommendations in the report. I intend in due course to issue a paper that will set out the Scottish Ministers&#146; full response to the report and our proposals for further action.</p>

  <p>The function of Private Office staff is to support Ministers in the efficient and effective execution of their duties. Information about the projected staffing levels in Ministerial Private Offices is given in my reply today to the question from Mr Gallie. The estimated annual cost of employing these 50 staff is &pound;979,451.</p>

  <p>Ministerial cars are provided for Ministers of the Scottish Executive and of UK Government Departments when in Scotland by the Government Car Service (Scotland). Eleven drivers are employed at a cost of &pound;10,545 for each driver. They constitute a shared resource and are not employed in the Private Office of any Scottish Minister.</p>

  <p>Rural development will be one of the Executive&#146;s top priorities but real progress will only be achieved if there is an integrated approach at the highest level. Accordingly, a Ministerial Committee reporting to the Cabinet has been established with the task of furthering the economic, environmental and social development of rural Scotland. The members of the Committee are:</p>

  <p>Ross Finnie, Minister for Rural Affairs (Chairman)</p>

  <p>Sarah Boyack, Minister for Transport and the Environment</p>

  <p>Alasdair Morrison, Deputy Minister for Enterprise in the Highlands and Islands and Gaelic</p>

  <p>John Home Robertson, Deputy Minister for Rural Affairs</p>

  <p>Jackie Baillie, Deputy Minister for Communities</p>

  <p>Angus MacKay, Deputy Minister for Justice.</p>

  <p>Other Ministers will be invited to take part as necessary. My Ministerial colleagues and I are talking to a range of rural interest groups and the work plan of this Committee will be drawn up in the light of those discussions.</p>
