  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will welcome the announcement by BBC Scotland that it will be the fifth major sponsor of Glasgow&rsquo;s bid to host the Commonwealth Games in 2014.</p>

  <p>I heartily welcome the announcement. The BBC is one of the most respected brands in the world. It is synonymous with the Commonwealth Games and quality sports broadcasting. Such prestigious support is yet another demonstration of the strength of our bid. In addition, the bid continues to receive support from across Scotland. To date over 1.5 million people have signed up to Back Scotland&rsquo;s Bid.</p>

  <p>The Antisocial Behaviour etc (Scotland) Act 2004 defines antisocial behaviour (ASB) as acting in a manner, or pursuing a course of conduct that causes or is likely to cause alarm or distress to at least one person not of the same household as them. It therefore covers a wide range of offences, some of which are subject to criminal court procedures, and some to civil court procedures.</p>

  <p>Table 4 (a) of the publication <em>Criminal Proceedings in Scottish Courts</em>, 2004-05 provides data on the numbers of people convicted of offences that can be considered antisocial, for example vandalism, breach of the peace, fire-raising, drunkenness and other crimes and offences since 1995. This table can be accessed at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2006/04/25104019/13" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2006/04/25104019/13</a>. It is not possible to aggregate these figures to local authority level because some sheriff courts serve more than one local authority area.</p>

  <p>The act provides for the use of a wide range of different measures to tackle ASB. Table 1 provides a list of those measures in the act which are subject to court proceedings and whose use can be reported by local authority, together with data on their use over the last two full years.</p>

  <p>Table 2 provides information on proven charges of breach of Antisocial Behaviour Orders (ASBOs) in each sheriff court.</p>

  <p>Note: Statistics on ASBOs on conviction were originally sourced on the basis of local courts. The ASBOs on conviction data presented in this table has been related approximately to the relevant local authority area. Applications for Closure of Premises orders are signed off by the relevant police force &ndash; the figures are therefore collected by police force area and not local authority.</p>

  <p>Notes:1. This information has been extracted from the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service&rsquo;s case management database. The database is a live, operational database used to manage the processing of reports submitted to Procurators Fiscal by the police and other reporting agencies. If a Procurator Fiscal amends a charge submitted by a reporting agency, the database will record details only of the amended charge.</p>

  <p>2. The database is charge-based. The figures quoted therefore relate to the number of charges rather than the number of individuals charged or the number of incidents that gave rise to such charges.</p>

  <p>3. The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service completed an upgrade of its electronic case management system in April 2002. Only case records created after that date contain complete data which is capable of electronic analysis.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive welcomes the &quot;European Year of Equal Opportunities for All&quot; and plans to organise a series of events under this banner over the course of 2007, in addition to the significant work it already undertakes to promote equality and tackle discrimination.</p>

  <p>The Executive&rsquo;s programme of events has yet to be finalised but will include: a national launch of the European Year; a summer conference; supporting a series of local events, and a final closing conference towards the end of 2007.</p>

  <p>The majority of these events will be cross-cutting in nature, aimed at raising general awareness rather than focussed on specific policy areas such as enterprise and transport. However, they should help to underpin the range of equal opportunities work already being undertaken in these domains.</p>

  <p>The European Union&rsquo;s maritime legislation and state aid rules mean that we must complete the tendering process. A key priority as we do this is that there should be no disruption to the lifeline Clyde and Hebrides ferry services. The new arrangement will, for the first time, introduce a robust contractual arrangement for provision of the services.</p>

  <p>Under the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987, a Scottish local authority has the statutory power to require that a house owned by the Ministry of Defence be brought up to the tolerable standard, but only if the Ministry of Defence consents to the service of an improvement order in respect of the house. Once the relevant provisions of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 are brought into force, a local authority will have the statutory obligation and power to require that such a house be brought up to the tolerable standard, with no need to seek consent.</p>

  <p>There is no statutory obligation on local authorities to ensure that houses owned by the Ministry of Defence meet the same standards as houses owned by local authorities and housing associations. The Ministry of Defence operates its own four-tier accommodation standard.

  <p>Provision for former members of the armed services on discharge is primarily the responsibility of the Ministry of Defence and it has contributed to the following information.</p>

  <p>No financial assistance is given to local authorities or other interested parties for provision of housing for this specific group. However, entitlement to occupy service accommodation at service rates is extended for a period of 93 days after discharge because of injuries received in the course of duty.</p>

  <p>When service personnel leave the armed forces, responsibility for their healthcare is transferred from the Defence Medical Services to the National Health Service (as has been the case since 1948). Priority treatment of war pensioners is an NHS provision and decisions on the allocation of treatment to individuals are made by the clinician in charge.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Executive Health Department offered Combat Stress (formerly known as the Ex-Services Mental Welfare Society) a total capital grant of &pound;100,000 over 2005-06 and 2006-07, to support Combat Stress&rsquo;s refurbishment of, and new build at, their Hollybush House care home in Ayrshire, to help them comply with the relevant National Care standards. The Scottish Executive is also providing total revenue grant funding of &pound;54,000 between 2004-2007 to help support the Combat Stress welfare team in its community outreach work.</p>

  <p>Local authorities receive no additional funding in respect of the employment of ex-service personnel. There are, however, several service charities which receive Ministry of Defence and/or other government funding. These charities may choose to spend this funding on employment or training matters but are not required to do so. The Ministry of Defence assists ex-service personnel directly with finding employment including making grants towards training costs. All service members who are medically discharged are entitled to a full package of support offered by its resettlement service, the Career Transition Partnership.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has always taken the view that there should be a charge on the new Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine railway and that the charge should be such as to allow the benefits of the new railway to be shared between the investor and operators using the new railway. This view has been discussed with many bodies since 2001 including the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR), the Strategic Rail Authority, Clackmannanshire Council, Scottish Power, Forth Ports, Clydeport and other industry bodies. Most recently we wrote to the ORR in June 2006 asking them to set an appropriate track access charge for the railway.</p>
