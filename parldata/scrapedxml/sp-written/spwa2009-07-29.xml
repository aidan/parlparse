  <p>Administered Incentive Pricing (AIP) for the use of spectrum by the aeronautical sector would provide airports with a significant cost that they would either have to absorb or pass on to users. For the Highlands and Islands this could translate into a potential requirement of additional funding support by the Scottish Government or increased costs to airlines and ultimately to passengers. This could threaten the viability of some air services. We will be considering Ofcom&rsquo;s next consultation on the issue.</p>

  <p>Apprentices are currently exempt from national minimum wage regulations, which is a reserved matter. The Scottish Government supports the removal of that exemption and has made representations to this effect.</p>

  <p>The UK Government has recently announced that the Low Pay Commission will be considering a national minimum wage for apprentices as part of its 2010 remit.</p>

  <p>In the meantime the Scottish Government has asked Skills Development Scotland to ensure that the modern apprenticeship programme rules clearly encourage employers in Scotland to pay minimum wage rates to their apprentices.</p>

  <p>Competition policy is a reserved matter. Scottish Government officials have been in discussion with officials of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills about this matter. The UK Government has made several representations to the European Commission about the importance of an open and competitive after-sales and repair market for motor vehicles and specifically has expressed concerns about access to information, particularly technical information, and parts for the independent aftermarket. The UK and other EU member states therefore expect that the European Commission will retain key elements from the existing Motor Vehicle Block Exemption Regulation.</p>

  <p>The estimated value of the co-operative sector to Scotland&rsquo;s economy is not held centrally. However, turnover statistics by legal status for VAT and/or PAYE registered businesses are published annually within the Scottish Government publication <em>Scottish Corporate Sector Statistics</em> . The following table presents turnover statistics by legal status for Scotland in March 2008. The legal status of non-profit making bodies and mutual associations will capture many co-operatives but it will also capture other enterprise types such as charities and community organisations.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government and Scottish Enterprise were informed by Diageo on 30 June 2009 that there would be an announcement the next day. However, neither the Scottish Government nor Scottish Enterprise was informed of the nature and extent of Diageo&rsquo;s intentions until after it had informed its workforce on 1 July 2009.</p>

  <p>A number of meetings have taken place involving ministers, the Scottish Government and Scottish Enterprise officials with Diageo since the announcement around all of the company&rsquo;s proposals. As part of our engagement, not only with Diageo but other partners such as trade unions and Glasgow City Council, the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth visited the Port Dundas facility on 16 July 2009.</p>

  <p>Our focus at the moment is on retaining jobs in Scotland. We are working with other partners such as East Ayrshire Council, the trade unions, Glasgow City Council and the local MSPs and MPs to produce alternative propositions to reverse the Diageo decision and safeguard jobs in Glasgow and Ayrshire. As a result of our meetings, Diageo has assured us that its consultation will be genuine. It has committed to ministers that it will give serious consideration to the alternative propositions that are being independently produced.</p>

  <p>However, should job losses take place, the Scottish Government will, through Skills Development Scotland, coordinate local response teams under the Partnership Action for Continuing Employment (PACE) initiative, to provide tailored help and support for those workers affected. PACE aims to work with employers and employee representatives to minimise job losses but where redundancies do occur partners take action to coordinate activities to support people back into employment or training as quickly as possible.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has not made such an assessment. However, we are aware of a resurgence of interest worldwide in developing the Stirling engine for a diverse range of energy applications. The Scottish Government and the enterprise agencies would welcome investigation of the potential role of the Stirling engine in technologies which could help achieve our vision for a sustainable, low carbon society.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has made no formal assessment of the potential use of light emitting diode (LED) lighting as an alternative to compact fluorescent lights (CFLs), although current industry reports indicate that compared with CFLs, LEDs are a very energy efficient lighting technology, even if the quality of light can be poorer. We have however ensured that a minimum standard for the energy efficiency of lighting will be met whenever building owners elect to do new building work through Scottish building regulations. Both LED and compact fluorescents can be used to achieve compliance.</p>

  <p>We will continue to work closely with our colleagues at Westminster over the implementation in the UK of the European Ecodesign of Energy Using Products Directive (EuP) which has already seen the phasing out of inefficient incandescent lighting.</p>

  <p>We are also keenly awaiting the results of the LED field trials being carried out by the Energy Saving Trust and funded by DEFRA&rsquo;s Environmental Transformation Fund.</p>

  <p>Subject to certain restrictions and exceptions, the public has a right to fish in Scotland. The right to fish is provided for in the Fisheries Act 1705, which empowered Scottish subjects to &quot;take buy and cure herring and white fish in all sundry and seas, channels, bays, firths, lochs, rivers etc. of this her Majesties ancient Kingdom and Islands thereto belonging wheresoever herring or white fish are or may be taken...&quot;.</p>

  <p>In general, the right extends only to fishing in the sea, foreshore, tidal lochs and the tidal (public) parts of rivers. The right extends to fishing for white fish, not salmon (which are vested in the Crown), and shellfish (but not mussels and native oysters, in respect of which the Crown retains the right to gather). The right may only be exercised where the public has lawful access to the fishings.</p>

  <p>The right exists where not excluded or restricted by statute. For example, the Inshore Fishing (Scotland) Act 1984 enables the Scottish ministers to regulate inshore fishing, and in particular to prohibit sea fishing in areas specified in an order made under that act. The Scottish ministers recently made such an order (the Inshore Fishing (Prohibition on Fishing) (Lamlash Bay) (Scotland) Order 2008) prohibiting all fishing for sea fish in the area specified in the order thereby restricting the public right to fish.</p>

  <p>The right to fish is a creature of statute, to be enjoyed by those who wish to engage in fishing. The right does not confer ownership of the waters over which it may be exercised to those who exercise the right - it is vested in those to whom the right applies to the extent permitted by law. This is analogous to the rights of responsible access, the so-called &quot;right to roam&quot;, created under the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003. That right enables those who wish to do so to access land in a responsible fashion. The right does not confer ownership of the land over which it is exercised to those who exercise it.</p>

  <p>Ownership of fish in inshore waters is mixed. Insofar as fish, including salmon, are on the foreshore, or comprise mussels or native oysters, they are vested in the Crown. Unless otherwise regulated under statute, wild salmon and white fish are <em>res nullius</em> , that is ownerless until they are caught, when they become the property of the captor. If the captor has no right or permission to fish, or does so contrary to law, the fish are forfeit.</p>

  <p>The latest academic year for which information on applications for assistance from the higher education discretionary and childcare funds is available is 2007-08. This information is shown in the following table and is provided by the Student Awards Agency for Scotland (SAAS). Data for 2008-09 is expected in early 2010.</p>

  <p>As details identifying the individual students applying to these funds are not held centrally, there is a degree of overlap in the student numbers. This is because students can receive help from both the childcare fund and the discretionary fund in the same academic year. Students are also able to receive help more than once from the same fund. The table therefore shows the number of applications for assistance from the discretionary funds in academic year 2007-08 rather than the number of students.</p>

  <p>Complementary investment under the Home Insulation Scheme, which will be in addition to the &pound;15 million allocated by the Scottish Government, will be delivered mainly from Carbon Emissions Reduction Target activity and owner contributions. The amount of investment contributed from these sources will depend on the uptake of measures under the first phase of the scheme which will cover at least 90,000 homes. Complementary investment will also be provided from local councils and other local partners in the selected areas. Complementary investment from some of the local councils selected for the first phase of the Home Insulation Scheme is subject to final confirmation and approval.</p>

  <p>Pest control services worked along with NHS Grampian estates staff to identify the problem. The infestation appeared to emanate from outside the theatre area. External pipes have been removed and cleaned, and pesticide treatment has been undertaken in external and internal roof areas. Remedial repairs, where required, have been made to external facia.

  <p>The management of health issues at work, which will include nurses diagnosed with arthritis, is a matter of delegated authority for NHS boards.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government, through the Partnership Information Network (PIN) policies, provides the minimum standard NHS Scotland boards must adhere to when providing support for staff with health issues.</p>

  <p>The &quot;Managing Health at Work&quot; PIN policy requires boards to make every reasonable effort to provide workplace adjustments for a member of staff who is fit for work but who cannot perform their full range of duties.</p>

  <p>If a member of staff is unable to work in a particular role due to ill-health or other physical factors, the employing board would be expected to make every reasonable effort to redeploy the member of staff to a post they are able to do.</p>

  <p>All NHS Scotland boards have occupational health and safety services to provide support for staff with work-related health conditions, including therapy, advice and involvement in any workplace adjustment or redeployment process.</p>

  <p>The public sector currently spends approximately &pound;8 billion on goods, works and services each year. Analysis of spend data from across the public sector shows that for 2005-06, 2006-07 and 2007-08 on average 49% of that spend was with small or medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Data collection will continue and organisations are being encouraged to actively monitor their level of spend with SMEs as part of the government&rsquo;s &quot;six simple steps&quot; to ensure that SMEs continue to make a significant contribution to the delivery of public services in Scotland and to the supply of goods and works to the Scottish public sector:</p>

  <p>Last summer, the government launched Public Contracts Scotland, in response to John McClelland&rsquo;s recommendation that &quot;an open market environment supported by a single public sector &lsquo;electronic portal&rsquo; should be established&quot;. Public Contracts Scotland gives suppliers free-of-charge easy access to information on Scottish contract opportunities. Over 30,000 suppliers are now registered, 83% of which are SMEs, and roll out of the portal across the public sector is continuing, with 138 public bodies already using the portal to advertise their contract opportunities.</p>

  <p>There are no specific indicators which track the formation of, or success of, consortia in securing public procurement tenders. However, public bodies can track the percentage of their spend with small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) through the Scottish Procurement Information hub. Over time, Public Contracts Scotland portal will also allow public sector bodies to track the proportion of their contracts that are awarded to SMEs.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises that the establishment of consortia and other supply chain partnerships can provide a mechanism for small, medium and social enterprises to actively compete for a range of public sector contracts. To facilitate this, the government has produced the following guidance:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/48453/0081532.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/48453/0081532.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p>The guidance, though specifically written for social enterprise and the third sector, contains general information helpful to any business organisation interested in these business models. The Scottish Government has also commissioned research on actual and perceived barriers to consortia bidding in the business community. This will assess what further support smaller firms might need in this area and help inform future procurement strategies.</p>

  <p>To make accessing public sector business opportunities as open as possible, cross-government events throughout Scotland are encouraging suppliers to register on the website, <a href="http://www.publiccontractsscotland.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.publiccontractsscotland.gov.uk</a>, for a free contract email alert service; browse the website for large and small opportunities; bid for these opportunities (via consortia and supply chain partnerships where appropriate) and look up contract award information for sub-contract opportunities. To date, over 30,000 business organisations have registered on the website.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is monitoring the proportion of contracts which go to small and medium-sized enterprises, and has asked all public bodies to do the same.</p>

  <p>According to the recently published Audit Scotland report <em>Improving Public Sector Purchasing</em>, implementation of the McClelland report&rsquo;s recommendations saved around &pound;327 million in 2006-07 and 2007-08. We have no evidence to suggest that local employment, welfare benefits costs or local spending have been adversely affected. Monies saved should be available to public bodies for deployment on other priorities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Procurement information hub analyses procurement spending by Scottish public bodies including all local authorities and health boards. According to information on the hub at July 2009, spending with small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) since April 2006 in terms of value is as follows:</p>

  <p>There have been two meetings with the UK Government on high speed rail. The first was in Edinburgh on 28 May 2008, to discuss cross border rail links, including opportunities for high speed rail.</p>

  <p>The second meeting also took place in Edinburgh on 23 April 2009, in which I continued to press the case for a high speed rail connection between Scotland, London and Europe.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland officials have also met with the UK Government company, High Speed 2, on two occasions (once in London and once in Glasgow with stakeholders present). Dialogue will continue over the coming months as the case for high speed rail is developed.</p>

  <p>The terms of the east coast franchise means that the Department for Transport (DfT) has the right to step in as &quot;operator of last resort&quot; should a franchisee, such as National Express East Coast, experience financial difficulties. This is a temporary measure while DfT prepares for the refranchising of the east cost main line passenger service.</p>

  <p>I understand that passenger services on the east coast main line will continue to operate according to the published National Express East Coast timetable, and with no effect on service provision or ticketing.</p>

  <p>Since rail was devolved to Scotland in 1999, Scottish ministers have a legal obligation to provide non-binding advice to DfT in respect of cross border passenger services.</p>

  <p>Although no discussions have taken place as yet, I can assure you that the Scottish Government will be involved in future negotiations for a new east coast franchise, which DfT will be tendering by the end of 2010.</p>

  <p>Councils and their community planning partners will monitor the effectiveness of services and how well placed they are to support the outcomes they have agreed in their single outcome agreements (SOAs). They will also report to their communities and to the Scottish Government each year on their contribution to the achievement of national and local outcomes highlighted in these SOAs. The first of these reports are due to published in September 2009.</p>

  <p>The Accounts Commission recently consulted on proposals for the next phase of its best value audits of councils. In the short term, the commission expects that local auditors will examine the approach the council and its partners are taking in developing their SOA and monitoring performance against it. These results and evidence from the annual reports will inform risk-based and proportionate decision-making about how and when Audit Scotland and inspection bodies (e.g. HM Inspectorate of Education and the Social Work Inspection Agency) undertake scrutiny within councils.</p>
