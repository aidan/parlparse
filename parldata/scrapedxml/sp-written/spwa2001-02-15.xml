  <p>We are today issuing to local authorities, the health service, the voluntary sector and others a consultation paper <i>Changing Children&#8217;s Services Fund</i> , a copy of which has been placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre. This sets out our proposals for the fund, which will encourage better, more innovative and more integrated services for children. Funding of &#163;4 million will be available in 2001-02 for drug-related projects only, while &#163;33 million will be available in 2002-03 and &#163;44.5 million in 2003-04. Resources are being committed from the education, health and social justice budgets. This reflects the cross-cutting nature of this fund. It will encourage local authorities, the health service, the voluntary sector and others to work together for Scotland&#8217;s children.</p>

  <p>The Executive is advised on this matter by the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC), which has stressed the importance of rigorous washing and decontamination in reducing risk. In November 2000, the committee endorsed the concept of a pilot scheme involving tonsillectomy to assess the practicability of using disposable instruments. The move to single use instruments is a precautionary one, and there is no evidence of any cases of vCJD having been caused by surgery.</p>

  <p>The Deputy Chief Medical Officer has advised health boards and NHS Trusts, that, until single use instruments come fully on stream, it will be for clinical judgement to be exercised in each case, balancing the unquantifiable risk there might be from vCJD against any more immediate health concerns that the surgery would be designed to address. The British Association of Otorhinolaryngologists, Head and Neck Surgeons advised their members that, where there are &quot;definite indications for surgery&quot; (e.g. malignancy, significant airway obstruction), the benefit of surgery outweighs the theoretical risk there may be from vCJD.</p>

  <p>If tonsillectomy procedures are postponed, there will be an impact on waiting lists and waiting times for this procedure. But there may be scope for hospitals to bring forward other ear, nose and throat operations to fill the gaps caused by any tonsillectomy postponements.</p>

  <p>The victims of drug misuse can range from individuals who misuse drugs, to their families and the wider community. Earlier this month I announced details of how the Executive&#8217;s &#163;100 million package of additional expenditure on drug misuse over the next three years will be targeted.</p>

  <p>We have a priority to develop services targeted at families of people who misuse, as well as to increase the numbers of specialist staff available to provide treatment, care and support for individuals and families. Guidelines are currently being drawn up for local authorities and other agencies which work with drug misusing parents. These guidelines are aimed at minimising the effects on children in such family circumstances.</p>

  <p>The Executive recognises that we need to support our entrepreneurs. They are crucial to our economic success. We need to raise the rate of new firm formation in Scotland, enhance business survival and improve growth. We must become a country where starting up and running a successful business is an ambition of most and an achievement for many.</p>

  <p>The way forward is set by the publication of <i>A Smart Successful Scotland </i>- the first comprehensive statement by the Executive setting out the direction and priorities for the Enterprise Networks. Encouraging entrepreneurship is one of the strategy&#8217;s three key challenges, and we will continue to work with the networks to drive forward improvements in this area.</p>

  <p>The representations were made by the manufacturers of emamectin benzoate, who asked the Scottish Ministers to direct the Scottish Environment Protection Agency to determine applications for consents to discharge under the Control of Pollution Act 1974 within four months. The manufacturers also wished the Scottish Ministers to direct the agency to allocate further resources to the consenting regime and to establish and implement an effective regime for determining applications for consents to the discharge of emamectin benzoate.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Ministers declined to give such Directions. Under the 1974 Act the determination of applications for consents to discharge emamectin benzoate is the responsibility of the agency, which is established by statute as a body separate from Government. Bearing in mind their own powers to call in applications, or to consider appeals, the Scottish Ministers did not consider it necessary or appropriate to intervene in the way proposed, in relation to SEPA&#8217;s discharge of its functions, for the benefit of a particular commercial interest.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether emissions from factories producing medium density fibreboard pose any health risks; whether it is aware of the concern of the local community in Cowie, Stirlingshire, about such emissions from Nexfor on 26 January 2001, and whether it will take any steps to investigate these concerns.</p>

  <p>Factories producing medium density fibreboard in Scotland are authorised by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency under Part I of the Environment Protection Act 1990. When issuing an authorisation SEPA must have regard to the emission limits set down in Government Guidance for the Process for the Manufacture of Particleboard and Fibreboard, as well as the health-based air quality objectives in the Air Quality (Scotland) Regulations 2000.</p>

  <p>SEPA monitors the Nexfor plant on a routine basis for emissions of potentially hazardous chemicals and wood dust. It is aware of the concerns of the residents of Cowie regarding a wood fibre emission from the plant on the 26 January 2001. Shortly after the incident was reported to SEPA an investigation was initiated; this is ongoing.</p>

  <p>In response to concerns raised in the past about the Nexfor plant, Forth Valley Health Board has checked the incidence of health problems in the surrounding area. Health statistics indicate that the incidence of asthma in the Cowie area is in keeping with expectations based on the national average figure.</p>

  <p>Scottish businesses obtain significant benefits from the UK&#8217;s membership of the EU. The EU is the destination of 63% of Scottish manufacturing exports, with France our most significant overseas trading partner. In the last five years Scotland has attracted &#163;724 million of planned investment from continental Europe. Membership of the EU is considered crucial in attracting inward investment from not only within Europe but also the rest of the world. Scotland received &#163;368 million in Structural Funds in 1994-99, making a significant contribution to Scotland&#8217;s economic regeneration.</p>

  <p>The Single European Market provides a stable framework in which Scottish firms can operate. The removal of trade barriers reduces business costs as well as increasing competition, stimulating efficiency and encouraging the creation of jobs and wealth.</p>

  <p>The Executive believes that identifying and tackling the causes of health inequalities is the key to improving the health of the people of Scotland and an important part of our work for social justice. The policy framework is set out in the White Paper <i>Towards a Healthier Scotland</i> , the first Social Justice Annual Report and <i>Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change.</i> These all recognise that poverty affects life circumstances, lifestyles and experience of health and disease.</p>

  <p>The Executive supports research on health inequalities through project grants and by providing core funding for a programme of work at the Medical Research Council Social and Public Health Sciences Unit at Glasgow University. The aims of the programme are to investigate variations in health and the determinants of health within Scotland, and to identify effective non-health sector interventions for tackling inequalities in health. The Executive has also commissioned independent evaluations of the Starting Well, Healthy Respect and Have a Heart Paisley national health demonstration projects which will help to identify their contribution to tackling inequalities in health.</p>

  <p>The recently established Public Health Institute of Scotland will provide a focus for work to develop the evidence base to support efforts to improve Scotland&#8217;s health.</p>

  <p><i>Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change</i> published on 14 December, provides a clear statement of the Executive&#8217;s national priorities for health and NHS Scotland. The Scottish Executive distributes the bulk of the resources to health boards on the basis of a Scotland-wide formula which reflects the health care needs of their local population. It is for NHS bodies locally to decide how best to apply these allocations to meet national and local priorities. The total planned provision for health in 2000-01 is &#163;5.4 billion, of which &#163;4.5 billion has been allocated to health boards for Hospital and Community Health Services revenue purposes.

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Income is net equivalised household income; equivalisation takes account of the number of individuals living in the household.</p>

  <p>2. Deciles, quartiles and medians are based on the GB distribution of income.</p>

  <p>3. Estimates are based on sample counts, and are therefore subject to sampling variability.</p>

  <p>4. Caution should be exercised in drawing conclusions about changes over time due to the small sample sizes in Scotland.</p>

  <p>5. Figures for the bottom decile should be treated with caution as the bottom decile of reported incomes cannot safely be construed as the bottom decile of living standards.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for trunk road snow clearing lies with the new Operating Companies and the Scottish Executive. The use of snow clearing equipment on trunk roads by the local authorities would be acceptable only if agreed in advance by the new companies or the Executive.</p>

  <p>Miller Civil Engineering Ltd does not charge tolls on the A87 in its own right nor does it have the authority to do so. As I made clear in my answer to question S1W-10325 on 5 December, the right to collect tolls has been assigned to Skye Bridge Limited while the operation of the bridge is carried out on SBL&#8217;s behalf by the joint venture Miller Dywidag.</p>
