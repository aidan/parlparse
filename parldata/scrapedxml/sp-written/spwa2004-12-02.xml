  <p>I am pleased to announce the launch today of a public consultation exercise on the review of the Scottish Climate Change Programme, which is designed to stimulate a public debate on climate change and seek views on the Executive&rsquo;s response. The consultation paper is available online at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/climatechange" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/climatechange</a> .</p>

  <p>The Executive is co-funding an interactive conference on 7 December to help raise awareness of the Scottish Programme review and engage stakeholders in the consultation process. We will look to avail ourselves of media opportunities to ensure maximum coverage of climate change issues associated with the review.</p>

  <p>In addition, the initial focus of the Executive&rsquo;s environmental awareness campaign, Do a Little: Change a Lot, which launched in 2001, was on climate change. The campaign&rsquo;s budget for 2004-05 is &pound;400,000, of which the majority will be spent promoting energy efficiency, a key element of the Executive&rsquo;s response to climate change.</p>

  <p>The Community Care and Health (Scotland) Act 2002 introduced various new legislative rights for carers and new duties upon statutory bodies. In recognition of their lead role in supporting carers and the people they care for, most of these duties apply to local authorities. The Executive is developing with key stakeholders a range of outcome measures and performance indicators that will provide robust data on the impact of our Carers Strategy. A key part of that will be to monitor the impact of these new legislative rights and duties. The first of these indicators will come on stream in 2005.</p>

  <p>From January 2005 local authorities are being requested for the first time to report on the number of carers&rsquo; assessments being carried out annually, and this will provide a much clearer picture of whether they are meeting legislative requirements.</p>

  <p>Thirty-one local authorities issued direct payments in the year to 31 March 2004. Although there are no performance indicators in place to monitor the uptake of direct payments, consideration is being given to introducing these in 2005-06 through the Joint Performance Information and Assessment Framework.</p>

These estimates are reviewed each year as part of the annual teacher workforce planning exercise, taking account of actual recruitment and completion rates from the previous year.</p>

  <p>We are on track in delivering on the commitments to reduce class sizes. Very good progress is being made, in session 2004-05 student numbers in Postgraduate Certificate in Education courses in primary have increased by 31%, in maths by 85% and in English by 52%. Student intakes will increase again going into 2005 and 2006, to ensure the increase in teacher workforce is achieved in time for 2007.</p>

  <p>Newly qualified teachers are not the only means by which the class size commitments can be met. We are currently developing an advertising campaign for launch early in 2005, to attract existing teachers to come to register and work here.</p>

  <p>Lewis Macdonald: The Scottish Executive, in conjunction with the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Welsh Assembly Government, have recently consulted on a proposal that 50% of all cremations throughout Great Britain should be subject to mercury abatement. It is proposed that this target should be achieved by the end of 2012. Procedural guidance will be issued in due course to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), and other environmental regulators. In deciding what emissions abatement is appropriate at installations in Scotland, SEPA will adopt a regulatory approach that is proportionate to the risk posed by the installations.</p>

  <p>I am delighted that 39 regional governments were represented at the 5th Conference of Minister-Presidents of regions with legislative powers (REGLEG), which I chaired in Edinburgh on 29 and 30 November 2004.</p>

  <p>The Edinburgh Declaration, which the Conference adopted, expresses the support of REGLEG for the Constitutional Treaty signed on 29 October 2004 and welcomes the provisions in the Treaty which enhance the role of the regions with legislative powers in Europe. The Declaration points the way for further reforms to improve the quality of European legislation and its responsiveness to differing regional circumstances; to reduce the burden of unnecessary regulation; to ensure that decisions are taken as close as possible to the citizen, and to allow the regions with legislative powers to fulfil their potential as key agents in bridging the gap between the European Union and its citizens. The Edinburgh Declaration is available in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 34594).</p>

  <p>The conference was the culmination of the Scottish Presidency of REGLEG, a year in which we have taken every opportunity to promote the interests of the regions with legislative powers in discussions with European Commissioners and other key decision-makers in Europe.</p>

  <p>The British Association for Immediate Care Scotland does not provide emergency medical care but does provide training in emergency care for health care professionals.</p>

  <p>The Executive is looking to NHS Education for Scotland (NES) to continue to support the emergency care training programme for British Association for Immediate Care Scotland (BASICS) members when the Remote and Rural Areas Initiative (RARARI) funding comes to an end in March 2005. NHS Education for Scotland is currently considering future arrangements with the education officer of the British Association for Immediate Care Scotland.</p>

  <p>BASICS members perform an invaluable role using their enhanced emergency skills in responding to medical emergencies especially in remote and rural areas of Scotland. Many operate as first responders making themselves available to the Scottish Ambulance Service to be used where they may be the nearest available resource to an incident. The Scottish Ambulance Service and NHS boards are discussing the possibility of providing a tracking and communications device for members which would help with these arrangements.</p>

  <p>Tackling healthcare associated infection (HAI) which includes MRSA is a key priority for the Executive and for the NHS in Scotland. Scotland is leading the way in the UK in the fight against infection.</p>

  <p>A ministerial HAI Task Force was established in January 2003, to take forward a major three year work programme to improve prevention and control of all HAIs, including MRSA. Raising professional and public awareness of this problem, and the solutions, is a core issue for the task force.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has provided all local authorities with funding under the National Priorities Action Fund to enable them to provide all P1 and P2 pupils with one free piece of fruit three times a week. The January 2004 School Meals survey showed that 99% of local authority primary schools provided free fruit to P1 and P2 pupils in January 2004. This information is available in the Scottish Executive National Statistics Publication, <em>School Meals in Scotland, January 2004 </em> which was published in June 2004.

  <p>As part of our organ donation strategy, we have been running an award-winning campaign to encourage people to register, and to tell their families what their wishes are. We have set up a Single Organ Retrieval Team, the first of its kind in the UK. We are introducing two non-heartbeating donation programmes that make the option of donation more widely available. We have published a teaching resource pack on the ethical issues relating to organ donation and transplantation. Aimed at senior secondary school pupils, it has the potential over time to raise awareness within the whole population of the importance of organ donation.</p>

  <p>The proposal to transfer the rail powers of the Strathclyde Passenger Transport Authority and Executive (SPTA/E) was set out in the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s transport White Paper, <em>Scotland&rsquo;s Transport Future</em> , (Bib. number 33072) published in June 2004.

  <p>The decision on a Regulatory Impact Assessment is in accordance with the guidance <em>Better Policy Making: A Guide to Regulatory Impact Assessment</em> issued by the Cabinet Office.</p>

  <p>The draft order varies the competence of the Scottish Parliament. It does not in itself have a direct or indirect impact (whether benefit or cost) on business, charities or the voluntary sector. It would not therefore have any regulatory impact. The approach is normal for constitutional measures.</p>

  <p>The invitation to tender for the SNH HQ building requires the developer to design all non-replaceable elements of the building fabric to a standard suitable for permanent buildings with a life span of 75 years or more. Option appraisals undertaken by SNH follow Treasury guidance on appraisal periods and discount rates and in this case follows normal practice in adopting a 30-year appraisal period. No final decision has been taken on whether the building will be leased or purchased outright. If the leasing option were to be chosen, on completion of the 30-year lease term the building could either be surrendered back to the owner or a new lease negotiated, according to SNH&rsquo;s requirement at that time.</p>

  <p>Since migration to Holyrood on 2 August, a total of 23 fire alarm activations resulting in full and partial evacuation have taken place. The majority of these activations were linked to either dust from contractor works activating smoke detector heads or accidental operation of break glass call points. Statistics show that, as contractor works have reduced, the incidence of fire alarm activations has also decreased. Fumes from cooking and steam from cleaners&rsquo; cupboards hot water taps have resulted in a very few activations. Additionally, a small number of fire alarms have resulted from planned live testing of the Debating Chamber and Committee Rooms, as well as accidental operation of the fire alarm voice message system.</p>

  <p>Since migration, the contractual and statutory processes relating to fire alarm system commissioning and testing has continued. Testing has been restricted to out of normal working hours where possible and at other times with the agreement of building management. During migration, and for some time post migration, the planned four minute grace period to allow an investigation to take place was not in operation. Thus a vital element of the fire alarm system, designed to reduce the incidence of unwanted fire alarm activations, was not available.</p>

  <p>The implementation of a &quot;second phase&quot; of the Fire Alert voice message is currently being processed, to increasing the gap between alert messages. This will be more amenable to occupants, enabling them to carry on working as normally as possible whilst preparing themselves for a possible fire evacuation.</p>

  <p>After every fire alarm activation, the Fire Safety Manager carries out a Fire Incident Review. This process identifies root causes, issues, lessons learned and initiates and records actions required to minimise as far as is reasonably practicable, the chance of recurrence.</p>
