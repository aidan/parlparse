  <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service has eight mobile decontamination units manned by specialist teams that would deploy to an incident. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service have six mass decontamination units; an additional two units will be operational early in 2006.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to provide information on a local authority basis as all decontamination equipment held by the emergency services is mobile and any response to a decontamination incident would be Scotland wide.

  <p>Responsibility for the decontamination of casualties rests with NHSScotland. However, this is devolved to the Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) who, subject to operational requirements, may devolve operational responsibility for provision of mass decontamination to the Fire and Rescue Service (FRS).</p>

  <p>The number of casualties who can be processed through SAS facilities is dependent on the nature of the casualty. Up to 200 ambulant people per hour can be processed through FRS decontamination units.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to provide information on a local authority basis as all decontamination equipment held by the emergency services is mobile and any response to a decontamination incident would be Scotland wide. Resources could also be called upon from England and Wales.</p>

  <p>Continuous discussions take place between the Executive and all health boards on a whole range of issues throughout the year.</p>

  <p>I and the senior management team of the Scottish Executive Health Department met with the chairman and senior management team of NHS Ayrshire and Arran on 16 August 2005 for the 2004-05 NHS annual review. I chaired the review to hold the board publicly to account for their performance in the planning and provision of health services for the people of Ayrshire and Arran.</p>

  <p>Yes. Health services and patient care are improving. Waiting time targets are being met. Deaths from cancer, heart disease and stroke are coming down. People are living longer.

  <p>We do not consider there to be any barriers to eliminating poverty caused by the devolution settlement. We are committed, in partnership with the UK Government, to tackling poverty and deprivation throughout Scotland and, specifically, to eliminating child poverty by 2020.</p>

  <p>Poverty is only partly about low income; it also encompasses a lack of opportunity, facing barriers to participating in social and economic life, and access to appropriate and affordable public services.</p>

  <p>That is why, through our Closing the Opportunity Gap (CtOG) approach, we want to:</p>

  <p>-prevent individuals and families from falling into poverty;</p>

  <p>-provide routes out of poverty for individuals and families, and</p>

  <p>-sustain individuals and families in a lifestyle free from poverty.</p>

  <p>Through co-ordinated action across all of the Executive&rsquo;s departments and agencies, and working with our partners, we are making good progress &ndash; although we recognise that there is much more still to do.</p>

  <p>Over 210,000 children have been lifted from absolute poverty since 1997, reducing absolute child poverty from 33% to 15% &ndash; a reduction of 56%.</p>

  <p>Over 110,000 children have been lifted from relative poverty since 1997, reducing relative child poverty from 33% to 25% &ndash; a reduction of 30%.</p>

  <p>Over 190,000 pensioners have been lifted from absolute poverty since 1997, reducing absolute pensioner poverty from 30% to 8% &ndash; a reduction of 73%.</p>

  <p>Over 100,000 pensioners have been lifted from relative poverty since 1997, reducing relative pensioner poverty from 30% to 18% &ndash; a reduction of 38%.</p>

  <p>Over 220,000 working age adults have been lifted from absolute poverty since 1997, reducing absolute working age poverty from 20% to 13% &ndash; a reduction of a third.</p>

  <p>Over 60,000 working age adults have been lifted from relative poverty since 1997, reducing relative working age poverty from 20% to 18% &ndash; a reduction of 10%.</p>

  <p>We currently have one of the highest employment rates in Europe (75%), as well as the highest employment rate since records began, and the lowest unemployment rate for a generation (3.2%).</p>

  <p>Nursing staff may have mental health nursing skills and qualifications but not have undergone the registration process as defined by the Nursing Midwifery Council (formerly the United Kingdom Central Council for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting).</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive recognises the challenges posed by an ageing population that local authorities and others involved in local policy and service delivery face. These local bodies are best placed to assess the needs of their communities, through engaging in the community planning process, when planning infrastructure and key services. The role of the Executive is to encourage and support Community Planning Partnerships in their improvement of service provision in rural areas, not to prescribe a single blueprint of what those services should be.</p>
