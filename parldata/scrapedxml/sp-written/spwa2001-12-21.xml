  <p>: In Scotland, New Deal for Lone Parents has helped almost 13,300 lone parents to find work by September 2001.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive launched in July a new &#163;24 million package of initiatives which aims to encourage lone parents into Scotland&#146;s universities and colleges by making it easier for them to meet the childcare costs that prevent many from taking that vital first step to jobs and better incomes. An estimated 6,500 students could benefit from this overall package of support.</p>

  <p>Also one of the key aims of the Scottish Executive&#146;s Childcare Strategy, which includes funding for local authorities of almost &#163;50 million between 2001-02 and 2003-04, is to ensure that affordable, accessible, good quality childcare is available to all parents, including single parents, to enable them to take up employment and training opportunities.</p>

  <p>No. We propose to increase the Scottish poundage rate by 1.7% to 47.8p for 2002-03 in line with the retail price index. The poundage rate in England and Wales will also increase by the same amount to 43.7p and 43.3p respectively.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#146;s published objective is that by 2010 renewable energy will account for 18% of Scottish electricity supply. This will be delivered by the Renewables Obligation (Scotland) which is already stimulating demand for renewable energy development, and some manufacturing opportunities. The PILOT taskforce on which the Executive is represented has conducted a Diversification/New Business Study into renewable energy diversification opportunities open to oil companies. The Executive and Scottish Enterprise, along with DTI, are now promoting these opportunities to a range of companies including the oil and gas sector. Discussions between the Executive and oil companies about individual renewable projects are subject to commercial confidentiality.</p>

  <p>I recently announced, together with the Ministers for Health and Community Care and Social Justice, the establishment of an expert panel to make recommendations for wide ranging improvements in the delivery of school meals. Chaired by a Director of Education, the panel's remit will be to provide Scottish ministers with fully costed recommendations, and an implementation and monitoring strategy to:</p>

  <p>establish standards for the nutritional content of school meals;</p>

  <p>eliminate the stigma attached to free school meals and improve take up, and</p>

  <p>improve the presentation of school meals.</p>

  <p>The expert panel will include representatives from a wide range of sectors and stakeholders and it will operate in a consultative and participatory manner to ensure that the views of key groups such as parents, children and young people are taken into account. The panel is expected to report in the autumn of 2002 and I look forward to receiving their recommendations, which will be given careful consideration.</p>
