  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what assessment it has made of the EU ruling that the Gourock to Dunoon ferry route should be treated as a public service route and whether specific vessels have been identified for this and the other island routes operated by Calmac Ferries Ltd.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-12-09.S3W-29306.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80393" speakername="Stewart Stevenson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa1209.htm#6">

  <p>The Scottish Government welcomes the European Commission&rsquo;s Decision, which confirms that the public financing of the ferry services in Scotland is compatible with the State aid rules so long as we implement appropriate tendering procedures in respect of the Gourock to Dunoon route. We look forward to receiving a final version of the full EC report, at which time a proper assessment of all its findings can be made.</p>

  <p>The Commission requires us to launch a public tender for this route before the end of 2009, and for the subsequent public service contract to take effect before the end of June 2011:</p>

  <p>- The Scottish Government will launch an open transparent and non-discriminatory public tender for a six-year public service contract with the subsidy to cover only passenger traffic, with current timetable restrictions being removed.</p>

  <p>- The winning bidder will be allowed an unrestricted commercial vehicle transport service, subject to appropriate accountancy measures and audit monitoring to prevent cross subsidisation from the passenger service to the commercial vehicle service.</p>

  <p>The winning bidder will be free to bring in its own vessel solutions, replacing the old vessels currently operating on the route. Nevertheless, I have recently asked Caledonian Maritime Assets Ltd (CMAL) to undertake some research into the availability of ferries on the present second-hand market, to provide what we believe will be useful information to bidders for the Gourock to Dunoon ferry service contract. The timetable in the Commission&rsquo;s Decision would not allow sufficient time for new vessels to be procured. In terms of the remainder of the island routes operated by Calmac Ferries Ltd, I can confirm that these will continue to operate with the existing vessels.</p>

  <p>HubCo is a long-term programme and therefore needs flexibility as to the financing route of individual projects. It is anticipated that the hub Co formed by the Private Sector Development Partner and the public sector will deliver community based infrastructure using two principal contract types, depending on a value for money assessment:</p>

  <p>design and build contracts using public capital, and</p>

  <p>concession agreements which incorporate private finance.</p>

  <p>In privately financed concession agreements, an overall cap on returns (the cap set at a level above the expected return) will be agreed at project level. In line with key NPD principles, this provision will ensure that any surpluses are retained by the public sector client to an individual concession agreement.</p>

  <p>In Scotland, planning permission is required from local authorities for the siting of a marine finfish farm under the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 (as amended by the Planning etc (Scotland) Act 2006). This requires an assessment of the number of cages, layout and design of all equipment associated with the farm. A proposal for any development over 100 tonnes also has to be assessed against the requirements of the Environmental Impact Assessment (Scotland) Regulations 1999 (as amended), to determine whether it is likely to have a significant environmental effect.</p>

  <p>In Norway, planning permission is not required. Screening for any environmental impact does not start until the consent exceeds 3,120 tonnes of biomass. A basic assessment is carried out to determine any seabed impacts of the proposed biomass before a pollution control permit is issued.</p>

  <p>The UK cetacean bycatch monitoring scheme (UKCBMS) is designed to meet UK and Scottish Government responsibilities under the EU Habitats Directive by monitoring incidental bycatch of cetaceans in UK fisheries. The scheme is a UK scheme funded at UK level but the Scottish Government provides support amounting to &pound;30,000 per annum, plus the use of Marine Scotland fishery observers. It involves the stationing of observers on board a sample of UK fishing vessels to record instances of bycatch. These records are then used to estimate total bycatch in UK fisheries. This meets the requirements of the EU Habitats Directive.</p>

  <p>One thousand, four hundred UK-registered vessels use gill and tangle (bottom set) nets, of which 20 are registered in Scotland. Eight of these Scottish vessels (40%) have been subject to monitoring under the scheme. No separate estimate of cetacean bycatch in Scottish waters has been made. However, the small scale of these fisheries in Scottish waters in comparison to the rest of the UK means that cetacean bycatch in Scottish waters is likely to be small. Seals are not the focus of this monitoring scheme but records indicate that seal bycatch is similarly small.</p>

  <p>The rapid testing system in NHS Tayside is currently being evaluated by the board as part of its overall approach to managing Clostridium difficile Infection (CDI).</p>

  <p>Independent of this, the Scottish Microbiology Forum (SMF), Health Protection Scotland and the Scottish Clostridium difficile Reference Laboratory Service have produced a new testing algorithm for Clostridium difficile which will be available for the diagnostic laboratories before the end of December 2009. Whilst this guidance recognises that Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing for toxin B may have a role as part of the combination of tests employed in a two-step diagnostic algorithm, the expert consensus of opinion, both in the UK and the rest of Europe, does not currently support its use as a stand alone test, and that there are alternative test combinations which can be used as part of that algorithm.</p>

  <p>Any case for the implementation and roll out of a specific rapid testing system for the whole of Scotland would require evidence that a single solution could be applied and would be cost effective for all laboratory situations. It would also require evidence that the system is at least as effective as other methods available and improves the turnaround of results with a positive impact on patient care. Such evidence is currently lacking.</p>

  <p>It remains the case that best practice in infection control management and control of potential outbreaks and incidents should be handled as explicitly stated in the Scottish Guidance for the management of CDI.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has had several meetings with COSLA since May 2009 to discuss innovative ways of boosting housing supply, including the potential for a housing trust model to assist some councils in meeting housing needs. Officials held initial discussions with COSLA officers in May and June, at which it was agreed that the concept of a housing trust model was worth exploring further to clarify its feasibility and potential.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government asked the Scottish Futures Trust in June to examine the case for a national housing trust and, as part of this exercise, 26 local authorities were approached to seek their initial views and potential levels of interest in the model. The initial feedback from the work of the Scottish Futures Trust suggested that 18 of these local authorities would be interested in looking at the housing trust model in more detail.</p>

  <p>Following completion of the exploratory work carried out by the Scottish Futures Trust, further discussions were held between the Scottish Government and COSLA in September and October. It was agreed that COSLA would seek feedback from councils and arrange consideration of the proposal at meetings in November of the relevant COSLA executive groups and COSLA leaders.</p>

  <p>To inform COSLA&rsquo;s consideration of the proposal, the Scottish Government provided COSLA with a summary of the housing trust model together with a background paper prepared by the Scottish Futures Trust to give councils more details, and the Scottish Government also answered a number of queries fed back from councils. Copies of these papers entitled <em>National Housing Trust &ndash; summary of proposals</em> and <em>Increasing Affordable Housing Supply from Limited Public Resources &ndash; The Proposed National Housing Trust Initiative,</em> are available in the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s Information Centre (Bib. numbers 49829 and 49830).</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is continuing to work closely with COSLA to identify whether any local authorities would wish to participate in a national housing trust initiative and, if so, to undertake further work with COSLA and interested local authorities to develop detailed proposals.</p>

  <p>As part of its consideration of further actions for responding to the recession and public finance constraints, the Scottish Government has, in the course of 2009, held numerous meetings on innovative models for providing affordable housing with lower levels of public resource and the type of vehicle needed to deliver this, including a housing trust model.</p>

  <p>Over 50 meetings and discussions have been held with a range of stakeholders, in particular COSLA, local authorities, the Scottish Futures Trust, lenders, developers, housing associations, the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations and insolvency practitioners about a potential national housing trust or alternative models to boost affordable housing supply. The Scottish Futures Trust has also held meetings with key stakeholders as part of its work in examining the potential for a housing trust model.

  <p>As employers, NHS boards are required to maintain such records as are adequate to demonstrate that each employee is compliant with the regulations. In addition to guidance covering record keeping issued in 2003 (NHS HDL (2003) 3), more recently we have issued CEL 14 2009 which provides good practice guidance on the sort of records that NHS Scotland boards could keep to measure compliance with the Working Time Regulations (WTR) for doctors in training. These include:</p>

  <p>New Deal monitoring (two week monitoring information);</p>

  <p>Template rota information, in particular extending all rotas over 26 weeks to ensure compliance over this reference period, and</p>

  <p>Clinical activity analysis.</p>

  <p>Our WTR Adviser continues to work with NHS boards to ensure that employers are aware of their obligations around record keeping. Following these suggestions will enable NHS Scotland boards to gauge the working hours of doctors in training to ensure they comply with the WTR.</p>

  <p>The First Minister has hosted anti-sectarian events and has seen the positive outcomes of Sense over Sectarianism twinning schools projects for himself. He regularly has meetings and events with stakeholders which involve tackling sectarianism, such as his address to the Edinburgh Inter Faith Association in St John&rsquo;s Church on 22 January, the meeting he hosted with faith leaders at Bute House on 16 June and his annual meeting with Action of Churches Together in Scotland, which took place in the Scottish Parliament on 4 November.</p>

  <p>Lead responsibility for this area of work rests with me, as Minister for Community Safety, and I regularly visit anti-sectarian projects and initiatives to see the positive impact these are having on our communities. I was delighted that some of these projects were featured at the event I hosted, to celebrate the achievements of those who are delivering initiatives to tackle sectarianism at the Scottish Youth Theatre on 23 November, and which I am pleased you were able to attend.</p>

  <p>The government has taken action to address the serious issue of teacher unemployment. We have listened to what councils have said over the summer about the desire to put in place an early retirement scheme.</p>

  <p>Councils will be invited to bid for this scheme and we will take account of the business cases presented, which will include value for money. The cost to local authorities will be dependent on the profile of those taking retirement. However, as the retiring teachers are being replaced with teachers predominately at the bottom of the pay scale, we anticipate that the scheme can be cost neutral.</p>
