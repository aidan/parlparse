  <p>Local police force initiatives are the responsibility of the individual Chief Constable. The Strathclyde Police Spotlight Initiative on Safer Streets will continue until 31 March 2002. In addition, I understand that Strathclyde Police intend to concentrate on crime priority areas such as organised crime, drugs suppliers, vandalism and street disorder.</p>

  <p>There will be two national Safer Scotland campaigns during 2002. The first, "Crime Breakers", will run from 28 March until 31 May focusing on the activities of criminals who utilise the transport network and will also target drink and drugs driving offences. The second national campaign will take place in the autumn and will focus on public reassurance and high visibility policing.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no plans to bring forward specific proposals regarding the establishment of town champions. However, any appointment by local authorities of appropriate people to such, or similar, posts would be consistent with the general thrust of <i>Designing Places, </i> the Executive's design policy statement published in November 2001, which encourages local authorities to recognise their role in raising aspirations for good design.</p>

  <p>Institutions already have a significant degree of flexibility in the use of Hardship Funds. Institutions themselves decide how to disburse the Hardship Funds to individual students within guidelines laid down by the Scottish Executive. For example, institutions are allowed to offer short-term repayable cash advances; to use up to 10% of their total Higher Education (HE) allocation to provide scholarships or bursaries and to provide payments of up to &#163;3,500 per year to individual students without recourse to the Executive. Each institution is also free to determine its own &quot;means-test&quot; and the frequency of instalments.</p>

  <p>Institutions have also now been advised that they may vire up to 20% of their Mature Students' Bursary Fund (MSBF) allocation to their HE Hardship Funds, provided that this is consistent with the objective of targeting support on assisting mature students with childcare costs. This will enable institutions to adjust the distribution of their funding allocations based on their actual student population in the current academic year, as MSBF is phased in.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to the effective use of public resources, and the resources invested in the Government Car Service are no exception.</p>

  <p>The operation of the Government Car Service in Scotland is consistent with UK guidance on ministerial transport. It provides or arranges the provision of transport principally for Scottish ministers and ministers of UK Government Departments when in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The scheduling system is designed to match the arrival of cars to the timetable for ministerial engagements, and keep waiting times to a minimum. However, there can be unforeseen circumstances that give rise to cars waiting longer than anticipated.</p>

  <p>Departmental stationery requirements are met through central contracts. A breakdown by department since 1998-99 is not held centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. The following figures set out expenditure on stationery (e.g. recycled paper and desktop consumables) through central contracts:</p>

  <p>As stated in my reply of 22 February to the member, Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) will undertake a review of its headquarters locations. No targets have been set for relocating public sector posts and all areas of Scotland will be considered. The review has not yet started. The target date for completion of the review is mid-2002 and ministers will take a decision on the most suitable HQ location for SNH based on the review findings.</p>

  <p>Donald Dewar, the then Secretary of State for Scotland, announced on 8 May 1998 that the 12 Priority Partnership Areas designated in November 1996 would evolve into Social Inclusion Partnerships (SIPs) and that SIPs would also be set up in other areas across Scotland.</p>

  <p>In July 1998 the Scottish Executive wrote to all Scottish local authority chief executives outlining the key characteristics of SIPs and inviting expressions of interest in this initiative.</p>

  <p>These expressions of interest were evaluated and the relevant partnerships were invited to draw up detailed proposals from which a final selection would be made.</p>

  <p>This final selection was made by an advisory group drawn from members of the Social Inclusion network, who assessed the proposals received on the following basis:</p>

  <p>Need, with a particular focus on preventing social exclusion;</p>

  <p>Extent to which the proposals complemented current programmes and were compatible with existing strategies;</p>

  <p>Innovative nature of the proposals;</p>

  <p>Ability to demonstrate the commitment of partners, including the voluntary and private sectors and local communities, and</p>

  <p>The extent to which the proposals appear to be deliverable.</p>

  <p>The present situation is that there are no plans to extend the areas currently designated as SIPs or to award SIP designation to further areas.</p>

  <p>Scottish water authorities ensure that measures to control rodents in sewers are effective, pragmatic and appropriate to local needs.</p>

  <p>The water authorities' employees liase with local authorities at a corporate and at a local level to respond to any reported outbreaks and generally a partnership approach is adopted where the resources of both organisations are mobilised to deal with the issue.</p>

  <p>In spring 2001 the Scottish Executive oversaw the introduction of a voluntary joint agreement between COSLA and the Scottish water authorities - this set out a strategy to ensure closer collaboration between local authorities and water authorities regarding the control of rodents in sewers. This document is available in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 19775).</p>

  <p>The design services not completed by Flour City Architectural Metals (UK) Ltd mainly comprised detailing of interfaces between complex cladding elements and the cost of completing that work would have been &#163;117,500.
