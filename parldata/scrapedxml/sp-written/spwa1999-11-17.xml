  <p>Zanamivir (Relenza) is authorised as a prescription only medicine for the treatment of influenza A and B in adults and adolescents, 12 years of age and over.</p>

  <p>In Scotland, arrangements exist within each Health Board area whereby Drug and Therapeutic Committees consider the available evidence, including that provided by manufacturers, and provide advice to clinicians and Boards on new health technologies, including drugs. The Executive is happy for these arrangements to continue at present and we understand that some Committees have already assessed the available evidence and issued advice on Relenza to their local prescribers.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what plans it has to establish a centre to provide the NHS with advice on new health technologies, including drugs.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/1999-11-17.11.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80146" speakername="Susan Deacon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-99/wa1117.htm#1815">

  <p>The White Paper <i>Designed to Care</i> included a commitment to support the establishment of a Scottish Health Technology Assessment Centre to evaluate and provide advice to the NHS in Scotland on cost-effectiveness of all innovations in health care, including new drugs.</p>

  <p>A consultation paper setting out how such a centre might sit within the wider Scottish quality agenda was issued last December. It sought views on how the centre might engage and involve the NHS, the public, patients and other key stakeholders in the identification, selection and assessment of topics, both new and established, and in the dissemination of advice. Some 120 well argued and generally supportive responses were received from this consultation process.</p>

  <p>In March of this year, Dr Angus MacKay was asked to chair a small multi-disciplinary, cross-speciality working group to consider these comments and to develop a more detailed implementation plan for the proposed centre.</p>

  <p>The Implementation Working Group has now provided me with the report and I am today arranging for copies to be made available in the library. Briefly, the group has recommended:</p>

  <p>a process that the centre might adopt for its work;</p>

  <p>the professional and public relationships necessary for it to achieve its objectives;</p>

  <p>how it should keep its wide constituency of interests informed and involved in its processes to encourage the acceptance and implementation of its advice.</p>

  <p>The report concludes that the centre should be established as a Special Health Board and endorses the consultation paper&#8217;s view that the centre must be seen to be independent of the Health Service management when assessing evidence and generating its advice.</p>

  <p>It recommends that the centre should draw on Scotland&#8217;s best academic and clinical advice and, working with the NHS and patient representatives, make recommendations designed to encourage effective new treatments moving smoothly into mainstream practice. It also notes that the centre should have a role in reviewing existing treatments to ensure that resources are not being spent on those that are not effective.</p>

  <p>The centre will begin operation early in spring next year.</p>

  <p>The Executive committed itself in its programme for Government to ensuring that 18,000 new and improved homes are built over the next three years for affordable renting or low-cost owner-occupation. In addition, there are already a number of complementary national policies which affect housebuilding across Scotland. These include technical provisions such as building regulations and planning guidelines as well as housing policies more generally. The Housing Green Paper also consulted on the proposal for a national strategic framework for housing in Scotland and we are considering how best to take this proposal forward in the light of views expressed in response to the Green Paper. The design quality of housing will also be addressed in work underway to develop a national policy on architecture for Scotland.</p>

  <p>The detailed breakdown of expenditure by local authority area can only be supplied by individual local authorities. Scottish Executive funding for sport is generally channelled through <strong></strong> sportscotland which, in turn, gives grant assistance to governing bodies and works with local authorities on a range of initiatives. During the financial year ended 31 March 1999 <strong></strong> sportscotland gave Scottish Gymnastics grant assistance of &pound;100,000 from Exchequer funding.</p>

  <p>Support for gymnastics from the Lottery Sports Fund has included one award of &pound;50,000 through the Junior Groups Programme, 21 awards totalling &pound;61,433 through the Awards for All Programme, 37 awards totalling &pound;135,184 through the Talented Athlete Programme and four awards totalling &pound;108,348 through the Capital Awards Programme.<br /></p>
