  <p>The report of the Scottish Needs Assessment Programme review on autism and Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome is expected to be submitted in January 2002. It will inform future decisions by the Executive on the organisation of services for this important care group, including workforce planning for child and adolescent psychiatrists.</p>

  <p>Within this context, local action is a matter for individual NHS boards, working in partnership with local agencies on the basis of their appreciation of the need for local service provision. A multi-disciplinary approach, developed in the Scottish Borders NHS Board area with voluntary, social care and educational partners and support from the Mental Health and Wellbeing Development Fund, provides a working example of good practice for other areas to consider in the management of their services.</p>

  <p>The understanding, assessment and collaborative management of autism and Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome is part of the training pathway for all consultant psychiatrists.</p>

  <p>General practitioners, like other professionals, are encouraged to look at their own personal learning needs and the health needs of their patients and to seek training in specific areas accordingly. Guidance and assistance is available from the Scottish Council for Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education via the postgraduate Directors of General Practice Education. Each GP already receives an annual Postgraduate Education Allowance to support an agreed amount of training.</p>

  <p>Abusers, either alleged or proven, cannot attend a Children&rsquo;s Hearing unless that person holds parental rights over the child in question. In that event, the hearing must balance the human rights of the parent and child. This can be achieved through the Children&rsquo;s Hearing sitting separately to listen to the views of each party and ensuring that no meeting takes place between the child and the abuser.</p>

  <p>National statistics on child protection are compiled and published annually by the Scottish Executive, using data supplied by local authorities about children who have been referred to them because of concerns that they have been abused or may be at risk of abuse. Statistics for the year ended 31 March 2000 were published on 23 October 2001 and are available on the Scottish Executive website ( <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/stats/bulletins/00114-00.asp" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/stats/bulletins/00114-00.asp</a> ).

  <p>The criteria to be taken into account will vary according to the circumstances of the organisation under review. The policy states (question S1W-1558 refers) that the location of public sector jobs should promote efficiency and effectiveness and that, subject to that, the Executive will seek opportunities to locate jobs as close as possible to the communities they serve.</p>

  <p>A number of general criteria were set out in the letter sent to local authorities and Local Enterprise Companies in December last year, seeking information from them about potential location opportunities in their area. This made clear that ministers will take into account a range of financial and non-financial factors in reaching their decision, including economic factors relating to the areas concerned, such as unemployment levels and other indicators of deprivation, costs, transport links, disabled access, staff and personnel issues and environmental considerations. A range of specific issues which relate to the organisation under review, will also be taken into account.</p>

  <p>The Executive wrote to all local authorities and local enterprise companies in December last year seeking information about relocation opportunities in local areas. We received a number of responses, including information about opportunities in North Ayrshire, which will continue to be considered. Following the announcement on 19 November 2001 on the progress of the policy (question S1W-19681) we will write again to provide details of the likely requirements of the new bodies in the programme.</p>

  <p>The relocation policy states that when the Scottish Executive establishes a new unit or agency, or where an existing unit is merged or otherwise reorganised, there should be a presumption against location in Edinburgh. It also states that where a significant property break point is reached &ndash; for example, the termination of an existing lease &ndash; relocation options outside Edinburgh will be considered. In each case, ministers will look at alternative locations. The criteria to be taken into account will vary according to the circumstances of the organisation under review.</p>

  <p>NHS Scotland has a widely recognised reputation for the quality and safety of its patient care. This is demonstrated in the work of the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland and the leading edge work being carried out by our other clinical effectiveness organisations. However, at present there are no direct ways of comparing standards of patient safety in England and Scotland.</p>

  <p>There would, however, be merit in pooling patient data from the two countries to provide more useful information for the benefit of Scottish and English patients. That is why we endorsed the principles of the Department of Health report <i>An Organisation with a Memory</i> (<a href="http://www.doh.gov.uk/orgmemreport/" target="_blank">www.doh.gov.uk/orgmemreport/</a>) and have initiated discussions with the Department of Health to ensure that their new National Patient Safety Agency can also work for the benefit of Scottish patients.</p>

  <p>In line with the recommendation of the research commissioned by the Scottish Office on the discretionary licensing schemes, the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 (Licensing of Houses in Multiple Occupation) Order 2000 which introduced mandatory licensing throughout Scotland, made explicit provision for authorised officers to the licensing authority to have powers of entry and search of unlicensed premises. The lack of a power of this nature was identified as a particular weakness in the previous discretionary licensing schemes, which prevented local authorities from obtaining information to be used as evidence for the prosecution of an owner who failed to apply for a licence when one was required or continued to operate after a refusal of a license.</p>

  <p>The Guidance on the Mandatory Licensing of Houses in Multiple Occupation, which was issued by the Scottish Executive also drew the attention of local authorities to the need to establish good relations with the police and procurator fiscal and suggested that local authority officials might want to meet the procurator fiscal to discuss any possible problems. It specifically referred to <i>Reports to Procurator Fiscal &ndash; A Guide for Non-Police Reporting Agencies</i> first published by the Crown Office in 1999 which gives guidance on the information that should be provided in reports to the procurator fiscal.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has also provided advice on the Houses in Multiple Occupation licensing scheme to allow the Crown Office to update and reinforce its guidance to procurator fiscals. The procurator fiscals are responsible for deciding whether to prosecute cases referred to them by local authorities, subject to guidance issued by the Crown Office on timescales for taking and implementing decisions on cases.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service, to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>This information requested is not available. The Scottish Prison Service Addictions Process provides a single gateway for all substance misuse presentations, including alcohol. The aim is that all who present will be offered an assessment, resulting in an individualised care plan. This will address the range of needs identified, including those that are alcohol related.</p>

  <p>The cost of enforcing any regulation falls upon the enforcement agency concerned. The attention of the Improving Regulation in Scotland Unit (IRIS) is on the impact of regulations upon businesses, charities and the voluntary sector. The cost of enforcing any regulation does not come within the remit of the unit, except to the extent that any costs are passed onto business. In that circumstance, the Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) process is designed to bring these costs into account and to provide ministers, before any regulation is introduced, with as full a picture as possible of the likely costs for business, charities or the voluntary sector. Since the full RIA process is only required where an <u>additional</u> burden is identified, the IRIS Unit cannot say if there has been a net increase or decrease for business in the cost of enforcing regulations.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what its position is on the range of locations currently covered by the definition of tourist attractions for the purposes of the Trunk Road and Motorway Tourist Signposting Policy; whether it has any plans to review this matter; in particular, why golf courses are not considered to be tourist attractions under the terms of that definition, and whether the lack of tourist signposting for golf courses has any impact on the Executive's strategy for the promotion of golf to visitors.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2001-12-07.S1W-20369.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80189" speakername="Lewis Macdonald" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-01/wa1207.htm#15">

  <p>A tourist attraction/facility is broadly defined, for signing purposes, as being a permanently established destination or facility that attracts or is used by visitors to an area and which is open to the public without prior booking during its normal working hours. Examples of the types of tourist attractions/facilities eligible for signing under this definition are historic buildings, gardens, leisure complexes, beaches, ancient monuments, historic churches, zoos, picnic sites etc.</p>

  <p>The importance of golf as a major tourist attraction in Scotland is recognised. However, golf clubs must, through the local tourist board, take appropriate steps to develop a marketing strategy and inform the public of the golf course through advertising material. As the majority of golf courses are used mainly by their members and require pre-booking for any visitors they are not normally considered suitable for tourist signposting.</p>

  <p>The Trunk Road and Motorway Tourist Signposting Policy was introduced in 1998 following wide consultation with interested parties, including the Scottish Tourist Board, to ensure a consistent approach across the trunk road network. There are no proposals to review this policy.</p>
