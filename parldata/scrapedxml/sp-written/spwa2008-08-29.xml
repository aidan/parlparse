  <p>The primary source of incentives and support is the Scotland Rural Development Programme 2007-13 (SRDP), worth &pound;1.6 billion over the next seven years. This programme is intended to promote environmental, social and economic measures across the whole of rural Scotland. Around 70% of the total SRDP budget is allocated to help improve the environment and countryside through land management.</p>

  <p>Support for agri-environment measures is delivered through rural development contracts, which comprise land managers options and rural priorities. There is a wide range of options to offer support for farmers to manage their land for environmental purposes. Details of agri-environmental measures in the SRDP can be viewed on the internet at:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government are aware of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs&rsquo; preferred option to require arable farmers to manage a small percentage of their land primarily for environmental purposes. Whilst this is clearly an option for Scotland, it would be wrong to pre-empt the outcome of our consultation on the <em>Future Implementation of the Common Agricultural Policy in Scotland </em> which invites views on measures that should be taken to maintain the environmental benefits of set-aside. The consultation period runs until 5 September 2008, and we will take a decision on appropriate measures in the light of consultation responses, views from our CAP health check stakeholder group and the outcome of the EU-level discussions on the CAP health check.</p>

Vestas is currently in consultation regarding the future of the facility and we are in dialogue with the company to understand its intentions.</p>

  <p>Every effort will be made to encourage and support Vestas to retain manufacturing and production facilities at the Campbeltown facility. However, we are also seeking to identify other potential occupiers for the facility from the energy sector and other engineering related uses that are able to utilise the highly skilled local staff should Vestas decide to end production. The Scottish Government is working alongside Scottish Development International, Highlands and Islands Enterprise and others to ensure the best possible outcome for the people of Kintyre.</p>

  <p>Vestas procured the buildings at its Machrihanish facility with Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) funding the construction to a capped sum of &pound;9.54 million. The buildings belonged to HIE on their completion and were leased to Vestas for the period 28 March 2002 until 31 December 2012, at full market rent. Subsequently various improvements were undertaken to the facility funded by HIE at a cost of &pound;678,000 in return for an increase in the rent to be paid by the company. The total construction cost was &pound;10,218,000 and the annual rent paid by Vestas is &pound;546,585.</p>

  <p>In addition to the property spend, funding support was granted to Vestas on five occasions from 2002 to 2005 totalling &pound;668,500.</p>

  <p>The Judiciary and Courts (Scotland) Bill, currently being considered by the Parliament, recognises the Lord President as head of the judiciary in Scotland with responsibility for the training, welfare, deployment and conduct of the judiciary.</p>

  <p>The bill sets out a framework of powers to deal with inappropriate judicial conduct leaving it to the Lord President to determine the details in rules which will be published. The bill also provides for both the complainer and the member of the judiciary being complained about to have the right to have an independent person review the administration of the case to ensure that the set procedures have been followed. That independent person, who will be appointed by the Scottish ministers, will be called the Judicial Complaints Reviewer.</p>

  <p>The bill completed stage 2 in June 2008, stage 3 is scheduled for September 2008. Once enacted, it will be for the Lord President to establish a transparent and easily accessible judicial complaints procedure to deal with any matter concerning the conduct of a member of the judiciary.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does intend to conduct a review of the Game Acts, which will commence before the end of the year. Early tasks will be to assess the scope of work required and to set a realistic timeframe. Part of the process will be a public consultation, providing stakeholders the opportunity to contribute.</p>
