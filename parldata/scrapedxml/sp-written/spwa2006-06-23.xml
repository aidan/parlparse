  <p>Yes.</p>

  <p>The Antisocial Behaviour (Noise Control) Regulations 2005 do not specify the noise source other than it must be emitted from a domestic dwelling; therefore, it can include the noise caused by animals.</p>

  <p>There are also other legislative provisions and tools to tackle noise nuisance from animals and birds, for example the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and the Civic Government Act 1982.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it considers that the actions outlined in <em>Bathing Water Strategy for Scotland</em> will be sufficient to ensure that no Scottish beaches fail to meet the European standard for bathing waters and, if so, in what timescale this will be achieved.</p>

  <p>The revised Bathing Water Directive, which came into force in March 2006, requires that all designated bathing waters comply with its standards by September 2015.</p>

  <p>In our new bathing water strategy, <em>Better bathing waters: Meeting the challenges of the revised Bathing Water Directive in Scotland</em>, which I launched in March, we set out the measures we believe are necessary to meet such compliance. We have also asked Scottish Environment Protection Agency to report on the risks to each bathing water, which they will complete by 2007.</p>

  <p>We already recognise that the greatest risk to achieving compliance now comes from diffuse agricultural pollution, and the strategy outlines the work we have already done with farmers, as well as future proposals to meet this threat. By its very nature, diffuse pollution is harder to control, and even with suitable measures in place, we are unable to guarantee that there will be no future failures in compliance.</p>

  <p>Our strategy is available on the Executive&rsquo;s website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Bathingwaterstrategy" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/Bathingwaterstrategy</a>.</p>

  <p>2. Percentages have been rounded to the nearest 0.1%.</p>

  <p>We have introduced the Homeless Persons (Unsuitable Accommodation) (Scotland) Order 2004 to ensure that where children are accommodated in temporary accommodation this is of the best possible standard and causes minimum disruption to families&rsquo; lives. We are also encouraging local authorities and their partners to act to prevent homelessness wherever possible and have established an Innovation Fund to support demonstration projects. Both authorities report having taken action to prevent homelessness occurring, based on evidence available as to the causes of homelessness in the area and focussing on early intervention and the provision of appropriate support. They also report working with local housing providers to ensure that the quality of temporary accommodation is improved and that homeless families&rsquo; access to permanent housing is maximised.</p>

  <p>There are a number of possible charges which can result from offences involving a knife. The information recorded centrally on those proceeded against in courts is based on the type of offence committed, for example assault, rather than the way it was committed.

  <p>Ministers and the Scottish Executive are not in a position to give any assurances about any bill which is under consideration by Parliament. A meeting was held with the Scottish Crofting Foundation to discuss the Bill and a copy of a memo outlining the conclusions of that meeting was sent to the SCF. This memo has already been the subject of a request for information under the Freedom of Information Act and was released. It will be published in both the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 39898) and the Executive&rsquo;s website, in line with the Executive&rsquo;s publication scheme. Although it is not usual practice to publish possible amendments to a bill under consideration by Parliament, where we have indicated to the Environment and Rural Development Committee that we intend to amend the bill we have published those amendments.</p>

  <p>The Maritime and Coastguard Agency has issued advice confirming that it is regarded as best practice for owners of jet skis and other leisure vessels to observe the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea at all times. All craft should also continue to comply with local regulations and it is the responsibility of local and harbour authorities to consider whether there is a need to regulate the use of jet skis using local byelaw powers.</p>

  <p>Health Protection Scotland (HPS) is responsible for monitoring the diagnosis, clinical investigation and treatment of all HIV infected persons in Scotland. HPS data indicate that all diagnosed persons have access to HIV specialist care, including the most up to date laboratory tests and, if appropriate, the most comprehensive range of anti-retroviral therapies to prevent HIV disease progression. No inequities in service provision, in the context of geographical area of residence, sexual orientation, injecting drug use status, ethnicity and country of origin, are evident.</p>

  <p>The breakdown of funding on information services for people with HIV/AIDS is not held centrally. Services provided by NHS boards and NHS Health Scotland would be met from their general allocation.</p>

  <p>However, the Executive currently allocates &pound;8.6 million per annum to NHS boards for action to prevent the spread of blood borne viruses (BBV), and to support people who have contracted BBV, including HIV/AIDS.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Executive also funds a number of voluntary organisations through the Section 16B Funding scheme. The organisations which received funding towards supporting people with HIV/AIDS, within the financial year 2006-07 are:</p>

  <p>PHACE Scotland receives core funding of &pound;32,000 and project funding of &pound;9,769;</p>

  <p>HIV Scotland receives core funding of &pound;85,000 and project funding of &pound;204,500;</p>

  <p>National Aids Trust receives core funding of &pound;12,000;</p>

  <p>Positive Steps Partnership receives core funding of &pound;45,000 and project funding of &pound;50,000, and</p>

  <p>Waverley Care receives core funding of &pound;7,636. Waverley Care also receive Section 10 project funding of &pound;62,044.</p>

  <p>The National Sexual Health Strategy Respect and Responsibility, published in January 2005, includes a number of recommendations on the importance of educating the general public on prevention of sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV/AIDS.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are delivering education through their locally appointed Health Promotion Managers and Drug Action Teams. In addition, NHS Health Scotland is working with key stakeholders to support positive Sexual Health in the workplace in relation to HIV status.</p>

  <p>NHS Health Scotland are also working closely with the Executive on two programmes, &quot;Healthy Respect&quot; and &quot;Respect and Responsibility&quot; where HIV/AIDS is seen as being an important element in work around promoting protection against all STIs, reducing stigma and discrimination and improving access to services for those people who are living with HIV/AIDS.</p>

  <p>1. Anomalies have been located from the diagnostic summaries contained within the linked source data comprising profiles of neonatal and in-patient hospital discharge records, stillbirth notifications and death registrations.</p>

  <p>2. All Infants followed up from birth for period of one year to allow detection of anomalies from hospital in-patient records or General Register Office death registrations.</p>

  <p>3. Singletons with more than one congenital anomaly are only counted once in a category total. For example if an infant was born with anomalies of both the heart and circulatory system, the anomalies would be recorded separately in each category, but only once in the total figure for Anomalies of the Heart and Circulatory System.</p>

  <p>The Scotland-wide free bus scheme for older and disabled people was introduced on 1 April 2006. Older and disabled people who hold a National Entitlement Card can travel free by bus anywhere in Scotland on local buses and long distance scheduled coaches throughout the day. The Executive&rsquo;s Rural Community Transport Initiative enables mainly elderly and disabled people and others who are unable to access conventional public transport to visit family and friends; to access shopping, medical and other social facilities and to take part in community life.</p>

  <p>On rail, First ScotRail, as part of the &pound;10 million Station Investment Plan, are committed to improving access at four major stations, in addition to investing &pound;250,000 per year in small scale works, including ramps to platforms, anti-skid flooring on footbridges, stair markings and installation of handrails, to improve access at stations throughout Scotland. The choice of works will be carried out with Mobility Access Committee for Scotland and Transport Scotland.</p>

  <p>On ferries, the Executive is making every effort to improve passenger access facilities at the shore to vessel transition stage for its network of lifeline ferry services. Record levels of piers and harbours grants have been paid out to qualifying projects. The Executive has also invested almost &pound;25 million in piers and harbours since 2000 involving improvements to passenger access.</p>

  <p>Capacity has been significantly increased on rail services in Scotland with the introduction of 29 new Class 170 turbostar diesel trains in 2004 and the procurement of a further four Class 170 trains in 2005. This has allowed better deployment of resources which in turn has allowed the available capacity on some services at peak times to be increased. In addition, a number of platform extensions has now been completed on the Dunblane/Bathgate to Edinburgh line, the East Kilbride line and the Fife Circle thus allowing longer trains with additional capacity to stop at these stations.</p>

  <p>There has been a number of new services and service enhancements across the Scottish rail network, including:</p>

  <p>new Larkhall-Milngavie services introduced in December 2005 increasing the frequency of services between Hamilton and Glasgow and Milngavie and Glasgow;</p>

  <p>Invernet project introduced five new services in the Inverness area in December 2005;</p>

  <p>improved frequency of services between Lanark and Glasgow;</p>

  <p>increase in services on the Barrhead line to run earlier in the morning and later in the evening;</p>

  <p>extended services between Motherwell and Cumbernauld now operating later in the evenings;</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no such estimates. The Scottish Executive&rsquo;s decision to withdraw funding from the Hannah Research Institute as of 31 March 2006 took account of two very critical Visiting Group reports of 1999 and 2003 and recognised that the research being undertaken at the Hannah was outside the Executive&rsquo;s research priorities as specified in the document <em>Strategic Research for SEERAD</em> <em>2005-2010</em> .</p>

  <p>It is important to note that the 2005 figures include, for the first time, an estimate of the number of overseas visitors who arrived in Scotland via Prestwick. Many of these visitors are from Sweden, and so the figures for 2005 in the above table for Sweden in particular, and for some other countries with direct flights to Prestwick, are therefore not directly comparable with those of previous years.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committing 70% of our transport budget to public and sustainable transport over the period of our 10-year investment plan. Since 2003, we have introduced a number of initiatives aimed at promoting sustainable transport, including:</p>

  <p>A national concessionary fares scheme, with funding capped at &pound;159 million for 2006-07, enabling older and disabled people to travel free anywhere in Scotland by bus;</p>

  <p>The &pound;22 million Bus Route Development Grant, which provides kick-start funding for new and enhanced bus services;</p>

  <p>&pound;1.2 million Regional Selective Assistance funding towards Scotland&rsquo;s first large-scale biodiesel plant, near Motherwell;</p>

  <p>&pound;1 million grant funding towards regional transport partnerships to fund travel plan officers;</p>

  <p>&pound;750,000 core-funding of Cycling Scotland, an independent organisation, to provide a greater focus on achieving the targets of the National Cycling Strategy;</p>

  <p>&pound;9.5 million in grants to cycle charity Sustrans to develop the National Cycle Network in Scotland, with a further &pound;8 million announced on &pound;20 June 2006;</p>

  <p>Funding worth &pound;575,000 in each of three years for the <strong>step</strong>change pilot initiative, which aimed to encourage a more efficient use of cars and an increase in alternative modes of travel at local level;</p>

  <p>&pound;56 million towards the Bus Service Operators Grant (BSOG), which recognises the public service aspect of bus services, and passes on benefits to passengers through mitigation of fare increases, and</p>

  <p>Publishing Scottish Planning Policy 17, which promotes an integrated approach to land use, economic development, transport and the environment.</p>

  <p>In addition, since 2003 we have continued to support further initiatives, including:</p>

  <p>Traveline Scotland, a telephone, internet and SMS travel enquiry service providing public transport timetable and journey planning information to travellers in Scotland;</p>

  <p>Transport Direct, the UK-wide door-to-door journey planner and travel information service:</p>

  <p>Awards through the Freight Facilities Grant scheme, which aims to encourage the transfer of freight from roads;</p>

  <p>School Travel Co-ordinators;</p>

  <p>Grant funding towards safer routes to school and cycling, walking and safer streets projects (CWSS)</p>

  <p>Working with the UK Government on new fuel technology such as biofuels and low carbon vehicle technology), and</p>

  <p>Publishing the National Transport Strategy which will take a broad view of the development of Transport in Scotland over the next 20 years.</p>

  <p>I am not aware of any published data on this aspect of pine marten behaviour, however, I understand that the extent of pine marten predation on red squirrels is generally believed to be limited. I would expect the Red Squirrel Action Plan which I have commissioned to include consideration of the impact which predation has on red squirrel populations.</p>

  <p>Figures are not available for pine marten or red squirrels populations on a yearly basis. Scottish population estimates for both species were published by JNCC in 1995 and numbered red squirrels at 121,000 and pine martens at 3,500.</p>
