  <p>The Bathing Waters Review Panel was convened by The Scottish Office specifically to review nominations for the 1998 round of bathing water identifications. The Scottish Executive has no plans to reconvene the panel. We consulted widely when preparing the Bathing Waters Strategy, including all parties with an interest in bathing waters.</p>

  <p>The European Directive on Bathing Waters does not specifically require us to make further identifications.</p>

  <p>Toll revenue is used to fund the maintenance, management and operation of the Bridge, and this arrangement will continue with establishment of the Forth Estuary Transport Authority on 1 April 2002. The authority will however have the flexibility to use surplus toll revenue more widely. It is entirely up to the authority, subject to the research it undertakes, to determine what it spends its surplus revenue on, provided that it funds schemes that reduce road congestion or encourage the greater use of public transport.</p>

  <p>It is felt that the most appropriate way to look at the issues surrounding chemo-prevention, is to establish an annual seminar involving a range of national and international experts, including epidemiologists and others undertaking specific cancer research, to review the published evidence and make recommendations to the Scottish Cancer Group (and through them to ministers and the Scottish Executive Health Department) on any action deemed necessary in the light of that evidence.</p>

  <p>We have allocated &#163;6.3 million over three years to support activities falling within the scope of our Drugs Communications Strategy. These activities include national mass media campaigns, the production and distribution of drugs communications materials for national and local use, and the development and implementation of local drugs communications strategies.</p>

  <p>The costs incurred to date include the first tranche of advertising at around &#163;650,000. That includes funding for television, press, outdoor (posters), cinema and other media work. Current research costs are around &#163;70,000.</p>

  <p>Expenditure on tackling drug misuse spans a variety of programmes and funding streams, and the Executive does not hold all of this information centrally.</p>

In 2000-01, extra resources of &#163;1 million were provided for drugs-related activity in each of three separate areas i.e. drugs treatment, drugs rehabilitation and work by Social Inclusion Partnerships. In 2001-02, the Executive has made available an additional &#163;28.866 million, bringing the level of funding on tackling drugs to over &#163;170 million per annum.</p>

  <p>A draft strategy for increasing physical activity levels amongst our population will be issued for consultation in June 2002.

  <p>The figures need to be interpreted with some care. They are based on the number of courses of treatment provided to patients. Some patients will receive more than one course of treatment during the year, and therefore the number of people receiving chiropody or podiatry treatment will be less than the total number of treatments provided.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to identify the number of patients who receive more than one course of chiropody or podiatry treatment, and therefore we cannot estimate the number and percentage of people in the population who have seen a chiropodist or podiatrist.</p>

  <p>There are no such plans. It is for the NHS locally to determine the range and level of service provision in accordance with the needs of the population, and national and local priorities.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not collected centrally. However, as <i>Patient Focus, Public Involvement</i> which was published in December of last year states, feedback on the services the NHS provides should be solicited in a range of ways. A well-targeted survey can provide useful data on specific elements of service user experience. Guidance on the use of surveys in the NHS, based on research carried out in conjunction with the Scottish Consumer Council, will be published shortly. This guidance will be supplemented by information on alternative ways of soliciting feedback from service users.</p>

  <p>The Information and Statistics Division (ISD) of the Common Services Agency, NHSScotland has published a Health Briefing (2001): <i>Community Chiropody Services</i> which presents information on community chiropody and podiatry services in Scotland between 1990-99.

  <p>Information on the number of foot operations performed as in-patients or day cases in the speciality of orthopaedics since 1997-1998, by NHS board of residence, is provided in the following table.

  <p>The Scottish Health Surveys conducted in 1995 and 1998 show that:</p>

  <p>(i) the proportion of population who eat fresh fruit once a day or more increased between 1995 and 1998. The proportion who eat green vegetables five or more times a week has decreased. Figures are not yet available to allow average consumption to be calculated.</p>

  <p>(ii) the proportion who eat four or more slices of bread a day has increased slightly between 1995 and 1998.</p>

  <p>(iii) the proportion who eat breakfast cereal has increased slightly.</p>

  <p>(iv) fat intake includes many sources including butter and saturated fat margarines, fat in frying and frequency of eating fried foods, dairy produce and meat. There was no comparable information in the 1995 and 1998 Scottish Health Surveys which would allow us to look at consumption of these foods over time.</p>

  <p>(v) the proportion of adults who usually or generally add salt to food at the table has decreased between 1995 and 1998.</p>

  <p>(vi) in 1995 the Scottish Health Survey only contained information on persons aged between 16 and 64 years. In the 1998 survey this was extended to persons aged between two and 74. Therefore trend data are not available from this source. The next Scottish Health Survey will provide comparable data.</p>

  <p>(vii) consumption of potatoes, pasta or rice has increased between 1995 and 1998.</p>

  <p>(viii) consumption of oily fish has decreased between 1995 and 1998.</p>

  <p>(b) This information will become available with the publication of the Food Standard Agency&#146;s National Diet and Nutrition Survey in early 2003.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Food and Health Co-ordinator was appointed to support implementation of the Scottish Diet Action Plan&#146;s recommendations including work to encourage retailers, manufacturers, primary producers and caterers to play their part in implementing the SDAP recommendations. The Executive supports the implementation of the Scottish Diet Action Plan (SDAP) with dedicated resources of &#163;1 million per annum. Food and health action is also funded from the &#163;26 million Health Improvement Fund.</p>

  <p>Among actions under way and planned are the establishment of an expert panel to make recommendations for wide ranging improvements in the nutritional standards and delivery of school meals and the establishment of a Breakfast Services Challenge Fund to expand services targeted on vulnerable children who are most in need of a breakfast service.</p>

  <p>I understand that the option of extending passenger services to Dunfermline was considered by the partners promoting the Stirling &#150; Alloa &#150; Kincardine rail link at a Value Management Workshop hosted by Railtrack in May 2001.</p>

  <p>The workshop recommended that extending passenger services to Dunfermline should not be considered any further as part of the Stirling &#150; Alloa &#150; Kincardine scheme on grounds of cost. No firm estimate was made at the workshop but it was clear that the additional cost would be very significant. It is, of course, open to other parties to assess the feasibility of extending passenger services in the future.</p>
