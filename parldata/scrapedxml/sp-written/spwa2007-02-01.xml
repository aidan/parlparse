  <p>There are two forms of modulation and all funds raised are allocated to different measures.</p>

  <p>European modulation is compulsory and contributions from farmers and crofters are allocated to fund the Land Management Contract Menu Scheme, as part of the Scottish Rural Development Programme.</p>

  <p>Member state modulation has been allocated to support agri-environment and afforestation measures that are also part of the Scottish Rural Development Programme.</p>

  <p>Details of expenditure for the measures mentioned above, were provided in answer to question S2W-31085 on 31 January 2007.

  <p>We have put in place a range of measures to enable local agencies to address antisocial behaviour (ASB) driven by addiction. For example:</p>

  <p>We are providing &pound;2 million funding between 2006 and 2008 to three local authorities for Breaking the Cycle projects, testing intensive supervision and intervention models aimed at encouraging behavioural change in the small number of families, many of whom have addiction problems, who are responsible for much of the most serious ASB in each community.</p>

  <p>We have provided the police with powers under the Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004 to disperse groups engaged in persistent ASB, including street drinking, and to close premises being used as drug or drinking dens.</p>

  <p>We are supporting local authority proposals to introduce byelaws prohibiting drinking of alcohol in designated public places under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973.</p>

  <p>These measures are in addition to the &pound;120 million funding which is supporting local authorities between 2004 and 2008 to develop a full range of ASB services appropriate to local circumstances. We require local authorities to show how local action to tackle ASB is co-ordinated with that to tackle alcohol and drug addictions.</p>

  <p>The Executive has a broad range of interventions in place which ensure that individuals are offered access to treatment at each stage in the criminal justice system. The range includes arrest referral schemes, mandatory drug treatment for arrestees, diversion from prosecution, piloting of drug treatment and testing as a condition of bail, drug treatment as a condition of probation order, Drug Treatment and Testing Orders, drug treatment throughout prisons sentences and upon release from prison through the Throughcare addiction service. In addition, the Glasgow and Fife Drug Courts focus specifically on offenders driven by addiction and the 218 centre in Glasgow provides services for women offenders. The aim of this wide-ranging strategy is to reduce levels of addiction and to reduce or eliminate associated levels of crime.</p>

  <p>The establishment of Scottish milk quota ring fences followed the introduction of EU-wide milk quotas regime in 1984. The ring fence arrangements, which place restrictions on the movement of milk quota, were introduced to support dairy producers and processors in peripheral parts of the country. Restricting the movement of quota and, thus, production helps to underpin dairying and cheese-making in remote areas.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is, as a matter of priority, reviewing the effectiveness of the ban on keeping pit bull terriers, and other types of dog, and also the law relating to all types of breeds of dogs that are dangerously out of control in private premises.</p>

  <p>As a first step in the review process, we have written to Chief Constables to establish facts and evidence about how the law operates in their areas, what can be done to make enforcement of the law more effective, and whether the law needs to be changed. We will also be seeking facts and evidence from other key stakeholders.</p>

  <p>Once such facts and evidence have been established from this process, we will consider what action may be necessary and the most appropriate way to take any action forward. Any changes proposed will of course be subject to a full consultation process.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally. However, statistical returns indicate that we now have more educational psychologists working in local authorities than we have ever had. We now have over 400 educational psychologists breaching 400 mark for first time, with a vacancy rate of only 4%. These figures are very encouraging especially when set against a falling school population.</p>

  <p>There is no funding allocated specifically to assist the teaching of English as an additional language; however there are a number of GAE lines authorities could use to support the education of these children, such as, for example, the line &quot;teachers for minority ethnic pupils&quot;.</p>

  <p>The overall core local government finance settlement for 2007-08 will amount to over &pound;8.7 billion and this includes an additional &pound;120.5 million which has been allocated to authorities to spend on the basis of their own local needs and priorities.

  <p>At the December Council we secured a six-fold quota increase for Rockall haddock in line with the scientific advice and a 10% increase in Northern shelf monkfish. These developments will help in part to mitigate the economic impact of the decision taken on deep sea species at the November Council, which was necessary as the science was very bleak and strong action had to be taken to safeguard the stocks.</p>

  <p>We are also considering changes to the UK&rsquo;s licensing regime, following extensive consultation with the Fishing Vessel Licensing Review Working Group, which may offer additional options for owners to restructure their business&rsquo;s.</p>

  <p>It is for every Scottish public authority to adopt its own system for monitoring requests it receives for information. It is for each public authority to determine what information can most effectively be recorded, and there is no requirement to monitor requests in any particular way, for example by reference to any particular circumstance of the requester. Further the Executive is not party to the detailed information held by any other public authority as a result of that authority&rsquo;s monitoring system. It is therefore not possible for the Executive to answer this question.</p>

  <p>These safety assessments are the responsibility of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in accordance with requirements of Regulation (EC) No.1829/2003, and the final decision on authorisations is taken by the member states, who vote on each one.</p>

  <p>The key legislation for the preservation of and management of works on scheduled monuments is the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. <em>Scottish Historic Environment Policy (SHEP) 2: Scheduling: protecting Scotland&rsquo;s nationally important monuments</em> sets out Scottish ministers&rsquo; policy for the identification and designation of nationally important ancient monuments. A draft SHEP on Scheduled Monument Consent will be issued for consultation in the near future.</p>

  <p>The Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) (Scotland) Act 1997 is the key legislation in relation to listed buildings. Historic Scotland has published <em>The</em> <em>Memorandum of Guidance on Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas</em> which provides guidance on managing change to listed buildings. Draft SHEPs on Listing and Listed Building Consent will be issued for consultation in the near future.</p>

  <p>The legislative framework is supported by the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s National Planning Policy Guidelines of which NPPG 5 on archaeological remains and discoveries, NPPG 18 on the historic environment and NPPG 14 on the conservation and enhancement of Scotland&rsquo;s natural heritage are the most relevant.</p>

  <p>In 2002, Ministers published <em>Passed to the Future: Historic Scotland&rsquo;s Policy for the Sustainable Management of Historic Environment</em>. This will be superseded during 2007 by the publication, following consultation, of the finalised SHEP 1 on Scotland&rsquo;s Historic Environment.</p>

  <p>The UK has ratified the following international conventions and is bound to ensure that the legislative framework is in place for their effective implementation:</p>

  <p>The European Cultural Convention (ratified in 1955);</p>

  <p>The Convention on the Protection of the Architectural Heritage of Europe (ratified in 1987);</p>

  <p>The European Convention on the Protection of the Archaeological Heritage (ratified in 2000);</p>

  <p>The European Landscape Convention (ratified in 2006 and coming into force in March 2007), and</p>

  <p>The <strong>Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage</strong>, adopted by UNESCO in 1972.</p>

  <p>The UK government is also planning to ratify the 1954 Hague <em>Convention on the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of an Armed Conflict.</em></p>

  <p>UK-wide policy on the care of the historic environment in the care of government departments - particularly scheduled monuments and listed buildings - is contained in the Department of Culture, Media and Sport&rsquo;s <em>Protocol for the Care of the Government Historic Estate 2003</em>. There is also a range of policy and guidance produced by Historic Scotland. The most important of these publications is the Stirling Charter, which sets out broad principles for the conservation of the built heritage in Scotland. This will also be superseded by SHEP 1.</p>

  <p>In addition, there are a number of international charters which represent best practice in the conservation of the historic environment. Historic Scotland&rsquo;s <em>Technical Advice Note 8 </em>provides a guide to these charters.</p>

  <p>In terms of decision making, each case has to be considered on its particular merits, and the relative weight to be accorded to particular considerations will vary according to the facts of the case.</p>

  <p>When making decisions and/or providing advice on the future use of scheduled ancient monuments, listed buildings, protected wrecks and sites included on the inventory of gardens and designed landscapes each case has to be considered on its own facts and circumstances. In general the principal considerations will include the relevant legislative and policy framework, the nature and significance of the historic asset the subject of the proposal for change requiring consent, an assessment of the impacts of the proposed change on the historic asset, the risks associated with any change of use and any other relevant considerations.</p>

  <p>In relation to nationally important sites protected as scheduled monuments under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 an important general principle is that as far as possible scheduled monuments should be preserved in the state that they have come down to us and that any proposed works therefore should be the minimum necessary consistent with the preservation of the monument unless there are exceptional circumstances.</p>

  <p>Historic Scotland is publishing a series of Scottish Historic Environment Policies (SHEP) which will set out Scottish ministers&rsquo; vision and strategic policies for the wider historic environment. <em>SHEP 2: Scheduling: protecting Scotland&rsquo;s nationally important monuments</em> has been published in final form.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will list all the designations and classifications used for buildings and monuments, giving the distinctions between each.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2007-02-01.35.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80030" speakername="Patricia Ferguson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-07/wa0201.htm#19">

  <p>There are four statutory and non-statutory designations for historic monuments, buildings and sites. These are:</p>

  <p>Listed buildings are buildings of special architectural or historic interest which are given legal protection under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) (Scotland) Act 1997. Those awarded have satisfied criteria for inclusion, broadly age and rarity, architectural interest, close historical associations and group interest. Greater selectivity is applied to subjects younger than thirty years old.</p>

  <p>A listing may legally be applied to any-man-made structure which meets the criteria. The interior structure is always included in a listing as is any object or structure fixed to it.</p>

  <p>Listing brings with it a curtilage comprised of any object or structure which, though not fixed to the building, forms part of the land and has done so since 1 July 1948.</p>

  <p>Listing applies a grading system to distinguish between relative levels of interest and assist with future management of the resource (categories A, B and C(S)).</p>

  <p>Scheduled monuments are ancient monuments of national importance given legal protection under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. A scheduled monument can include: the above and below-ground remains of buildings, structures or works; the site of vehicles, vessels, aircraft or other moveable structures where the actual situation of these is a matter of public interest; and machinery that is associated with these if it cannot be detached without dismantling the monument. Underwater monuments in Scottish Territorial Waters (out to 12 nautical miles offshore) can also be scheduled.</p>

  <p>We cannot schedule a dwelling or ecclesiastical building that is in use, portable objects, or wrecks protected under the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973.</p>

  <p>Designated Wreck Sites are nationally important wrecks and the sites of those wrecks which are designated as protected areas under the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973. Again, Historic Scotland administers the responsibilities of Scottish ministers under this act.</p>

  <p>Conservation Areas<strong>: </strong>In addition, under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) (Scotland) Act 1997, planning authorities have powers to designate areas of their district as being of special architectural or historic interest, that is as Conservation Areas.</p>

  <p>Choice of statutory designation.</p>

  <p>Distinction between Listing and Scheduling: Different sites will qualify for different types of designation, and be designated under more than one. Scheduling and listing are subject to separate legal provision and apply different criteria for selection. The management of listed buildings following designation falls to local authorities in the first instance. Historic Scotland deals with scheduled monuments on behalf of Scottish ministers. If a site is both scheduled and listed, scheduling takes precedence. All scheduled monuments are of national importance whereas listing may be applied to subjects of national, regional or local interest.</p>

  <p>Scheduling aims for the preservation of the site in the state it has come down to us, with the presumption that any future works will be the minimum necessary consistent with the preservation of the monument. Within the planning system listing is designed to inform the management of change while aiming to protect the special architectural or historic interest of the subject.</p>

  <p>Non-Statutory Designation</p>

  <p>Gardens and Designed Landscapes of national importance are identified in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland. Historic Scotland and Scottish Natural Heritage are the sponsors of the Inventory. Sites are chosen for their importance as individual works of art in their own right and, for their importance in terms of architectural, archaeological, historic, scenic and scientific interest. Inventory status is not a statutory designation. However, the terms of the Town and Country Planning (General Development Procedure) (Scotland) Order 1992 (SI 1992/224) require planning authorities to consult with the sponsors on development proposals affecting inventory sites.</p>

  <p>Health Protection Scotland published the latest figures on MRSA bacteraemia (blood infection) rates on 16 January 2007. A copy of this report is available from: <br /> <a href="http://www.documents.hps.scot.nhs.uk/hai/sshaip/publications/mrsa-quarterly-reports/jan-2003-to-sept-2006.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.documents.hps.scot.nhs.uk/hai/sshaip/publications/mrsa-quarterly-reports/jan-2003-to-sept-2006.pdf</a></p>

  <p>Hospital specific information is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>MRSA bacteraemia rates have remained stable in Scotland as a whole since national mandatory reporting began in 2003.</p>

  <p>As part of our drive to improve surveillance, compulsory reporting of all Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemias (which includes MSSA and MRSA) was introduced in July 2006. As expected, this has increased reporting of MSSA infections (which was previously voluntary), but this will enable more effective targeting of measures to reduce these infections.</p>

  <p>Wide-ranging measures to address healthcare associated infection (HAI), set in place by the HAI Task Force, include a national campaign to raise awareness amongst NHS staff, patients, visitors and the public of the benefits of improved hand hygiene to public health. local health board co-ordinators are being appointed to help implement and monitor compliance in hospitals. Additional training courses for NHS staff, and robust monitoring of the standards of cleaning in Scotland&rsquo;s hospitals are also part of the Task Force&rsquo;s Delivery Plan.</p>

  <p>The guidance covers how a patient gets access to their own records, what they will see, what it might cost, how long it will take, what to do if a patient thinks the information is incorrect, whether a patient can claim compensation and who might see the records of a patient who has died.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of the impact that Sir Gerry Robinson is reported to have had on NHS waiting times and given how NHS Tayside health professionals demonstrated in the Parliament last year their commitment to perpetual improvement, what steps the Executive is taking to empower all NHS professionals to achieve similar results by using comparable working principles and methods across the NHS.</p>

  <p>I want all NHS boards in Scotland to demonstrate continuous improvement in the services they provide. I have established a clearer system of performance management and delivery which requires NHS boards to meet specific key targets. I expect all NHS boards to plan and utilise all of their resources effectively with support from the Health Department and its Delivery Group.</p>

  <p>One way in which we are supporting NHS boards is through the national programmes on primary care, unscheduled care, planned care, diagnostics, eyecare and the roll out of the Citistat approach to performance management. Participation in these programmes is enabling and empowering NHS boards to develop both capacity and capability for service improvement.</p>

  <p>In terms of context, it should be remembered that the successful implementation of Delivering for Health (launched in October 2005) is already bringing about a fundamental shift in the balance of care. This, quite appropriately, places a greater emphasis on anticipatory care so that those at risk of ill health receive the services they need. In effect, the NHS in Scotland is no longer waiting for people to become ill, then sending them to hospital for urgent treatment. Instead, the Executive and NHS is doing more than ever before to encourage people to lead healthy lives, and spotting and dealing with poor health before it can develop into something more serious. When people do need treatment, the Executive and NHS are committed to delivering more of it closer to home in local communities.</p>

  <p>Operations are carried out within NHSScotland in a wide range of settings dependent on a number of factors including the complexity of the operation and the clinical and personal needs of the patient. Table 1 shows the number of operations carried out on patients admitted as in-patients or day cases.</p>

  <p>Operations can also be performed in an out-patient setting. From April 2003, the national reporting of surgical activity in out-patients has been required and ISD has been working with NHS boards to develop full compliance nationally. At this stage only a proportion of boards have achieved extensive coverage and further work will be necessary before a complete account of all out-patient surgical activity can be made. The number of out-patient operations recorded in NHS Tayside in the year ended 31 March 2006 was 7,083.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. &quot;Operations&quot; has been assumed to be the number of invasive procedures undertaken. ISD Scotland does not maintain a definitive code list that distinguishes between invasive and non-invasive procedures. However, there are a few non-invasive procedures that are easily identified and as a result have been excluded from the information in Table 1, they include:</p>

  <p>X29 &ndash; Continuous infusion of therapeutic substance (including chemotherapy).</p>

  <p>X33 &ndash; Other blood transfusions.</p>

  <p>X35 &ndash; Other intravenous injection.</p>

  <p>X55 &ndash; Other operations on unspecified organs (this includes MRI scans and various types of imaging).</p>

  <p>2. The information in table 1 therefore includes all procedures (other than those specified above) whether invasive or non-invasive.</p>

  <p>The apparent decrease in the number of accident and emergency attendances in the most recent years is largely due to activity for emergency nurse practitioners being recorded as nurse-led activity in NHS Grampian. The nurse led activity return is part of ISD&rsquo;s data development initiative. Preliminary data and further information on this return is available on the ISD Scotland website at: <a href="http://www.isdscotland.org/isd/collect2.jsp?pContentID=2789andp_applic=CCCandp_service=Content.showand" target="_blank">http://www.isdscotland.org/isd/collect2.jsp?pContentID=2789andp_applic=CCCandp_service=Content.showand</a>.</p>

  <p>In terms of context, it should be remembered that the successful implementation of <em>Delivering for Health </em> (launched in October 2005) is already bringing about a fundamental shift in the balance of care. This, quite appropriately, places a greater emphasis on anticipatory care so that those at risk of ill health receive the services they need. In effect, the NHS in Scotland is no longer waiting for people to become ill, then sending them to hospital for urgent treatment. Instead, the Executive and NHS is doing more than ever before to encourage people to lead healthy lives, and spotting and dealing with poor health before it can develop into something more serious. When people do need treatment, the Executive and NHS are committed to delivering more of it closer to home in local communities.</p>

  <p>The information requested on the number of inpatient and day case episodes, and new and return outpatient attendances is shown in Table 1.</p>

  <p>Procedures are carried out within NHSScotland in a wide range of settings dependent on a number of factors including the complexity of the operation and the clinical and personal needs of the patient. Table 2 shows the number of procedures carried out on patients admitted as inpatients or day cases.</p>

  <p>Procedures can also be performed in an outpatient setting. From April 2003, the national reporting of surgical activity in outpatients has been required and ISD has been working with NHS boards to develop full compliance nationally. At this stage only a proportion of boards have achieved extensive coverage and further work will be necessary before a complete account of all outpatient surgical activity can be made. The number of outpatient procedures recorded in NHS Tayside in the year ended 31 March 2006 was 7,083.</p>

  <p>Information relating to the compliance of junior doctors with the New Deal contract has only been recorded centrally, from data provided by NHS boards, since 2004. The information you are seeking prior to this date may be available from individual health boards.</p>

  <p>Under the New Deal contract, rotas for junior doctors are monitored by health boards twice yearly (February to July and August to January). The data is collated centrally and is published by speciality and NHS board on the Scottish Health Statistics website under Workforce Statistics at: <a href="http://www.isdscotland.org/isd/info3.jsp?pContentID=1348&amp;p_applic=CCC&amp;p_service=Content.show&amp;#JunDr" target="_blank">http://www.isdscotland.org/isd/info3.jsp?pContentID=1348&amp;p_applic=CCC&amp;p_service=Content.show&amp;#JunDr</a>.</p>

  <p>Section B gives details of medical posts in NHS Scotland with tables B13 to 17 providing summaries of compliance rates for junior doctors with the New Deal. The information is based on rota periods rather than on calendar years and records only full compliance with the contract, that is the 56 hour limit as well as rest and natural break requirements.</p>
