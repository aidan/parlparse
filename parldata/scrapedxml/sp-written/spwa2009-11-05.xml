  <p>The Scottish Government announced its decision not to proceed with the Glasgow Airport Rail Link to the Scottish Parliament, in the first instance, on 17 September 2009 as part of the 2010-11 Budget proposals. The Glasgow 2014 Organising Committee was advised on the same day. The Scottish Government is working closely with the organising committee and the other games partners to ensure that effective transport planning for the games is in place.</p>

  <p>We continue to develop and improve the support available to new and young farmers in Scotland. For example, I propose to supplement the existing interest rate relief available to new young entrants under the Scotland Rural Development Programme (SRDP) with a new establishment grant of up to &pound;20,546. A wide range of other support is also available, both within the SRDP and through other initiatives, often at enhanced rates for young farmers.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally. The Scottish Government allocated almost &pound;7 million to local authorities between 2004-05 and 2007-08 for expenditure on programmes to support under 16-year-olds being considered for or subject to antisocial behaviour orders. This is broken down by year and local authority area in the following table. During this period 14 antisocial behaviour orders were issued to under 16-year-olds.</p>

  <p>The report <em>Dealing with offending by young people &ndash; a performance update</em> which was prepared by Audit Scotland for the Auditor General for Scotland and published in August 2007, highlights concerns about the effectiveness and value for money of antisocial behaviour orders for under 16-year-olds.</p>

  <p>Licences for the control of ravens have been issued during the period in question only for the purpose of preventing damage to livestock. Licences are normally limited so as to apply to the calving and lambing season. The following table shows numbers for calendar years on the basis that very few raven licences are issued in the second half of the calendar year; the few licences issued in that period will generally relate to the lambing or calving season for the following year and are accordingly included in the numbers for that year.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s Climate Change Delivery Plan describes four transformational changes needed by 2030 to ensure that Scotland is on the path to meeting its 2050 target of an 80% reduction in emissions (compared to 1990). One of these transformational outcomes is the almost complete decarbonisation of electricity generation. We are clear in our vision that Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology will be a vital element of a decarbonised power sector in 2030, providing secure back-up generation for the renewables that will provide the majority of Scotland&rsquo;s electricity.</p>

  <p>The Delivery Plan therefore sets the expectation that Scotland will have a working demonstration plant by 2015, and a fully operational, commercial CCS plant by 2020. This will make a limited impact on total Scottish emissions in 2020, with the real reductions taking place between 2020 and 2030. By 2030, we expect that all remaining fossil fuel power stations will have to use CCS. The current position on Carbon Capture Readiness is the first step in ensuring that we make progress on the decarbonisation path and the introduction of CCS technology.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s thermal generation guidance will set out the policy on the development of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) for both new and existing thermal power plants in Scotland. CCS is one of the low carbon emitting technologies that will be required in order to achieve the targets set out in the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009. Development of CCS will contribute to some emission reductions in 2020 and put Scotland on the right path to decarbonisation of electricity generation by 2030.</p>

  <p>The VAT/PAYE de-registrations data cannot specifically distinguish businesses operated by disabled people. Therefore rates of closures of businesses operated by disabled people, as opposed to that of business overall, are not available.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government undertakes joint funded PhD schemes with the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC). The Internship scheme enables second or third year ESRC PhD students to work in the Scottish Government on short three-month placements. The PhD scheme enables the Scottish Government and ESRC to joint fund PhDs on areas of common interest. The Scottish Government has participated in 10 such projects on equality issues between 2007 and 2009, as outlined below:</p>

  <p>No relevant research projects were undertaken in 2007.</p>

  <p>The following three-month internships took place in 2008 and 2009:</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what its position is on the comments of Ken Ross of the Fire Brigades Union to the Justice Committee on 6 October 2009 that the effect of removing ring fencing for the fire service has led to the fire service having to &quot;horse trade with other services to get the necessary funding, which is compromising the security of front-line services&quot; ( <em>Official Report</em> c. 2286).</p>

  <p>The fire service currently receives over &pound;300 million per year to meet its revenue obligations, as set out in the Fire Scotland Act 2005 - core responsibilities being to extinguish fire, free casualties from road traffic collisions and educate the public about fire safety. Additional annual capital grant of just under &pound;25 million is also made available for the purchase of related assets.</p>

  <p>In real terms, revenue funding for Scotland&rsquo;s eight fire and rescue services has increased by 12% over the last three years, while capital funding has increased by 58% over the last ten years.</p>

  <p>It is clear that the removal of ring fencing has provided local government with additional flexibilities and removed significant bureaucracy. But we remain open to discussing alternative approaches with our partners, where these bring clear benefits to the frontline services delivered in our communities.</p>

  <p>To date, no patients referred specifically to the adult scoliosis service have had an operation. During the first phase of the introduction of the adult scoliosis service, clinical priority has been given to younger adult patients (17 to 20 years). A number of such patients had been referred to the paediatric scoliosis service prior to April 2009. Given the experience and expertise of the staff working in the paediatric service and the need to develop the skills of the staff based at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, all operations to date have been performed at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children Edinburgh. Between April and September 2009, 11 adult patients (17 to 20 years) have had an operation.</p>

  <p>The criteria for the adult scoliosis service were clarified in July 2009 when the decision was taken to set the transition point between the paediatric and adult services at age 17. The figures supplied for S3W-25112 were provided before this decision was taken and included seven patients who were aged 16 years. For clarity, the table includes the number of patients aged 17 years and over who were referred during the period April to September.</p>

  <p>The adult scoliosis service in NHS Lothian is covered by our waiting time targets. The current waiting time standards for both outpatient consultation following referral from a general practitioner and for inpatient and day case treatment is 15 weeks and these will reduce to 12 weeks from 31 March 2010. The 12 week outpatient waiting time will also be extended at that time to include referrals not only from general practitioners but also other sources such as consultant-to-consultant referrals. It should however be recognised that due to the case complexity of these scoliosis cases and the high standard of clinical care required, it may not always be possible to deliver the waiting time standards as it is not possible to offer the treatment elsewhere within the United Kingdom within a shorter wait. I have been given an assurance that every effort is being made by NHS Lothian to reduce waiting times for this service and all available clinical capacity is being fully utilised.</p>

  <p>Since the submission of Petition PE873 in 2007, considerable progress has been made. Scottish Government officials met representatives of the Scottish Post Polio Network (SPPN) in August 2007 to discuss how to improve service for people living with PPS in Scotland. As a result of these discussions, in early 2009 the Scottish Medical and Scientific Advisory Committee (SMASAC) agreed to set up a working group, with a remit to consider issues around the definition of the condition, the collection of robust data on its prevalence in Scotland and the development of best practice guidelines. This work is now well under way, and the working group is due to present its recommendations to SMASAC in spring 2010.</p>

  <p>To promote awareness of the management of the condition, the Scottish Government Health Directorates have, on behalf of SPPN, issued a copy of guidance on The Late Effects of Polio produced by Queensland Health, Australia, to clinicians across NHSScotland who had indicated an interest in the subject.</p>

  <p>Recognising also that awareness-raising should be extended to polio survivors in the community who may benefit from a better understanding of PPS and the treatment options available, the Scottish Government funded a national media campaign featuring case studies of polio survivors which ran in national and local press through September and October 2009. This has been extremely successful in promoting contact with the SPPN and thereby directing polio survivors to sources of help, advice and medical opinion/treatment. The working group will also be able to draw on a wider range of patient experience in producing its report.</p>

  <p>The benefits and drawbacks of sensor operated taps are discussed at the Scottish Engineering Technology Advisory Group which comprises the most senior engineers in NHSScotland. NHS boards are empowered to decide on a risk assessment basis where these devices should be used using Health Facilities Scotland guidance for support.</p>

  <p>The NHSScotland HAI Task Force holds the view that although such automatic taps may have their place, they are not appropriate to all health care settings and that elbow/wrist-operated taps are more appropriate for clinical areas.</p>

  <p>The HAI Task Force has recommended that further consideration be given to this matter once an audit of facilities across NHSScotland has been carried out. This audit is dependent on the implementation of an Estates Monitoring System due in April 2010.</p>

  <p>In its announcement of 7 October 2009 the Scottish Government indicated that future work included consultation with stakeholders on minimum standards for residential mobile home sites, improved protections for owners of residential mobile homes through strengthened written agreements with site owners, and powers for councils to allow them to enforce minimum standards. The detailed proposals will be decided in the light of that consultation. We expect those proposals to be implemented through the use of powers for ministers to alter the implied terms of agreements for the use of stances on mobile home sites and through amendment of the Mobile Homes Act 1983 or other relevant legislation.</p>

  <p>The North Ayrshire allocation of funding from the Affordable Housing Investment Programme (AHIP) for 2010-11 is not yet decided. There is already a significant commitment from the budget to re-generate the Vineburgh area in Irvine, which is close to the location of the ANCHO proposal. Decisions on further projects for inclusion in the North Ayrshire AHIP will be taken in line with the local authority&rsquo;s Strategic Housing Investment Plan priorities, once the level of funding allocated to the area is known.</p>

  <p>We anticipate that the North Ayrshire allocation will be affected by the overall reduction in the Affordable Housing Investment Programme (AHIP) as published in the draft 2010-11 Budget on 17 September. This showed a reduction of &pound;173 million in the AHIP budget between 2009-10 and 2010-11 because of capital having been brought forward over the period 2008-10 to accelerate spending as part of the Economic Recovery Programme.</p>

  <p>The draft 2010-11 Budget published on 17 September showed the Affordable Housing Investment Programme (AHIP) budget for 2010-11 as &pound;471 million. This is &pound;120 million less for 2010-11 than originally planned at the start of the spending review period, simply as a result of the acceleration of &pound;120 million of the budget from 2010-11 into 2008-09 (&pound;40 million) and 2009-10 (&pound;80 million). The total funding for the current spending review (2007-09 to 2010-11) is planned to remain at &pound;1.65 billion, as originally announced.</p>

  <p>The allocation of the programme at local authority and housing association level for 2010-11 has not been decided, therefore we cannot say how grant funding for all individual housing associations will compare with 2009-10 planned funding levels.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government Housing Investment Division, as the grant provider, and Scottish Borders Council, as the strategic housing authority, jointly consider the priorities for affordable housing funding across the whole of the Scottish Borders including Berwickshire.</p>

  <p>The priorities for the Affordable Housing Investment Programme (AHIP) take their steer from the council&rsquo;s Strategic Housing Investment Plan and Local Housing Strategy. Consideration is also given to the expected committed carry forward of funding together with geographic and tenure priorities across the whole Scottish Borders Council area.</p>

  <p>In total, the Scottish Government has supported the building of new affordable housing in Berwickshire to the tune of &pound;7.43 million over the last five financial years with &pound;32.65 million provided to the whole of the Scottish Borders over the same period. In addition, for this financial year (2009-10) we estimate a further &pound;1 million will be spent in the Berwickshire area.</p>

  <p>Officials of the Scottish Government have met with representatives from Berwickshire Housing Association to discuss the supply of affordable housing in Berwickshire on two occasions in the last two months. On 4 September, the Housing Investment Division - East Region Manager met with the Chief Executive of Berwickshire Housing Association to discuss a range of strategic housing issues. More recently, on 7 October, an Affordable Housing Investment Programme meeting was held where discussion took place on individual projects.</p>

  <p>Scottish Borders Council has advised that there is no single waiting list figure for Berwickshire. There are a number of individual RSLs operating in the area, all with their own housing lists and allocation policies. These RSL housing lists, however, do not operate in terms of &lsquo;waiting&rsquo; time but rather operate on the basis of housing need, therefore there is no &quot;waiting list&quot; as such.</p>

  <p>Berwickshire Housing Association is the biggest RSL operating in the area, and it participates in the Borders Choice Homes Common Housing Register, a Choice Based Lettings approach. Applicants do not apply for housing in the traditional way. Applicants instead complete a single application form to register with the participating RSLs and can then bid for any property being offered for rent by any of these RSLs. It is therefore not possible to determine how many people are looking for affordable housing in the Berwickshire area via waiting list data.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of influenza A (H1N1) infection trends in Scotland and the experiences of countries throughout the world, how many patients it forecasts will require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment and how many ECMO machines it will require access to in order to cope with this demand.</p>

  <p>Forecasting the number of patients who may require ECMO in the future with any degree of certainty is difficult.</p>

  <p>A recent study on the experience of H1N1 in Australia and New Zealand during their winter months indicated that 68 patients with severe influenza-related acute respiratory distress syndrome were treated with ECMO; representing an incidence of 2.6 ECMO patients per million of the population. However, caution needs to be applied in extrapolating this data for Scotland as the circumstances are different.</p>

  <p>Modelling work is being commissioned at a UK level to assess the likely adult ECMO requirement in light of the current influenza A(H1N1) pandemic. The outcomes of this modelling work will be considered by the UK Critical Care Clinical Group.</p>

  <p>The new unit provides a range of dedicated services for young people aged 12 to 18 years, from across the West of Scotland, who have serious mental health problems. Staffing issues are therefore a matter for the West of Scotland NHS Boards (Ayrshire and Arran, Dumfries and Galloway, Forth Valley, Greater Glasgow and Clyde and NHS Lanarkshire) who are responsible jointly for delivering a service for patients in their areas.</p>

  <p>We are working closely with all NHS boards to increase the specialist CAMHS workforce to deliver a service which meets all our expectations and takes account of the changing needs and increasing demand for role flexibility to support appropriate care models. CAMHS workforce planning is now firmly embedded in NHS board&rsquo;s workforce plans.</p>

  <p>To support this, we are making an additional &pound;6.5 million available to NHS boards over the next three years to increase the number of psychologists working in specialist CAMHS as well as an additional &pound;2 million on a recurring basis to accelerate the development of specialist child and adolescent mental health community services.</p>

  <p>For children, there are currently nine beds provided on a national basis at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children (Yorkhill).</p>

  <p>There are no beds in Scotland specifically dedicated for forensic psychiatric adolescent patients and none are planned at present given the small numbers of such patients. For the last 12 years NHS National Services Scotland, National Services Division has instead commissioned the secure forensic service for young people, resident in Scotland, from the National Commissioning Group and this service is provided on a UK wide basis. The Scottish Government continues to monitor the demand for forensic psychiatric adolescent inpatient services and whether that demand is sufficient to justify creating a service in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government funds non-national museums, including industrial museums, through Museums Galleries Scotland. The indicative grant, subject to the Budget Bill process, for Museums Galleries Scotland for 2010-11 is &pound;3.628 million, which includes &pound;550,000 in capital funding for the Scottish Mining Museum and &pound;600,000 in ring-fenced revenue funding for the Scottish Maritime, Mining and Fisheries Museums.</p>

  <p>The total funding for industrial museums in 2010-11 will ultimately depend on the bids which those museums make for grant funding from Museums Galleries Scotland under their various grant schemes.</p>

  <p>The Museums Task Force which I recently set up is considering a range of issues facing the sector and the future of the industrial museums is one of these. The Task Force will report in 2010.</p>

  <p>Following these discussions, and feedback from a number of stakeholders, NHS Grampian has recently reviewed its two-year staff nurse development programme and has now decided to adopt a one year programme based around the national Flying Start NHS programme.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>Individual NHS boards are responsible for planning services in their area and for securing the staff to deliver them. It is for NHS boards to determine their workforce requirements, based on the clinical needs and service developments in their area. However, they are asked to consider the role of nurses with a broader remit working in the community, as part of their plans to make sure that services meet the needs of people living with long-term conditions.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Diabetic Retinopathy Screening (DRS) Programme offers retinopathy screening to all eligible people with diabetes in Scotland. Implementation of the DRS Programme is adapted to each board&rsquo;s geography and population and diabetic retinopathy information is shared with optometrists in NHS Borders and NHS Highland as part of ongoing pilots. We will evaluate the pilots to determine whether this model meets the needs of the local diabetes populations.</p>

  <p>There are already examples of shifting the balance of care from the hospitals to community optometrists in some parts of Scotland. In NHS Fife, collaboration between hospital ophthalmologists and community optometrists has enabled the transfer of images between optometry and ophthalmology.</p>

  <p>As members know, I personally am sympathetic to a move to a system of opting out, as I&rsquo;d prefer to call it.</p>

  <p>We debated this issue on 18 December last year. The motion agreed by the Parliament was that we accept the UK Organ Donation Taskforce recommendation that the time wasn&rsquo;t right to make such a change. The motion says we&rsquo;ll look at this again in five years, but I made clear in the debate that we could re-visit the issue sooner if we felt there wasn&rsquo;t enough progress.</p>

  <p>There are signs that we&rsquo;re starting to cover what I&rsquo;ve called the &quot;hard miles&quot; towards making organ donation usual in NHSScotland. I announced last month that the donor figures for 2008-09 were the highest for 10 years. So I&rsquo;m prepared to give it a bit longer before we decide whether to re-open this issue.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is working closely with relevant police and other public authorities to ensure there is adequate preparation for the event. Information on policing costs is not routinely released ahead of an event such as this because of the potential security implications in doing so.</p>

  <p>Given the nature of the event and the terms of the Statement of Funding Policy between HM Treasury and the devolved administrations, we would expect the UK Government to meet the associated costs and we have sought their confirmation that this will be the case.</p>

I am not aware of any data on the local economic contribution attributable to these Parks, or for the Loch Lomond Regional Park (designated in 1988), the management of which has been taken over by the National Park Authority as part of the larger Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park.</p>

  <p>The arrangements for general practice in the National Health Service are set out in the NHS (General Medical Services Contracts)(Scotland) Regulations 2004. These provide that a general practitioner may not demand or accept a fee from a person on their patient list except in certain circumstances. These are set out in Schedule 4 to the Regulations.</p>

  <p>Paragraph (g) of Schedule 4 provides that in the case of any immunisation which is not available free of charge under National Health Service arrangements, and which is requested in connection with travel abroad, a general practitioner may take a fee.</p>

  <p>The cost of the treatment is a matter between the general practitioner and the patient.</p>
