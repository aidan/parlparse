  <p>Scottish Government has provided just over &pound;3 million to farmers via the National Fallen Stock Scheme for the funding period 2004-08 to support farmers in the collection and disposal of fallen stock as they adjusted to the new requirements on the disposal of fallen stock. This funding expired in November 2008. Following representations from devolved administrations and industry stakeholders, a further &pound;2 million was made available in 2009 from the GB Animal Health and Welfare budget. This is intended as transitional funding to support the collection and disposal of adult fallen cattle in Great Britain, which are required to be sampled for BSE surveillance purposes.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS), to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The SPS has no plans at this time to transfer female prisoners into Inverness. The facility in the prison previously set aside to accommodate female prisoners remains ready for use should the need arise as a consequence of overcrowding at HMP Cornton Vale.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what steps have been taken to recruit a suitable manager for the Thurso Disease Surveillance Centre.</p>

  <p>The Thurso Disease Surveillance Centre is not a Scottish Government facility but is part of the Scottish Agricultural College&rsquo;s (SAC) network of veterinary laboratories. SAC are a private company limited by guarantee.</p>

  <p>Due to the specialist nature of this post, in a remote part of Scotland, recruitment of a suitably trained and experienced veterinary surgeon is difficult. Recognising this challenge SAC moved rapidly to secure the services of two local veterinary practitioners who have been contracted to provide an uninterrupted service. An agreement has been reached with the local veterinary practice, DS McGregor and Partners, to ensure that appropriately trained vets will continue to provide a post mortem service from SAC&rsquo;s existing Janetstown premises, laboratory samples will also be sent to Thurso from other parts of Scotland to supplement this work.</p>

  <p>Veterinary officials are satisfied that these arrangements will meet the requirements of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s surveillance programme and will continue to monitor the situation.</p>
