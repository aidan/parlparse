  <p>Interim anti-social behaviour orders are intended to provide for more immediate protection than is possible under the full anti-social behaviour order application procedure. While anyone in breach of an interim order will face the sanctions of a full order, under section 22 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, interim orders are not intended to replace full anti-social behaviour orders. We do not, therefore, propose to link interim orders to security of tenure under section 35, subsections (1) to (3) of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001.</p>

  <p>The remit of the task group is to re-examine the principles and mechanisms of licensing as they are set out in the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982, and, having done so, review the existing provisions and any proposals for change submitted to the Scottish Executive. In doing so, the task group is required to ensure that the provisions are European Convention on Human Rights compliant and that they properly apply the principles of the Enforcement Concordat, which provides for fair, practical and consistent enforcement policy and practice.</p>

  <p>In reviewing the licensing provisions of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 it is for the independent task group to determine what consultations are required in the context of their deliberations.

  <p>The Executive appreciates that some aspects of effectiveness are difficult to evaluate. However:</p>

  <p>(a) its staff survey indicates that the percentage of staff who agreed that the Scottish Executive &quot;values its staff&quot;<em> </em>increased from 38% to 49% from 2000 to 2001. There was also a 2% reduction, over the same period, in the number of individuals who felt that they had been discriminated against (from 10% to 8% of staff);</p>

  <p>(b) an active programme of equality proofing is currently being pursued, and</p>

  <p>(c) the Executive&#146;s Outreach Project has participated in 11 career fairs and given presentations at six universities and 10 schools since December 2000. It has also held a week-long development programme for minority ethnic students and has in place a diversity placement scheme for summer 2002 which will provide six-week, paid work opportunities for around 20 minority ethnic graduates and undergraduates.</p>

  <p>The total number of non-statutory scheme cases resolved in these years was larger as it included those which were resolved without referral to an oral hearing. However, no separate statistics are available for such cases that involved incidents in Scotland. Few of the cases now outstanding will be resolved without a hearing.</p>

  <p>The original announcement was predicated on the programme being operated by Wellpark Enterprise Centre, in collaboration with Scottish Enterprise. Under the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, Wellpark Enterprise Centre would have been covered by an exception under section 34 of the act allowing the organisation to operate a scheme of this nature. Given the difficulties faced by Wellpark, the programme is now being operated directly by Scottish Enterprise. As a public body set up by enactment, Scottish Enterprise would not be able to deliver the programme exclusively targeted at women, as this would be unlawful under section 29 of the act.</p>

  <p>The remit of the Housing Improvement Task Force does not extend to issues of increasing supply; it is looking at the quality of the existing stock in the private rented sector. However, we are of the view that a strong private rented sector is important in providing choice and flexibility in the housing market and we will expect the task force to pay particular attention to the impact that any of its recommendations aimed at improving quality may have on the supply of privately rented housing.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive gave a commitment at the time the licensing scheme for HMOs was introduced to conduct a review of implementation in the light of the first year of operation of the scheme. Research to support this review is currently in progress and we expect to publish the results later in the summer. We will be consulting shortly on the specific issue of exemptions from the requirement to be licensed, and whether the current range of exemptions should be extended. We will take a view on the merits of reviewing the size threshold for licensing in the light of the outcome of our review including the results of the research, the consultation and discussions with relevant organisations and individuals.</p>

  <p>It is for the planning authority to formulate the development plan for its area within the context of national planning policy guidelines set down by the Scottish Executive. As an updated structure plan for Dundee and Angus has recently been submitted to the Scottish ministers for consideration, it would be inappropriate for me to comment at this stage on any proposals relating to urban expansion towards the east of Dundee. However, if the Scottish ministers consider that modifications should be made to the plan as submitted, they will advertise their proposed modifications and provide an opportunity for interested parties to make further representations.</p>

  <p>None. The determination of planning applications is a matter for the planning authorities in the first instance. Decisions on planning applications are required to be made in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise.</p>

  <p>There are no legislative provisions which specifically require educational facilities to be included as part of new housing developments. However, <em>National Planning Policy Guideline (NPPG) 3: Land for Housing</em> notes that when assessing the requirement for housing land, planning authorities will be guided by a number of considerations relevant to local circumstances such as the availability of community needs, including schools. <em>NPPG 3</em> is currently being reviewed.</p>

  <p>Under section 75 of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 a developer may enter into an agreement with a planning authority to provide infrastructure necessitated by his proposed development. Such infrastructure may include educational facilities.</p>

  <p>Where a planning authority wishes to grant planning permission for a development which constitutes a significant departure from the structure plan, it must first notify the application to the Scottish ministers. This gives ministers an opportunity to consider whether there are issues involved which would merit call-in of the planning application for their determination.</p>

  <p>Our current study will include detailed assessments of the local and national economic benefits generated by the link to the airport. These assessments will be carried out once the consultants have identified the preferred route options, later this year.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, with regard to the Report of the MMR Expert Group, whether any official guidance will be issued on the administering of single vaccines and on the length of time that should elapse between each vaccine, particularly in the case of measles, mumps and rubella vaccines.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-05-15.S1W-25524.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80140" speakername="Malcolm Chisholm" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0515.htm#13">

  <p>As stated in the answer given to question S1W-25472 on 30 April 2002, the Executive is grateful to the MMR Expert Group for producing an excellent report, which describes the consequences of pursuing an alternative vaccination policy to MMR. It is clear that none of the alternatives provides comparable protection - for the population or individual children - against measles, mumps and rubella. Expert medical advice confirms that MMR remains the safest and most effective way to protect children from these diseases.</p>

  <p>The Executive has no plans to change the current immunisation programme, and, therefore, no plans to revise the relevant guidance issued in December 2000 by the Scottish Executive Health Department&#146;s Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Chief Nursing Officer and Chief Pharmaceutical Officer.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer, <a name="QuestionText"> further to his answer to question S1W-23245 on 18 March 2002, whether no further amounts will be paid to Flour City Architectural Metals UK Limited and whether he will clarify what costs are "yet to be agreed", what work these costs relate to, whether these works are those referred to in the answers, namely those "mainly comprised detailing of interfaces between complex cladding elements", and who will be liable for these costs.</a></p>
