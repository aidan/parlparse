  <p>We have made good progress in various ways since October 2004. The introduction of the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 and the involvement of carer organisations in the associated guidance has helped to improve support to young carers. The Executive commissioned a Mori poll to help identify the number of young carers and their level of caring. That poll was undertaken in schools early in 2005, and the report was published on 7 September.</p>

  <p>Last year, the Executive commissioned a major study on the future of unpaid care in Scotland. I announced the publication of the results of that study in September and subsequently discussed it with carers organisations. The report looked specifically at young carers and includes a recommendation relating to the development of a national young carers strategy and the creation of a national forum for young carers. We are presently liaising with key stakeholders to scope the report&rsquo;s 22 recommendations, including those on young carers, and I will respond to the report in the spring.</p>

  <p>In the period 2002-05 ICSP used Community Safety Award Programme to fund initiatives such as: employing a New Start development worker to work with young people in the earliest stages of antisocial behaviour and substance misuse; employing a domestic abuse co-ordinator, and expanding the Living Safely initiative to all vulnerable residents in Inverclyde through the provision of additional home security information and advice.</p>

  <p>Dental records are the property of the dentist. The dental records of patients previously, but no longer, registered with a dentist under NHS will therefore remain in the dentist&rsquo;s possession. Under their NHS terms of service dentists are required to retain records for a period of two years after completion of any course of treatment.</p>

  <p>Information on the total number of sales of residential properties is taken from a database of sales compiled by Registers of Scotland. The analysis excludes sales with a value of less than &pound;20,000 and over &pound;1 million, and also aims to exclude non-market sales. Analyses from the Registers of Scotland database cannot distinguish sales of newly constructed properties.</p>

  <p>The table also shows the number of private sector new houses completed in each year. While not all private sector houses completed in a year will be sold in that year, subtracting the total number of private sector houses completed from the total number of sales will give a reasonable estimate of the number of resales in the year.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The information in this table has been extracted from the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service&rsquo;s Case Management Database. The database is a live, operational database used to manage the processing of reports submitted to procurators fiscal by the police and other reporting agencies.</p>

  <p>2. The table is sorted using the totals for 2004-05.</p>

  <p>3. The table has been limited to those charges with a frequency of at least 100 in financial year 2004-05 (which accounts for 86 per cent of charges dealt with as warnings that year).</p>

  <p>4. In 2004-05, there were a total of 42,059 charge records relating to 36,723 accused persons where the charge was dealt with as a warning. In total there were 954 different charges (i.e. different crimes/offences) where one or more of the charges was dealt with by means of a warning.</p>

  <p>5. Where a piece of legislation is referred to more than once in the table, this indicates that there is more than one offence under the relevant section of the act.</p>

  <p>6. A case may involve more than one accused and/or more than one charge. A case disposed of by the issue of a warning may therefore have involved more than one charge.</p>

  <p>NHS 24 is committed to the highest possible standards of openness, honesty and accountability.

  <p>NHS 24 has a robust and thorough quality improvement and performance management programme which secures on-going training and development for all staff.</p>

  <p>All frontline staff are supported by an individual professional development plan, regular call consultation reviews and robust support and supervision from their team leader. All learning, including that from patient comments, complaints and compliments, is fed back both to the individual and into the organisation. This includes examples of best practice that are routinely highlighted by call and consultation review.</p>

  <p>There are currently five NHS 24 satellite centres based in Ayr, Dumfries, Dundee, East Kilbride and Inverness which were established towards the end of 2005 and which supported the response to the increased call demand over the traditionally busy festive period. The benefits of having these centres will be evaluated over the coming months.</p>

  <p>The evaluation will help inform the further considerations of NHS 24 and NHS area boards about the need for any further call centre development.</p>

  <p>The provision of changing facilities is a matter of local policy and no central monitoring is undertaken of the level of such provision. Scottish Health Planning Notes 03 and 04 provide general guidance on the provision of changing facilities recommending that where accommodation is located outwith a department it is necessary to provide a cloakroom, small lockers, showers and WC for staff working within that department.</p>

  <p>More recently Scottish Health Facilities Note 30 has reinforced the need for staff changing facilities in the context of infection prevention and control.</p>

  <p>Scottish Health Facilities Note (SHFN) 30: <i>Infection Control in the Built Environment</i> provides guidance on infection prevention and control in relation to the built environment. This includes guidance on the provision of staff changing facilities.</p>

  <p>The Healthcare Associated Infection (HAI) Task Force commissioned the NHSScotland Property and Environment Forum to review SHFN 30, and revised guidance was issued to all NHS boards in September 2005.</p>

  <p>SHFN 30 should be used in conjunction with the HAI System for the Control of Infection in the Built Environment &ndash; a questionnaire that helps to identify and manage infection control hazards in the built environment.</p>

  <p>It is for boards to decide how these guidelines are implemented locally.</p>

  <p>Whilst a number of options are being considered, further work is required and no decisions have been taken on Waverley Phase 2. Therefore, we would not expect any organisations, including our own to commit funding at this early stage.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-21768 by Colin Boyd QC on 13 January 2006, whether it would consider any flight which was found to be involved in the process of &quot;extraordinary rendition&quot; as a civil aircraft.</p>

  <p>The question whether an aircraft is a civil aircraft will depend on the application of domestic and, so far as relevant, international law to the particular facts. The Chicago Convention of 1944 on International Civil Aviation applies only to civil and not to state aircraft, which are described as aircraft used in military, customs and police services. Section 92 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982 defines &quot;military aircraft&quot; as an aircraft of the naval, military or air forces of any country, or any other aircraft in respect of which there is in force a certificate issued by the Secretary of State in accordance with any Order in Council in force under the act that the aircraft is to be treated for the purposes of that Order in Council as a military aircraft. Civil aviation is a reserved matter.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether, under the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding or other means of communication, it has been advised by the Foreign Office that it should now be admitted that an unknown number of rendition flights have used facilities at UK airports but that Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government will refer to the US Secretary of State&rsquo;s assurance that such flights are not used to carry prisoners to be tortured in sovereign regimes and, if investigations currently being pursued in other countries indicate that the US Secretary of State has been mistaken, what measures will be instigated in Scotland to prevent any complicity in the illegal transport of prisoners.</p>

  <p>I am satisfied that convictions secured prior to the introduction of Crown Production 16 are safe.</p>

  <p>The Appeal Court made clear in their decision of 16 December 1999 that while Production 16 was a relevant document, what was subcontracted under the Operations and Maintenance Agreement was not something for which the Secretary of State&rsquo;s consent was required.</p>
