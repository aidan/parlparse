  <p>Premises which could hold an off-sales licence under the 1976 Licensing (Scotland) Act are divided into the following categories: shops, supermarkets, garages (from which fuel and other items are sold), &quot;other&quot; and &quot;unknown&quot;.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-02-02.S3W-31016.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80370" speakername="Alex Neil" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa0202.htm#2">

  <p>Callers to the Energy Assistance Package helpline do not make an application as such. Where appropriate, the local Energy Saving Scotland adviser takes them through an assessment to determine whether they should be referred to stages two, three, and four of the package. On referral, their eligibility is then assessed by specialist advisors and responsibility for appeals passes to the different service providers.</p>

  <p>Stage 2:</p>

  <p>(a) EST Referral Process</p>

  <p>The EAP advisor makes a preliminary assessment of eligibility before referring callers, as appropriate, to the Pensions Service, Citizens Advice Direct, or to their energy supplier. If a caller insisted on being referred for a benefits check or a social tariff check, the EAP advisor would refer them, even if it appeared that they were not eligible.</p>

  <p>One person has complained to EST about social tariffs, but not about the referral process itself.</p>

  <p>(b) Individuals Referred to Stage 2 Service Suppliers</p>

  <p>The results of stage 2 referrals to the Pensions Service, Citizens Advice Direct, or energy suppliers, are only reported in summary statistics, not individual cases, due to data protection issues. Any appeals would be dealt with under the appeals process of the relevant organisation.</p>

  <p>Stage 3</p>

  <p>(a) EST Referral Process</p>

  <p>If callers appear to be eligible for stage 3, but not stage 4, they are referred directly to energy suppliers, who will determine their eligibility for stage 3 measures. When callers appear to be eligible for both stages 3 and 4, they are referred directly to stage 4 for an eligibility survey. If it is found that they are not eligible for stage 4, they are referred to energy suppliers, who will determine their eligibility for stage 3 measures.</p>

  <p>(b) Households Referred to Energy Suppliers for Stage 3 Measures</p>

  <p>Any appeal would be dealt with under the appeals process of the relevant energy supplier.</p>

  <p>Stage 4</p>

  <p>(a) EST Referral Process</p>

  <p>EST has had some complaints about not being referred to stage 4, but no formal appeals. In the case of such complaints, EST:</p>

  <p>undertakes a full investigation of the client&rsquo;s status regarding stage 4 eligibility and if not referred due to a disputed energy rating, offers a reassessment;</p>

  <p>explains as clearly and sympathetically as possible why the household is not S4 eligible;</p>

  <p>explains that their details can be stored so that if eligibility conditions are changed in future they can be contacted;</p>

  <p>recommends that they should call again if there is a change to their circumstances or to their heating system;</p>

  <p>assesses what other assistance may be available to them via stages 1, 2 and 3 and re-offers this if it has not been taken up initially, and</p>

  <p>thanks the caller for their feedback, and lets them know that it will be recorded.</p>

  <p>(b) Households Referred to Managing Agent</p>

  <p>When households are referred to Scottish Gas, the managing agent for stage 4, they are offered an eligibility survey to assess both the eligibility of the household and the SAP rating of the dwelling. Of the households rejected following the eligibility survey, 599 have appealed. Of these, 529 have subsequently been accepted for stage 4 measures, for the following reasons:</p>

  <p>- proof of household eligibility not provided at survey, supplied at appeal = 427;</p>

  <p>- amendment to regulation meant that the dwelling, correctly assessed at the time of survey as ineligible, became eligible as being energy inefficient from 21 December = 69</p>

  <p>- dwelling became inefficient post-survey = 33; various reasons recorded here, but most commonly that a Gas Safe Registered Engineer confirmed in writing that the boiler had broken down or been condemned.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-29821 by Bruce Crawford on 14 January 2010, whether the &pound;40 million stated in the answer is derived from the Scottish Government budget.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-02-02.S3W-30959.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80300" speakername="Bruce Crawford" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa0202.htm#3">

  <p>The &pound;40 million reflects the contribution Scottish taxpayers make to the costs on a population share basis. Scotland is in surplus on current spending and is therefore in a stronger fiscal position than the UK in the most recent GERS reports. This suggests that Scottish taxpayers actually contribute more than their population share to this and other UK-wide services.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the First Minister&rsquo;s statement that &quot;Nicola Sturgeon has extended the opening hours of GP surgeries in Scotland&quot; ( <em>Official Report</em> c. 23006), whether it will provide details of these extended opening hours and where they are in operation.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Where main offence.</p>

  <p>2. The recording of aggravators has improved over time therefore caution is needed when comparing changes over time. 2005-06 is the first year where it has been considered that the use and recording of domestic abuse aggravator codes from the Scottish Government Court Proceedings Database has been of sufficient coverage to be used.</p>

  <p>3. The data recording codes for aggravators changed on 10 March 2008. The new codes will be reconciled against the existing codes when the 2008-09 data is available in March 2010.</p>

  <p>4. Incorporates an approximate mapping of sheriff courts into local authority areas. Some sheriff courts will deal with cases from more than one local authority area.</p>

  <p><strong>Frank Mulholland: </strong>Suicide has not, in modern times, been considered a criminal offence in Scotland and therefore, unlike in England and Wales, there is no criminal offence of assisted suicide. Any question of responsibility for causing the death of another could amount to homicide and would be investigated as such.</p>

  <p>A decision to prosecute would be taken by Crown Counsel on the facts and circumstances of the particular case and the Law Officers do not regard it as appropriate to prepare and publish detailed prosecution policy guidance in this area as the Director of Public Prosecutions has recently done in England and Wales.</p>

  <p>Jackson Carlaw (West of Scotland) (Con): To ask the Scottish Executive how many cases have been prosecuted with a charge of culpable homicide against someone alleged to have assisted another person to commit suicide and how many resulted in convictions, in each year for which data are available.</p>
