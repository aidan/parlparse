  <p>General dental practitioners in both areas will benefit from elements of the Executive&#146;s &quot;Golden Hello&quot; package directly and indirectly.

Consequently, dentists who have completed their vocational training and enter substantive general dental practice in Grampian will receive a &#163;10,000 allowance over two years and dental graduates taking up their training year in this area will receive an allowance of &#163;3,000. In Tayside, dentists who have completed their vocational training and enter substantive general dental practice will receive a &#163;5,000 allowance over two years.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not directly support any organisations which support male victims of domestic abuse. It does however provide &#163;79,500 under Section 10 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 to Family Mediation Central Scotland. The aim of mediation is to enable divorced or separated parents to come to negotiated agreements about practical arrangements such as contact with children.

The Executive monitors drug action team activities through the annual corporate accountability process. Drug action teams were due to report on current services and their plans by 30 April.</p>

  <p>Executive funding for drug treatment services to the NHS board, from which Inverclyde will benefit, has increased by over &#163;645,000 over the three years 2001-02 to 2003-04.

  <p>Under the drugs strategy, treatment and care services, including information, advice, counselling and day and residential care, are delivered by a range of agencies, including NHS boards, local authorities and the voluntary sector. Voluntary sector organisations provide a broad range of services, usually commissioned and purchased by NHS boards and local authorities. There are voluntary sector providers in all drug action team (DAT) areas.</p>

  <p>In addition, it is an integral part of the drugs strategy that community views should inform the work of DATs and their constituent agencies. This includes the views of voluntary organisations with an interest, whether or not they provide drug misuse services. Voluntary sector involvement in the work of DATs is monitored annually by the Executive.</p>

  <p>Voluntary organisations also participate in policy development at national level.</p>

  <p>Appropriate safeguards are in place to protect the environment, but we are continually refining these in the light of experience and scientific advice, to ensure that processes that have a disproportionate impact on the environment do not proceed.</p>

  <p>Research is going on to examine Scottish waters to assess contribution of various activities, including fish farming, to eutrophication. A review of possible links between aquaculture, eutrophication and shellfish poisoning events is also under way. We are scoping the further necessary research required to establish the carrying capacity of coastal waters.</p>

  <p>The Area Management Agreement process is helping to increase trust between fish farmers and wild fishery interests, to work together and resolve local problems, especially sea lice. Escapes must be prevented, and site specific containment and contingency plans are now required in support of all fish farm applications. Legislation to require reporting of escapes was laid before Parliament on 19 April 2002.</p>

  <p>Timber is indeed a significant asset to the rural economy and we look forward to it having an increasing impact. The forestry industry in Scotland currently employs over 10,000 people, most of whom live in rural areas. The industry will, however, develop as timber production from our forests is set to double over the next 10 to 15 years. One of the strategic directions in our Scottish Forestry Strategy is &quot;To maximise the value to the Scottish economy of the wood resource becoming available over the next 20 years&quot; We aim to maximise the value to the rural economy of this timber resource becoming available by working closely with the Scottish Forest Industries Cluster to promote competitiveness and innovation.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is bound, by Article 6.1 and 6.2 of Directive 90/220/EEC, to consider whether an application to release a genetically modified organism into the environment does, or does not, comply with the terms set out elsewhere in the directive. Ministers are required to grant consent for a release, where they are satisfied that the application is in compliance with the directive and will not pose a threat to human health or environmental safety. A moratorium or refusal to grant approval would be illegal unless based on sound scientific evidence of potential harm.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers discharge their responsibility to base their decisions on sound scientific evidence by referring applications to expert advisory bodies; principally the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE). ACRE examines all relevant material in relation to a proposed release and advises ministers as to whether, in its opinion, the release will pose a threat to the environment.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers have powers under Article 6.6 of Directive 90/220/EEC to modify the conditions of, suspend or terminate GM crop trials where, at any time, information becomes available which could have significant consequences for the risks posed by the release. No such sound scientific evidence has emerged which might call into question the safety of any of the Scottish trials.</p>

  <p>The safety of medicines is a reserved matter and is the responsibility of the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) and the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM).</p>

  <p>The MCA has advised that various data sources are used for monitoring drug safety. This includes the Yellow Card Scheme, where health professionals&#146; report suspected adverse drug reactions to the MCA/CSM. The value of spontaneous reporting schemes such as the Yellow Card Scheme is in the early identification of possible drug hazards. The other data sources used regularly in the monitoring of drug safety in the UK include formal safety studies, published medical literature, information from pharmaceutical companies and other regulatory authorities throughout the world. When a new safety issue is confirmed, regulatory action is taken to minimise risk. This may include strengthened product warnings or restricting the terms of the marketing authorisation. Rarely, if there is evidence that the balance of risks and benefits is no longer favourable, it may be necessary to remove the medicine from the market.</p>

  <p>The MCA/CSM monitor the safety of all new medicines under the &quot;black triangle scheme&quot; where any of the following circumstances apply: if the medicine contains a new active substance or a combination of active substances; if the medicine is administered via a new route or drug delivery system; if the medicine is going to be used in a new population of patients.</p>

  <p>The present Chairman of Caledonian MacBrayne was appointed for a three-year term from 1 August 1999. An announcement relating to the future arrangements for this post will be made in due course. The processes and procedures for public appointments, including the involvement of independent advisers, are set out in the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments (OCPA) Code of Practice. These procedures are strictly followed for all appointments to Caledonian MacBrayne. They were introduced to ensure the selection process for public appointments is fair, impartial and transparent. The commissioner&#146;s comments in relation to the 1999 appointment process have been borne in mind in all subsequent appointment processes, including those relating to Caledonian MacBrayne. One of the main conclusions of the commissioner&#146;s report was that the present chairman was appointed on merit.</p>

  <p>In a letter dated 4 December 2001, Railtrack advised that at that time the delivery of its core maintenance and renewal programme left no signalling or management resources available to support the Larkhall-Milngavie rail project. Since then, the Scottish Executive has been pressing the Strategic Rail Authority and Railtrack, to take this project forward. We have also continued to support Strathclyde Passenger Transport (SPTE) to try and find practical ways to keep this scheme moving forward. These various discussions are ongoing.</p>

  <p>As my reply made clear, the amendment or repeal of the British Railways (No. 3) Order Confirmation Act 1994 is not a matter for the Scottish Executive. It is both private legislation and a reserved matter. The provisions of the 1994 act, including the relevant parliamentary powers to make the railway, remain in force.</p>

  <p>The revised guidance for Procurators Fiscal, referred to in the answer given to question S1W-24478, is internal guidance on which it has not been necessary to consult the police but will be based largely on the recommendations made by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service's Quality and Practice Review Unit which have been published.

  <p>Early feedback from project reports, visits and the Ministerial Steering Group suggests that the New Community Schools Initiative is delivering significant benefits through new ways of working.</p>

  <p>The New Community Schools Initiative is bringing about better integrated service provision by schools and their partner agencies, making a real difference to the lives of children and their families, the development of closer relationships between schools and parents, and increasing engagement of pupils with their local communities.</p>

  <p>That is why we are placing the new community school approach at the heart of our education agenda, and have committed ourselves to supporting its roll out across all schools in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The detail of the negotiations is a matter for VisitScotland and the area tourist boards (ATB), who are partners in the Joint Venture. Three ATB Chief Executives are members of the project board.</p>

  <p>VisitScotland has statutory responsibility under the Development of Tourism Act 1969, as amended by the Tourism (Overseas Promotion) (Scotland) Act 1984, to encourage people to visit Scotland and to encourage the provision and improvement of tourist amenities and facilities in Scotland. The performance indicators for VisitScotland are published annually in their Corporate Plan. The Executive will lead work to develop key performance indicators and targets and to develop a detailed measurement framework for the actions contained in the recently published <i>Tourism Framework for Action</i> . VisitScotland&#146;s performance indicators will be revised as part of that work.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive provides a range of funding to the voluntary sector. Funding opportunities are advertised in the leaflet <i>A Guide for the Voluntary Sector to Scottish Executive Grants.</i> This guide is updated annually, is distributed widely throughout the voluntary sector, and is on our website.</p>

  <p>Our policies on funding the voluntary sector are set out in the Scottish Compact Good Practice Guide to Funding. Scottish Executive funding is available:</p>

  <p>for activities that promote Scottish Executive objectives;</p>

  <p>to support capacity building within organisations on the basis of agreed outputs;</p>

  <p>to fund core management, administrative and relevant training costs where an organisation has a continuing role in the delivery of particular policy objectives;</p>

  <p>for national generic infrastructure organisations and associated local networks to promote the growth and effectiveness of voluntary and community organisations, and</p>

  <p>on a time-limited basis, for innovative projects where the Scottish Executive has a particular interest in taking forward an experimental approach.</p>

  <p>Applications for funding from voluntary organisations are assessed against Scottish Executive priorities and against each individual grant scheme&#146;s criteria, which are set by the Scottish Executive division responsible for each scheme.</p>

  <p>Final decisions on funding are made by ministers.</p>
