  <p>The Scottish Government is working closely with the police, other enforcement agencies and the UK Government to combat human trafficking generally.</p>

  <p>There is an element within the budget for the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games which covers all aspect of security. A multi-agency group led by Strathclyde Police and including representatives from UKBA, Glasgow City Council, the Organising Committee and the UK Human Trafficking Centre is in place. This group will consider all potential security issues, including human trafficking for economic and sexual exploitation, associated with the Commonwealth Games, both during the construction programme and during the games themselves.</p>

  <p>In addition, there are existing arrangements which have been implemented following the UK&rsquo;s ratification of the <em>Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings.</em> These include the provision of funding by the Scottish Government to support adult victims of trafficking and collaborative work with the UK Government and enforcement agencies to implement the National Referral Mechanism (the multi-agency approach to identifying victims of trafficking). These arrangements are designed to meet the needs of victims trafficked for any reason, including any trafficking associated with the Commonwealth Games.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not yet collected centrally. However, the first biennial reports on the exercise of the functions of adult protection committees are due to be submitted to Scottish ministers in October 2010. The Scottish Government is also working with COSLA to develop a survey on the use of the Adult Support and Protection (Scotland) Act since its enactment last year. Information from the survey will be available early in 2010 to provide an interim report in advance of the first biennial report.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how it will ensure that people caring for older people in care homes are made aware of section 1 of the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000 with regard to the administration of antipsychotic drugs.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-11-06.S3W-28522.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80379" speakername="Shona Robison" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa1106.htm#3">

  <p>Anyone authorised to make decisions on behalf of an adult with impaired capacity under the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000, as amended, must take account of the views of others with an interest in the person&rsquo;s welfare. The act lists those who should be consulted whenever practicable and reasonable. It includes the person&rsquo;s primary carer, nearest relative, named person, attorney or guardian (when in place).</p>

  <p>This principle is set out in the revised Code of Practice for part 5 of the act (which deals with medical treatment and research). The code was first issued in March 2008, and again (to NHS Scotland, its affiliates and care homes) in September this year, following the publication of the joint report by the Care Commission and Mental Welfare Commission, <em>Remember, I&rsquo;m still me, </em>on the quality of care for people with dementia living in care homes in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The report highlighted the inappropriate use of medication, amongst other serious failings, in caring for older people with dementia. From this, we are developing a dementia strategy, to be published in April 2010, to ensure that the required improvements in dementia care are identified and addressed in a comprehensive way for the first time.</p>

  <p>Dementia is a priority for the Scottish Government. In taking forward the strategy, the use of medication and its management, including the use of antipsychotic medication, is one of the issues being addressed. Through time, the strategy will make a real difference not just to those with dementia, but also to their carers and families.</p>

  <p>Health Rights Information Scotland has recently published <em>Caring and Con</em>sent which can be accessed at <a href="http://www.hris.org.uk/index.aspx?o=5099" target="_blank">http://www.hris.org.uk/index.aspx?o=5099</a>. This sets out, in plain English, carers&rsquo; rights to be involved in decisions about the healthcare of the adult they care for, including those who lack capacity.</p>

  <p>The response to question S3W-27050 indicated that 64 of the 73 Scottish Parliament constituencies have an alcohol-related death rate higher than the UK average. The University of Sheffield report <em>Model-Based Appraisal of Alcohol Minimum Pricing and Off-Licensed Trade Discount Bans in Scotland</em> (Bib. number 49447) estimated that minimum pricing would prevent a significant number of alcohol-related deaths in the longer term.</p>

  <p>The Sheffield report did not assess within which population sub-groups or geographical areas these deaths may be prevented but it did indicate that minimum pricing is most effective among heavy drinkers as a general group. Our framework for action on alcohol misuse commits us to monitoring and evaluating the impact of our actions, including minimum pricing, in reducing alcohol-related harm in Scotland. An important part of this work will be to monitor the impact of our actions on different population sub-groups and on health inequalities more generally.</p>

  <p>Funding of flood prevention and coast protection schemes has been rolled up into the General Capital Grant distributed to local authorities since 1 April 2008. The distribution of this funding took account of the then expected costs of a number of known schemes spread over the six years to 2013-14.</p>

  <p>Decisions on the levels of funding provided to local authorities will be taken in the next spending review. However, work undertaken jointly by the Scottish Government and COSLA to review the future distribution of resources has recognised the continuing requirement to take account of contractual commitments in determining the allocation of funds. Subject to final agreement by ministers and COSLA, we expect that the distribution of General Capital Grant for 2010-11 and beyond will continue to recognise the commitment made to long-term contracts, such as those for flood prevention and coast protection schemes.</p>

  <p>The final decisions on how capital funds are spent rest with the local authorities based upon their assessment of local requirements and the level of funds that they can afford to allocate to them.</p>

  <p>The standards referred to in paragraph 17 relate to the standards and obligations to be met by both the community service schemes and potential external placement providers in relation to compliance with relevant working conditions. This includes areas such as health and safety and equal opportunities. These are set out in paragraphs 18 to 25 of the National Objectives and Standards for Community Service, and are maintained in the Guidance on Community Service, which has replaced the National Objectives and Standards since 1 June 2009.</p>

  <p>Information in the form requested is not available. There are no waiting lists for guardianship orders under the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000. Guardianship applications are made to the sheriff court, and only the sheriff can grant an order. A guardianship order provides the legal authority for someone to make decisions and act on behalf of a person with impaired capacity, in order to safeguard and promote their interests in financial or welfare matters or both.</p>

  <p>Anyone with an interest in an adult, including a family member, can apply for a guardianship order. The Chief Social Work Officer for the adult&rsquo;s local authority has a duty to apply for welfare guardianship where no one else is applying and the adult has been assessed as needing a guardian. Further information can be found on the website for the Office of the Public Guardian, including statistics on the time taken to register guardianships.</p>

  <p>CalMac Ferries Limited and NorthLink Ferries Limited, both subsidiaries of David MacBrayne Limited, operate subsidised ferry services in Scotland on the basis of contracts awarded by the Scottish Government. The employment and training of staff is a matter for the operators, which advertise recruitment in around 15 educational establishments mainly within the communities served by the ferry services.</p>

  <p>This creates training opportunities for local colleges and providers in delivering the courses required before employees take up ship-board duties and in ongoing training and development. The companies themselves also run training schemes which involve the use of colleges and other training establishments. Discussions with these institutions are ongoing.</p>

  <p>Marine Scotland also facilitates cadet training on its vessels in conjunction with training providers. When requested Marine Scotland provides berths on its vessels to allow cadets to gain sea time and experience. This includes cadets who may have attended Glasgow College of Nautical Studies.</p>

  <p>My officials work closely with all local authority/NHS partnerships to reduce the level of delayed discharges in Scotland. In addition, the Joint Improvement Team is working with individual partnerships that have requested assistance. Various support tools have also been made available for partnerships to adopt.</p>

  <p>We are working with COSLA to jointly address any issues that arise that can impact on delayed discharge.</p>

  <p>Historically, delayed discharge figures rise in July. The performance in 2009 should be seen in context as there were 627 patients delayed for more than six weeks in July 2006 under the previous administration.</p>

  <p>There are Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) Guidelines on the managements of osteoporosis (71) and on the management of hip fractures in older people (111), which recommend that &quot;patients who have suffered one or more fragility fractures should be priority targets for the investigation and treatment of osteoporosis&quot; to prevent further fractures. Both guidelines recommend the use of DEXA scanning as a diagnostic tool, as these scans can be used to determine bone mineral density and all NHS boards have access to DEXA scanning.</p>

  <p>An NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS) Audit published at the end of 2005 also concluded that a fracture liaison service and direct access to assessment by DEXA scanning would allow patients who have sustained a fracture to be offered and receive appropriate therapies to prevent osteoporotic fractures in future.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has issued guidance which places a duty on NHS boards and Community Health Partnerships (CHPs) to have a combined falls and bone health strategy in place. The guidance sets out specific action for both NHS boards and CHPs to progress work on falls and falls prevention. Their progress towards will be reviewed in early 2010.</p>

  <p>Since November 2008, an osteoporosis Directed Enhanced Service (DES) has been offered to all Scottish GP practices to ensure eligible women who have had a fragility fracture are investigated for possible osteoporosis. Practices are rewarded for reaching benchmark target levels of achievement for referral for a DEXA scan and for offering bone sparing treatment for eligible women. The DES will run until 31 March 2010.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many prescriptions for (a) sibutramine and (b) orlisat have been dispensed to individuals aged (i) under 16, (ii) 16 to 18 and (iii) over 18 in each of the last five years, broken down by NHS board.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-11-06.S3W-28365.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80379" speakername="Shona Robison" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa1106.htm#16">

  <p>The following tables show the total number of prescribed items for orlistat and sibutramine dispensed in the community by community pharmacists and dispensing doctors in NHS board areas for the past five years ending 31 March. These data exclude the direct supply of medicines to patients from hospitals or hospital-based clinics.</p>

  <p>The data shown relate to items dispensed to patients aged under 16 years and all other patients. These data are not patient-specific and cannot be used as a proxy for the number of patients receiving treatment with a particular medicine.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to identify from the information collected centrally medicines dispensed to all patients aged 16 to 18 years. It is also important to note that the data relating to patients aged under 16 years rely solely on the patient or their representative ticking the correct exemption category box on the back of the prescription form. These data cannot be validated as part of the prescription pricing process.</p>

  <p>In 2008, the Scottish Government announced its approach to considering the effective management of property assets and the location of public bodies. This approach puts decisions about the location of public bodies in the context of the need to seek maximum efficiency from the use of the existing public sector estate, ensuring the operational effectiveness of individual organisations and obtaining the best value for money for the overall Scottish Government.</p>

  <p>In considering the accommodation requirements of relevant public bodies, an analysis is undertaken of the business needs of the organisation to review its business functions, how these are delivered and to what extent any of them are location dependent. That process allows identification of the most efficient options for accommodating the body in question, including consideration of location.</p>

  <p>In the last two years, four organisations have been considered. These were the Mental Welfare Commission, Judicial Appointments Board for Scotland, the Standards Commission and the Chief Investigating Officer. This has resulted in all four organisations satisfying the requirements of the asset management policy on relocation.</p>

  <p>There are presently two core Scottish Government office buildings that are vacant. Action is currently in hand with a view to their disposal. In terms of underused buildings, we are working to ensure that all parts of the Scottish Government have in place asset management plans which will identify any spare accommodation capacity which offer rationalisation and consolidation opportunities.</p>

  <p>The remuneration package was set at the beginning of the recruitment process by Scottish Enterprise in consultation with Scottish ministers. The package was established in line with the Scottish Government&rsquo;s <em>Public Sector Pay Policy for Senior Appointments.</em></p>

  <p>I have asked chairs of public bodies covered by the <em>Scottish Government&rsquo;s Public Sector Pay Policy for Senior Appointments</em> to invite chief executives to consider, in light of the current economic climate, waiving, on a voluntary basis, some or all of any bonus that may be due to them.</p>

  <p>The remuneration package took into account a Hay Group job size evaluation report completed in October 2008. This independent, market-facing review considered the chief executive role as it is now, after the implementation of the enterprise network reforms announced in September 2007.</p>

  <p>The official public sector employment series is only available at Scotland level. An alternative source is the Annual Population Survey (APS), however there are some quality issues with the data. The APS is a household survey and individuals self-classify whether they work in the public or private sector. As a result, the APS over estimates the number of public sector workers because some respondents unknowingly report themselves as working in the public sector when in fact they work in the private sector according to National Accounts definitions. The latest APS data over estimates total public sector employment by around 14% and this may vary across local authorities.</p>

  <p>The table below provides estimates from the latest APS showing how many employees respond that they work in the public sector by local authority. The information is not available for Scottish Parliamentary regions.</p>

  <p>This information is drawn from the Statutory Performance Indicators (SPIs) on respite collected by Audit Scotland. It is necessary in the first instance for Audit Scotland to be satisfied with the technical aspects of the data. The Scottish Government must also carefully analyse the data. I plan to publish the Scotland-wide data as soon as it has undergone the necessary checks.</p>
