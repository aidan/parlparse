  <p>The Scottish Executive will be undertaking a full and open debate with all stakeholders on the various flexibilities set out in the CAP Reform agreement of June 2003. A formal consultation will be launched in October and will last for a period of three months. This consultation will look at how the different flexibilities available in the agreement can be used in Scotland to achieve the vision set out in <em>A Forward Strategy for Scottish Agriculture</em> . Other elements of the consultation involve a national stakeholder group, regional stakeholder meetings and a conference. Decisions on the various options will be taken once the consultation process is complete early in 2004.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has made no recent assessment of the containment measures, as this is a matter for the Ministry of Defence.</p>

  <p>QinetiQ operates the Luce Bay range on behalf of the Ministry of Defence and undertakes an annual survey of the trial area. A full survey was conducted on 26 August 2002, and an interim visual assessment in April this year. Both the survey and visual assessment confirmed the safe and satisfactory containment of the area in question.</p>

  <p>A further full survey commenced on 3 September 2003.</p>

  <p>It is the responsibility of the NHS board or Primary Care NHS Trust to assess the overall provision of dental services in its area. However, the Scottish Executive recognises that there are increasing problems with access to NHS dental services in Dumfries and Galloway. For this reason, Dumfries and Galloway is one of the designated areas of Scotland which benefit from enhanced incentives from the recruitment and retention packages introduced by the Executive.</p>

  <p>Access to NHS dentistry and the conditions under which dentists work is being kept under constant review.</p>

  <p>I have taken the term &quot;middle grade doctors&quot; to refer to non-consultant career grade (NCCG) doctors. The salary levels applied to non-consultant career grades and to junior training grade doctors, as for all medical staff, are recommended annually by the Doctors&#146; and Dentists&#146; Review Body (DDRB), which is independent of government. The Scottish Executive has consistently accepted all the recommendations of the DDRB and implemented them in full.</p>

  <p>The DDRB made clear this year in their Thirty-Second Report that any consideration they might give to additional remuneration for NCCGs should follow on from reviews into medical career structures which are currently being undertaken across the UK, including in Scotland. These reviews are expected to report to ministers before the end of the year.</p>

  <p>Education authorities should have procedures in place to identify and provide for pupils with dyslexia, and other support needs. A number of tools may be used to this end, including routine monitoring and assessment of class work by classroom staff.</p>

  <p>In support of this, in 2003-04 the Scottish Executive has provided &#163;8.4 million for the training and development of staff working with pupils with additional support needs. In addition, Dyslexia Scotwest and the Scottish Dyslexia Trust have been awarded over &#163;180,000 from the Special Educational Needs Innovation Grants Programme 2002-04 in support of two dyslexia-specific projects. Furthermore, over &#163;20 million of inclusion programme funding has been provided by the Executive to local authorities to support pupils with additional support needs.</p>

  <p>Proposals contained in the draft Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Bill aim to strengthen further the duties on education authorities to identify and address the needs of pupils who require additional support, including those with dyslexia.</p>

  <p>Regulation of international trade is a reserved matter. However, the Scottish Executive continues to be in regular contact with DTI and other Government Departments on trade issues, including the GATS negotiations, to ensure that Scottish interests are fully taken account of.</p>

  <p>The GATS negotiations do not threaten the Executive&#146;s right to supply water services as a public sector service. Public services are excluded from the scope of GATS and the EC&#146;s initial offer to the World Trade Organization on 29 April did not contain any commitments on water services.</p>

  <p>Changes to the fee regime for higher education in England are not planned until 2005-06, subject to parliamentary approval. We have initiated a third phase of our review of higher education in order to consider the possible impacts on Scottish higher education of any new funding system introduced in England. We are working closely with a range of interested organisations to gather and analyse relevant data. The third phase of the review is due to report early in 2004.

  <p>A Government decision to recommend UK entry into EMU is a reserved matter, and therefore a matter for the UK Government. The Government will only recommend UK membership of EMU if it is in the national economic interest.

  <p>Other Government Departments were involved in aspects of the preliminary and technical work (encompassed in the EMU studies). But the assessment itself is a Treasury assessment produced for the Government, and the work was undertaken by the Treasury.</p>

  <p>Since its creation 17 months ago, Scottish Water has made steady progress in merging systems and operations inherited from the former three water authorities and I am satisfied with its administration. There is, however, no room for complacency and rates of progress on overall levels of customer service, operating efficiency, and investment and asset management will be assessed annually by the Water Industry Commissioner.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is closely monitoring the implications of a 23 May 2003 decision of the High Court (in England) on the applicability to waste water treatment works of the nuisance provisions of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.</p>

  <p>In the event of the water company being granted leave to appeal against this decision, and the House of Lords then upholding its appeal, the Scottish Executive would then consider whether to consult on legislative change.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive also intends to consult on a voluntary Code of Practice that will provide advice and guidance to local authorities, the water industry and the public regarding the successful resolution of odour and other nuisance problems from waste water treatment works. The draft voluntary Code of Practice is due to be finalised and issued for public consultation towards the end of the year.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer given to question S2W-2092 today, I understand that Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) is currently in discussion with scientific representatives of Uist Hedgehog Rescue (UHR) and other welfare interest groups to discuss the design and implementation of a trial translocation in spring 2004. This would include methods of marking and monitoring which are required for robust statistical analysis of the data. It is likely that this would use electronic tags, as these are a suitable and reliable method of tracking a mobile species. All guidance given by Scottish Natural Heritage on the marking of relocated animals pertains to those included in the trial as SNH does not condone the relocation of animals without suitable monitoring in place to assess the fate of released animals.</p>

  <p>I understand from Scottish Natural Heritage that electronic tagging equipment comprises two component parts: the electronic tag and the receiver necessary to detect the signal. Various systems are available, however, the proposal submitted by Uist Hedgehog Rescue (UHR) in February 2003 included costs of &#163;150 per hedgehog for electronic tags suitable for this species and &#163;1,500 for a receiver and antenna.</p>
