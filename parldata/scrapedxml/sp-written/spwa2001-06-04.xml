  <p>Consultation responses showed support for the proposal to set up an index of adults unsuitable to work with children. I have published today a policy position paper, which confirms our intention to proceed with legislation to create the index, and responds to comments received during consultation. Copies of this paper, <i>Protecting Children: the next steps towards securing their safety</i> , have been placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>Following this final round of consultation, I hope to introduce necessary legislation at an early opportunity if the parliamentary timetable permits.</p>

  <p>Up to and including 22 May 2001, a total of 21,125 invoices have been issued to insurance companies in respect of treatment provided at NHS hospital in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The centralised cost recovery arrangements have not in fact simply replaced the Emergency Treatment Fee (ETF) arrangements. They replaced the previous arrangements by which individual Trusts could seek to recover all or part of the costs where an accident victim goes on to make a successful claim in respect of personal injury. Whilst, under the centralised arrangements, Trusts may not charge ETFs it is still open to general medical practitioners to do so.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive provides guidance to the Scottish Further Education Funding Council (SFEFC) on the strategic priorities for the further education sector, including support for students with special educational needs. Specific guidance was recently issued on the focus of the &pound;4.5 million provided to take forward the inclusiveness agenda for students with additional support needs in the further education sector, as set out in the recommendations of the Beattie Committee.</p>

  <p>Under the funding methodology for colleges used by SFEFC, colleges receive additional funding in respect of students who either require to attend a special programme or who require additional support to undertake a mainstream course.</p>

  <p>SOED Circular (FE) 1/94 describes the circumstances in which a college may claim additional funding for students with special educational needs. It also sets out what a college is expected to provide for that student. In particular, that a Personal Learning Support Plan (PLSP) must exist for each student and be available for audit. The PLSP provides an assessment of a student&#8217;s needs and attainments, together with an educational programme and record of support measures.</p>

  <p>Colleges can also look to the four ACCESS Centres in Scotland, based at Aberdeen, Motherwell and Stevenson Colleges, and the University of Dundee, for training, guidance and information, as well as support for students with a physical or sensory disability or learning difficulty.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive holds regular meetings with the Scottish Further Education Funding Council, to monitor its performance in taking forward Executive priorities, as set out in Ministerial Guidance. This includes the support colleges give to students with special educational needs.</p>

  <p>Further education colleges are required to submit student activity data to the Scottish Further Education Funding Council (SFEFC) each year. This will include information about students with special educational needs for whom a college is claiming additional funding. The council will check returns and visit a number of colleges each year, including to check the existence and nature of Personal Learning Support Plans for students with a physical or sensory disability or learning difficulty.</p>

  <p>SFEFC is shortly to publish its revised Quality Framework, which will apply to colleges in academic year 2001-02. The framework includes quality indicators relating to facilities that colleges have in place to support access (including access for people with disabilities) and arrangements for students with learning difficulties and disabilities (which covers a range of issues from identification of needs to staff development and individualised curricula).</p>

  <p>Through the Further and Higher Education (Scotland) Act 1992, further education colleges are required to have regard to the requirements of persons over school age with learning difficulties. Scottish Ministers provide guidance to the Scottish Further Education Funding Council (SFEFC) on the priorities for the further education sector, including issues related to disadvantaged groups. The Scottish Executive has recently issued guidance on the focus of the &pound;4.5 million provided to take forward the inclusiveness agenda for students with additional support needs in the further education sector, as set out in the Beattie Committee recommendations. The use of the funding provided to SFEFC to address these priorities is monitored through regular meetings with the Executive.</p>

  <p>Although neither the Scottish Executive nor the Scottish Further Education Funding Council (SFEFC) currently set targets for further education colleges for any category of student, including those with special educational needs, SFEFC plans to review how it can effectively and relevantly measure progress towards social inclusion. This will enable it to consider appropriate future targets for widening participation.</p>
