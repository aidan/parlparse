  <p>Since 2008 the Scottish Government has received four parliamentary questions and twenty-two letters about neonicotinoid pesticides on crops. In general, this correspondence expressed concerns over the use of neonicotinoid pesticides, and the potential impact on wildlife.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government takes issues related to bee populations very seriously and monitors developments in relation to pesticides and insects carefully.</p>

  <p>To develop an understanding of these issues the Scottish Government has contributed to a &pound;1.8 million study led by the University of Dundee on &quot;An investigation into the synergistic impact of sublethal exposure to industrial chemicals on the learning capacity and performance of bees&quot;, which is part of the UK wide &pound;10 million Insect Pollinators Initiative.</p>

  <p>Bans imposed on the use of neonicotinoid pesticides in other member states can result from a number of different reasons, for example Germany and Slovenia have had labelling issues, whereas Italy and France have imposed bans as a precautionary measure. It is too early to assess the impact of such bans on bee populations.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-39257 on 24 February 2011. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament's website, the search facility for which can be found at:</p>

  <p><a href="../../../Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx</a>.</p>

  <p>Regulations regarding active substances in pesticides are initially evaluated at European Community level and then, if the substance meets safety requirements, may be authorised at member state level. The UK has stringent procedures in place before a pesticide can be sold or used (which include assessments of the toxicity of each product and the ways in which spray operators, the public or environment, in particular honey bees, may be exposed to it and, checks to ensure the risks that can arise from use of the product is not unacceptable).</p>

  <p>The Better Together Programme, Scotland&rsquo;s national patient experience programme, will be reviewing the first national datasets produced through the two national patient experience surveys undertaken in 2009-10 to establish if there are reported differences in the experiences of those people living with long term conditions including cancer.

  <p>This information is not held centrally however Table 1 shows the estimated numbers of patients attending consultations at Scottish GP practices for prostate cancer related conditions during the financial years 2003-04 to 2008-09.</p>

  <p>Patients with prostate cancer will be diagnosed and receive treatment in healthcare settings other than GP practices, and may never consult their GP practice for prostate cancer. They may also consult their GP practice for non-prostate cancer related conditions.</p>

  <p>These estimates are based on data from a small sample of general practices in Scotland that participate in the Practice Team Information (PTI) scheme. The patients registered to PTI practices are representative of Scotland as a whole in terms of their age, gender and deprivation profile. However, precise estimates are difficult to generate for small age groups and/or for conditions where patients consult relatively rarely. Confidence intervals are shown to indicate the degree of precision of these estimates.</p>

  <p>In 2010 the Scottish Government circulated the prostate cancer risk management programme pack to all general practitioners across NHS Scotland. Full details of this programme can be found at:</p>

  <p>The PSA testing information leaflet, which is included in the prostate cancer risk management programme pack, is available to members of the public from their GP and can also be accessed via the Scottish Government website.</p>

  <p>Men who are concerned about prostate cancer can ask their GP for a PSA test. If they do so, they should be provided with full information explaining the risks and benefits, allowing them to make an informed choice about proceeding with the test. The prostate cancer risk management programme pack provides all the relevant information in one concise resource.</p>

  <p>The UK National Screening Committee (UK NSC) sets out the criteria to assess screening programmes; the introduction of proposed new population screening programmes; the modification and withdrawal of existing programmes; and the quality and management of such programmes. At present the UK NSC recommends that a national programme for prostate cancer, with the currently available testing techniques, would not be of proven benefit and could cause harm. This policy was last reviewed in December 2010 and no significant changes were made. It is due to be considered again in 2013-14 and the UK NSC will continue to actively review the research findings as they become available on screening for prostate cancer. The Chief Scientist Office (CSO) within the Scottish Government Health Directorates has responsibility for encouraging and supporting research into health and health care needs in Scotland. CSO is currently funding one research project into prostate cancer, at a cost of &pound;364,000. This project is based at the University of Aberdeen, titled Deregulation of androgen receptor signalling in prostate cancer and will contribute to the development of UK NSC policy.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has offered local authorities a financial package of over &pound;11.5 billion which, if accepted, represents a reduction in funding of just 2.6%, a significantly lesser reduction than is being experienced across the Scottish Government as a whole or by local authorities south of the border.</p>

  <p>Managing current budgetary pressures is requiring very difficult decisions to be made, both nationally and locally. Local authorities are usually better placed than the Scottish Government to judge and take expenditure decisions on local services and facilities, including those for children, according to local views and priorities.</p>

The &pound;410,000 provided to Highland Council to assist with the running costs of the National Centre for Excellence in Traditional Music was a figure that emerged from a 2005 revision of all the centres&rsquo; funding and was based largely on the number of residential and non-residential pupils at that time.</p>

  <p>Under the terms of the Concordat it was agreed by Scottish Ministers and the COSLA Presidential Team that, as part of the funding package for 2008-11, the Scottish Government would substantially reduce the number of separate funding streams, thereby allowing local authorities much more freedom in how they allocate their total resources. The funding for national centres of excellence in education was one of the many ring-fenced funding streams rolled up with effect from 1 April 2008. Although the funding for centres of excellence is no longer separately identifiable, the provision is still recognised in the needs based distribution formula.</p>

  <p>The previously ring-fenced funding for national centres of excellence was rolled-up into the local government finance settlement with effect from 1 April 2008. Although the provision for national centres of excellence is still recognised in the needs-based distribution formula there is no separately identifiable funding. If a local authority were to withdraw this service, this could impact on the future funding allocations for that local authority. The Scottish Government&rsquo;s view is that it would not be appropriate for a local authority to benefit at the expense of other local authorities, within the distribution formula, in relation to a facility or service that it no longer provides.</p>

  <p>At the beginning of last year the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) provided guidance which was incorporated into the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Generic Scoping Guidance for Biomass Plants. The guidance sets out what developers need to consider in assessing the environmental impacts of a biomass development.</p>

  <p>In addition, SEPA is a statutory consultee for all applications for consent under Section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 and has therefore also responded to consultations on recent biomass applications.</p>

  <p>The Low Carbon Economic Strategy highlights the massive potential that renewable, environmental and emerging low carbon sectors have in Scotland. In considering the evidence base underpinning the Strategy we estimate that employment in the Low Carbon Environmental Goods and Services sector could support an additional 22,000 additional jobs by 2014-15. This would increase employment in the sector to 95,000 by 2014-15 from its 2008-09 base of 73,000.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Breast Screening Service works closely with GP practices and local NHS boards in advance of screening in their area. All NHS boards undertake local awareness raising in the areas where mobile vans are timetabled to visit. This often includes meetings with staff at GP practices to encourage attendance. Information packs, including posters, are provided to NHS boards and GP practices and they are encouraged to display these to improve informed uptake locally. Posters are also displayed in local supermarkets and the service is made as accessible as possible by stationing mobile screening vans in convenient local locations particularly targeting deprived areas. Other activities that have been supported nationally to improve uptake have included distribution of a DVD targeted for women with learning difficulties. The DVD was designed for use by health professionals or carers with women.</p>

  <p>: A survey of sodium intake was conducted in Scotland in 2006 to measure progress towards the Scottish Dietary Targets. The mean estimated salt intake was found to be 9.1g per day (10.6 and 7.6 g per day for men and women respectively).</p>

  <p>A UK survey in 2008 showed a reduction in the UK&rsquo;s average daily salt consumption to 8.6g. In 2009, a second survey was commissioned to measure any change from 2006 in Scotland. The 2009 sodium survey is ongoing. The report of this survey was submitted for peer review in December 2010 it is expected that the report will be published later in 2011.</p>

  <p>There are two sets of salt targets, population targets and industry targets. The agreed <strong> </strong> population target is to reduce sodium intake of the Scottish population to 100mmol per day or 6g salt/day.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Dietary Targets were first set out in <em>Eating for Health: Diet Action Plan for Scotland</em> and have since been reiterated in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s publications <em>Healthy Eating, Active Living</em> (2008), <em>Recipe for Success National Food and Drink Policy</em> (2009) and <em>Preventing Overweight and Obesity in Scotland a Route Map Towards Healthy Weight</em> (2010).</p>

  <p>In 2006 the Food Standards Agency introduced voluntary salt reductions for industry across 80 categories of food, for achievement by 2010. Through a review in 2008 it was found that a number of retailers had already met these targets. Therefore, some of the 2008 targets were revised and a further version to create more challenging targets were set for achievement by 2012. You can find out more about the targets at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.food.gov.uk/scotland/scotnut/salt/saltreduction" target="_blank">http://www.food.gov.uk/scotland/scotnut/salt/saltreduction</a>.</p>

  <p>These industry targets remain in place in Scotland. The population-based Scottish dietary targets are currently monitored by the FSA urinary sodium survey.</p>

  <p>Homoeopathy in the NHS is used only by registered health care professionals, integrated within their wider practice. It is reported as useful, both in specialist secondary care and in the 50% or so of general practices in Scotland which prescribe homoeopathy (with the use in those under 16 years doubling between 2000 to 2003).</p>

  <p>There may be debate about the scientific mechanism underpinning the results obtained, with respect to the relative contribution of the holistic consultation process, the action of the homoeopathic remedy, and placebo effects, but the results are clear, with research showing high levels of safety, patient satisfaction, consultation quality, patient enablement, and useful outcomes.</p>

  <p>In 2008, the Scottish Government introduced the National Performance Framework. This new context paved the way for the review of HEAT targets, and allowed HEAT targets and local delivery plans to be better positioned to support the achievement of the Government&rsquo;s purpose and national outcomes by optimizing the contribution of health-related activities. This development resulted in the refinement of a number of HEAT targets. For example, in 2008-09, HEAT contained a target to reduce mortality from coronary heart disease among the under 75s in deprived areas. This is in fact a long-term outcome achievable through the contributions and actions of a range of public services, private companies and individual behaviours. For 2009-10, the HEAT target was changed to a specific one that NHSScotland could be held to account for, that is to achieve an agreed number of inequalities targeted cardiovascular health checks during 2009-10. This HEAT target supports the range of actions carried out by other community planning partners in pursuit on the longer term outcome. In addition, NHS boards are active partners in community planning partnerships, and deliver a range of services to support delivery of single outcome agreements, over and above the HEAT targets.</p>

  <p>HEAT targets are agreed with a wide range of stakeholders, and set out the areas where accelerated improvement is required.</p>

  <p>NHS Boards aim to deliver the HEAT targets through sustainable improvement. Following delivery of HEAT targets, the expectation is that NHS boards will continue to deliver the improved performance and the target becomes a standard. For 2011-12, the local delivery plan guidance (see <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/NHS-Scotland/17273/LDPGuidancePDF201112" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/NHS-Scotland/17273/LDPGuidancePDF201112</a>.) sets out eight national standards.</p>

  <p>Provide 48 hour access or advance booking to an appropriate member of the GP Practice Team.</p>

  <p>To respond to 75% of Category A calls within eight minutes from April 2009 onwards across mainland Scotland (Scottish Ambulance Service).</p>

  <p>98% of patients will wait less than four hours from arrival to admission, discharge or transfer for accident and emergency treatment.</p>

  <p>No patient will wait longer than 12 weeks from referral (all sources) to a first outpatient appointment (measured on month end Census).</p>

  <p>No patient will wait longer than nine weeks for inpatient and day case treatment (measured on month end Census).</p>

  <p>No people will wait more than six weeks to be discharged from hospital into a more appropriate care setting.</p>

  <p>Maintain the number of people with a diagnosis of dementia on the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) dementia register and other equivalent sources.</p>

  <p>NHS boards to achieve a sickness absence rate of 4% from 31 March 2009.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will monitor these standards, and discuss performance at NHS boards&rsquo; annual reviews. The HEAT targets which have been delivered by NHS boards, over and above the eight national standards, are standards which are monitored locally by NHS boards.</p>

  <p><strong>Frank Mulholland: </strong>Guidance is not issued directly by the Scottish Government, since these are operational matters for the police, other reporting agencies who prepare witness statements and prosecutors.</p>

  <p>Detailed guidance for police officers entitled <em>Disclosure in Criminal Proceedings &ndash; Manual of Guidance</em> has been prepared by the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland (ACPOS) in consultation with the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service. This material is publicly available and can be found at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.acpos.police.uk/Documents/Policies/CJ_ACPOSDisclosure_in_CriminalProceedingsManual_of_GuidanceV2NPM.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.acpos.police.uk/Documents/Policies/CJ_ACPOSDisclosure_in_CriminalProceedingsManual_of_GuidanceV2NPM.pdf</a></p>

  <p>Chapter nine of the guidance deals specifically with witness statements. It is clear in stating the importance of obtaining statements from all witnesses and the requirement to accurately record, retain and review this information before revealing it to the Crown. A training package devised by ACPOS which emphasises the importance of accurate statement taking by police officers has now been delivered to all police officers in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010 will place current disclosure practices on a statutory footing. Section 164 of the Act will require the Lord Advocate to issue a code of practice in relation to that part of the act. This is currently under development and will be laid before the Parliament. The code will include guidance on the taking of statements. The police, prosecutors and other reporting agencies that engage in the investigation of crime and sudden deaths and submit reports to Procurators Fiscal, must have regard to the code of practice in undertaking their functions.</p>

  <p><strong>Frank Mulholland: </strong>The requirements for the preparation of witness statements are set down in detailed operational guidance prepared by the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland in consultation with the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS). This requires that witness statements obtained by the police should be accurate, contain detail of all matters of significance to the case and as far as possible should reflect the words of the witness. This guidance is clear that all statements should be checked for accuracy by the originating officer before being submitted electronically to COPFS. Where a police officer is submitting a statement relating to their own involvement then this must be prepared and confirmed as being accurate by that officer.</p>

  <p>Further information about this operational guidance is provided in the answer to question S3W-39285 on 24 February 2011. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at:</p>

  <p>The vast majority of monies recovered under proceeds of crime legislation is being invested in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Cashback for Communities scheme, which make a real difference to the lives of young people in our communities across Scotland.</p>

  <p>Where a case can be made that it will increase receipts, we are prepared to reinvest some of the proceeds in enhancing the efforts of the agencies directly involved in recovering those assets and criminal profits. That is why the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service has been given &pound;400,000 per annum for the last two years to recruit and retain specialist staff.</p>

  <p>After discussion with ACPOS we have also provided &pound;500,000 to allow three police forces to recruit financial investigators. This funding was matched by the three police forces and has resulted in an additional 19 financial investigators being recruited. This pilot will be evaluated later this year before a decision is taken on whether to roll out or extend the arrangement to other police forces.</p>

  <p>The funding for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service was highlighted to the Parliament during the Cashback for Communities debate on 28 May 2009 and the funding allocation for the police was highlighted during the serious organised crime debate on 11 March 2010.</p>

  <p>2007-08: 28</p>

  <p>2008-09: 34</p>

  <p>2009-10: 35</p>

  <p>The latest figures from the Mental Welfare Commission show that the number of young people under the age of 16 who were admitted to adult mental health beds is similar to that of the previous year. However the number of young males admitted has increased whilst the number of females has decreased. This may be due to young males requiring urgent admission for other mental health problems with young women more likely being admitted on an arranged basis, often for eating disorders.</p>

  <p>With regard to the number who were deemed to be admitted inappropriately this information is not available.</p>

  <p>The budget for health will increase by &pound;190.5 million compared to 2010-11. The 2010-11 position has been restated to reflect transfers in respect of the removal of the cost of capital (following revised HM Treasury guidance), transfer of funding in respect of Adult Support and Protection Act to local government and other corporate transfers.</p>

  <p>Figures in the 2010-11 Draft Budget and the 2011-12 Draft Budget are not directly comparable due to the reasons stated above and therefore a more valid comparison is to use the prior year figure included in the current budget.</p>

  <p>NHS boards have an important role to play in reducing inequality and poverty in areas of multiple deprivation. Health and Wellbeing ministers have made it clear that boards and community health partnerships should contribute to the Scottish Government&rsquo;s overall purpose and to a range of national and local outcomes, including those aimed at reducing inequality and poverty. As part of the local delivery plans and NHS accountability process, boards are now required to demonstrate activity that supports the agreed priorities set out in the three linked social policy frameworks on early years, health inequality and tackling poverty, as well as economic recovery from recession. Where appropriate, this will include activity targeted in areas of multiple deprivation, such as the Keep Well programme of inequalities-targeted health checks. To date, more than 90,000 people from Scotland&rsquo;s most deprived communities have received a Keep Well health check. The health checks cover both clinical risk factors and wider life circumstances, with patients receiving appropriate follow-up treatment and advice. We have announced plans to mainstream the Keep Well programme from April 2012.</p>

  <p>Prescription pre-payment certificates (PPC) have been available as both 12-month certificates and four-month certificates. The following table shows savings per PPC, since we started reducing prices from 1 April 2008. As indicated in the table, a patient who has always bought 12-month PPCs will have saved a total of more than &pound;180 since the policy of phasing out prescription charges was introduced on that date.</p>

  <p>People have been able to buy up to three four-month certificates in any one year, but data is not available showing how many individuals bought PPCs each year. Additionally, data is not held which shows which individuals bought a 12-month PPC one year and not the next, and therefore their related savings are not known.</p>

  <p>Figures showing total sales by NHS board are provided to the member in the answer to question S3W-39338 on 24 February 2011. Overall sales of PPCs have increased by more than 100,000 since 2007-08, up by around 160%.

  <p>To support the HPV vaccination programme a major awareness raising campaign was funded by the Scottish Government. This campaign has run since the launch of the vaccination programme in 2008. A range of information materials have been produced and made available to girls and parents about the vaccination.</p>

  <p>All girls eligible for the HPV vaccine are provided with an information leaflet, either by their school prior to vaccination or from their NHS board if they have left school. Information leaflets are also available for health care professionals and parents and carers of girls eligible for vaccination.</p>

  <p>A website, <a href="http://www.fightcervicalcancer.org.uk" target="_blank">www.fightcervicalcancer.org.uk</a>, has been specifically created to support the vaccination programme. The website contains a range of information materials in addition to electronic versions of the leaflets that have been produced. A free NHS helpline number which girls can call for impartial advice and information is also available.</p>

  <p>In addition to this national activity many NHS boards will themselves undertake local awareness raising activity to promote the benefits of the vaccine.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what discussions it has had with the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation; when these discussions took place, and whether it plans to continue the provision of the influenza A (H1N1) vaccination to young children.</p>

  <p>The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) meets regularly to discuss vaccine related issues. Officials from the Scottish Government and from Health Protection Scotland attend these meetings.All children aged six months to five years old were offered vaccination against influenza A (H1N1) during the H1N1 pandemic in 2009-10 on the basis of what was known about the virus at the time. However there is no longer a pandemic of influenza and for 2010-11 we have returned to the routine seasonal flu arrangements. The JCVI considered whether flu vaccination should be offered to healthy children aged either zero to four years and five to 15 years of age at their meeting on 30 December 2010. It considered that, although there was a high incidence of influenza-like illness in those age groups, a significant proportion was due to other viruses such as Respiratory Syncytial Virus. In addition, only a very small proportion of those with severe disease at the time were children. Most healthy children who catch flu will recover within a week and will not experience any adverse effects.In conclusion, the JCVI recommended that only adults and children (aged from six months) who have clinical risk factors which place them at particular risk from seasonal flu, should have vaccination against flu this year. The Scottish Government, and all the UK administrations, followed this recommendation and has not offered seasonal flu vaccination to healthy children this year. This is in line with practice in previous years where healthy children have not been recommended for seasonal flu vaccination.</p>

  <p>The JCVI continues to keep recommendations under review and we will consider carefully any recommendations it makes.</p>
