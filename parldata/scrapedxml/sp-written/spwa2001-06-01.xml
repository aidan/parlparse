  <p>An environmental impact assessment was carried out by Aspinwall and Company in support of a planning application by British Steel PLC in November 1994 for the proposed development of a secure containment facility at Ravenscraig. The resulting Environmental Statement is available from North Lanarkshire Council, or from the Scottish Executive Library.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency carried out an assessment of the impact of a proposed discharge from a groundwater treatment plant at the site on the receiving watercourse.

  <p>Regulating Orders are made under the Sea Fisheries (Shellfish) Act 1967, which places the responsibility for enforcing the Order with the grantee. The local management of shellfisheries under a Regulating Order is an initiative which is designed to improve stocks for the benefit of those fishermen and communities with an interest in the regulated fishery. With such benefits come responsibilities, of which enforcement is one. The Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency&#8217;s remit in regard to inshore fisheries covers European, UK and Scottish legislation, for example, controls under the Inshore Fishing (Scotland) Act 1984.</p>

  <p>The adequacy of the enforcement of a Regulating Order is a responsibility of the Regulating Order management organisation. The Shetland Shellfish Management Organisation (SSMO) in their agreed Management Plan saw community enforcement as licensed shellfishermen, local processors and the community in general reporting any transgressors of the Order, aiding the SSMO&#8217;s submission of a report to the Procurator Fiscal and subsequently testifying in court. On the issue of dealing with suspected offences, the SFPA have offered to provide the SSMO with detailed advice and training. This offer has yet to be taken up.</p>

  <p>Those applying for Regulating Orders in Orkney, the Western Isles, the Highlands and the Solway Firth are aware of the enforcement responsibilities that come with an Order. In Orkney, enforcement through utilising shellfishermen and processors is envisaged alongside employment of a part-time inspector of creels and catches. Initial proposals for enforcement of any Highland Regulating Order envisages responsibility for policing carried out on an alternating basis by vessels whilst at sea and the possibility of employment of dedicated fishery officers. The draft Management Plan for the proposed Solway Firth Order states that enforcement will be by spot checks on hand gatherers and vessels and through inspections at designated landing points. Use of a vessel monitoring system where equipment fitted on the vessel will enable identification of its location is also envisaged. Proposals for a Western Isles Regulating Order are as yet at an early stage.</p>

  <p>No final decisions have yet been taken, following the consultation exercise by the Fisheries Departments in the UK, on shellfish licensing.</p>

  <p>If it is decided to introduce a scheme operated by the Fisheries Departments, enforcement of the scheme arrangements would fall to the departments and would generally be undertaken by the relevant Sea Fisheries Inspectorates. In Scotland, that would be the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency. Responsibility for enforcing any local scheme arrangements which were also introduced would rest with the relevant local interests.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the December 2000 UK consultation document on shellfish licensing includes provisions for it to operate a licensing scheme and what is meant by &quot;locally managed&quot; in relation to the policing of such a scheme.</p>

  <p>Consultation was undertaken on the basis of proposals that there would be, initially, a national shellfish licensing scheme run by the Fisheries Departments and that, subject to the necessary legal powers being secured, this could be supplemented by local management measures.</p>

  <p>The consultation paper suggests that local management might be through the Sea Fisheries Committees for England and Wales, or other bodies. Policing arrangements would depend on the nature of, and statutory basis for, local conditions related to shellfish licensing. In Scotland, where Sea Fisheries Committees do not operate, these might follow the model for Regulating Orders, in relation to which existing statute places responsibility for enforcement with the local body to which regulating powers are granted. Any further legislative proposals by the Fisheries Departments would however be subject to consultation with industry and other interests in the normal way.</p>

  <p>Scottish local authorities are not required to publish a &quot;Best Value&quot; plan (unlike in England and Wales). However, under the voluntary approach adopted to Best Value to date in Scotland, all local authorities are expected to undertake a rolling programme of Best Value reviews of all their services and to publicise the results of these reviews locally. From April 2000 they were also expected to, and have developed their own Public Performance Reporting frameworks which make information about performance available to those who are recognised stakeholders in local authority activities.</p>

  <p>This is an operational matter for the East of Scotland Water Authority and I have asked Dr Jon Hargreaves, Chief Executive of ESWA to reply. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>East of Scotland Water has no plans to enter into lease arrangements in connection with the Carron Valley reservoir or to enter into any new arrangements for the management of that reservoir and its associated distribution system.</p>
