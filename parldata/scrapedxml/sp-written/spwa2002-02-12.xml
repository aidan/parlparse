  <p>The care of people with asthma is primarily a matter for NHS boards, and there are no immediate plans for further guidance. However, the Executive endorses the recommendations of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network on self-management for people with asthma and is funding the Scottish Asthma Management Initiative, one aim of which is to help general practitioners to identify suitable patients and devise self-management regimes.</p>

  <p>The Executive also provides grant funding to the National Asthma Campaign Scotland, which works to support people with asthma and encourage them to take control of the condition.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what information it has received from the National Translational Cancer Research Network (NTRAC) about any plans to extend NTRAC in order to include centres of scientific and clinical excellence based in Scotland and, if NTRAC has no such plans, what plans it has to assist patients in accessing experimental treatments and, in particular, experimental chemotherapy.</p>

  <p>The NTRAC is funded by the Department of Health in England, whose support will not extend to Scotland. However, Scotland already has established centres in translational research such as the Dundee CRC Cell Transformation Group, Glasgow CRC Beatson Laboratories and ICRF Edinburgh Medical Oncology Unit.</p>

  <p>All of the five Scottish Cancer Centres are actively involved in UK-wide cancer clinical trials, including those for chemotherapy. Additionally, the Scottish Cancer Therapy Network works to improve access to experimental treatments and recruitment to clinical trials.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of the &#163;15 million Department of Health funding for the National Translational Cancer Research Network (NTRAC), whether any funding is being made available to help patients in Scotland access experimental treatments and, in particular, experimental chemotherapy, given that the eight NTRAC research centres of excellence are all in England.</p>

  <p>NTRAC is an English initiative designed to support translational research into the prevention, diagnosis and/or treatment of cancer. NTRAC will receive &#163;15 million over five years and will set up eight centres of excellence in England. Most of the clinical trial work that is undertaken as translational research involves small numbers of patients and is designed to address issues of drug dosing regimens and safety, rather than effectiveness of treatment.</p>

  <p>The main means through which the Scottish Executive supports the improvement of access to experimental treatments and recruitment to clinical trials is through the Scottish Cancer Therapy Network (SCTN). The Chief Scientist Office and the Clinical Resource and Audit Group provide more than &#163;300,000 per year to this network. SCTN works in conjunction with the English National Cancer Research Networks under the strategic direction of the National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI). The Chief Scientist Office also contributes to the costs of the NCRI.</p>

  <p>We have been considering carefully the extent to which Scottish firms are able to access venture capital investment in the current market. It seems clear that some firms continue to face difficulties in accessing small-scale, early-stage equity, and I am announcing today our intention to set up a new venture capital fund of funds to address this equity gap. To establish this, over the next three years a total of &#163;20 million will be made available from my department&#146;s Regional Selective Assistance budget. The fund of funds will support a number of new private sector equity funds in Scotland making small-scale investments - mainly up to &#163;250,000 (but up to &#163;500,000 where justified).</p>

  <p>The prison population projections, which were prepared in September 2001, are based on projecting the numbers of receptions based on trends observed over the past 10 to 18 years. These are then converted to population projections by allowing for the time spent in custody. The projections therefore assume that the trends in sentencing behaviour observed in the past will continue. Two variants for future numbers have also been prepared, based on alternative extrapolations of past trends; these are given in the following table. The prison population projections do not extend beyond 2010-11.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS), to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The restructuring of prisoner escort arrangements will mean that the SPS will, over time, need about 200 fewer prison officer posts, but all our staff have been given a firm undertaking that that there will be no compulsory redundancies: any surplus staff will be suitably re-deployed.</p>

The maps are based upon an Ordnance Survey 1:10,000 digital backdrop, rescaled to 1:25,000 and provide the detailed information which farmers will need to see whether individual fields fall within the proposed nitrate vulnerable zones.

  <p>EU Council Directive 91/676/EEC (the Nitrates Directive) requires that member states shall designate as vulnerable zones all known areas of land which drain into waters affected by pollution and which could be affected by pollution (identified in accordance with criteria set out in Annex I of the directive) and which contribute to pollution.</p>

  <p>The proposed new groundwater nitrate vulnerable zones described in the consultation paper <i>Protection of Scotland's Water Environment</i> have been identified by the Scottish Executive on the basis of the criteria set out at Annex IA(2) of the directive, i.e. that the groundwaters of the proposed zones contain more than 50mg/litre nitrates or could contain more than 50 mg/litre nitrates if action programme management measures are not taken. The proposals are based on analysis of water, quality data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency&#146;s monitoring network and other sources and supporting research commissioned from the Macaulay Land Use Research Institute and the British Geological Survey.</p>

  <p>In determining this notified planning application, the Scottish Executive was made aware of certain pollution issues associated with other activities on the Spurryhillock industrial estate. However, we are satisfied that the operation of the new waste transfer facility will be strictly controlled in accordance with a waste management licence issued by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency.</p>
