  <p>We are currently developing regulations under section 39(2) of the Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005 which will outline the procedures for applying to the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator for a reorganisation. Charities will be able to reorganise in a more straightforward, swifter and cost-effective manner than was possible under the previous regime.</p>

  <p>We will issue the draft regulations for consultation this autumn in order to bring them into force early next year. In the meantime charities may prepare the substance of any application which they wish to submit, in the knowledge that the regulations covering the procedures for application will be in place in due course.</p>

  <p>A charity with the necessary powers in its constitution can already seek the consent of OSCR to amend its constitution so far as it relates to its purposes, amalgamate with another body, wind itself up or apply to court in relation to these actions under section 16 of the act. This section is already in force and OSCR is processing consents under it.</p>

  <p>Class size data for secondary is not routinely collected as part of the annual school census exercise, but in order to estimate the number of additional Maths and English teachers required to meet our S1/S2 class size commitments a special collection was made in 2003.</p>

  <p>Information on the average class size of S1/S2 Maths and English classes is therefore only available for 2003. It is published on the Scottish Executive website and can be accessed using the following hyperlink <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2003/11/18511/28927" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2003/11/18511/28927</a>.</p>

  <p>As there are no interim targets, we have no plans to collect this information again until school census week in September 2007.</p>

  <p>As stated in my answer to question S2W-24555 on 19 April 2006, the Executive has not issued any specific guidance to local authorities in relation to their obligations under equal pay. General advice and guidance on such matters has, as you know, been published by the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC).</p>

  <p>Once the Gender Equality Duty takes effect in April 2007, there will be a statutory requirement on all public bodies, including local authorities, to ensure that the policies they develop and services they deliver meet the potentially different needs of women and men.</p>

  <p>The Executive has not so far been asked formally by COSLA to provide additional funding to help implement the Agreement although individual councils have asked for assistance from the Executive to meet their particular circumstances. The pay and conditions of local government staff are matters for local authorities who have an obligation, like other employers, to ensure that they comply with all employment legislation.</p>

  <p>However, COSLA has sought funding support from the Executive to meet other financial pressures facing councils and I have said on a number of occasions that I am prepared to look again at the funding for local government in 2007-08 and that remains the position.</p>

  <p>There is a general expectation that the substantial rises over the last two spending reviews are unlikely to be repeated. Therefore, ministers may need to make some careful choices and the outcome of this review, which was submitted to me in July, will assist with this. Later publication of this information provides ministers time to explore and think through all the implications of particular options in private.</p>

  <p>Sexual Offences Prevention Orders are intended to protect the public from the risk posed by sex offenders by placing restrictions on their behaviour. In order to manage that risk to the public it is essential that the police are able to monitor offenders. The most effective method of achieving this is for the police to undertake limited and sensitively managed disclosure of such information to relevant individuals and organisations, for example local authority parties or head teachers of local schools. This limited disclosure, assessed on a case by case basis by the police is designed to minimise the risk of driving the offender underground and is an important element in ensuring public safety.</p>

  <p>The Executive recognises that shops can play an important role in helping to sustain thriving communities in Scotland&rsquo;s remote rural areas. Successful shops that are adapted to changing patterns in people&rsquo;s lifestyle, work and travel are a mark of a flourishing area. Through the Executive&rsquo;s Closing the Opportunity Gap strategy, we are funding needed improvements to the Uig Community Shop on Lewis, run as a community co-operative. As with other projects to tackle rural exclusion, this was identified as a priority by the local community and the Community Planning Partnership. In addition, the Enterprise Networks provide support and advice to small and medium sized businesses, including shops, to help ensure their viability.</p>

  <p>In many of Scotland&rsquo;s most remote communities, local post offices support essential small shops. The Executive has recently published research (available at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2006/07/12103744/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2006/07/12103744/0</a>) that examined three case studies and found that the associated general retail element was most important in the very remote community studied. Since 2003, the UK Government has provided &pound;150 million annual funding across the UK to sustain the rural post office network and prevent all avoidable closures. The Executive regularly discusses the future of the network with the UK Government and advocates that the importance of rural shops, as well as the other social and economic benefits that can be provided by many post offices, are recognised in decisions about future arrangement.</p>

  <p>The Executive&rsquo;s Scottish Procurement Directorate (SPD) has awarded three contracts which are still in operation for call centre services; the telephone helpline service contract based in Glasgow, the smoke free compliance line based in Irvine and the contract for handling public appointments based in Glasgow.</p>

  <p>The pilot for the 24 hour Child Protection Line was completed in July, and therefore no contract is currently in place. However, a re-tendering exercise is in its early stages and the contract is anticipated to commence in April 2007.</p>

  <p>The SPD does not hold details of any other call centre contracts held by other departments in the Scottish Executive and therefore this information could only provide this information at disproportionate cost.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to estimate how many contracts may be awarded in the future.</p>

  <p>The &pound;62 million of funding that has been made available to local authorities will be distributed on the basis of 80% GAE, 18% based on the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation and 2% based on rurality. Funds have been available from the start of this school year.</p>

  <p>Teacher numbers are collected annually in the Teacher census and the results of the 2006 census will be available in due course.</p>

  <p>My officials are to hold discussions with those authorities that are major beneficiaries from the additional funds for multiple deprivation on the outcomes that are expected.</p>
