  <p>It is for NHS boards and trusts to assess and provide for local needs and to determine the staffing levels required for effective delivery of service outcomes. It would be wrong for the Executive to attempt to define staffing levels, as trusts must be able to adapt staffing arrangements to suit the changing pattern of circumstances, and be judged by outcomes rather than inputs.</p>

  <p>The number of higher specialist training posts available in Scotland is regularly adjusted to meet the projected number of new consultants needed to meet known and anticipated turnover and local service developments. In March 2001, the specialist registrar establishment for neurology was increased from 12 to 14. We will consider whether additional training posts for neurologists should be part of the targeted increase of 375 junior doctors which was announced on 2 April 2001 for the period to 2004. Targeting will take account of the review of medical workforce planning which is also currently under way.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has not funded any such research projects but smoke alarm ownership in Scotland is relatively high with 88% of dwellings having smoke alarms. However, we have recently undertaken a comprehensive advertising campaign to further raise people&#146;s awareness of the benefits of installing and maintaining smoke alarms, involving the use of TV and radio advertising, posters on buses and advertising boards at football grounds. In addition, we have undertaken a survey on the impact of the regular press supplement &quot;Fire Safety Scotland&quot; which we produce in partnership with the Scottish Fire Service. The survey confirmed the effectiveness of the supplement in targeting the most vulnerable groups. I will write to the member with more detail on the survey and also place a copy in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Health Plan, <i>Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change</i> , reinforces the requirement of NHSScotland to meet the specific needs of people with physical disability by giving a commitment to &quot;improve physical access to health services, meetings and offices, by carrying out an accessibility audit of all NHS premises&quot;. This commitment is consistent with the legal obligations which require NHS bodies to comply with the statutory requirements of section 21: Access to Goods and Services, of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA). The provisions of section 21 are being phased in over the period October 1999 to December 2004.</p>

  <p>To assist NHS Holding Bodies the Scottish Executive Health Department (SEHD) and the NHSScotland Property and Environment Forum have issued comprehensive guidance on both compliance with section 21 of the DDA and on accessibility audits. Responsibility for implementing measures to ensure compliance with these legal obligations rests with NHS Holding Bodies, e.g. NHS trusts, and to inform the process accessibility audits are currently on-going.</p>

  <p>Having issued this guidance SEHD and the NHSScotland Property and Environment Forum are considering what monitoring mechanisms need to be put in place to assess the progress of compliance. It is anticipated that appropriate monitoring arrangements will be in place in the near future.</p>

  <p>This is primarily a matter for health boards and education authorities. The good practice guidance emphasises the need for co-operation between NHS boards and education authorities to ensure that appropriate arrangements are in place. These would determine the respective responsibilities of each in relation to the administration of medicines in schools. Implementation and practical issues will, however, need to reflect local circumstances and in some cases the individual needs of pupils.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are expected to consult with <i>all</i> affected communities about any significant service change or development whether these are new or existing services, or a change in the way health services are used.</p>

  <p>Boards should agree a process that provides a clear timetable for decision making, identifies who will be consulted and when this will happen, the range of approaches that will be used, and the stages at which people who have been involved will be made aware of progress. This approach should be shared with the local health council, the local authority and other representative bodies at an early stage for advice where appropriate.</p>

  <p>It is important that service users should be involved in developing possible options or alternatives prior to proceeding with the formal consultation process. The initial stages of a consultation process should begin with open sessions to gain views on a range of options of key interest groups, for example service user groups, community groups, NHS staff and trade unions.</p>

  <p>Full public debate on the options should be supported by feedback, through the media and newsletters, of the points made at open sessions. Focus groups and surveys should be used where appropriate to ensure patient experience and the wider public perspective are fed into the process. Written comments should be encouraged with particular attention being given to eliciting comment from local councils, local councillors, MSPs and MPs and other key local individuals and organisations.</p>

  <p>In deciding whether to approve a proposal for a permanent change of use, ministers will take account of the quality and extent of the public involvement in the development of the proposal for service change.</p>

  <p>On 9 January 2002, we announced a &#163;20 million package for local authorities and NHSScotland to make a significant reduction in the number of patients experiencing delayed discharge from hospitals across Scotland. This is over and above the recurring &#163;10 million already provided to local authorities for the purpose through their Grant Aided Expenditure settlements. Additionally, an expert group, led by NHSScotland Chief Executive, Trevor Jones, has been looking in detail at delayed discharge and the reasons for it. Next month, I will announce an Action Plan based on the work of this group, and including the distribution arrangements for the new resources, to help drive down the delayed discharge figures.</p>

  <p>We have no such plans. Individuals who are assaulted in the course of their duties are already treated as the victims of an aggravated assault.

  <p>Having now considered the advice of the Government Actuary, the Scottish ministers have now made the Damages (Personal Injury)(Scotland) Order 2002, setting the discount rate at 2.5%.
