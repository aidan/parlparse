  <p>We plan to introduce secondary legislation to require those who deal in puppies and kittens to do so only under a local authority licence.

  <p>With regard to compulsory purchase and compensation, Scottish ministers may act as a confirming authority, or as promoter. The main users of compulsory purchase powers are Transport Scotland, and local authorities. Other bodies with compulsory purchase powers include utility companies (water, gas and electricity), Scottish Enterprise, Historic Scotland and railway undertakings. This would require an assessment of each order submitted over the past 10 years in Transport, Education, Planning, Housing and Historic Scotland. A breakdown of each individual order is not centrally held and would only be possible to obtain by incurring disproportionate cost.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-19849 by Kenny MacAskill on 28 January 2009, whether in consideration of Part 2 requests for extradition, as set out in the Extradition Act 2003, the same test of dual criminality must be met as for Part 1 requests.</p>

  <p>The test in relation to dual criminality is, in essence, encompassed in the definitions of &quot;extradition offence&quot; as provided for in sections 64 and 65 (in relation to category 1 territories) and sections 137 and 138 (in relation to category 2 territories) of the Extradition Act 2003. The same definitions apply with one exception. In relation to category 1 requests, an &quot;extradition request&quot; also includes an alleged offence (or conviction) which is certified by the requesting state as falling within the European framework list and attracts the necessary minimum periods of detention. In respect of those European framework list offences (which are applicable in category one cases only) there is no requirement for dual criminality.</p>

  <p>There are examples of leasing public forest land in a number of other countries, including New Zealand, Canada and Australia. Also, a National Audit Office report in 1998 on the disposal of Forestry Commission land said that leasing could help protect public access and help rationalise the forest estate.</p>

  <p>Armed forces personnel and veterans already have the same rights as civilians in relation to the eligibility to social housing in Scotland. Social landlords are required by the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 to admit anyone aged 16 or over to their housing list and in allocating their houses take no account of an applicant&rsquo;s length of residence in the area or whether they are resident in the area in a number of listed circumstances. Local connection is not a statutory criteria in relation to eligibility to social housing and guidance on the 2001 act makes clear that applicants for housing should not be debarred because they have no local connection with an area, although local connection might be a factor in determining priority.</p>

  <p>However, Scottish homelessness legislation allows local connection to be taken into account in determining which local authority has a duty towards a homeless household. A local connection is formed through residence, employment, family associations or because of special circumstances. However, currently the legislation states that a local connection is not formed through residence or employment in the armed forces.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government set out last year that it would consider amending these provisions so that employment/residence in the armed forces would be treated in the same way as civilian employment/residence for this purpose, removing any doubt as to whether service leavers can apply as homeless in the area in which they have served. A commitment was made to consult with representatives from the service community and local authorities, recognising the particular issues faced by those local authorities hosting significant numbers of service personnel in large bases. This process of consultation is underway.</p>

Between 9 February 2005 and 31 March 2008, 19 section 14 notices were issued to remove obstructions. In six of these cases appeals against the notice have been made to a sheriff court. In addition, one court case was initiated by a land owner under section 28 of the act.

  <p>Yes, the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 places emphasis on the local management of access and makes it the duty of the local access authority to uphold access rights under the provisions contained within the act. Support for access authorities and local access forums is provided in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s written guidance on the implementation of the access provisions of the act, and in the Scottish Outdoor Access Code. Local access forums can also seek advice and support from the National Access Forum.</p>

  <p>Following consideration of the responses on the recent consultation exercise on Sustainable Seas for All a Consultation on Scotland&rsquo;s first Marine Bill and related delivery arrangements, we plan to establish new integrated marine management arrangements for Scotland &ndash; under Marine Scotland as part of the core Scottish Government, as of 1 April.</p>

  <p>This will enable coherent management of the seas with integration of policy alongside delivery functions, as well as contributing to the Scottish Government&rsquo;s aim to simplify the public bodies landscape. Our proposals signal our commitment to a step change in marine management arrangements for Scotland.</p>

  <p>Marine Scotland&rsquo;s role will be, in partnership with others, to deliver our marine vision of clean, healthy, safe, productive, biologically diverse marine and coastal environments within the overall Government&rsquo;s purpose of sustainable economic growth. This will include, for example, working closely with bodies such as the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and Scottish Natural Heritage. It will manage Scotland&rsquo;s seas for prosperity and environmental sustainability both by leading and working with others and in carrying out its own functions of evidence-based policy development and marine planning, streamlined marine licensing and consenting, sound science and effective compliance monitoring and enforcement.</p>

  <p>We plan to establish a Marine Strategy Board, to be led by Marine Scotland and involving key partners with marine management interests, to deliver strategic management of Scotland&rsquo;s seas.</p>

  <p>Marine Scotland will have direct responsibility for core marine functions, which include both the existing functions of the Marine Directorate, Fisheries Research Services (Marine and Freshwater Fisheries) and Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency, and also planned new functions of marine planning, improved nature conservation measures and better integrated licensing, consents and monitoring arrangements. There is strong support for the establishment of such a body with the largest group to comment on status supporting its establishment within government. It will build on the success of the organisation involved and will enable a strategic approach to marine management.</p>

  <p>In light of the importance of the new body&rsquo;s science function we will, as part of the new governance arrangements, also be establishing a Scientific Advisory Board to assure its scientific objectivity and credibility. We will also be developing appropriate appeals mechanisms with an independent element.</p>

  <p>We believe it is important to establish Marine Scotland quickly so that it can begin the process of integrating and streamlining currently separate functions and processes and so that it will be well placed to deliver new functions and responsibilities, following agreement on new marine legislation, effectively and efficiently. Decisions now about its role, status and establishment will also remove uncertainties for the staff involved, partner organisations and stakeholders and help us to gain the benefits of better integrated, more streamlined arrangements more quickly.</p>

  <p>The duty of the Scottish Government is to provide policies, frameworks and resources to NHS boards in order that they can deliver high quality, safe and sustainable services that meet the needs of their local population. Within this context, the actual provision of local healthcare services is normally the responsibility of local health boards, taking into account national guidance, local service needs and priorities for investment.</p>

  <p>NHS Borders has advised me that it has close ties with NHS services across the border into Northumbria and Cumbria. It continues to foster strategic alliances with these partners given the two-way flow of patients, and the need to secure access to services for patients close to the border and ensure seamless care.</p>

  <p>HMP Grampian will provide around 500 prisoner places (roughly the current combined capacity of HMP Aberdeen and HMP Peterhead), supporting the demand for places within the Northern Community Justice Authority (CJA), excluding those accommodated in HMP Inverness.

  <p>I am pleased to announce that the relevant Amendment Order [the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Domestic Microgeneration) (Scotland) Amendment Order 2009] was laid before the Scottish Parliament on Friday 6 February 2009 [SSI 2009/34]. It will now be considered by the Subordinate Legislation Committee and the Local Government and Communities Committee.</p>

  <p>The Order will enable householders to install certain energy generating equipment, such as solar panels, on their houses or in their gardens without applying for planning permission. Removing the barriers of cost and time will encourage greater uptake of micro-generation equipment, which will increase renewable energy generation and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.</p>

  <p>Removing the barriers will also support the development of the micro-generation industry therefore contributing to the government&rsquo;s efforts to ensure that Scotland&rsquo;s planning system increases sustainable economic growth.</p>

  <p>The needs of this transport corridor were considered as part of the Strategic Transport Projects Review (STPR) which recommended that our aim should be to optimise the operation of the route through active traffic management and targeted individual investments. This may include plans to ensure the road is safe and suitably maintained for the expected levels of traffic and may, for instance, include realigning sections of road, individual junction improvements and creating additional overtaking opportunities where appropriate.</p>

  <p>Prior to the STPR we had delivered on our route strategy to provide a dual two lane &quot;near motorway&quot; standard of road between Edinburgh and Dunbar, and further south where traffic volumes are significantly lower, to create unambiguous guaranteed overtaking opportunities along the route. The completion of this major &pound;120 million package of improvements has resulted in two-thirds of the A1 having been upgraded by the provision of dualling and climbing lanes. We have no current plans for dualling the A1 from Dunbar to the Border.</p>

  <p>The Roads (Scotland) Act 1984 states that a roads authority shall take such steps as it considers reasonable to prevent snow and ice endangering the safe passage of pedestrians and vehicles over public roads.</p>

  <p>Each roads authority is responsible for identifying its own level of winter service and these vary between authorities. Most roads authorities publish winter maintenance plans which set out service levels. Transport Scotland, on behalf of Scottish ministers, is responsible for the winter service on trunk roads and motorways. The Operating Companies undertake the winter service according to procedures and specifications laid down in the trunk road maintenance term contracts and detailed in their winter service plans. This is monitored by the independent Performance Audit Group.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to questions S3W-19163 and S3W-19170 by Stewart Stevenson on 19 January 2009 and given that Transport Scotland has 291 employees and this figure does not include consultants, for what reasons it considers it impossible to separate out the cost of consultancy work.</p>

  <p>The suppliers who provide consultancy advice to Transport Scotland are often responsible for wider service provision as part of an overall package. This could include engineering and support services. For this reason it is not always possible to separate out the cost of the consultancy element.</p>
