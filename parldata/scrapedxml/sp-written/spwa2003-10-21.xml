  <p>The immigration office in Govan has not closed, so there was no need for the Executive to make representations or for it to be consulted. There have been some changes in the way asylum seekers can register claims affecting single adult asylum seekers, but families and people with special needs can still register claims in Glasgow.</p>

  <p>The Department for Trade and Industry has lead responsibility on all matters related to the GATS as the regulation of international trade is a reserved area. The Department of Trade and Industry consult with devolved administrations and other stakeholders at UK level for input on matters related to education policy as appropriate. The Executive supports the UK policy line that no commitments should be made under the GATS which would undermine governments&#8217; ability to fund or regulate public sector education services. The European Commission&#8217;s initial GATS offer which was submitted to the World Trade Organization on 29 April 2003 fully protects public services and proposes no new commitments in relation to education, which includes higher education, services.</p>

  <p>With regard to privately funded higher education services, the UK has already taken full commitments during the Uruguay round of GATS negotiations in 1993, with the exception of Mode 4 which relates to the temporary movement of natural persons.</p>

  <p>The Department for Trade and Industry (DTI) has lead responsibility for all matters related to GATS on behalf of the UK, as the regulation of international trade is a reserved area. Scottish Executive officials arranged an opportunity for representatives from the further and higher education sectors in Scotland to meet with DTI&#8217;s leading GATS negotiator in January this year to discuss matters related to education and the GATS. The initial EC offer issued on 29 April 2003 does not propose any new commitments for the education sectors and, as such, further meetings have not been required. DTI are in regular contact with the devolved administrations and other stakeholders on matters related to the GATS. This will continue as appropriate throughout the negotiating process.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, acting Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is:</p>

  <p>In the current year &#163;57 million will be invested in rural affordable housing through the Communities Scotland Development Programme: this represents 25% of the total budget. Ministers recently announced that the development programme for rural housing will be increased by &#163;5 million nationally in each of the next two financial years.</p>

  <p>In the Clydesdale area, the Communities Scotland Development Programme is providing funding of &#163;4.152 million in the current year, which will provide a total of 162 affordable housing units.</p>
