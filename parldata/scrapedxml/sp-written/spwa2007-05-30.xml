  <p>I have asked Dr. Paul Stollard, Chief Executive of the Scottish Building Standards Agency (SBSA), to answer. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The SBSA&rsquo;s draft corporate plan sets strategic objectives for the agency for the period 2007-10. These are:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p align="justify">Develop and promote a strategy for achieving net zero carbon buildings.</p>
<p align="justify">Complete the next stage in that strategy by a significant cut in expected carbon emissions from new buildings.</p>
<p align="justify">Further the use of micro generation and low and zero carbon technologies.</p>
<p align="justify">Complete implementation of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive.</p>
<p align="justify">Introduce better standards to prevent noise nuisance.</p>
<p align="justify">Improve means of escape from fire.</p>
<p align="justify">Increase compliance with building standards.</p>

  <p>The qualifying criteria set out under Article 3 of the National Bus Travel Concession Scheme for Older and Disabled Persons (Eligible Persons and Eligible Services) (Scotland) Order 2006 have remained in force since their introduction on 1 April 2006.

  <p>Under the local concessionary bus travel schemes formerly administered by individual local authorities and Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive (SPTE), various eligibility criteria were applied which entitled some sufferers of fibromyalgia to receive free bus travel in their local area. On introduction of the national free bus travel scheme, a standardised set of eligibility criteria was established, as set out in Article 3 of the National Bus Travel Concession Scheme for Older and Disabled Persons (Eligible Persons and Eligible Services) (Scotland) Order 2006. These national criteria, which were developed with the agreement of local authorities, SPTE, transport operators and the Mobility and Access Committee for Scotland, do not encompass those receiving the lower rate of the mobility or care component of the Disability Living Allowance, including sufferers of fibromyalgia.</p>

  <p>The Executive has a range of measures which reflect the outcomes generated by investment in the NHS.

  <p>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The Bridging the Gap (BtG) team was formed and resourced by the SPS to prepare a bid for the new prison at Bishopbriggs; governance arrangements were put in place to allow the team to operate independently of the SPS board.</p>

  <p>The BtG team made their own arrangements regarding legal and other advice. They have confirmed that they are being advised by Dundas &amp; Wilson CS and Tribal Consulting.</p>
