  <p>The databases referred to in the answer to question S3W-21194 on 3 April 2009, are maintained by IT support staff as part of their total workload of supporting all IT systems operated by the Scottish Government (not only databases) as well as users and other support functions such as hardware support and telecommunications.</p>

  <p>We do not maintain records of staff time separately for database-related work.</p>

  <p>In 2007, eight meetings of the main committee of the then Mobility and Access Committee (MACS) took place. The decision to meet more often than the statutory requirement is a matter for the Convener and Members of MACS. The committee consider that meeting four times a year is appropriate, but will keep the matter under review. In addition to the main committee meetings, members are involved in attending meetings with stakeholders, and we anticipate members working around 12 days a year.</p>

  <p>Policies on flexible and home working are an operational matter for individual organisations. They need to consider a number of issues such as business need as well as HR policy.</p>

  <p>We have taken the approach of promoting flexi and home-working as part of a wider transport policy agenda. I wrote to chief officers of all Scottish public sector organisations in June 2008, requesting a primary point of contact and progress on and plans for promoting more sustainable travel. The letter also publicised the available support and guidance, via <a href="http://www.chooseanotherway.com" target="_blank">www.chooseanotherway.com</a>, to implement more sustainable and active travel practices.</p>

  <p>Through government funding, Regional Transport Partnerships are working with local authorities and NHS boards on Travel Plans. In addition, the Energy Saving Trust provide advice on travel planning.</p>

  <p>Larger public sector employers such as health boards and local authorities, have either already produced or are developing a travel plan, which can include an assessment of the role of home and flexi working in addressing transport impacts associated with the daily commute, as well as business travel.</p>

  <p>A programme to engage with all public sector organisations is currently being developed based on responses to a questionnaire issued last year. 81% of organisations that completed the questionnaire either have or are developing a travel plan.</p>

  <p>The Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) sets the contractual and financial framework within which Network Rail operates the network, ensuring that the company carries out its activities efficiently and well. This includes monitoring and enforcement of Network Rail&rsquo;s required outputs, as defined by Scottish Ministers&rsquo; High Level Output Specification.</p>

  <p>Performance statistics are published by the ORR. They are issued quarterly, and the details of the latest information available are set out in the following table. The periods available are from year 2007-08 and 2008-09. Each recording year commences in April. The latest figures available are for Quarter 2 in 2008-09.</p>

  <p>The measure used is Public Performance Measurement (PPM) which combines punctuality and reliability of the service in comparison with the advertised timetables.</p>

  <p>Ministers met with Network Rail representatives at least every six months. In addition, Transport Scotland officials met frequently with their Network Rail counterparts to progress issues relating to the rail network in Scotland. Ministers met with Network Rail&rsquo;s Chief Executive on 2 June 2008 and 3 March 2009. Transport Scotland officials met with Network Rail officials on 10 April 2008, 18 August 2008, 11 September 2008, 10 November 2008, 3 December 2008, 25 February 2009 and 5 March 2009. These meetings consider trends in performance, and delays arising from particular problems or incidents. Network Rail responds by explaining its analysis of the causes of delay, and its plans to reduce these delays in future.</p>

  <p>There are also frequent meetings at functional levels to discuss topical issues and handling of specific incidents.</p>

  <p>Network Rail operates under a network licence and is accountable to the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) if they do not meet the conditions of its licence and the outputs specified within it. If Network Rail fails to meet their specified outputs the ORR can require Network Rail to take remedial action and may also impose monetary penalties.</p>

  <p>Network Rail is required to take into consideration the reasonable requirements of Scottish ministers as funders and specifier of the Scottish rail network.</p>
