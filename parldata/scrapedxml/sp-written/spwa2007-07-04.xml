  <p>We estimate that at least 20,000 children will get additional funded hours of free Pre-School Education following the expansion in hours to 475 hours from August 2007. Making this a universal entitlement will also put local authority services which currently provide 475 hours of pre-school on a proper financial footing.</p>

  <p>Yes. Children in Glasgow who attend partner provider settings will receive 475 hours of free pre-school education from August 2007, an increase from the current level of 412.5 hours. Glasgow City Council will receive an additional &pound;1.576 million in 2007-08 and &pound;2.364 million in 2008-09 to cover the cost of funding the additional hours for all pre-school children. It will be for the Council to decide how the additional resources should be allocated.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government values the role of the Scottish Youth Parliament in representing the views of young people in Scotland. We have already met some key members of the Scottish Youth Parliament and look forward to continuing to work with them and to hearing their views on issues of interest to young people.</p>
