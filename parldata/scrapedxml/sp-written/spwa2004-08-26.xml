  <p>No one body is responsible for disused non-coal mines, and no specific funding is earmarked for making such mines safe. Responsibility concerning possible subsidence is dependent on the particular circumstances of the mining rights or of the land ownership.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive already provides core and training grant funding for Couple Counselling Scotland and Scottish Marriage Care. Some &pound;355,000 will be made available this year for activities by them at a national level.

  <p>The Scottish Executive recognises the importance of relationship support services in helping to provide stable family settings where children can prosper. In our recent consultation on family law reform - <em>Family Matters: Improving Family Law in Scotland</em> - we sought views on how best to harness the voluntary sector contribution to securing good outcomes for families, and we are now considering the responses.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many people there are with atherosclerosis; what the most effective recognised treatment is and whether a cure exists and, if not, what research is currently being carried out into finding a cure or to develop a drug that would be capable of allowing constricted arteries to regain their elasticity.</p>

  <p>Atherosclerosis affects many people in varying degrees, and prevalence and severity increase with age. It generally remains undiagnosed until it is of a severity to cause symptoms. The severity and rate of progression will be determined by both genetic and lifestyle factors. A range of treatments is available; the most appropriate treatment is a matter for clinical judgement and will depend on the severity of the condition.</p>

  <p>The Chief Scientist Office is currently funding a study in children to determine whether changing lifestyle &ndash; such as diet, exercise or stopping smoking &ndash; can have a demonstrable benefit to reduce cardiovascular risk.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether there is a method for the treatment of existing nuclear waste other than storage and whether the current arrangements would allow it to support a planning application for the creation of any new nuclear power station.</p>

  <p>Low-level waste can be disposed of to the engineered facility at Drigg operated by British Nuclear Fuels. For higher activity radioactive waste the current policy is that it will be stored, after any necessary treatment, until a long-term waste management option is decided. All options for the future management of intermediate and high-level waste are being considered by the current UK-wide process undertaken by the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management to which the Executive is fully committed.</p>

  <p>We will not support the further development of nuclear power stations while waste management issues remain unresolved.</p>

  <p>The Executive has no current plans to dual the A737 between Howwood and Dalry, nor to construct any direct connection between the A737 and the A78 Three Towns By-pass.</p>

  <p>On 28 June, I announced a full study into the road problems at Dalry including proposals for a by-pass, using the Scottish Transport Appraisal Guidance (STAG) methodology. The study should be completed by spring next year.</p>

  <p>The covering letter which accompanied the consultation pack invited the support of organisations and employers to encourage their employees, members and customers throughout Scotland to respond to the consultation, for example by publicising the response website address or making response forms available in their premises.

  <p>In addition, I wrote personally to COSLA, leaders and chief executives of local authorities, chairs and chief executives of NHS boards, Scotland&rsquo;s Health at Work, the British Pharmaceutical Industry (Scottish office) and the Scottish Voluntary Charter Group seeking their support to encourage responses from members, staff and people who use their services.</p>
