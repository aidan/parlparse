  <p>Yes Circular 1/2007 which gave guidance on the previous administration&rsquo;s policies on P1 and S1/S2 maths and English classes is still extant. However, the commitment to reduce P1 to a maximum of 25 has been superseded by this government&rsquo;s policy of reducing P1 to P3 classes to a maximum of 18.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-09-29.S3W-16283.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80396" speakername="Nicola Sturgeon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa0929.htm#3">

  <p>I fully appreciate the views expressed about a public inquiry. As I said in Parliament on 11 September, it is right to allow the investigation by the area procurator fiscal to conclude before any further decisions are taken by ministers. I will make a further statement to Parliament at the conclusion of these investigations. I am always happy to meet with the families of the deceased to discuss what happened at the Vale of Leven hospital.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-15802 by Nicola Sturgeon on 17 September 2008, how many nurses attended the provided training on Clostridium difficile in May 2007, also expressed as a percentage of the total nursing staff.</p>

  <p>I am advised by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde that fifteen nurses from the Vale of Leven hospital attended the training on Clostridium difficile in May 2007. It is not appropriate to present this figure as a percentage of the total nursing population at the hospital as not all nurses perform duties or functions where Clostridium difficile training would be relevant to their position.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-15610 by Nicola Sturgeon on 10 September 2008 and the intention to involve patients and relatives in the review process, why the independent review team only contacted the patients and relatives affected by Clostridium difficile one week prior to the completion date for the report.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-09-29.S3W-16445.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80396" speakername="Nicola Sturgeon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa0929.htm#3">

  <p>As stated on page seven of the Independent Review Team&rsquo;s report much consideration was given on how to appropriately and sensitively contact patients and relatives and it was decided that a newspaper advert would be the most appropriate means of contact. However, this meant that the review team were required to work to the publishing timetables set by the newspapers that were approached and this meant that there were unavoidable delays in getting the adverts published. The fundamental issue is, however, that the Independent Review Team met with a number of representatives of the families affected and took account of their comments when formulating the recommendations in their report.</p>

  <p>A decision on whether to publish the written evidence considered by the Independent Review Team is currently being considered under the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2005.</p>
