  <p>Details of corporate insolvencies are compiled by financial year. A breakdown of the figures by Creditor Voluntary Liquidation, Compulsory Liquidation and Receivership is shown in the attached table. These figures refer to limited companies only as partnerships and other unincorporated business associations, which are declared bankrupt in Scotland, are registered as personal bankruptcies under Scottish law. Figures on these are not available separately from other personal bankruptcies.</p>

  <p>Details of corporate insolvencies broken down by local authority is not available.</p>

  <p>The strategic review of public space CCTV in Scotland includes a landscaping element which provides us with the figures for public space CCTV in Scotland covering a single year.</p>

  <p>This is the first time that such information has been gathered. Alongside the other areas of the review it will help identify where the effectiveness of public space CCTV in Scotland can be improved.</p>

  <p>While it is too early to indicate what our intentions might be, we will look to build upon the output of the review.</p>

  <p>Funding has been made available to all local authority Community Safety Partnerships over the period 2005-08 to identify and address local community safety priorities, which can include CCTV. Funding has also been provided under the Safe Cities and Towns initiative, details of which can be found on the Scottish Government website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk</a> .</p>

  <p>Under the concordat agreed between Scottish ministers and COSLA, funding for community safety and antisocial behaviour has been absorbed into the main local government settlement since 1 April 2008.</p>

  <p>It is the responsibility of each local authority, in conjunction with their Community Planning Partners, to allocate funding on the basis of their local needs and priorities having first fulfilled their statutory obligations and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities, including the Scottish Government&rsquo;s key strategic objectives and manifesto commitments.</p>

  <p>2. It is possible that a patient may have more than one new outpatient appointment in the course of a year and will be counted each time.</p>

  <p>3. It should be noted that, prior to 2008, some new outpatient attendances for Dundee Dental Hospital were recorded incorrectly resulting in low numbers being reported for this period. This discrepancy may explain the increase from 2008 onward.</p>

  <p>The common definition, used within police forces, is that a crime of drugging is committed when drugs are surreptitiously or dishonestly administered with the intent of incapacitating the victim.</p>

  <p>There are three further crimes/offences for which drugs may be a contributory factor &ndash; causing death by careless driving when under the influence of drink or drugs, driving a motor vehicle while unfit through drink or drugs and being in charge of motor vehicle while unfit through drink or drugs. We are not able to identify the number of such crimes/offences specifically relating to drugs and as such have not included these figures in the above table.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government wants the best, robust, most up to date and comprehensive evidence base on behaviour in schools, including serious indiscipline and violence. The 2009 <em>Behaviour in Scottish Schools</em> survey is well underway and will report back this autumn. This government, working in partnership with the Scottish Advisory Group on Behaviour in Schools (comprising all the main teaching unions, COSLA, GTCS and HMIE), has improved the survey to provide clearer data on the perception and experience of serious indiscipline and violence, as well as whether incidents were reported and how staff were supported through follow up. The sample size was also increased to improve the accuracy of the data.</p>

  <p>Once the survey has been published, we can then determine if the improvements provide sufficient information to monitor serious indiscipline and violence in schools.</p>

  <p>The proposal to ban trade in seal products across the EU is a reserved matter. There will not be a total ban on sealskins in sporrans under the proposals. Inuit products from seals, sourced using traditional methods could still be traded. Also, non-commercial seal products which are by-products of marine management could still be used. There has been widespread concern about the inhumane nature of many seal hunts and the Scottish Government supports the tightening of trade in seal products. However, it also supports measures allowing sporrans manufactured in Scotland to be made from seal skins in a traditional way.</p>

  <p>We have indication that the industry will consider alternatives, such as using bovine hides, pony skins, rabbit furs or synthetic materials for the manufacture of sporrans. Our important export markets for sporrans in the United States will not be affected, as seal skins are already banned in the US.

  <p>Under the Hepatitis C Phase 2 Action Plan, significant funding has been provided to NHS boards to improve the support services for those infected with hepatitis C. Managed Care Networks for hepatitis C have been set up in every NHS board area and all NHS boards have a local MCN Steering Group which includes representation from statutory and voluntary sector providers. The role of these steering groups is to drive the development of care pathways and associated service development, including support and care, in line with actions 1, 6 and 8 of the action plan.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Government has commissioned further support services for people with hepatitis C through a national tender open to local authorities and voluntary sector agencies.

  <p>As part of our anticipatory care approach to long-term conditions management, we recognise the benefits of taking steps to ensure strong bones throughout life. We are taking this forward through our wider work in supporting young people to make positive choices about their health and wellbeing by means of our programmes relating to smoking, alcohol, healthy eating and physical activity.</p>

  <p>The Schools (Health Promotion and Nutrition) (Scotland) Act 2007 also places a duty on education authorities to ensure that schools promote health and wellbeing. NHS boards engage in community planning with local authority education departments and children&rsquo;s services to take forward health promotion in schools, based on Scottish Government guidance. All of this work will have a positive impact on bone health.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is not aware of how many journeys were proposed by DB Schenker but Network Rail offered 12 paths, Hunterston through to Longannet and return, in their initial offer based on no overnight working.</p>

  <p>Proposals to undertake night time operations on the Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine railway line were first communicated to Transport Scotland by EWS (now known as DB Schenker) on 15 February 2008.</p>

  <p>During the parliamentary process to support re-opening the Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine railway line the Promoter, Clackmannanshire Council, submitted a memorandum to the parliamentary committee entitled the <em>Promoters Memorandum on Existing Railway Processes</em> . This document set out that the hours of operation of the railway are not within the powers to be granted under the Bill and are regulated by other public bodies under a range of different legislation.</p>

  <p>The Committees Consideration Stage Report May 2004 acknowledged these restrictions upon the Promoters by stating &quot;It is important to note that the scope of the Bill includes only the construction of a railway between Stirling and Kincardine (via Alloa) together with associated works. It is not within the scope of the Bill for it to be amended to include matters that pertain to the operation of the railway (for example the speeds of trains or the times at which they should run).&quot;</p>

  <p>Network Rail is responsible for operation of railway infrastructure under the Railways Act 1993 and is responsible for determining freight timetables in conjunction with rail freight operating companies, who in turn respond to the needs of their freight customers.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the 2,200 ton trailing weight referred to in the minutes of the meeting between DB Schenker Rail, First ScotRail, Transport Scotland and Network Rail on 22 February 2008 was the same as the weight used in the 2002 Scott Wilson impact study and what the proposed increase in the trailing weight is following the lengthening of the Elderslie loop.</p>

  <p>The weight used in the Scott Wilson Report was based on the use of 20 x HTA wagons each weighing 100 tonnes, therefore the Environmental Statement assumed a trailing weight of 2,000 tonnes.</p>

  <p>There is no proposal to increase the trailing weight of Hunterston &ndash; Longannet trains on the completion of the lengthening of Elderslie loop</p>

  <p>The objective of the Elderslie loop lengthening project is to replace Arkleston up loop, which will be incorporated into the new four track layout east of Paisley. It will increase operational flexibility and allow freight trains to be recessed clear of the main line during perturbations.</p>

  <p>It will not facilitate increases in the trailing weights of Hunterston &ndash; Longannet trains as these trains are limited to 23 x HTA wagons due to constraints on the track and signalling within the Longannet Power station site.</p>

  <p>Currently the Hunterston - Longannet trains are unable to be recessed in Elderslie loop and the timetable is constructed on that basis. Thus whilst the lengthening of Elderslie loop will allow longer, hence, heavier trains to use the loop, it will not impact on the trailing weight of the Hunterston &ndash; Longannet trains.</p>

  <p>Local authorities regularly make representations to Government regarding funding for infrastructure investment, including schools. The Government is supporting record capital funding &ndash; some &pound;2 billion over the two years 2008-10 &ndash; to improve Scotland&rsquo;s infrastructure, including schools and we are on track to lift 100,000 pupils out of crumbling schools and into modern, new classrooms during the lifetime of this Parliament.</p>

  <p>We have already indicated our intention to announce later this year the next part of our schools investment programme. That will involve working with local authorities to take forward capital investment through the Scottish Futures Trust.</p>

  <p>The aim of the Scottish Futures Trust (SFT) is to become the focal point in Scotland for action in infrastructure investment and the pursuit of value for money for the taxpayer. To achieve value for money, SFT will consider a range of funding and procurement options including the NPD model for funding projects. It is unlikely to be a direct funder of projects in the short to medium-term but will instead use its expertise, to be an arranger of funding that is cheaper overall than PFI, taking into account all factors, including risk.</p>

  <p>Initially, SFT is working to secure greater value from the funding that the public sector is already planning to invest. In due course, SFT will develop proposals setting out how investment might be channelled for Scottish infrastructure priorities &ndash; what the SFT&rsquo;s Strategic Business Case refers to as SFT Finance and Investment - with proposals due to come forward in 2009-10.</p>

  <p>SFT&rsquo;s first priority has been to take forward the workstreams identified in the Business Case. That work represents a two year programme but the major focus in the short-term is on delivery of hub pathfinders and the initial projects which will be delivered through them. The other early focus is developing with a broad range of stakeholders, a national strategy for the delivery and funding of schools. To this end SFT is a member of the joint Scottish Government/COSLA School Estate Strategy Working Group which is developing a new School Estate Strategy.</p>

  <p>I have already made clear that we are planning to announce later this year the next part of our schools investment programme which will involve working with local authorities to take forward capital investment through SFT. It should also be noted that on 12 March this year following quality assurance work by SFT, Orkney Islands Council commissioned its schools NPD project by advertising for a partner to carry out the construction of the schools.</p>

  <p>One further area of early activity has been the exploration of the tax increment financing concept. The full range of SFT&rsquo;s initial activities will be published in their forthcoming Business Plan.</p>

  <p>I am satisfied that SFT is progressing along the path envisaged and is already making an important contribution to infrastructure investment. During the development of SFT, the Scottish Government has been investing, and continues to invest in Public infrastructure, at record levels. In the current year the &pound;3.5 billion budget has been boosted by accelerated expenditure of &pound;293 million from 2010-11 for a range of projects including affordable housing and town centre regeneration.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it considers that reducing the intake to teacher training courses by 4%, as confirmed by the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning on 30 April 2009 ( <em>Official Report</em> c. 16897), is contrary to paragraph nine in its letter to the Scottish Funding Council dated January 2009 entitled Teacher Workforce Planning: Initial Teacher Education (ITE), which states that &quot;Increasing the BEd numbers does not address demographic needs or class size reduction policies in the short term due to the course length. There therefore continues to be a need for substantial number of PGDE students&quot;.</p>

  <p>Substantial numbers of postgraduate initial teacher education students will still enter training in 2009. Following revised guidance 1,350 students will enter the primary course and 1,050 the secondary course. This level of PGDE students still exceeds the average intake of such students in the last seven years of the previous administration.</p>

  <p>Prior to the retirement of Dr Reed, the responsibilities of the Director of Finance and Corporate Services post were combined with those of the Director of Business Improvement, as an interim measure. The Permanent Secretary has agreed with the current Chief Executive of Transport Scotland that the post of Finance Director should be separated from the remainder of Corporate Services. The post of Director of Business Improvement will become Director of Corporate Services and Business Improvement. Arrangements are being put in place to fill the Finance Director post.</p>
