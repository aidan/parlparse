  <p>Prescription data collected centrally are not patient-specific.</p>

  <p>Care homes for children are now regulated by the Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care (the Care Commission). The commission regulates services by inspecting them against the legislative requirements and the relevant national care standards. The Regulation of Care (Requirements as to Care Services)(Scotland) Regulations 2002 require providers of some care services, including providers of care homes for children (independent and local authority), to keep a record of medicines for the use of service users which are kept on the premises from which the care service is provided.</p>

  <p>The information provided relates to assaults on police officers returned to Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Constabulary by forces on an annual basis. Forces are asked to record <i>all</i> assaults on police officers whether or not injury occurred and whether or not any person was charged. However, changes in recording systems, differences in counting conventions and differences in the nature of the incidents probably lie behind some of the large annual variations within certain forces and differences between forces. Action is in hand to try to improve the consistency with which this information is collected.</p>

  <p>The Executive received a copy of the OFT report today, as did ministers in the other three UK Health Departments.</p>

  <p>We shall consider the recommendations in the report very carefully. The recommendations could have potentially significant implications for both community pharmacists and patients alike. We are therefore arranging meetings to give key stakeholders the opportunity to give their views and reaction to the report&rsquo;s recommendations. Additionally, stakeholders who wish to do so may submit written comments to the Executive.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The SPS have prepared an Estate Development Programme. Long-term development plans are in place for HM Prison Edinburgh, HM Prison and Young Offenders Institution Glenochil, HM Prison Perth and HM Young Offenders Institution Polmont and implementation of these is planned to start in 2003. The programme also includes investment at HM Prison Barlinnie (accommodation upgrade) and HM Prison Peterhead (power in-cell).</p>

  <p>In addition, investments are being progressed on a number of sites, for example HM Prison Aberdeen, to meet key needs and subject to operational priorities and funding availability.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Budgets are allocated to areas best placed to manage them at any point in time. For example, when a process is relatively new the costs may be managed centrally and then subsequently delegated. Budgets at present delegated to prisons and other establishments are set out in the table but may change from year to year and during the year. A number of areas are managed by the centre including estate development, cost of capital and some specialist functions. These can also change from year to year and during the year.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has funded a study of rail links to Glasgow and Edinburgh Airports, and the Clyde Corridor Transportation Study, both of which examine the scope for a light rail link between Renfrew, Braehead retail centre and Glasgow city centre. The Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive has recently undertaken a Braehead Fixed Links study that will report shortly. As none of these studies have yet reported, it follows that, at this stage, there are no firm proposals for such a link.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive <a name="QuestionText">what the impact has been of HM Treasury&rsquo;s Technical Note No.1 (Revised), <i>How to account for PFI Transactions</i>, and how it will affect Scotland.</a></p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2003-01-17.S1W-33257.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80183" speakername="Mr Andy Kerr" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-03/wa0117.htm#QuestionText">

  <p>Technical Note No. 1 (Revised), <i>How to account for PFI Transactions</i> , is about the practical application of accounting standards which determine how PFI schemes are to be reported in the annual accounts of both the purchasers and operators. In particular, it is used to determine in which set of accounts the property associated with the PFI scheme is to be reported. The accounting treatment follows the requirements laid down by the Accounting Standards Board, which aim to ensure openness and clarity in published accounts. The guidance was effective from September 1998, and applied retrospectively.</p>

  <p>Under resource accounting, a change in a PFI project&rsquo;s accounting treatment from being &quot;off balance sheet&quot; to being &quot;on balance sheet&quot; has an impact on the budgeting process for departments and sponsored bodies. When Technical Note No.1 was issued, the Treasury agreed that where the accounting treatment changed for existing PFI schemes, this should have no impact on the departments or sponsored bodies concerned. This concession was allowed because departments would have been unaware of the change in accounting treatment at the time of signing such a PFI contract and it was deemed unfair to penalise them for a change which was outwith their control.</p>

  <p>The only contract in Scotland affected by the change of treatment is that for the new Edinburgh Royal Infirmary (RIE). The PFI contract for the RIE was signed in September 1996, and when the new guidance was applied retrospectively to the contract, the accounting treatment was revised to report the deal as being on the balance sheet of Lothian University Hospitals NHS Trust. Stage 1 of the scheme became operational in January 2002, and the annual accounts of the trust for 2001-02 reflect &#163;70.6 million on the balance sheet for that element. Stage 2 of the scheme is expected to be operational in spring 2003, by which time the capital value of the whole project (&#163;252 million) will have been reflected in the trust&rsquo;s balance sheet. The change in accounting treatment does not change the value for money assessment of the scheme.</p>

  <p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer has agreed that the Executive&rsquo;s budget will be adjusted to reflect this in 2001-02 and 2002-03 in respect of the PFI scheme at the RIE. Therefore there is no net impact on the Executive&rsquo;s Budget from the application of Technical Note No.1.</p>
