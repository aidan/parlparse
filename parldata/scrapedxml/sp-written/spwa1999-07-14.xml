  <p>The Ministry of Defence must adhere to procurement rules in awarding contracts and is precluded from specifying the source of origin of its purchases, including beef and lamb. While requiring its contractors to seek the best price in the open market, consistent with its quality standards, the Ministry does look to buy home produced products where they are competitive. My Department keeps in touch with the Ministry on procurement issues with that in mind. Special arrangements have been made for the armed forces to access stocks of intervention beef held in cold stores throughout the UK, including stocks held in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Full details of individual grants are listed each year in SNH&#146;s published Annual Report, a copy of which is laid before Parliament. Contracts, which are in the main for research commissioned by SNH, are subject to normal protocol concerning commercially sensitive information.</p>

  <p>In addition to the payments listed in the table, the RSPB also received the sums of &pound;61,340, &pound;69,204 and &pound;41,731 over the years 1996/97 to 1998/99 respectively in respect of management agreements.

  <p>We have no immediate plans to do so.</p>

  <p>Three months does not seem to be an unreasonable period within which to expect borrowers whose income is below the repayment threshold to seek to defer their liability to repay.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Ministers may borrow from the Secretary of State only to meet a temporary excess of sums paid out of the Scottish Consolidated Fund over sums paid into that Fund, or to provide a working balance in the Fund. The interest charged by Treasury will be dependent on the timing and duration of such borrowings.</p>

  <p>I am satisfied that appropriate arrangements are already in place for Gulf War Veterans in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The clinical needs of veterans in Scotland are assessed by their doctor. Should concerns exist that the patient&#146;s health may have been affected by service with the armed forces in the Gulf, he or she can be referred to the Ministry of Defence&#146;s Gulf Veterans&#146; Medical Assessment Programme (MAP) for further investigation and diagnosis.</p>

  <p>Patients referred to the MAP are given a full medical examination together with a range of physical tests; investigations routinely conducted for all patients include urinalysis, haematological, biochemical, biological and serological tests, ultrasound scan of the abdomen and electrocardiography. These tests are carried out on the day of the appointment and take approximately 4 hours. Additional investigations and /or referrals to other consultants or specialists may be required; this is decided either during the initial appointment or in follow-up consultations if deemed necessary.</p>

  <p>The MAP itself does not provide treatment; its role is to assess patients and recommend treatment as appropriate. Any recommendations for treatment are passed on to the patient&#146;s GP; it is then for the individual doctor to arrange treatment through the National Health Service and to monitor the patient&#146;s health as he or she would for any other patient. In the case of a veteran who is still serving, recommendations for treatment would be passed to the unit medical officer and treatment arranged through the Defence Medical Services.</p>

  <p>The cost of the patient&#146;s travel to the MAP (within the UK) is met by the MOD as are accommodation costs where necessary.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no immediate plans to upgrade the A737 trunk road. A study is underway to identify sections of the route which would benefit from a more consistent standard of signing. Subject to the findings of the report, it is expected that any work identified will be undertaken during financial year 2000-01, subject to funds being available.</p>
