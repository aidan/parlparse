  <p>There are no Scottish Government plans to produce a national report based around any single SOA indicator.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s current preferred indicator of child poverty at a local level is the &quot;percentage of children in each Local Authority that live in households dependent on out of work benefits OR Child Tax Credit more than the family element&quot; which is calculated from HM Revenue and Customs data.</p>

  <p>It is available for all local authorities in Scotland and the rest of the UK. It is published on the HMRC website as well as being available to download on the government income and poverty statistics website and the Scottish Neighborhood Statistics website at <a href="http://www.sns.gov.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.sns.gov.uk/</a>, a site that is a popular source of data for local authority single outcome agreements.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to improving the quality and efficiency of all Scotland&rsquo;s public services. The ability to simplify and share resources is the right way to deliver real benefits at a local level, while helping to protect front line services. The Scottish Government is fully committed to supporting and facilitating collaboration between services at a local level.</p>

  <p>Scotland&rsquo;s three emergency services have already delivered a number of successful joint initiatives, with a number of others in the planning stages. Some examples are quoted below</p>

  <p>Scottish Ambulance Service / Police</p>

  <p>Joint Ambulance and Police Station in Afford, Grampian.</p>

  <p>Imminent sharing of premises with Police in Lairg, Highlands and Islands.</p>

  <p>Scottish Ambulance Service / Fire and Rescue Services</p>

  <p>There are a number of Fire Stations around the country used as tactical deployment points for ambulance crews to enable a quick response to the public.</p>

  <p>Volunteer Fire Fighters in remote and rural communities have been trained to give vital first aid to patients while the ambulance is on its way.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Fire Services College has trained over 70 members of the Scottish Ambulance Service, Special Operations Response Teams in the use of breathing apparatus.</p>

  <p>Scottish Ambulance Service/ Fire and Rescue Services / Police</p>

  <p>National tripartite fleet initiative through collaborative procurement of fleet products and joint maintenance including fleet workshops in Ayr, Kilwinning, Lochgilphead and Glenrothes.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland (ACPOS) and the Scottish Government are jointly hosting a collaboration event on 22 June 2010 to facilitate dialogue between the Scottish Police Service and other parts of the public sector about the potential scope for future collaboration and sharing services.</p>

  <p>Discretionary fiscal stimulus measures were introduced by countries across the world in response to the onset of the global downturn, and the fall in global demand. These actions have helped support demand and jobs in many countries, including Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government introduced a discretionary fiscal stimulus through the accelerated capital spending programme - a key element of the Economic Recovery Plan. It is estimated that the accelerated capital spending programme &ndash; which involved the acceleration of &pound;293 million capital spending into 2009-10, and &pound;53 million into 2008-09 &ndash; has supported over 5,000 jobs in the Scottish economy over the period.</p>

  <p>In December 2008 the Scottish Government estimated the potential impact on the Scottish economy of the temporary 2.5% reduction in the rate of VAT &ndash; a key element of the discretionary fiscal stimulus package introduced by the UK Government at the 2008 Pre-Budget Report. This analysis, using the Scottish Government input output model and applying Treasury assumptions regarding the proportion of the VAT cut that would be saved by consumers, estimated that this action would directly support around 5,400 jobs in Scotland. However, the analysis estimated that if the same level of support (around &pound;1 billion) was directed towards capital expenditure this would have directly supported around 10,000 jobs in the Scottish economy in 2009. This analytical note was published via the Scottish Parliaments Information Centre in December 2008 (Bib. number 47241).</p>

  <p>The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) is part of NHS Quality Improvement Scotland, a special health board, whose role is to support NHS boards and their staff to improve the quality of healthcare in Scotland.</p>

  <p>SIGN has a range of policies to ensure that patient and carer experiences and preferences are included in the development of their guidelines. These include patient focussed literature searches, speaking to patient organisations, checking with other NHS organisations whether there is any local research on patient views and seeking direct feedback from service users if required. Patients and other groups also have the opportunity to comment on the draft recommendations and influence their final form through a national open meeting which is held for each draft SIGN guideline. Further detail on these policies is available on the SIGN website at<a href="http://www.sign.ac.uk" target="_blank"> www.sign.ac.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>Better Together, Scotland&rsquo;s Patient Experience Programme will be publishing the provisional results of the 2009-10 inpatient experience survey on the Scottish Government and Better Together Websites on 27 July 2010. This provisional release will provide a report on patients experiences of admission, ward and hospital environment, staff, medicines and discharge for each hospital in Scotland where the number of responses are above 20 patients. The reports will identify the top 10 and bottom 10 scoring questions for each hospital. The report will also show where a hospital&rsquo;s positive percentage for a particular question is significantly less than the Scotland positive percentage. This will enable NHS boards and their patients to identify where a hospital is provide a high quality experience for its patients and where there are areas for improvement. These provisional results will then be updated and presented in a national report which will be published on the 28 September 2010 on the Scottish Government and Better Together Websites. The national report will provide Scotland level results and comparisons between NHS board areas.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally. Each local authority would be best placed to estimate numbers in its own area.</p>

  <p>However, in March 2009 the Review of the Private Rented Sector in Scotland estimated the number of households living in the sector to be 233,000. Private landlords must register themselves, and all the properties that they let.</p>

  <p>Up to 31 May 2010, 217,032 properties were approved with a further 9,660 awaiting decision. Although the exact numbers in the sector are subject to constant change, this indicates that about 97% of properties are now covered by registration based on the estimate in the review.</p>

  <p>Internal convention is that Cabinet procedures for dealing with requests for written authority require any authorities from ministers to be assessed separately by the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth and cleared by the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. In providing advice to ministers, special advisors are required to comply with the Code of Conduct for Special Advisors, which sets out their role and duties. A copy of the code is available in the Scottish Parliaments Information Centre (Bib. number 49592).</p>
