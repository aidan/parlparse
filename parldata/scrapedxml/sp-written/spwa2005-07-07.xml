  <p>The draft Animal Health and Welfare Bill will not provide any additional protection for intensively farmed chickens. However, a draft EU Council Directive based on the EU Report <em>The Welfare of Chickens kept for Meat Production (Broilers)</em> , proposes to set down additional minimum standards for the protection of chickens kept for meat production. This proposal is currently being examined by a European Council Working Group.</p>

  <p>It is for the patient&rsquo;s own health board to provide suitable care and treatment arrangements for a patient who is ready to be transferred out of the State Hospital. if no facilities are available within the board area then it is up to that board to consider other appropriate facilities outwith their area.</p>

  <p>As at 30 June 2005, 46 out of the 227 patients within the State Hospital had been assessed by State Hospital clinicians as being ready for transfer to a less secure environment, subject to agreement with clinicians in the receiving health board area. For 27 of the 46 patients, clinical agreement had been reached with the receiving clinicians. Nineteen of these 27 patients have been waiting over three months for a transfer out of the State Hospital.</p>

  <p>We do not hold this precise information. However, around 10% of the municipal waste stream consists of plastics and around 0.3% of the municipal waste stream consists of plastic bags. We would expect, therefore, that most recycling of plastics from the municipal waste stream would not relate to plastic bags but would relate to other products, such as plastic bottles.</p>

  <p>It was decided to review general grant conditions across the Scottish Executive because inconsistencies were emerging in the control of funding, for example, the way in which annual accounts had to be presented. The updated conditions ensure uniformity of the core conditions applying to all recipients of grant funding from the Scottish Executive. The updated conditions are also designed to be more user friendly and transparent than those used previously. Furthermore, the updated conditions consolidate a range of conditions already in place, and Scottish Executive Divisions are able to amend clauses to suit their needs.</p>

  <p>Scottish Executive grant funding is normally available on a three year funding basis, with instalment arrangements agreed between recipient organisations, in accordance with the Scottish Compact with the voluntary sector. Organisations can seek to receive grant funding from the Scottish Executive in any way which suits their needs and this will be considered, subject to financial rules and spending review restrictions.</p>

  <p>It is appropriate for the Scottish Executive to retain intellectual property rights on publicly funded research if, for example, retention of these rights by the grant recipient organisation might inhibit policy development or dissemination, or create a disproportionate commercial benefit to the grantee. However, if there is no need for the Scottish Executive to retain intellectual property rights it will be appropriate for the voluntary organisation undertaking the research with public funding to hold them for the work done.</p>
