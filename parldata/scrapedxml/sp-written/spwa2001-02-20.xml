  <p>The Scottish Executive does not forecast GDP growth rates. However, Scottish GDP growth strengthened in the most recent quarter and latest independent forecasts indicate growth in line with or above trend this year, with BSL and Cambridge Econometrics projecting that growth in Scotland will strengthen in 2001.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is firmly focused on raising the long run sustainable growth rate of the Scottish economy by meeting the new international conditions for economic success - growing business, ensuring Scotland is globally connected, lifelong learning and skills development - through the framework provided by the Enterprise Strategy, <i>A Smart, Successful Scotland</i>.</p>

  <p>The Health Technology Board for Scotland (HTBS) recognises effective communication processes are essential to its work and is developing a communication strategy to ensure it has ongoing dialogue with interested groups. It is also forming a Communications Reference Group to advise its board.</p>

  <p>HTBS will hold consultative seminars with health boards, Trusts and other groups in NHSScotland in spring 2001. Discussion at these seminars will identify preferred methods of disseminating HTBS advice.</p>

  <p>HTBS is actively building a communication network with interested groups, particularly patient groups, and individuals to support its consultation processes. In addition to an open and consultative process designed to ensure there is ongoing dialogue with interested groups, HTBS is also using its website to capture suggestions and encourage feedback, and conducting question and answer sessions with the public at the end of each of its board meetings.</p>

  <p>All documents issued by HTBS are placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre and advice that flows from the assessments carried out by HTBS will also be available there.</p>

  <p>No. Anyone cited for jury service who can show good reason may be excused by the clerk of the court. The trial judge also has a similar discretion. A sympathetic view would generally be taken, if attendance would cause genuine problems of a domestic nature.</p>

  <p>We receive occasional correspondence on road traffic law. This law is mostly reserved. Its implementation falls to the Lord Advocate and the courts.

  <p>Some health boards already have non-executive members who are also elected local authority members. We believe that the presence of local authority members on the NHS Board will be important for the future development of local services.</p>

  <p>Although it has undertaken no research on this specific aspect, the Scottish Executive believes that adequately funded police forces are an essential ingredient in any broad-based strategy which seeks to tackle crime and disorder.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers are committed to ensuring that Scotland has an effective as well as a strong police service and a range of measures have been taken to free up the time of the police officers for front-line duties. These include promoting the use of new technology, for example through initiatives such as the Integration of the Scottish Criminal Justice Information Systems and the Scottish Police Information Strategy. We are also encouraging the use of support staff to take on duties that do not require the skills and powers of a police officer, and we are examining other ways. For example, we funded a pilot into delivering citations by post rather than by police officers, and are considering ways of extending this process throughout Scotland.</p>
