  <p>The Scottish Government has accepted Lord Sutherland&rsquo;s 12 recommendations in full and these are being taken forward alongside a wider package of measures we are developing in collaboration with local government and health service partners.</p>

  <p>The government&rsquo;s National Performance Framework focuses all of government and public services on a single overarching common purpose and provides clarity through a set of purpose targets and 15 National Outcomes that describe a 10-year vision of the kind of Scotland we want to create.</p>

  <p>The interests of older people are reflected in a number of the National Outcomes. Full details of the outcomes the government wants to achieve and how well Scotland is progressing in pursuit of these aims can be found on the Scotland Performs website. Beneath the national level, strategic local priorities are aligned to the 15 National Outcomes and are set out in Single Outcome Agreements prepared by each local authority working with Community Planning Partners (CPPs).</p>

  <p>The government recognises that other activity supports the achievement of the Purpose and National Outcomes. Where Community Care outcomes are concerned there is a National Outcomes Framework for Community Care Services which includes measures and targets relevant specifically to improving the quality of systems and processes which support delivery of outcomes for older people and other community care clients. All CPPs have been encouraged to use the framework as a basis for assessing and presenting progress towards more effective joint delivery of community care services and better outcomes for service users.</p>

  <p>National data on levels of childhood obesity are available from the Scottish Health Survey and new data will be available later in 2009. We have used data from the most recent Scottish Health Survey (2003) to determine the HEAT targets for each health board in delivery of behaviour change programmes for overweight children.</p>

  <p>Although data is not available through the national Child Health School System (CHSP-School) in these NHS boards areas for height and weight in primary seven, the health boards should have their own systems for monitoring purposes.</p>

  <p>It is a matter for NHS boards to use and develop appropriate data to allow them to deliver effective interventions.</p>

  <p>The early years framework makes clear the commitment of the Scottish Government and COSLA to improving outcomes for children the importance of play in meeting that commitment.</p>

  <p>The concordat between the Scottish Government and COSLA sets out the terms of a new relationship based on mutual respect and partnership. It will be for community planning partners, through the single outcome agreement (SOA) process, to plan and deliver improved outcomes at the local level.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government therefore currently has no plans to make the provision of play facilities a statutory requirement.</p>

  <p>Measures of success of all aspects of the early years framework, including play, will be based on outcomes and appropriate indicators, rather than on implementation of specific actions.

  <p>The exact number of men and women treated for an eating disorder (i.e. anorexia, bulimia and other psychological eating disorders) in Scotland, is not available centrally. However, national estimates of the number of people consulting a member of the primary care practice team because of eating disorders can be given based on PTI (Practice Team Information). PTI data are obtained from a sample of Scottish general practices. This sample covers the full range of age, sex, deprivation and urban/rural classes existing in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The estimated number of men and women consulting a member of the practice team (GP, practice nurse, district nurse or health visitor) for an eating disorder in Scotland, during the financial years 2003-04 to 2006-07, based on PTI data, is shown in table 1. Estimates are standardised by deprivation, and figures are rounded to the nearest 50. Estimates are provided for the requested age groups (10-16 years, 17-23 years, and 24-30 years) for females, however the small number of cases in males does not permit the age breakdown, so for males only totals over all three age groups are shown.</p>

  <p>Most patients suffering from eating disorders will be treated in primary care. More severe cases may however be referred to hospitals.

  <p>Note that the figures are based on numbers of patients who have at least one discharge episode in any given year. Patients are counted once within each year but may be counted more than once across years. Patients with an episode in both acute (non-obstetric, non psychiatric) and psychiatric hospital within a year will be counted in both tables.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government inherited a system from the previous administration that did not record all requests centrally. In particular, only the more complex requests tended to be recorded centrally. This means that the information held in relation to the number of requests pre 1 January 2008 is not comprehensive.</p>

  <p>As of 1 January 2008, the Scottish Government put in place an Information Request Tracking System which has considerably improved the accuracy of the information we hold on request handling. All requests are now recorded (except those which are regularly and easily dealt with, such as requests for consultation papers and publications).</p>

  <p>In 2007, the Scottish Government recorded 779 requests and issued 431 responses. In 2008, we recorded 1,258 requests and issued 1,149 responses.</p>

  <p>Regarding the cost of responding to FOI requests I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-21200 on 16 March 2009. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at:</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many deaths have been attributed to thrombosis in each year from 1998 to 2002.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-03-18.S3W-21617.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80379" speakername="Shona Robison" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa0318.htm#8">

  <p>The information requested is shown in the following table, and represents the best estimates available, rather an exact count, for the following reasons.</p>

  <p>This information uses groups of causes of deaths. In the case of some of the groups, it is thought that all the deaths from those causes are due to the specified type of thrombosis; in the case of the other groups, it is thought that most of the deaths from those causes are due to the specified types of thrombosis. This is because thrombosis is not a diagnosis, but a mechanism through which diseases cause their effects. Doctors certifying death record the disease or condition relating to death, but do not record the mechanism of disease, which is not known in every case. Some conditions are caused exclusively by thrombosis, but for other conditions, such as stroke, thrombosis contributes only to some, or most, cases. For such conditions, information about the proportion of cases in which there was thrombosis is not routinely available.</p>

  <p>In addition, the groups are defined, for the years 1998 and 1999, in terms of codes from the ninth revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-9), and, for the years 2000 to 2002, in terms of codes from the tenth revision of that classification (ICD-10). This is because the General Register Office for Scotland used ICD-9 codes to classify deaths which were registered up to 1999, and ICD-10 codes for deaths which were registered from 2000.</p>

  <p>The figures for 1998 and 1999 are therefore on a different basis from those for 2000 and later years, due to the change in the classification. The figures for 1998 and 1999 are likely to be less reliable than those for 2000 onwards, because the ICD-9 code-list was generally less detailed than the ICD-10 one. The groups shown here may therefore differ from those which have been used, on other occasions, to provide statistics of the numbers of deaths caused by particular types of thrombosis.</p>

  <p>As the figures demonstrate, the vast majority of these deaths are caused by clots in the coronary arteries, which result in certain types of heart attack, and clots in the brain, which result in certain types of stroke.</p>

  <p>The higher rate of tuition fees for medicine was introduced by the then Scottish Executive as voted on and agreed by Parliament on 20 April 2005.

  <p>We continue to work with the Ministry of Defence, NHS boards, veterans organisations such as Combat Stress, and other partners to further improve structured care and support for former service personnel with mental health problems, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</p>

  <p>There are a range of evidence based treatments for PTSD which are best determined by the clinician, in consultation with other professionals, the individual and where appropriate the carer(s) or family, on the basis of individual needs assessment, and the priority to be attached to NHS treatment for service personnel.</p>

  <p>The newly established UK Psychological Trauma Society, supported by the Scottish Government, will also have a role to play in promoting good clinical practice among those working with traumatised individuals, including former service personnel.</p>

  <p>Our partnership Pilot with the MoD, NHS Lothian and others to provide care and support for Veterans in Edinburgh, will inform the further development of improved mental health services for Veterans across Scotland. It is expected to be operational this month.</p>

  <p>We also continue to work with all partners to advance the ambitions set out in the 2008 MoD command paper and our own commitments paper published the same day for improving and extending care and support for service personnel and veterans across a wide range of services.</p>

  <p>The extension of priority treatment for services related health issues was extended in Scotland with effect from 29 February 2008 to all veterans, not just those in receipt of a war pension. It applies only to conditions related to service and it is for the clinical practitioner to decide, on the balance of probabilities, whether the condition is related to service.</p>

  <p>We continue to work closely with NHS Scotland and their partners to deliver mental health care, services and support which reflect this priority, and which respond to the distinct needs and cultures of veterans and service personnel.</p>

  <p>Piracy is an offence at common law. The maximum penalty on conviction on indictment is accordingly life imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine. The Merchant Shipping and Maritime Security Act 1997 also incorporates provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea defining piracy, and is relevant where the acts occur outwith Scottish territorial waters. Hijacking of aircraft is dealt with by section 1 of the Aviation Security Act 1982, the maximum penalty on conviction on indictment being life imprisonment.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body how many staff have taken voluntary redundancy since 2003, broken down by directorate.</p>

  <p>The SPCB&rsquo;s policy on compulsory redundancy states that one of the measures used to avoid or minimise compulsory redundancies includes inviting staff to volunteer for redundancy on compulsory terms. Since 2003, three members of staff have volunteered for redundancy thereby avoiding the need for a compulsory redundancy process.</p>

  <p>Directorate of Resources and Governance &ndash; one member of staff</p>

  <p>Directorate of Access and Information &ndash; two members of staff.</p>

  <p>Parliament has established the Review of SPCB Supported Bodies Committee to consider and report on among other things the structure of the bodies supported by the SPCB and to make recommendations accordingly.</p>

  <p>The SPCB submitted its proposals based on its experiences of dealing with the SPCB supported bodies since the establishment of each of the offices. The SPCB was aware that each of the officeholders would themselves give evidence to the committee.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body what its reasons are for not renewing its contract with the Scottish Tourist Guides Association.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-03-18.S3O-6458.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80346" speakername="Tricia Marwick" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa0318.htm#32">

  <p>The SPCB&rsquo;s decision not to renew the contract was taken for strategic reasons in the context of the Parliament&rsquo;s developing approach to public engagement.</p>

  <p>In October 2008, the SPCB agreed that tours for Members&rsquo; guests and the general public should, in future, be provided free-of-charge by Scottish Parliament staff. From September 2009 members of the public will no longer have to pay to take a guided tour of the Holyrood building.</p>

  <p>The costs of the commercial tour contract have not been met by tour income, despite action being taken to address this by reducing the number of guides timetabled daily, and rescheduling tour departure times to reduce costs.</p>

  <p>The provision of free-of-charge tours, which have not been possible given the commercial nature of the current contract, will bring tours into line with other aspects of the Parliament&rsquo;s public engagement programme such as the education programme, cr&egrave;che for visitors and public exhibitions and events which are also free for visitors.</p>

  <p>The SPCB endeavours to provide maximum flexibility for employees to balance their work and private life, which includes making time for volunteering purposes. And it also looks to support any direct requests for staff to take time off for volunteering, working to ensure that we balance the needs of the business with personal wishes wherever this is possible.</p>

  <p>The SPCB observes all its statutory duties in terms of granting paid special leave for certain public duties. In addition, staff may apply for unpaid special leave to carry out voluntary and/or charitable work in the UK or abroad for any period of less than three months whilst a career break can be requested for a period of three months &ndash; two years for the same purpose.</p>
