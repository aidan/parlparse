  <p>Some information on the level of spend by NHS boards on addressing drug misuse is currently collected through drug action team corporate action plans, available at http://www.drugmisuse.isdscotland.org/dat/cap/dat.htm, and <strong> </strong> alcohol action team local action plans, available at http://www.scotland.gov.uk/health/alcoholproblems/plans.asp.</p>

  <p>Information on direct spend on both drugs and alcohol will be collected within combined drug and alcohol action team plans for 2004-05. However, many services, particularly for alcohol, are provided within a generic setting and funded from general allocations, and therefore expenditure cannot be separately identified by the Executive. Some information which will be collected will also cover combined addictions services, where drugs and alcohol spend cannot be separately identified.</p>

  <p>From 2004-05 we will be collecting data from local authorities on the numbers of carers&#8217; assessments being carried out. We propose to build on this by collecting additional data on the numbers of carers requesting assessments.

Other performance indicators and outcome measures for carers will be developed in due course and we are already working closely on this with key stakeholders.</p>

  <p>It would be wrong to conclude that implementation of the Review of Scotland's Cities might lead to a diminution in the role of urban economies elsewhere in Scotland &#8211; particularly in areas such as West Lothian and North Lanarkshire, whose economic success is very closely bound up with that of Glasgow and Edinburgh.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, the whole emphasis of our urban policy is to view cities in the context of their wider city regions. Our framework policy document for Scotland's cities &#8211; Building Better Cities &#8211; emphasises the fundamental importance of close collaboration between cities and their surrounding regions.</p>

  <p>Cities and their community planning partners must draw together the wider city-region view, because many of the issues to be addressed &#8211; such as economic development, land-use planning, health-care and transport &#8211; require a perspective spanning the entire city-region and beyond.</p>

  <p>That report was published today, and it addresses recommendations to the UK Government on areas where the Council of Europe considers action is required to ensure that its charter obligations are met. Specific recommendations are made in relation to Scots and Gaelic.</p>

  <p>Progress has already been made since the Council of Europe collected the information on which its report is based. B&ograve;rd na G&agrave;idhlig has been established as the primary Gaelic development agency in Scotland and is channelling government funding to priority areas of Gaelic language development. The Executive has consulted on a draft Gaelic Language Bill, which will be introduced to Parliament later this year. Steps are being taken through the Standards in Scotland&#8217;s Schools Act 2000 to improve the delivery of Gaelic Medium Education. The UK Government and the Scottish Executive are in dialogue about funding for the Gaelic Media Service. The Executive is also committed through <em>A Partnership agreement for a Better Scotland</em> to develop a national language strategy, which will develop a new focus for all of Scotland&#8217;s languages, including Scots. Work on the strategy will start this year.</p>

  <p>The implementation of the objectives and principles of the charter is a matter not only for the Executive but for local authorities and other public bodies and institutions, and the Executive expects that due recognition will be given to charter obligations at these levels. We will shortly write to all those with an interest in the charter reminding them of the UK&#8217;s obligations and what practical steps can to be taken to meet them.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to policies which will enable it to work toward meeting those charter obligations for which it has responsibility, and looks forward to the opportunity to contribute to the UK&#8217;s next report to the Council of Europe.</p>

  <p>The introduction of annual chain-linking was recommended by the European System of National Accounts 1993 (SNA93). All member states of the EU were required to adopt this methodology by 2005.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Economic Statistics Programme published in <em>Scottish Economic Statistics 2001 </em>noted the intention to adopt the methodology for Scottish GDP. This proposal was open for consultation, and the Scottish Economics Statistics Consultants Group of external experts fully supported the decision to adopt the EU standard approach.

  <p>No other region of the UK currently produces a quarterly GDP index, so the change in methodology does not directly affect them. The Office for National Statistics produces regional analysis for all regions of the UK through the annual regional accounts exercise.</p>

  <p>The potential for production of a measure of gross national income (the ESA95 equivalent of GNP) was considered by the Scottish Economic Statistics Consultants Group in June 2002. After considering evidence from an initial study, the group decided that it was not feasible to pursue it because of the difficulty of measurement, in particular of investment flows between Scotland and the rest of the UK. A paper summarising the reasoning behind the decision is available on the Scottish Executive website at</p>

  <p>http://www.scotland.gov.uk/stats/scotstats/committees/economy/meetings/sescg912003.pdf.</p>

  <p>Work is on-going to improve the available information on household wealth in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The business learning account (BLA) pilots will run for two years until 2005, with evaluation on-going throughout. An interim evaluation is due in Autumn this year, with the final evaluation report due to be received in September 2005.</p>

  <p>Three hundred BLAs are being delivered within four pilots testing a sectoral and geographical approach. Three are within the Scottish Enterprise area and one in the Highlands and Islands using two different funding caps to establish the most effective level of support.

  <p>A consultation paper for a Code of Practice on litter and waste for the Fast Food Industry in Scotland is currently being prepared. In the Antisocial Behaviour etc (Scotland) Bill the Executive is proposing to extend the power to issue fixed penalty notices for littering to police officers.</p>

  <p>There are no proposals to introduce a levy on fast food container use at present. On plastic bags, Mike Pringle MSP has issued a consultation paper about the possible introduction of a levy. The Executive is currently giving consideration to this paper. We are also having discussions with the Scottish Retail Consortium about retailers taking voluntary steps to reduce the use of plastic bags.</p>

  <p>Effective monitoring, control and surveillance are critical to the operation of the Common Fisheries Policy and measures to conserve fish stocks. Towards the end of last year the European Commission drew attention to shortcomings in the United Kingdom&#8217;s control arrangements and compliance with the rules and regulations of the Common Fisheries Policy. Concerns have also been expressed by the National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee in England and, more recently, by the Cabinet Office Strategy Unit which will report shortly on a sustainable future for the fishing industry.</p>

  <p>With increasing emphasis on the sustainable use of naturally occurring resources, a culture of high compliance becomes ever more important. To encourage such culture and to respond to the concerns raised by the European Commission and others, the Fisheries Departments in the UK are taking a number of measures to strengthen fisheries monitoring, control and surveillance. These include:</p>

  <p>consideration of moving away from the current system of criminal sanctions towards a potentially more responsive system of administrative penalties for breaches of fisheries regulations;</p>

  <p>improved accountability and traceability of fish landings through the designation of fish markets and the registration of all sellers and buyers of first sale fish;</p>

  <p>improvements in the weighing of fish before it is sold or before it leaves the port of landing for sale elsewhere;</p>

  <p>extending the existing arrangements for designated landing ports and for the prior notification of catch to vessels below 20 metres;</p>

  <p>the wider use of single area or single species licensing;</p>

  <p>the fitting of tamper proof satellite position reporting terminals to all vessels over 15 metres;</p>

  <p>the better utilisation of resources with a greater focus on land-based inspection.</p>

  <p>Some measures are already being put into effect and others are or will be the subject of consultation with the industry. Together the measures will complement other action that is being taken at both national and community level to safeguard fish stocks and the long term interests of the fishing industry.</p>

  <p>A more detailed note on the action that is being taken has been placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre and copies are to be sent to fishermen and other stakeholders.</p>

  <p>I am concerned that there has not been a resolution of the various difficulties over the transfer of funds from the former Football Trust to the Scottish Football Partnership. The Executive has no direct locus but has been encouraging the parties to resolve the difficulties and ensure the transfer of funds is made at the earliest opportunity. The precise nature of the difficulties are confidential matters for the trustees involved but I would hope that a resolution is not too far off and that the partnership, which was incorporated on 29 October 2001, will finally be able to contribute to the development of football at all levels.</p>

  <p>Priority for the use of this funding will be for regeneration activity that is directly linked to housing transfer proposals which have secured a place on the Community Ownership Programme. Access to the fund will be widened to include retention councils who have robust delivery plans to achieve the Scottish Housing Quality Standard (SHQS) for their own stock, but who have significant areas of deprivation that have wider regeneration needs. Bids from these councils will be considered in 2005 when we see their SHQS delivery plans. Detailed criteria will be issued in due course.</p>

  <p>I set out my plans for the new Individual Learning Account scheme, to be known as ILA Scotland, to the Enterprise and Culture Committee on 27 January.</p>

  <p>It is intended that the new scheme will be available from summer 2004 subject to all required improvements being in place, and testing having been satisfactorily completed.</p>

  <p>It will initially be offered to people on incomes of up to &#163;15,000 per year.</p>

  <p>A universal scheme, focused initially on basic Information, Communication Technologies skills and qualifications, will be rolled out from April 2005. It is intended that the general eligibility criteria for the universal scheme are that learners should be ordinarily resident in Scotland and aged 18 years or over.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s funding for money advice will cover negotiation by advisers with creditors to reach an agreement which provides the best possible outcome for the creditor and debtor alike. In some circumstances debtors seeking such advice will have experienced the diligence of attachment. In a few cases exceptional attachment orders may have been granted.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what plans it has to relocate appropriate items held in museums to the areas where they were originally made or discovered.</p>

  <p>Museum collections legally belong to the individual institutions that have either purchased or been given them. It would, therefore, be inappropriate for the Scottish Executive to make any plans to relocate items from one museum to another. Museums will usually respond favourably to requests to lend items from their collections to other museums for temporary exhibitions, if measures can be put in place to satisfactorily safeguard them.</p>

  <p>Through its support for the registration scheme, the Scottish Executive expects museums to comply with the Museums Association's Code of Ethics. This makes it clear that a museum has a duty to acquire collections honestly and responsibly and to recognise the interests of people who made, used, owned, collected or gave items. If a community were to seek restitution of an item for any reason, a museum would have a duty to deal sensitively and promptly with that request, but its principal duty would continue to be to safeguard the item and hold it in trust for society.</p>

  <p>However, the principle that ownership need not limit the physical accessibility of the item to the institution that owns it is now widely accepted and has guided the provision of the National Museums of Scotland&#8217;s services for many decades. There are many ways in which the National Museums of Scotland makes accessible to local communities the objects that were found there. For example, the National Museums of Scotland has an extensive loans programme, enabling objects in the national collections to be seen by the people whose local heritage these items represent.</p>

  <p>All existing base-load stations are privately owned and operated, and their future lifespan is a matter for the generation asset owners. The UK Energy white paper, published in February 2003, envisages that the energy system in 2020 will be much more diverse than it is today, with a greater mix of technologies and including imports, particularly of gas. We are determined that renewable technologies will play their full part in the future energy mix in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has been fully consulted by the Sector Skills Development Agency about the intention to appoint two partnership manager posts for Scotland. We, along with key Scottish stakeholders, including the enterprise networks, have been fully involved in the development of the specific roles for these two posts. Funding of the proposed posts is a matter for the Sector Skills Development Agency.</p>

  <p>The Home Secretary is aware that we are keen to make early progress in extending the remit of the Security Industry Authority (SIA) to include Scotland and Whitehall officials are pursuing a number of potential vehicles for making the necessary legislative changes. The Queen&#8217;s Speech in November will set out the legislative programme for 2004-05 and it is only then that we will be able to confirm if the proposals have been included in the next session.</p>

  <p>My officials and the Scottish Qualifications Authority are working with the SIA on the detail of how training will be organised in Scotland. Consideration is also being given to the strategy for consulting and working with the Scottish industry, once the SIA has a formal role in Scotland.</p>

I am sure that Jan Bebbington, Professor of Accountancy and Finance, University of Aberdeen; Ian Good, Chairman of the Edrington Group; and Simon Pepper, Director of WWF Scotland, will bring a useful external perspective and challenge to the work of the sub committee.</p>

  <p>The issues raised in the course of the consultation are still under consideration. A number of fundamental planning issues remain to be resolved and no decision will be made until they are resolved or alternatively it becomes clear that they cannot be resolved in a way that complies with national planning policy guidelines.</p>

  <p>The Energy Technology Support Unit produced the Assessment and Rating of Noise from Wind Farms report in September 1996 on behalf of the DTI. The guidance in this report has been widely adopted by the wind farm industry when assessing noise impact.</p>

  <p>Scottish Power has conducted its own noise assessment at the Whitelee site in accordance with these guidelines. The environmental statement produced in support of this application commits to ongoing noise monitoring and, where necessary, mitigation measures. Should Scottish ministers be minded to grant consent to this proposal, this commitment will be secured by condition.</p>

  <p>The potential for noise impact will be a material consideration in determining the Whitelee application as it is for all wind farm sites.</p>

All three rooms will be fitted with running water and chiller units to provide a suitable environment for nursing mothers to breastfeed and to express and store milk if required.</p>

  <p>All who require regular access to the Parliament must satisfy the security checks conducted via the Security Office. These checks take an average of 14/15 working days after the completed security questionnaire is submitted. Any delay depends on the information provided by staff so it is not possible to forecast how long a clearance will take to complete. Irrespective of the circumstances no one has been told that their clearance would take three months.</p>
