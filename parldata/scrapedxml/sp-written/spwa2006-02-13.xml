  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what further education is provided for young people with learning disabilities.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-02-13.4.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80115" speakername="Nicol Stephen" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0213.htm#2">

  <p>The Executive is committed to ensuring that everyone has the chance to learn irrespective of their background or personal circumstances. Our widening access policy is helping to break down barriers to participation faced by all groups including students with learning disabilities.</p>

  <p>The further education sector has made great efforts in recent years to make college provision accessible and inclusive to all those who wish to study and participation by students with disabilities or additional support needs has increased year on year.</p>

  <p>Scotland&rsquo;s colleges receive additional funding in respect of students who either attend a special programme or who require additional support to undertake a mainstream course.</p>

  <p>In addition to mainstream courses, Scottish colleges provide a range of programmes and courses which allow young people with learning disabilities to access further education and develop and improve their core skills.</p>

  <p>We recognise that for some students with the most complex needs, there is limited or no suitable provision in Scotland. Last year, we undertook a consultation to find out more about current provision; funding policies and experiences of young people with additional support needs. The consultation closed on 31 October 2005. We are currently considering options on how to best meet the needs of students with complex needs and will announce the next steps shortly.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many local authorities operate (a) source-segregated and (b) co-mingled recycling schemes.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-02-13.6.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80032" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0213.htm#3">

  <p>For the purposes of this question, we have assumed that &quot;source-segregated&quot; is a system where materials are separated into individual types before collection or at the kerbside. We have assumed that &quot;co-mingled&quot; is a system where different material types are collected together mixed and then separated at a materials recycling facility.</p>

  <p>Information held by the Scottish Waste Awareness Group (SWAG) indicates that there are 19 local authorities operating source-segregated recycling schemes; 10 local authorities operating both source-segregated recycling schemes and co-mingled recycling schemes, and three local authorities operating co-mingled schemes. Authorities operate a number of collection schemes and SWAG&rsquo;s Information indicates that, across Scotland, there are 83 source segregated schemes operated by local authorities and 22 co-mingled schemes operated by authorities.</p>

  <p>Information on recycling facilities across Scotland can be found by using &quot;Sort It&quot; on SWAG&rsquo;s website <a href="http://www.wascot.org.uk/sort_it_website/html/frame_scot.htm" target="_blank">http://www.wascot.org.uk/sort_it_website/html/frame_scot.htm</a>.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer given to that question. The Scottish Executive has no function in relation to electoral registration matters and no role in determining funding for them.</p>
