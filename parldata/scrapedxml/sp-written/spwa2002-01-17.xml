  <p>We started a review of domestic adoption and fostering policy and legislation in April last year. Just before Christmas, I received the report of the working group undertaking phase one, which was looking, amongst other matters, at the place of adoption in local authority services. I intend to publish the report and the Executive&#146;s response shortly.</p>

  <p>We have also strengthened controls over intercountry adoption. Prospective adopters must have a home study report by an approved adoption agency and must inform their local authority when they bring a child into this country. As agreed by Parliament, we are pursuing further measures to tighten up controls on internet advertising with UK ministers in the context of the Adoption and Children Bill.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is taking action in a number of areas to protect children's safety on the internet.</p>

  <p>We are supporting the current UK-wide advertising campaign to protect children using the internet. The campaign seeks to raise public awareness of the activities of paedophiles and the steps that users can take to protect themselves. We are reviewing our existing &quot;Click Thinking&quot; guidance to schools and education authorities to promote safe and responsible use of the internet both at school and at home. The Police Service and the Crown Office are working together to improve their existing training on Internet Crime, including action to tackle grooming by paedophiles on the internet. We are also working with the Crown Office to identify the scale of such grooming and possible remedies. In this respect I refer the member to my answer to Mr Gil Paterson on 13 December, S1O-4309.</p>

  <p>Securing better outcomes for children and young people in Scotland is one of our top priorities. We have established a new Cabinet Sub-Committee on children&#146;s services, chaired by the First Minister, to drive this forward. This met for the first time in December and agreed priority tasks for the next 12 months; including an integrated approach to assessment of needs and supporting joint working at local level.

  <p>The Scottish Executive has implemented a number of initiatives to improve the provision of this important service. We have made &#163;8 million available over three years to local authorities to help stabilise and sustain out-of-school care clubs, especially in disadvantaged areas. We are convening a Working Group, with cross-sector representation, to take forward issues affecting the delivery of out-of-school care. We agreed the designation of 25% postcode areas in Scotland (most deprived areas) where funding is available for up to three years for out-of-school projects approved by the New Opportunities Fund (the Fund). I am shortly to meet with the Fund&#146;s Scotland Board Member to explore ways of increasing the take up of funding in Scotland under its child care initiative.</p>

  <p>We achieved a very good outcome for Scotland from the recent EU Fisheries Council. Faced with an initial proposal which was far from favourable to Scottish and UK interests, the UK delegation took a robust approach to ensure the best possible available deal for our fishermen. This agreement, which is consistent with scientific advice, includes increases in quotas of key Scottish stocks.</p>

  <p>A full table of the UK quotas for 2002 has been placed in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 18398).</p>

  <p>My officials met Supporters Direct last September to discuss the possibility and practicalities of Supporters Direct extending the service they provide in England and Wales to Scotland. Supporters Direct were asked to submit a written proposal on how this could be achieved together with costings.</p>

  <p>Following the setting up of the Scottish Football Partnership (SFP) in November 2001, Supporters Direct were encouraged to apply to the SFP for funding and I understand that initial contact has been made. My colleague, Mike Watson has written to the Chairman of the Partnership asking that his board consider sympathetically any subsequent application received from Supporters Direct for funding. It is, however, a matter entirely for the board of the SFP. We remain committed to examining all possible means of encouraging responsible groups of supporters to become more involved in their football club.</p>

  <p>We recognise the important contribution made by commercial businesses based on outdoor activities to the Scottish economy as a whole and the rural economy in particular. There is no reason why such businesses should not continue to operate as at present following enactment of the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill.</p>

  <p>The bill will not diminish any existing rights nor will the fact that an activity is not included within the new access rights mean that it cannot continue as at present. In principle we do not consider it appropriate to provide commercial businesses with a statutory right to use another persons land for their own profit. It is for that reason that we have included section 9 (2)(a) in the bill. The effect of this provision is that the position of commercial businesses in relation to access is unchanged by the bill. In other words, they can continue to have access to land for the purpose of their business, as now, with the consent of the landowner (whether express or implied).</p>

  <p>Guidance on access by commercial businesses will be set out in the Scottish Outdoor Access Code following consultation with all interested parties.</p>

  <p>As stated in <i>Our National Health</i> , the Scottish Executive is committed to the development of advocacy services for those who most need them.

  <p>The resource implications of the new legislation will be set out in the accompanying Financial Memorandum.</p>

  <p>Roads authorities have powers under section 131 of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991, in the event of a failure by a utility company to reinstate the road properly, to issue a notice to the utility company requiring it to carry out remedial works within a prescribed period. Should this notice not be complied with, the authority may carry out the necessary works and recover the costs reasonably incurred by them in doing so.</p>

  <p>Section 130 of the same act requires that a utility company executing road works shall, in reinstating the road, comply with such requirements as may be prescribed as to the specification of materials to be used and the standards of workmanship to be observed. Failure to comply with section 130 is an offence which, on summary conviction, is liable to a fine not exceeding level 3 (&#163;1,000) on the standard scale.</p>

  <p>One component of the &#163;3 million Healthy Respect national health demonstration project seeks to increase awareness of chlamydia among young people and to pilot accessible chlamydia testing opportunities in a range of non-medical settings. Its short-term aim is to get a true picture of the problem in Lothian, by 2003, through greater awareness and more accurate reporting. Its longer-term target is to decrease reported prevalence by 50% by 2010. Lessons learned will be shared throughout Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Executive is also funding two studies, due to conclude later this year, which will inform any plans to take forward opportunistic screening for chlamydia infection in certain targeted groups.</p>

  <p>The initiatives undertaken by HEBS and NHS Boards in the sexual health field will also contribute to the aim of reducing the incidence of chlamydia.</p>

  <p>Individuals and businesses are required to comply with the Environmental Protection Act 1990 which prohibits statutory nuisances, including the emission of noise, that are prejudicial to health or a nuisance. Where a business is found to be in breach of the legislation, a notice requiring them to abate or cease such a nuisance can be served. The costs, if any, of complying with any such notice are normally a matter for the business concerned although the business, in negotiation with the enforcement officer, can negotiate a suitable timetable for the completion of the work required.</p>

  <p>However, if the costs are part of a wider business development proposal there may be local sources of funding available. It would be in the interests of small businesses to make contact with the Small Business Gateway in the Scottish Enterprise area or the Local Enterprise Company in the Highlands and Islands to investigate what assistance is available in their individual circumstances. Assistance can be provided in a number of ways but it is not automatic and will depend on the specific support criteria and whether the project is commercially viable.</p>
