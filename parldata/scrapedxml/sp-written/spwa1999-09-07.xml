  <p>It is essential that scientific information is available on the environmental effects of genetically modified crops before decisions are taken on wider use. It is important that full information is obtained on the effects of genetically modified crops under Scottish conditions, which can be very different from elsewhere in the UK. Sound future policy cannot be formulated without this information.</p>

  <p>The Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE) has advised that the information from decades of experience with producing seeds to specific purity levels can be used to estimate the level of cross pollination which is likely to occur between crops in adjacent fields at specific distances. It is not possible, however, to guarantee absolutely that no cross pollination will occur, even with very large separation distances, although the amount of cross pollination decreases rapidly with distance.</p>

  <p>All crops in the farm-scale evaluations are being grown in accordance with the SCIMAC (Supply Chain Initiative on Modified Agricultural Crops) Code of Practice and Guidelines. The guidelines set out proposed separation distances between GM and non-GM crops and are based on internationally recognised criteria for ensuring high purity in seed production.</p>

  <p>The Intervention Board Executive Agency, whose Board answers to all the UK Agriculture Ministers, which runs the Over Thirty Month Scheme, is responsible for arranging the disposal of the rendered material from the cull.</p>

  <p>The Board has awarded contracts to three companies, and is in negotiation with two others, to incinerate rendered material from the cull.</p>

  <p>The Board also has contracts in place to incinerate direct carcases slaughtered under the Scheme. In Scotland, the Board currently has contracts with Orkney Islands Council, the Scottish Agricultural College, Matheson Jess Sacone Ltd, Dundas Chemical Co, Wescot Hides Ltd and Hamilton (Irvine) Ltd.

  <p>The Intervention Board Executive Agency, whose Board answers to all the UK Agriculture Ministers, which runs the Over Thirty Month Scheme, is responsible for the disposal of rendered material produced under it. EU regulations require the material to be destroyed. The Board has incineration contracts with three companies. One of these contracts is currently operational and the other two are due to come on stream next year. In addition, the Board is currently in negotiation with two further companies.</p>

  <p>Some carcases from animals slaughtered under the Scheme are incinerated direct.</p>

  <p>The Board estimate that cost of disposing of the remaining material currently stored in Scotland is approximately &pound;7.1m. This equates to around &pound;98.50 per tonne and includes storage, transportation, final incineration and ash disposal to landfill.</p>

  <p>In Scotland, 72,100 tonnes of rendered material is currently held in storage. None of this material has yet been consigned for destruction. The Intervention Board Executive Agency, whose Board answers to all the UK Agriculture Ministers, intends to dispose of the material by incineration. Some 2,800 tonnes of tallow, one of the by-products of the rendering process, has been burnt on-site in Scotland for energy recovery purposes.</p>

  <p>Since intervention purchasing recommenced in March 1996 intervention beef has been held, in up to 7 cold stores, located in Scotland. The quantities held in store on the first day of each month and their average book value as declared to the European Commission, since then up to 1 August 1999 are given below. In addition there was a small quantity of around 150 tonnes pre 1996 stock of intervention beef held in Scotland. This was incinerated at the European Commission&#146;s instruction.</p>

  <p>Payment arrangements are a matter between local authorities and individual suppliers. However, we encourage local authorities to pay their bills promptly.</p>

  <p>The Accounts Commission publishes annual comparative information on local authorities&#146; performance in making payments within agreed timescales. The Late Payment of Debt (Interest) Act 1998, which gives small businesses the right to claim interest for the late payment of debt from larger companies and public bodies, should also lead local authorities and other agencies to improve their payment practice. Finally, under Best Value, the Scottish Executive is encouraging local authorities to set performance targets for a wide range of services including for the prompt payment of bills.</p>

  <p>Sportscotland is setting up arrangements for monitoring the implementation of Sport 21 and will ensure that the interests of all recognised sports are considered as part of that process. I will be playing an active part in the monitoring arrangements.</p>

  <p>Initiatives such as &quot;Overground&quot;, based upon co-operation and partnership, are key to the delivery of better bus services. We shall bringing forward, later this session, legislation to encourage development of more Quality Partnerships. We want local authorities to pursue these against the background of their local transport strategies so that bus service provision can be properly integrated within overall transport policies. Better infrastructure and better quality buses can lead to more frequent services and increased patronage. I expect that our forthcoming decisions on authorities&#146; bids for public transport fund support will encourage bus operators across Scotland to deliver similar improvements. <br /></p>
