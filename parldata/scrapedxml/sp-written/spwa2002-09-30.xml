  <p>As a reserved policy area, links with the EU institutions are co-ordinated by the Home Office, on behalf of all UK administrations. We place high priority on working with our European partners to tackle the drug problems we share by, for example, exchanging information on best practice.</p>

  <p>In 2000, the EU Council of Ministers agreed to the adoption of the EU Action Plan on Drugs as a mechanism to implement the EU Drug Strategy (2000-04). The plan sets out a range of actions to be taken by the EU to reduce the damage caused to health and to society by drug misuse and associated crime. Objectives fall within four main areas: prevention of drug misuse, particularly among young people; improved treatment of drug misusers; reducing drug trafficking and the availability of drugs, and international co-operation, with particular focus on countries applying to join the EU, and those areas which either produce illegal drugs, or which are on transit routes for drugs bound for Europe.</p>

  <p>Our Drugs Strategy and Action Plan for Scotland are consistent with these objectives.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive responded formally to Justice 2 Committee regarding petition P333 on 26 July 2001. This confirmed that the Scottish Executive do not accept the view expressed by the petitioner that the law regarding the celebration of marriage in Scotland is not compliant with the European Convention on Human Rights. The Scottish Executive response pointed out that there is nothing to prevent a humanist or other ceremony supplementing the legal procedure undertaken by a registrar. In addition, the Scottish Executive undertook to review the position once the then proposed Marriage (Scotland) Bill had been enacted and operational for a suitable period. The new arrangements under the Marriage (Scotland) Act 2002 and associated regulations came fully into effect on 10 June 2002. These permit civil marriages to be carried out by registrars in places that are approved by Scottish local authorities. The Scottish Executive still intend, as was indicated in the response to PE333, to review matters once the 2002 act has been operational for a suitable period.</p>

HEBS is also supporting 15 small projects aimed at young men across Scotland through its Scottish Mental Health Week Small Projects Award Scheme 2002 and is running a seminar during Scottish Mental Health Week called Men and Mental Health.</p>

  <p>The National Programme for Improving the Mental Health and Well-being of the Scottish Population, established in October 2001 and overseen by a National Advisory Group, (NAG) which I chair, is developing a range of initiatives to make progress on this vital component of our health improvement agenda. The programme&#8217;s main objectives include raising awareness of mental health issues, promoting positive mental health, and the effective prevention of mental health problems. It links into initiatives both within and outwith the Executive, for example in the social justice, education and employment fields, to maximise the potential for mental health gain. This broad ranging approach is reflected in the membership of the NAG, which includes health, local authority, community, business, trades union and voluntary interests. An initial focus of the work is on early years, children and young people, workplace and communities.</p>

  <p>With initial funding of &#163;4 million, current projects include an National Anti-Stigma Campaign which will be launched in October; the Breathing Space Helpline for people with low mood and depression, especially among young men; the Framework for the Prevention of Suicide and Self Harm, and a public attitude survey on mental health. Other initiatives include the development of a range of public mental health indicators; the establishment of a Public Mental Health/Mental Health Improvement library of evidence and practice, and a national project to help improve the mental health and well-being of communities and to support local community effort and capacity. A magazine <em>Well?</em> describing the aims of the programme has been issued widely and a copy has been placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 24027).</p>

  <p>There are a number of measures in place to ensure that prescribers have access to information about the safe and effective use of medicines. Importantly, the Medicines Control Agency (MCA), the UK medicines regulatory authority, is responsible for the safety, quality and efficacy of medicines available on the UK market. The MCA, and its expert Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM), continuously monitor the safety of medicines. Through the MCA/CSM, health care professionals are alerted to problems with medicines and provided with advice on the ways medicines can be used more safely. Further information can be found on the MCA's website www.mca.gov.uk.</p>

  <p>The British National Formulary (BNF), issued free to doctors and pharmacists, provides advice about the prescription of anti-depressants and analgesics. The BNF information reflects safety concerns and shifts in clinical practice. In addition, the product information for medicines, produced by the manufacturers and authorised by the Licensing Authority, includes relevant safety information.</p>

  <p>Anti-depressant and analgesic prescribing are areas regularly reviewed by NHS board/Primary Care Trust Prescribing Advisers, who receive monthly reports of prescribing data by GP practice. These reports are an important source of information for evaluating the use of medicines. Individual GPs and practices receive quarterly Scottish Prescribing Analysis (SPA) reports, which cover anti-depressants and analgesics. NHS boards and trusts also have access to Drug and Therapeutic Committee advice on the safe use of medicines.</p>

  <p>In relation to anti-depressant prescribing, <em>Clinical Evidence</em>, a compendium of best available evidence in health care, has been distributed to health care professionals throughout Scotland and includes guidance on the effectiveness of some drug treatments for depression. As with all medicines, the decision whether or not to prescribe a treatment for an individual patient depends on the clinical judgement of the doctor concerned, in consultation with the patient and bearing in mind the risks and benefits of the treatment.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what considerations it has given to any pressure on the nursing workforce as a result of (a) the establishment of nurse-led clinics, (b) increasing the responsibilities of nurses to enable them to write prescriptions, (c) any specialisation within the nursing profession and (d) proposals for one nurse on each ward to become a &quot;cleanliness champion&quot;.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-09-30.S1W-29332.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80216" speakername="Mrs Mary Mulligan" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0930.htm#18">

  <p>We are taking positive steps on a number of fronts to increase capacity, enhance career development opportunities and retain the current nursing workforce.</p>

  <p><em>Facing the Future, the Report of the National Convention on Recruitment and Retention in Nursing and Midwifery</em>, identified the need to make an explicit connection between supply and demand, planning and distribution and the mix and diversity of nurses and midwives. In partnership, we are working to ensure that career development opportunities within Scotland are fostered and expanded.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is also committed to recruiting more nurses in NHSScotland. Over the next five years 10,000 more nurses and midwives will qualify in Scotland, 1,500 more than previously planned and a raft of other initiatives have been put in place to ensure that NHSScotland recruits and retains the number of nurses it needs.</p>

  <p>Like other health care professionals, nurses and midwives want to take the opportunity for personal and professional development to enable NHSScotland to meet the demands of developing more flexible, needs-driven services in partnership with the public and fellow health professionals including innovative approaches to care. Support for staff to do so is provided through appropriate educational opportunities and through workforce planning so that individuals can follow career opportunities.</p>

  <p>Nurses and midwives themselves seek opportunities to establish nurse-led clinics focussing on the delivery of patient centred care. The benefits for nurses include the opportunity to expand their skills and knowledge, being able to take autonomous clinical decisions and enabling patients to experience a smooth transition through their pathway of care. When developing nurse-led clinics it is important that cognisance is taken of the implications of changes to workload within the wider multi professional team. As part of the new arrangements set out in <em>Working for Health</em>, the workforce development action plan for NHSScotland, workforce officers will have local responsibility in their NHS board for ensuring that effective integration of service planning and workforce development takes place at trust and board level in order that services can be delivered in the most appropriate way.</p>

  <p>Nurses have been at the forefront of seeking the opportunity to prescribe as part of the care they provide in the areas of minor ailments, minor injuries, health promotion and palliative care. Appropriate training is being provided and will ensure that nurse prescribing brings real benefits in terms of access to care for patients.</p>

  <p>Some nurses seek to develop a specialist role within a given clinical field. A specialist nurse will have successfully completed a post qualification course of study in a specific clinical field and be able to apply a level of judgement, discretion and decision making in clinical care to improve the quality of patient care, meet the needs of patients within the speciality and in the specific area of practice. The development of these roles also requires a workforce development approach.</p>

  <p>The role of cleanliness &quot;champions&quot; has been planned in partnership with NHS boards and trusts to ensure that it fits with the clinical environment and existing infection control structures with appropriate support mechanisms being put in place. An education programme is currently being developed by NHS Education for Scotland, which will ensure that individual nurses are well prepared for the role.</p>

  <p>The statement referred to relates to the costs of monitoring contracts. All contracts have to be monitored whether they are PPP contracts or conventional contracts. There are sound reasons for doing this, not least to ensure propriety and value for money. There is a cost attached to this. It is not possible to provide specific examples as contract monitoring costs are not separately identified in conventional contracts.</p>

  <p>There are mechanisms in place under the terms of the current franchise to enable passengers to receive compensation from train operating companies who cancel train services. Where the cancellation is due to action taken by Railtrack, the train operating company can seek compensation from Railtrack.</p>

  <p>In this particular case, Railtrack decided to close the Edinburgh to Glasgow line at Falkirk on safety grounds following a fire on land adjacent to the railway but owned by a third party. Railtrack may therefore wish to seek compensation for the losses incurred from that third party.</p>

  <p>The Directions and Guidance issued to the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) on 28 June 2002 for the next Scottish Passenger Rail Franchise require the SRA to develop, among other things, a franchise which will endeavour to improve passenger compensation.</p>

  <p>Following previous exchanges of correspondence with the Inland Revenue on taxation issues, I wrote to HM Treasury on 9 August 2002 seeking a tax concession which would allow the ex-gratia payments to be made as tax-free lump sum payments. HM Treasury replied on 20 September 2002 confirming their view that there was no case for special treatment.</p>

  <p>The first tranche of payments was calculated as &#163;3.90 per &#163; of pension or pension entitlement at 1993 levels. The total to be paid out in this tranche, assuming that all the details on the database are correct, is approximately 80% of the &#163;118 million then available for distribution. Since the calculations were made for the first tranche of payments we have secured an additional &#163;8 million for distribution to beneficiaries, and the second tranche will distribute the balance of the &#163;126 million now available.</p>

  <p>Our intention was to select a small basket of indicators that would help us measure whether we are closing the gap between deprived areas and the rest of Scotland. The indicators were chosen from existing Executive portfolio and Social Justice targets, because they relate to the achievement of specific outcomes, are relevant for monitoring area-based deprivation relevant to the national average and because the necessary data will be available at local area level for the baseline year of 2003-04.</p>

  <p>Spending on a wide range of Executive programmes will impact on the jobs indicators of target 3 of the social justice section of <em> Building a Better Scotland</em> . Some of the Executive&#8217;s spending plans will have a direct effect. For example, we will spend an additional &#163;20 million from 2004 to help people in deprived communities through child care. Other spending plans will have a less direct, but nevertheless important effect.

  <p>After publishing the Executive&#8217;s proposals in <em>Assessing our children&#8217;s needs: The Way Forward?</em> (Bib. Number 19469), further consultation seminars and focus groups were held with service providers and users of the Record of Needs system. A draft bill is now being prepared, taking account of the outcome of the consultation, and we expect to publish the draft bill early next year.</p>

  <p>UK Sport has no role specific to Scotland. It is responsible for fostering, supporting and encouraging the development of sport and physical recreation in the UK as a whole with a particular focus on the Olympic sports (which are organised on a GB/UK basis) and the achievement of excellence. Its functions include support for GB/UK governing bodies of sport and governing body modernisation; advice on policies and practices on anti-doping and other ethical and equity issues, and it provides the central services for the UK Sports Institute. For these purposes, it receives annual grant-in-aid from DCMS. It is also a distributor for part of the Lottery Sports Fund, operating the World Class Performance Programme and the UK Major Events Programme.</p>

The first of the Inquiry&#8217;s reports to include Scottish data &quot;Safer Services&quot; was published in 2001.
