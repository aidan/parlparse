  <p>The Scottish Office has produced key documents in a number of formats including Braille, large print, audio and sign language video formats. It is expected that this practice will continue under the Scottish Executive. We will also be taking into account the commitments required to meet the needs of disabled people contained in the Disability Discrimination Act.</p>

  <p>As the proposed Glasgow Southern Orbital road (GSO) needs a safe and reliable link with the existing A77 trunk road, or with any upgraded M77/A77 which might replace it, implementation of the GSO proposals is linked to decisions on the A77. A proposed upgrading to motorway of the A77 is one of the major road improvement schemes included in the Strategic Roads Review. As I indicated on 24 June, we expect to report to Parliament on the Review after the summer recess.</p>

  <p>Plans for the section of road between Arisaig and Kinsadel are being considered within the Strategic Roads Review. My answer to Mr Tosh on 24 June provides the information on progress of the Review. We have no plans to upgrade the section of road between Loch Nan Uamh to Arisaig. <br /> <br /></p>

  <p>A figure for contingency, which includes daywork allowance, is built into the total building cost estimate of &pound;109 million and is commercially confidential. Individual works packages are each allocated a budget to cover all of the costs associated with the package, including provisional sums. These cannot be separately identified until &#145;invitations to tender&#146; are issued for each works package.</p>

  <p>The Parliament voted on 17 June to continue the Holyrood Project with an increased construction cost estimate of &pound;62 million. This meant that no savings would have to be made by a lowering of the standard of materials to be used or otherwise, and that accommodation for the additional staff previously identified could be provided.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer whether any of the contracts awarded for the Holyrood Project impose obligations upon the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to pay compensation for loss of work and breach of faith, and what advice did the SPCB take in relation to any court action in relation to loss of work or breach of faith being successful, in the event of the project being abandoned.</p>

  <p>The contract conditions, which are standard to the construction industry, do not impose specific obligations to pay compensation for loss of work or breach of faith. Professional appointments and other contractors could however raise court actions for breach of contract which might include claims for damages related to loss of work and any other consequential losses. Legal advice was taken on the potential for such claims and related architectural and construction industry practices. <br /> <br /></p>
