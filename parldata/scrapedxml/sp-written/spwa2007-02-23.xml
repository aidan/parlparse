  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how much funding it estimates will be available under the new Scottish Rural Development Programme (SRDP); whether there will be as much funding provided for crofting communities under the programme as there was under the Crofting Community Development Scheme (CCDS); whether it will provide estimates of the amount which will be available for those parts of Scotland which were eligible to make applications under the CCDS, and whether it will submit any application for structural funding in this connection.</p>

  <p>Scotland has been allocated approximately &pound;240 million from the EU over the 2007-13 period. In addition, there will be money from the Scottish Executive &ndash; which will provide the majority of the funding &ndash; and subject to agreement with the EU, receipts from voluntary modulation. I am unable to confirm these amounts at this stage because they will both depend on the outcome of on-going negotiations in Brussels on the voluntary modulation regulation.</p>

  <p>As with the SRDP, the structural funds programme for 2007-13 is still to be finalised with the Commission. However, dedicated funds will be available for the Highlands and Islands, under the European Regional Development Fund and the European Structural Fund, to support a range of economic, social and community development projects. These funds will be available for all relevant projects to bid into.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the four EU regions, Catalonia, Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg, Lombardy and Rh&ocirc;ne Alpes, which have signed an economic co-operation agreement known as the &quot;Four Motors for Europe&quot; have invited Scotland to be involved, or attend any of their events as an observer, as they have done for Wales and Flanders.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive supported the Multi-Regional International Business Programme from 2002-05. This exchange programme for business undergraduates was an initiative of the &quot;Four Motors for Europe&quot; network. Scottish involvement arose from the Co-operation Agreement between Catalonia and Scotland and our view continues to be that bilateral work is the most effective use of our resources.</p>

  <p>NHS Lanarkshire has submitted its Programme Initial Agreement document, An Investment Framework for Improving Health Services in Lanarkshire, for consideration and approval by the Health Department Capital Investment Group in due course. This document sets out NHS Lanarkshire&rsquo;s planned developments for acute, community, and primary care premises over the years 2007 to 2014 and provides a strategic context for individual business cases for implementing these plans.</p>

  <p>Detailed proposals for the individual hospital developments will be developed through the business case process, the timetable for which is set out in the Programme Initial Agreement.I have arranged for NHS Lanarkshire&rsquo;s Programme Initial Agreement paper to be lodged with the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 41995).</p>
