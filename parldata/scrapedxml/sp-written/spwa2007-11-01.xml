  <p>The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service is responsible for the prosecution of crime in Scotland and does so in the public interest.</p>

  <p>Recently published figures show that procurators fiscal have taken action in 92% of cases which involve alleged alcohol consumption in public places. The action which can be taken in each case includes issuing a warning, a fiscal fine or taking criminal proceedings in court. The Procurator Fiscal will decide on the appropriate action having considered the circumstances of the particular case as well as the wider public interest such as the concerns of the local community.</p>

  <p>Class formation is a matter for local authorities. Class size maxima of 30 were introduced in primary 1 to primary 3 by The Education (Lower Primary Class Sizes) (Scotland) Regulations 1999. Regulation 3 of these regulations allows a class of over 30 pupils provided a ratio of 30 pupils per teacher is maintained. In extremis this would allow classes of 60 provided there were two teachers. The degree of flexibility that will be permissible in meeting our manifesto commitments is a matter that will be discussed with local authorities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to doing more to empower individuals and communities to have more control over their own lives and more choice in how their needs are met. To this end, we are holding a series of meetings with a range of stakeholders who have a particular expertise in empowering communities, local community activists and community planning partners with a view to developing practical proposals. We are also considering how best to develop the role of community councils. This will include identifying pilots for supporting them to play a greater role in community planning and also for allowing them to have some control over existing spending in their area to meet specific local priorities.</p>

  <p>Scottish Executive funding to tackle antisocial behaviour is supporting community wardens in every local authority area in Scotland. It is for each local authority to decide how best to allocate funding across all their antisocial behaviour services, including community wardens, based on local needs and priorities. Future funding for antisocial behaviour services is being considered as part of the spending review.</p>

  <p>I understand that Inverness College recently submitted to the Scottish Funding Council (SFC) an outline business case for funding to support its relocation to a greenfield site and that a decision will hopefully be made in January.</p>

  <p>College funding decisions are a matter for the funding council and not ministers. However, our decision to provide an extra &pound;100 million to support college and university estates shows how serious we are about providing the resources to create world-class buildings and facilities. &pound;60 million of that support is for colleges which we understand from the SFC will mean that the Inverness College plans can be advanced during the Spending Review 2007-10 period.</p>

  <p>1. Allocations to Highland Council to tackle homelessness over each of the last two financial years includes specific grant funding from the Scottish Government in the form of the amalgamated Tackling and Preventing Homelessness Fund from 2007-08 (previously the Homelessness Task Force and Furnished Tenancies Grant) and the allocations were as follows:</p>

  <p>2. The progress report and local outcome agreement received by the Scottish Government Homelessness Division from Highland Council for 2006-07 indicates a number of partnerships with a variety of local agencies in delivering local homelessness services and that a number of different funding streams are sourced in implementing these services in addition to the Tackling and Preventing Homelessness Grant.</p>

  <p>3. Highland Council also receives general funding allocated through the core local government finance settlement. It should be noted however that the general provision does not represent actual funding but is used as a means of distributing the core local government finance settlement. The general provision in the core settlement includes Tackling and Preventing Homelessness (formerly Rough Sleepers Initiative) and General Homelessness.

  <p>The Scottish Government has produced a Code of Guidance on Homelessness to which all local authorities must have regard when carrying out their duties. The code is available on the government&rsquo;s website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/housing/homeless/guidance" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/housing/homeless/guidance</a> .</p>

  <p>Local authorities have flexibilities in how they discharge the duty to provide temporary and permanent accommodation for homeless people but, in respect of temporary accommodation, they must adhere to the Homeless Persons (Unsuitable Accommodation) (Scotland) Order 2004. This order sets out standards which temporary accommodation for homeless households with children and pregnant women must meet.</p>

  <p>Such accommodation must provide adequate bedrooms and adequate toilet and personal washing facilities for the exclusive use of the household. Adequate cooking facilities must also be provided. The code indicates that these facilities must meet the local authority&rsquo;s houses of multiple occupation standards.</p>

  <p>This requirement relates to any accommodation used for this purpose &ndash; not just houses of multiple occupation.</p>

  <p>Other houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) must be licensed with the appropriate local authority. Before granting an HMO licence, the local authority will inspect the property to ensure that it is safe and that the accommodation is appropriate for the proposed number of tenants.

  <p>In setting up culture and leisure trusts, local authorities are expected to ensure clear public accountability for public funds and the quality of local services, in keeping with the statutory principles of Best Value, regardless of whether they provide these services directly or set up and fund external bodies to do so. Decisions by councils about how and by whom local services are delivered and sustained are subject to scrutiny by the Accounts Commission for Scotland.</p>

  <p>To the extent that trusts have been established with charitable status, the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator has a role in monitoring their compliance with the requirements of the Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005, which places a duty on Charity Trustees to act in the best interest of the charity, and to operate in a manner consistent with the charity&rsquo;s purposes.</p>

  <p>The regulation of veterinary medicines within the UK is a reserved matter and the responsibility of the Veterinary Medicines Directorate. The Scottish Government has therefore not given direction to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) on mutual recognition.</p>

  <p>The role of SEPA with regard to veterinary medicines for fish is to consider their environmental impact. SEPA minimises this by issuing discharge consents to Scottish aquaculture businesses which restrict usage to that which can be assimilated without significant detriment to the locality.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has a close working relationship with SEPA. Discussions take place during which SEPA explains its views and their underpinning science.</p>

  <p>Where there is a need for a veterinary medicine which has a full marketing authorisation in another member state the Scottish Government encourages the company concerned to apply to the Veterinary Medicines Directorate for mutual recognition.</p>

  <p>We will be working with our stakeholders and delivery partners to fully implement the conclusions of the modern apprenticeship consultation. As this will likely involve changes to the delivery infrastructure, the new skills body (who will have operational responsibility for the delivery of the modern apprenticeship programme) will be leading on this work. I therefore anticipate this to start as soon as the new body has been established.</p>

  <p>The regulation of employment rights is reserved under section H1 of the Scotland Act 1998.</p>

  <p>Terms and conditions of employment are a discretionary matter for employers, providing they comply with any relevant statutory requirements.</p>

  <p>In addition, I would point out that the Christmas Day and New Year&rsquo;s Day Trading (Scotland) Act 2007 does not protect shop workers and retail staff from being compelled to work. It deals only with the opening of large stores. Nothing in that legislation would prevent staff being required to work on a closed day to prepare for the next trading day. So even if ministers were to pursue a ban under the act on large stores trading on New Year&rsquo;s Day, it would not necessarily protect shop workers.</p>

  <p>We will announce our proposals for removing or reducing business rates for small businesses in Scotland following the Scottish Spending Review. Our proposals can be implemented as part of the annual programme of secondary legislation for non-domestic rates and will not impose new regulatory burdens compared with the current small business rate relief scheme. Our proposals will also substantially benefit small and medium-sized businesses. In the circumstances, we do not consider that a regulatory impact assessment is required.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s response to the snaring consultation, initiated by the previous administration, will be issued in due course, in accordance with the priorities of the Scottish Government in this area. We are well aware of the sensitivities surrounding this issue and the fact that snaring is considered an essential tool by land managers. Our proposals will be carefully considered and will take account of the strong views expressed on all sides of this debate.</p>
