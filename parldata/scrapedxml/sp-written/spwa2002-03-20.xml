  <p>The Scottish Executive has taken action, in the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001, to extend the legislative remedies available through the introduction of "probationary" tenancies (a special variant of the short Scottish secure tenancy) and by suspending the right to buy for any tenants subject to recovery procedures. It also plans to use the forthcoming Criminal Justice Bill to introduce Anti-Social Behaviour Orders.</p>

  <p>The Executive's intention is to move to a position where all staff in centres providing childcare and early education for pre-school children either hold an appropriate qualification, are seeking accreditation of skills and experience, or are pursuing on-the-job-training. The Scottish Social Services Council will be responsible for taking much of this forward in due course.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, from 1 April 2002, the Commission for the Regulation of Care will be expected to require that all managers should be qualified in childcare, teaching or social work and as a minimum, at least half of the staff in any one facility should be qualified in childcare. "Qualified in childcare" is defined as holding any one of the qualifications mentioned in <em>Working With Children</em>.</p>

  <p>2. Seizures from joint operations involving HM Customs and Excise and the police are generally recorded by HM Customs and Excise.</p>

  <p>3. Seizures made by the Scottish Crime Squad are recorded by the appropriate police force.</p>

  <p>4. As a seizure can involve more than one drug, figures for individual drugs cannot be added to produce totals.</p>

  <p>Persons with a charge proved in Scottish courts where the main offence was a drugs offence, by police force area and drug type, 1998-2000.</p>

  <p>Enforcement bodies are continuing their efforts to reduce the illicit availability of drugs, and seizures of benzodiazepines, including diazepam, have increased throughout the 1990s.</p>

  <p>The UK Health Departments' <em>Drug misuse and Dependence-Guidelines on Clinical Management</em> set out guidance for clinicians on the prescribing of diazepam, including patient monitoring, checking for signs of polydrug misuse and liaison with dispensing pharmacists. The procedures are intended to reduce the risks to patients.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer given to question S1W-23846 today.</p>

  <p>Sources of diazepam include sold or stolen prescriptions and illegal imports. The number of seizures of benzodiazepines across Scotland was higher in 1999 (663) than in 1998 (647). The reclassification earlier this year of diazepam from Schedule 4 part II (Misuse of Drugs Regulations 1985) to a revised Schedule 4 Part I (Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001) makes it an offence to possess diazepam without a prescription, which will help the police in reducing diversion of the drug.</p>

  <p>Clinicians can prescribe diazepam to illicit drug users under a long-term benzodiazepine withdrawal programme, and guidance is set out in <em>Drug misuse and Dependence-guidelines on Clinical Management</em>.</p>

  <p>Practical assistance with proposals for the European Framework Programmes is provided by Innovation Relay Centres (IRC) Scotland. IRCs in Scotland are jointly funded by the European Commission and Scottish Enterprise, and work with Scottish universities and SMEs providing assistance and advice on the preparation of proposals for the programmes. The IRCs also help find suitable collaborative partners for proposals and encourage universities to partner with Scottish companies.</p>

  <p>A Scottish FP6 Focus Group has been formed by the Scottish Executive with representation from Scottish Enterprise, Highlands and Islands Enterprise, Scotland Europa, Scottish Enterprise Cluster Teams and Innovation Relay Centres Scotland. The aim of the focus group is to develop and implement a Scottish framework for FP6 promotion and support in order to maximise Scottish involvement in FP6 projects. Scottish universities are one of a number of organisations who are expected to benefit from this initiative.</p>

  <p>There is no formal relationship between Strathclyde European Partnership and Saxony-Anhalt. Officials in Saxony-Anhalt have approached a number of other regional bodies, including Strathclyde European Partnership, with a view to developing an application, under INTERREG III C, on the themes of Innovation and the Information Society. The proposal is at a very early stage. The Scottish Executive has had no involvement in this development to date.</p>

  <p>During 2002-03, the Health Education Board for Scotland's <strong>(</strong> HEBS') approach to coronary heart disease (CHD) prevention will continue to be through programmes focussing on behavioural aspects such as stopping smoking and promoting physical activity and healthy eating. One of the main strands of this activity will be a continuation of the award-winning "Big 3" (CHD, cancer and stroke) advertising campaign, encouraging adults to think about making small changes in their lifestyle, which are easy to achieve, easy to maintain and can have such a beneficial impact on their health. HEBS will continue to track and monitor these adverts and develop programmes as appropriate, using both qualitative and quantitative research. NHS boards are key partners for all HEBS work.</p>

  <p>During the course of the next financial year, HEBS estimate that expenditure on CHD/cancer and stroke will be in excess of &#163;1.5 million.</p>

  <p>The Public Health Institute for Scotland's remit does not extend to the design and delivery of health promotion campaigns. It will, however, be creating a Scotland-wide learning network on heart health during 2002.</p>

  <p>Clinical guidelines are prepared by expert working groups, who use the best available definitions of a given condition world-wide. Such definitions are usually prepared by professional bodies, though the World Health Organisation (WHO) issues a publication called International Classification of Diseases (ICD) which is regularly revised.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network guideline on <em>Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorders in Children and Young People</em>, published in June 2001, gives detailed advice on the definition, diagnosis and treatment of these conditions, informed by more than 150 publications, including the WHO classification.</p>

  <p>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a complex condition which has been the subject of a considerable body research world-wide. While there is evidence that the condition may have an organic basis and that there could be a genetic contribution, there is no definitive proof that these are the only factors.</p>

  <p>The Department of Health maintains a National Research Register, with details of all on-going and recent research into a wide variety of medical conditions, including ADHD. This is available on regularly updated CD-ROM in the Parliament's Reference Centre and online at:</p>

  <p>In deciding whether to prescribe methylphenidate, for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD), clinicians would be expected to take account of advice and guidance about the drug, including the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) Guideline 52 on ADHD and the advice issued by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence in October 2000.</p>

  <p>The National Research Register (NRR), records two recently completed research projects on side effects and long-term effects to children who have taken methylphenidate.

  <p>The National Cultural Strategy committed the Executive to initiate a national audit of collections in museums and galleries, beginning with the industrial museums. Resources of &#163;250,000 were made available for the audit and an interim report was published in October 2001. In addition, a Strategic Change Fund of &#163;3 million over three years was announced for the sector. In December 2000, the Executive allocated &#163;1.26 million of this fund over three years towards the running costs of the Scottish Fisheries Museum, the Scottish Maritime Museum and the Scottish Mining Museum in recognition of their financial difficulties. A condition of the package was that the local authorities involved would maintain their level of support over the same three-year period. The three industrial museums were accepted as museums of national importance on the strength of evidence from a number of independent studies and expert advice from the National Museums of Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has awarded an increase in funding of &#163;850,000 over the three years 2001-02 to 2003-04 to the Scottish Museums Council. The Scottish Museums Council has made a bid to the Executive for additional funding for ICT development to enable them to provide more support for the non-national museum sector.</p>

  <p>We have received representations on funding from six individual non-national museums.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is responsible for the National Museums and Galleries; the responsibility for non-national museums rests with local agencies and local authorities, which have statutory responsibility to provide cultural facilities for the residents in their areas.</p>

  <p>The following table shows the number of beds per 1,000 population, in each NHS board area in the years 2000 and 2001. It is not meaningful to make comparisons between individual boards, because these figures do not take account of differences in the underlying healthcare needs of the population living in different NHS board areas, nor do they take account of the extent to which hospitals in one area may treat patients from neighbouring NHS board areas.</p>

  <p>An audit of NHS trusts, conducted in December last year, revealed restrictions to a very small number of out-patient waiting lists. The following list gives names of NHS trusts which identified waiting lists for psychological services which had been closed:</p>

  <p>Lothian Primary Care NHS Trust;</p>

  <p>Lanarkshire Primary Care NHS Trust;</p>

  <p>Lomond and Argyll Primary Care NHS Trust, and</p>

  <p>Renfrewshire and Inverclyde Primary Care NHS Trust.</p>

  <p>Following the audit, the Chief Executive of NHSScotland and the Chief Medical Officer issued guidance to the Health Service in Scotland instructing NHS Chief Executives to ensure that no patient who has been referred for assessment, or treatment, is refused admission to an appropriate waiting list.</p>

  <p>The Accountant in Bankruptcy will become an Executive Agency of the Scottish Executive on 2 April 2002. In many ways the office already operates along agency principles and there will be no change to the statutory functions of the Accountant in Bankruptcy or to his status as an independent statutory officer.</p>

  <p>This change will clarify the accountability of the office to both the Scottish Parliament and to Scottish ministers. It will also formalise relationships between the office and the other parts of the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>The provision of pre-school education in rural areas is the responsibility of local authorities, working with partner providers in the private and voluntary sector. To take account of the additional cost of pre-school provision in rural areas, the pre-school education grant, which from April 2002 will be re-integrated into the local government settlement, includes a rural weighting. For 2002-03, this rural weighting will be worth &#163;6.4 million.</p>

  <p>Families are not provided with additional resources to obtain part-time pre-school education places for three- and four-year-olds, since from 1 April 2002, local authorities in all areas of the country will be under a duty to secure these places at no cost to the parent or guardian.</p>

  <p>The Executive encourages the identification and dissemination of good practice, in meeting the need for pre-school provision in rural areas. The Executive is therefore funding two themes of Children in Scotland's programme Growing Up in Rural Scotland. This programme includes a series of seminars which are intended to assist local authorities, childcare partnerships, pre-school providers and other organisations in providing quality pre-school education in rural areas.</p>

  <p>Once the new escorting contract is in place, the posts of those SPS staff who are currently involved in escorting prisoners will no longer be required by SPS, for that purpose. Some staff are scheduled to escorting duties; others have to be drawn from other duties, often at short notice.</p>

  <p>The latter is the main cause of disruption to regimes and routines of prisons, including withdrawing staff from in-prison duties. The new service will mean that the main cause of disruption will cease, allowing these staff to be available for in-prison duties, for all or most of the time.</p>

  <p>I received the final report of MVA's <em>Stirling - Alloa - Kincardine Rail Line Reopening Benefit Study</em> earlier this month. Copies of the report have been placed in the Parliament's Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>The report demonstrates that the project will have significant benefits by reconnecting Alloa to the national rail network; by taking freight trains off the Forth Bridge and improving passenger rail services between Fife and Edinburgh; and by reducing the cost of shipping coal to Longannet Power Station. The report concludes that for both the freight-only and combined passenger and freight options the benefits outweigh the costs.</p>

  <p>I am therefore releasing up to &#163;2 million from Clackmannanshire Council's Public Transport Fund (PTF) award to allow the council and other partners in the project to undertake more detailed costings of the works required; to promote the necessary Parliamentary Order to construct the link, and to put together a funding package to complete the project securing contributions from those who will benefit from the new services.</p>

  <p>This is an important project with strategic benefits for the Scottish rail network. I have therefore asked my officials to work very closely with Clackmannanshire Council, Scottish Enterprise Forth Valley, the Strategic Rail Authority and other partners promoting the project to ensure this project is delivered as early as possible.</p>

  <p>Today's announcement also demonstrates that we are committed to delivering rail infrastructure improvements despite the current difficulties facing Railtrack.</p>

  <p>It is not the Executive's policy to dual the whole length of the A9 between Perth and Inverness, and no recent estimate of the costs has been made. However, a study commissioned in 1993 estimated these costs at &#163;281 million at 1994 prices.</p>

  <p>Thirteen meetings of the Ministerial Committee on Rural Development were held during the period from 1 September 1999 to November 2001: on 1 September, 5 October, and 25 November 1999; 31 January, 13 March, 5 April, 6 September and 8 November 2000; 30 January, 26 March, 14 June, 11 September and 14 November 2001. In January 2002, the name of the committee was changed to the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Rural Development, with the following membership: the Minister for Environment and Rural Development, the Minister for Social Justice, the Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning, the Minister for Finance and Public Services, Deputy Minister for Environment and Rural Development and the Deputy Minister for Tourism Culture and Sport. Details of the membership of Cabinet Sub-Committees are available on the Scottish Executive website. So far this year the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Rural Development has met once, on 5 February 2002.</p>

  <p>All meetings discussed a variety of issues that impact on Rural Development in Scotland.</p>

  <p>As indicated in the <em>Guide to Collective Decision Making</em>, a copy of which is available in the Parliament's Reference Centre (Bib. number 5884) and on the Scottish Executive website, the Executive operates on the basis of collective responsibility and does not disclose details of the internal processes through which decisions have been made. For that reason, the Executive does not normally comment on which ministers attended specific meetings.</p>

It will be the role of these representatives to ensure that the priorities, policies and charging strategy of the authority are consistent with the priorities and policies of its constituent authorities. Opportunity to input on planning and the co-ordination of public transport provision will also arise through the democratic procedures currently in place, through the duty placed on local authorities to consult and the requirements placed on the authority in the 2002 Order to consult widely on its charging strategy.</p>

  <p>The Executive commenced a review of the effectiveness of litter and fly-tipping legislation on 21 February 2002. The review will consider whether the current legislation on litter and fly-tipping is effective and achieving its purpose, and also if it is being fully utilised by local authorities. The views of local authorities, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and other stakeholders are being sought. The review is expected to be completed by mid to late summer.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether current measures allow local authorities to recover the cost of making good the damage done by fly-tipping, the abandoning of a vehicle or other unlawful dumping of rubbish, from the offender and, if so, what assessment has been made of their effectiveness.</p>

  <p>Section 59(8) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, and section 5(1) of the Refuse Disposal (Amenity) Act 1978, provide that local authorities can recover costs from offenders, for dealing with fly-tipped waste and abandoned vehicles respectively.</p>

  <p>Existing legislation regarding litter and fly-tipping is currently the subject of a wide-ranging review, the recommendations of which will be known in late summer. There are no current plans to assess the effectiveness, in terms of cost recovery, of the legislation relevant to abandoned cars.</p>

  <p>The Executive has no such powers. Responsibility for dealing with fly-tipped material, irrespective of the type of land or area, rests with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the local authority in whose area the fly-tipping has taken place.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the implications are for Scotland of the announcement by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on Tuesday 19 March 2002 about competition in the water industry in England and Wales.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-03-20.111.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80155" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0320.htm#49">

  <p>The announcement has no direct bearing on the position in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has also been reviewing its plans to introduce a legislative framework to safeguard public health, the environment and social objectives in a more competitive environment. It has concluded that there remains a need for such a framework. However, further consideration of some complex issues is necessary and as a result the Executive has decided that provisions relating to the framework should not be included in the Water Environment and Water Services Bill that is due to be introduced in May.</p>

  <p>The regulation of international trade is a reserved matter. However, the Scottish Executive is in regular contact with the Department of Trade and Industry on trade issues including negotiations with the World Trade Organisation, and how these may impact on the Executive's responsibilities.</p>
