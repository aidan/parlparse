  <p>The Personal Expenses Allowance (PEA) for care home residents was increased to &#163;17.50 per week last April. Although no specific research was undertaken, this increase was more than the rate of inflation and was in line with both average earnings and the uprating of equivalent sums in benefits. The PEA will be updated again in April 2004.</p>

  <p>Besides the PEA, other resources are available to many residents who are supported by local authorities. These include capital under &#163;11,500, which residents can retain to use as they choose, and a new savings disregard of up to &#163;4.50 per week that the Scottish Executive is proposing for certain older residents from 6 October, in response to the introduction of Pension Credit. The introduction of free personal care also allows certain residents to retain more of their income for personal use.</p>

  <p>The principle of Good Neighbour Declarations has been woven into the funding requirements of the &quot;Building strong, safe and attractive communities funding programme&quot;, where they are referred to as neighbourhood compacts. Local authorities are required to underpin bids with neighbourhood compacts, which set out the standards of behaviour expected of local residents and the support and services delivered by relevant agencies. All local authorities are expected to identify where these neighbourhood compacts will apply. They will be evaluated as part of the funding programme evaluation.</p>

  <p>The agreement <em>A Teaching Profession for the 21st Century</em> provides for an improved and simplified career structure for all teachers. The agreement also provides for local negotiation and enhances the flexibility to determine staffing issues at local level.</p>

  <p>Within the framework of the agreement, it is therefore a matter for local authorities to decide what staffing structures best suit their local needs. However, existing experience suggests that faculty-style departments are already working well in many schools, and can contribute to increasing both the quality of management resources and the teaching resources available within a school. As such, it would be inappropriate for the Scottish Executive to intervene.</p>

  <p>In June 2001 the Department for Education and Skills published a report entitled <em>The Impact of Study Support</em> containing the findings of a longitudinal study carried out by the Quality of Education Centre at the University of Strathclyde.

  <p>Our Partnership Agreement confirms we will evaluate the local pilot projects in order to assess the desirability of creating a national voluntary citizen&#8217;s entitlement card for appropriate public services in Scotland. The Smartcard consortium partners, consisting of 11 local authorities, have been allocated over &#163;5.8 million funding from the second round of the Executive&#8217;s Modernising Government Fund. Under the Dialogue Youth programme, further funding has been allocated to develop a young person&#8217;s version of the card.</p>

  <p>The consortium have appointed a programme manager and put in place a governance structure which will ensure they can assess and report the business case and strategic framework for public sector smartcard applications by June 2004. In addition, the consortium partners are pursuing specific smartcard applications with groups of citizens. Applications include cashless catering in schools, school registration, concessionary fares and access to leisure and library services among others.</p>

  <p>Aberdeen City Council is the first council to roll out the card - initially for concessionary travel and to all students and staff at the council&#39;s secondary schools - and around 35,0000 cards have been issued. Similarly, under the national Dialogue Youth Programme five councils, including Aberdeen, have begun to issue cards to young people; to date some 79,000 cards have been issued.</p>

  <p>The Department for Trade and Industry (DTI) has lead responsibility for all matters related to the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) on behalf of all UK stakeholders as the regulation of international trade is a reserved area. The DTI representatives are fully engaged with current discussions around the Japanese communication to the Council for Trade in Services. Colleagues there will consult with the devolved administrations and other UK government departments as appropriate on any relevant issues that arise during the course of the negotiations. However, since the EC has not and does not intend to make any offer in the area of public sector education services, there can be no impact. GATS has no mandate to equivalise qualifications.</p>

  <p>The new UK General Medical Services contract was accepted in a ballot of all UK GPs, the results of which were announced on 20 June 2003.</p>

  <p>The new contract will take effect from 1 April 2004 subject, of course, to the Scottish Parliament approving the required changes to primary legislation. Such changes are contained within the Primary Medical Services (Scotland) Bill which was introduced on 23 June. In the meantime, work is currently under way on implementing the new contract and a national reference group and eight working groups have been set up to look at the key issues such as finance and the quality and outcomes framework. Until this work has been completed it is too early to say what the annual administration costs will be. However, the new contract does simplify some of the funding streams. The single Global Sum payment replaces 25 different fees and allowances, thereby greatly reducing the bureaucracy associated with the administration of the system.</p>

  <p>The Sorbonne Agreement, and its successor the Bologna Declaration, aim to strengthen collaboration between higher education institutions across Europe and to enhance levels of mobility for staff and students by 2010. It is an inter-governmental process, dependent on the co-operation of institutions and other stakeholders in taking forward the necessary detail behind the principles of the Declaration. The process recognises the need for diversity and flexibility, and the autonomy of individual higher education institutions.</p>

  <p>A summary of progress made by the Scottish higher education sector towards implementing the Bologna Declaration can be found in the UK National Report at http://www.bologna-berlin2003.de/en/national_reports/index.htm This report has been produced for a ministerial conference taking place in Berlin on the Bologna process, which the Deputy Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning, Lewis Macdonald, will attend to represent Scottish interests.</p>

  <p>I am not aware of any evidence which would determine the impact that technological advances in neonatal patient care have had on the survival rate of babies born in Scotland. Other factors, such as developments in obstetric care and prenatal diagnosis of congenital abnormalities, and improvements in the health of the reproductive population in general will also contribute to changes in this rate.</p>

  <p>A planning web page is available on the internet at www.scotland.gov.uk/planning/pc/pc.asp. This provides information on planning applications that come before the Scottish ministers showing, on a weekly update basis, the current status of each case. Cases are presently listed by local authority area, and work is on-going to also identify each case by MSP constituency.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s Inquiry Reporter&#8217;s Unit also has a website &#8211; www.scotland.gov.uk/planning_appeals/seiru. Within the site is a planning appeals search facility which makes it possible to view progress on appeals and retrieve appeal decision letters online, without charge.</p>

  <p>The use of ICT to provide and receive planning related information is constantly under review and further refinements, consulting as necessary with the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre, will be introduced as appropriate.</p>

  <p>Under the pilot projects, the Hamilton Local Plan in South Lanarkshire and the Wester Ross Local Plan in Highland are progressing well towards publication of finalised draft plans. The project has helped to support the view that barriers to better plan making relate more to cultural and management issues rather than legislation or regulations. Both South Lanarkshire and Highland Councils have considered new ways of engaging with the public and other stakeholders, including opinion meters and photographic competitions, which will be of interest to other authorities.</p>

  <p>Local authorities have powers under the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 to restrict or prohibit pavement parking by the making of a Traffic Regulation Order (TRO). The procedures for the making of TRO&#39;s are contained in the Local Authorities&#39; Traffic Orders (Procedure) (Scotland) Regulations 1999.</p>

  <p>There are no current plans to amend this legislation.</p>

  <p>Under the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003, the production of the Scottish Outdoor Access Code is a matter for Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH). I understand SNH are currently considering the comments received following their consultation on a draft code and expect to be in a position to forward the revised Scottish Outdoor Access Code to ministers later this year. Following consideration and approval by ministers, the code will be presented to the Parliament for its approval.</p>

  <p>We have recently published, and are in the process of issuing to all teachers, a document <em>Continuing Professional Development for Educational Leaders</em> which forms part of the National Framework for Continuing Professional Development. The document was prepared in collaboration with teachers, local authorities, academics and other stakeholders. The purpose of the document is to provide teachers, schools and local authorities with a framework to assist the development of leadership and management skills in the teaching workforce. It will be for the teachers and their line managers to ensure that they have access to appropriate continuing professional development opportunities at the most appropriate stage of their career that allows them to expand their skills and knowledge including quality assurance.</p>

  <p>None. There is no requirement for a particular grade of teacher to be the nominated supporter for student teachers or probationer teachers. Support can be given by all levels of experienced teaching staff.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally. It is a matter for local authorities to determine staffing issues at local level.</p>

  <p>Good progress has been made on making provision for the accreditation of prior learning (APL) as part of the Chartered Teacher programme. The Scottish Executive recently sent to all registered teachers a leaflet describing the Chartered Teacher programme and the accreditation of prior learning (APL). All teachers taking a Chartered Teacher programme are required to complete module 1 of the programme. On successful completion of module 1, the teacher can choose between one of two APL routes.</p>

  <p>The first route will be handled by providers as part of their programme designed to meet the standard for Chartered Teacher and will allow a teacher to claim up to a maximum of 50% of the standard by APL.</p>

  <p>The second route will be handled by the General Teaching Council for Scotland and will allow teachers to make a 100% claim against the standard by APL.</p>

  <p>Alternatively the teacher can choose to complete the whole programme.</p>

  <p>The agreement <em>A Teaching Profession for the 21st Century</em> included a commitment to introduce approximately the equivalent of 3,500 support staff into schools by 31 March 2004. Authorities have been provided with &#163;50 million annually from March 2001. It is a matter for authorities how the funds are spent but within the overall intention of reducing the administrative burdens on teachers. Some authorities have, for example, invested in capital equipment such as improved management systems. A working group of the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers has been established to monitor the impact. It has yet to report.</p>
