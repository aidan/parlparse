  <p>As the member may not appreciate, the producers receiving subsidy payments cannot be named due to EC restrictions on the release of data and further restrictions under the Data Protection Act 1998. Nevertheless, I have set out in the following table the amounts involved.</p>

  <p>I would remind the member, however, that the two schemes operate on different principles and therefore the top 50 payees will not be the same under the two schemes.</p>

  <p>A following table shows the average amount of subsidy paid to businesses, under the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS), for the last two years.</p>

  <p>The schemes covered by IACS are Beef Special Premium Scheme including Extensification payments, Suckler Cow Premium Scheme, including Extensification payments, Sheep Annual Premium Scheme, Arable Aid Payments Scheme and in 1999 Hill Livestock Compensatory Allowance, which was replaced in 2000 by the Less Favoured Area Support Scheme. Payments for schemes covered by IACS 2001 have not yet been completed and hence an average subsidy payment for 2001 is not yet available.</p>

  <p>In the debate on the Agriculture Strategy for Scotland on 3 October, my colleague Ross Finnie announced the creation by the Scottish Executive, together with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, Scottish Natural Heritage, WWF Scotland, the Scottish Agricultural College and the National Farmers&#8217; Union of Scotland, of an advice co-ordination post at the college. One of the postholder&#8217;s main tasks will be to collate and publicise advice on best practice in bathing water catchments, based on the research work by the college.</p>

  <p>Further work, building on the research, is currently under discussion with stakeholders.</p>

  <p>In September we published the Digital Inclusion strategy <i>Connecting Scotland&#8217;s people</i> &#8211; this included initiatives which will promote digital inclusion in rural areas.</p>

  <p>The public access points initiative will expend some &#163;5 million to create more than 1,000 additional public internet access points, and investment will be particularly focussed on areas of Scotland where access to the web is currently poor. The initiative will provide PCs with internet access in places where people already go - for example doctors&#8217; surgeries, shops and hairdressers. This will significantly improve public access to the web across much of rural Scotland. We expect to provide the first PCs early next year.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Digital Communities initiative will expend some &#163;3.5 million in tackling digital inclusion by creating pilot &quot;digital communities&quot; to connect homes to the internet in two disadvantaged areas of Scotland. The objective is to demonstrate how the internet can increase peoples' opportunities and improve quality of life, but at the same time to inform our further efforts to close the digital divide. The two communities chosen will be announced in March 2002, one of which will be a rural community.</p>

  <p>As noted in the strategy, we are also examining the feasibility of a range of other initiatives to promote digital inclusion.</p>

  <p>The repeal of the pre-school provisions of the Schools (Scotland) Code 1956 &#8211; proposed and consulted upon in 2000 &#8211; will not of itself carry any implications for minimum teaching qualifications in pre-school education. The &quot;special qualification&quot; referred to in paragraph 5(2) of the Code is no longer offered in this form; and all courses leading to the B.Ed and PCGE qualifications now cover pre-school education. We will be issuing guidance to local authorities and others on the future deployment of teachers in early years services.</p>

  <p>In April last year we published <i>Delivering Lifeline Ferry Services</i> and used this as the basis for a wide consultation with users, including residents of Colonsay and others, on options for bringing Caledonian MacBrayne&#8217;s ferry services into line with EC rules on maritime state aids. The Minister for Transport and Planning announced in January 2001 a package of provisional proposals to bring the Clyde and Western Isles ferry services into compliance with EC rules. As part of the proposals the minister gave a commitment to protecting levels of service and fares.</p>

  <p>Burness Corlett &amp; Partners, Maritime Consultants, have been appointed to draft the Service Specification for the tender exercise. Over the summer the consultants met and discussed the Service Specification with key interests, including the relevant local authorities and the Strathclyde Passenger Transport Authority; Trade Union representatives; the Scottish Parliament Transport and Environment Committee Reporters; CalMac Users Consultative Committee; the three Shipping Services Advisory Committees (which represent users), and the Highlands and Islands Strategic Transport Partnership.</p>

  <p>The draft Service Specification will cover all aspects of the service, including minimum levels of service and fares. We will be consulting widely on the service specification in due course and I would urge all those with an interest, including residents of Colonsay, to participate.</p>

  <p>I established the New Deal Implementation Support Group (ISG) in September 1999 as a partnership arrangement with the Scottish Junior Doctors Committee of the British Medical Association (BMA) to work with NHSScotland Trusts in supporting their efforts to reduce hours of work for training grade staff. This work has been underpinned by the New Contract for Doctors in Training which introduced a contractual requirement for all Pre Registration House Officer (PRHO) posts to comply with the New Deal by 1 August 2001 and for Senior House Officer (SHO) and Specialist Register (SpR) posts by 1 August 2003.</p>

  <p>I recently announced that 97% of PRHO posts have now been declared by the ISG as New Deal compliant, which is a significant improvement on the 13% declared by the ISG in their March 2001 report. In particular, <u>all</u> PRHO grades training in the Glasgow area have been declared by junior doctors, trusts and the ISG as fully compliant with New Deal standards on hours of work and rest. The current position on compliance for SHO and SpR grades has yet to be confirmed. Completed returns from trusts are awaited, but trusts are aware of the August 2003 compliance deadline. It is anticipated returns will identify that progress has been made with these grades of doctors in training.</p>

  <p>In addition to the recruitment of an extra 100 junior doctors announced in June 2000, I also announced in April this year a commitment to employ 375 more junior doctors by 2003. This represents an increase of approximately 10% and I expect these additional resources to be used to best effect in targeting areas of hour's non-compliance.</p>

  <p>In relation to other issues such as accommodation, catering and security, UK national minimum standards have been agreed recently between the four UK Health Departments and the BMA. The ISG is currently in the process of undertaking visits to trusts to assess where variations from standards exist and to advise on necessary improvements. On completion of this assessment process, trusts will be invited to submit plans detailing how they are to address any shortfalls against standards and to submit on-going progress reports as appropriate to the Health Department on a six-monthly basis.</p>

  <p>It is for local authorities to satisfy themselves, and their auditors, that any expenditure they incur is within their powers. The Scottish Executive holds no information on any contributions made by local authorities to Nuclear Free Local Authorities in the last three years.</p>

  <p>The National Cultural Strategy recognises the particular position of Glasgow and committed the Executive to work with Glasgow City Council to examine the circumstances of the museums and galleries in the city. We have already had preliminary discussions but it is now for the council to set out its own plans for the future of its museums and galleries as the basis of further discussions with the Executive.</p>

  <p>We have honoured our commitment in the National Cultural Strategy to provide resources of &#163;250,000 for a national audit of all museum collections, buildings and services to establish their relative importance, the first of its kind in Europe. The final results of the audit are due in April 2002. However, an interim report was published on 25 October and included detailed findings relating to industrial museums and Glasgow City museums.</p>

  <p>In the first instance, the results of the audit will inform the distribution of our new Restructuring Fund of &#163;3 million over three years, which is aimed at helping to put the local museum sector on a sounder financial footing.</p>

  <p>We are also progressively increasing our annual grant-in-aid to the Scottish Museums Council, the channel for the Executive&#8217;s support to the non-national museum sector, from &#163;940,000 in 2000-01 to &#163;1,440,000 in 2003-04. The increase of &#163;850,000 over three years (&#163;100,000/&#163;250,000/&#163;500,000) is intended specifically for the development of Information and Communications Technology and education programmes in the non-national sector.</p>

  <p>Based on the proposals put forward in May in the Scottish Executive Consultation Paper <i>Rate Relief for Small Businesses</i> , businesses occupying a property with a rateable value of &#163;10,000 or less, subject to certain criteria, would benefit from a general rate relief scheme. The table shows the number of all non-domestic properties above and below the &#163;10,000 rateable value threshold by local authority area. This provides an indication of the numbers and percentage of businesses likely to benefit from the scheme.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&#8217;s consultation paper on rates relief for small businesses proposes an extension to the rural rates relief scheme, to offer 50% mandatory rates relief to qualifying singly owned pubs in designated rural settlements. The proposals for a general rate relief scheme for small businesses do not include any special provisions for licensed premises.</p>

  <p>The Executive has published for consultation a scheme based on rateable values because this is transparent and easy to understand. The rateable value threshold of &#163;10,000 has been an accepted measure of small businesses for some time and is the threshold criterion for the current 2p reduction in poundage. An estimated 70% of businesses occupy properties with a rateable value of &#163;10,000 or less and would therefore benefit from such a scheme.</p>

  <p>The following progress has been made in improving safety on the A84 and A85 trunk roads:</p>

  <p>BEAR Scotland Ltd have proposals for improving the A84/A85 junction at Lochearnhead. The construction work is programmed for completion this financial year.</p>

  <p>The designs for village gateways for Lochearnhead have been completed and the signs should be erected by the end of December 2001.</p>

  <p>A contract for improving and upgrading the verge safety fences at various locations on the A84 and A85 has been awarded. These works will start in mid December and be complete by the end of the financial year.</p>

  <p>Minor alterations will be made to road signs and markings at Glen Ogle. The signs should be in place by the end of the year.</p>

  <p>Three improvement schemes at Glenogle are being designed for implementation in the future, subject to competing priorities and available funding.</p>

  <p>The Executive remains committed to promoting social inclusion across Scotland, including in our rural areas. Our understanding of rural social exclusion is being improved as a result of the Rural Poverty and Inclusion Working Group&#8217;s report, <i>Poverty and Social Exclusion in Rural Scotland, </i> which was presented to ministers on 30 October. The report makes a number of practical recommendations for measuring the impact of, and tackling, poverty and social exclusion in rural areas. The Executive is already acting on the group&#8217;s recommendations by taking forward work to improve data availability and to disaggregate existing data on a rural/urban basis. As far as is currently possible, we will provide an urban/rural breakdown of data in the second Social Justice Annual Report, which will be published shortly.</p>

  <p>The Executive seeks to protect and enhance the land and water resources required for the nation&#8217;s sport and physical recreation through the planning system. It is part of local authorities&#8217; responsibility to take full account in their preparation of development plans, and development control decisions of the community&#8217;s need, for recreational space and sporting facilities. Planning decisions must be made in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise. The development plan will therefore form the basis of decisions made by local authorities and Scottish ministers.</p>

  <p>National Planning Policy Guideline (NPPG) 11: <i>Sport, Physical Recreation and Open Space</i>, states that there should be a presumption against redevelopment of playing fields or sports pitches and that planning permission should not be granted for their alternative use, unless it has been established that they will not be required in future by the school or community. For the purposes of NPPG 11 a playing field is defined as land of 0.4 hectares or more for any pitch sports, including any adjacent tennis courts and bowling greens, and athletic tracks.</p>

  <p>Under Article 15 of the General Development Procedure Order, <strong></strong>sportscotland must be consulted on proposals for development on land last used as a playing field which has not subsequently been built on and development that is likely to prejudice the use of land as a playing field or lead to the loss of land used as a playing field. If a planning authority is minded to grant a planning permission, and <strong></strong>sportscotland has made and maintained an objection to the application, the authority must notify the Scottish ministers who can then decide whether to call in the application for their own determination.</p>

  <p>Robust planning policies are required to safeguard established open spaces, playing fields and access routes where they contribute to local community needs and enjoyment. Local authorities should lead by example and generally resist development of open space and playing fields in their ownership.</p>
