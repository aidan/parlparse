  <p>Data from Futureskills Scotland&rsquo;s Employers Skill Survey 2004 demonstrates that, according to employers, only 2.4% of employee jobs in the skilled tradespeople sector are hard-to-fill. This is down from the previous year&rsquo;s figure of 3.0%, but higher than the all-sector average of 1.7%. We continue to work with key delivery partners through our Determined to Succeed Strategy, and the Modern Apprenticeship and Skillseekers programmes to address such shortages using local intelligence.</p>

  <p>Our Scottish Biodiversity Strategy Implementation Plans for 2005 to 2007 were published on 31 March this year. These plans include a range of targets for conserving biodiversity in Scotland&rsquo;s woodlands.</p>

  <p>Forestry Commission Scotland and the Executive&rsquo;s Planning Division will shortly undertake a review with key stakeholders, which will aim to minimise losses of woodland biodiversity as a result of changes in land use. Part of the review&rsquo;s remit will be to examine measures to ensure that ancient and semi-natural woodlands are adequately protected.</p>

  <p>No detailed impact analysis of a rise in fuel prices has been carried out for specific industries or areas of Scotland. With regard to the agricultural and fisheries industries, both sectors benefit from reduced duty applied to the use of red diesel. This is worth over 40 pence per litre compared to fuel usage by most sectors of industry.</p>

  <p>We recently announced a new campaign to protect patients from hospital infections and ensuring clean wards. This will be a thorough, relentless and systematic campaign, which is one of the most comprehensive in Europe, and is backed by &pound;15 million investment over three years.</p>

  <p>The key elements include sisters and charge nurses being accountable for ward cleanliness and a programme to ensure that alcohol hand rubs are available near every frontline bed by the beginning of April 2005. I have received confirmation from chief executives that the policy to provide alcohol hand rubs has been fully implemented. There is also a reinforcement of management accountabilities and responsibility, and further developments in education and training for cleaning, nursing and medical staff.</p>

  <p>Cleanliness is everyone&rsquo;s responsibility. Staff and visitors alike can do a lot to help keep patients safe from infection.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what provision it has made in the franchise to First ScotRail for expansion of the West Highland Line service by (a) more train journeys and (b) securing extra rolling stock and whether its transport policy includes any commitment that the West Highland Line should be expanded by more train services, extra sleeping cars or any other means.</p>

  <p>The franchise allows the Executive to require additional services to be provided. Any proposal to run additional services would be considered alongside the existing service level commitment and needs across the rail network. Expansion of the West Highland Line service would be possible if there was a robust business case.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has made any arrangement to prevent the destruction of redundant sleeping cars stored by Porterbrook Leasing to enable these cars to be used as extra sleeping cars for the West Highland Line and, if not, how much it will cost to purchase new sleeping cars.</p>

  <p>The Executive has no plans to require First ScotRail to lease additional sleeping cars as there is already sufficient capacity within the fleet. Purchase of new sleeping cars would be subject to a procurement process before reliable estimates of the costs involved could be ascertained.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will carry out a feasibility study into the (a) cost per unit of refurbishing the redundant sleeping cars stored by Porterbrook Leasing for use on the West Highland Line or other sleeper service, comparing that to the cost of purchasing new stock, and (b) economic costs and benefits of laying on extra sleeping cars for existing rail sleeper services and whether such a study would consider the potential benefit to the tourist industry of such services and the adequacy of the existing marketing of the service.</p>

  <p>The franchise agreement allows the Executive to receive a range of information about sleeper services on a regular basis, on marketing, demand, costs and revenues. In addition, service development is considered on an on-going basis by First ScotRail and by the Executive as part of franchise monitoring.</p>

  <p>First ScotRail estimates that the costs of refurbishing redundant sleeping cars would be significantly less than purchasing new rolling stock. They also advise that currently there is no need for additional sleeping cars as there is sufficient capacity within the existing fleet, which is itself being upgraded through a &pound;1 million investment as part of the franchise.</p>

  <p>Services to support the tourism industry are important. First ScotRail is already committed to providing a three car sleeper service on the Fort William route during the summer at weekends. This provides 50% greater capacity than the base for the rest of the year and reflects demand at peak times.</p>

  <p>The Executive has no plans to carry out a feasibility study as outlined in the question.</p>

  <p>The decision on storage and future leasing arrangements is for First ScotRail and Porterbrook to make within the terms of the franchise requirement. The Executive is satisfied, having consulted with First ScotRail, that sufficient capacity exists within the fleet currently under lease to First ScotRail to allow for development of the West Highland Line Service in line with anticipated demand.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-16014 by Lewis Macdonald on 26 April 2005, when it will publish its new sustainable development strategy and what (a) non-government organisations, (b) trade unions and (c) other members of civic Scotland have been asked to contribute to the development of the strategy.</p>

  <p>Ross Finnie: We shall publish our Scottish strategy this autumn.</p>

  <p>We are keen that it should reflect the concerns of people, communities and organisations in Scotland and the contributions which they can make towards a more sustainable future. To that end, I have written to the non-government organisations and other bodies listed below asking for their assistance in developing the strategy, and my officials are working with them and others, including the Scottish Trades Union Congress, to develop the content of the strategy.</p>

  <p>We are also seeking to encourage a more general debate on the implications of sustainable development, both to contribute to the strategy and to develop the awareness and engagement needed for its implementation. We are doing that in a number of ways, including through the Scottish Executive website (<a href="http://www.sustainable.scotland.gov.uk" target="_blank">http://www.sustainable.scotland.gov.uk</a>), an open online discussion area hosted by the Scottish Sustainable Development Forum (<a href="http://www.ssdforum.org.uk" target="_blank">http://www.ssdforum.org.uk</a>) and a series of public meetings run by the forum in more remote rural locations across Scotland to enable us to gather views on the issues from the particular perspective of these communities.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what provision it will seek, in connection with the proposed rail link from Glasgow Airport to Glasgow city centre, for park-and-ride schemes to encourage users of the M8 to leave their cars at the airport connection and take the rail link into the city centre and, if no such park-and-ride scheme forms part of the proposal submitted by Strathclyde Passenger Transport (SPT), whether it will invite SPT to add such a provision.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive supports the current design of the Glasgow Airport Rail Link as proposed by Strathclyde Passenger Transport (SPT). If the SPT or a local authority wished to pursue a proposal for a park-and-ride facility such a project would be assessed by the Executive in the normal way.</p>

  <p>Strathclyde Passenger Transport (SPT), the promoter of the Glasgow Airport Rail Link, are in the final stages of analysing the impact that their proposals will have in reducing congestion on the M8. This information will be available towards the end of May, but will not include a comparison in respect of with/without park-and-ride, as this does not form part of their scheme proposal.</p>
