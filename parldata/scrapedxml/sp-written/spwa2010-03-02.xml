  <p>Both the First Minister and I have written to the British Geological Survey (BGS) urging them to reconsider their decision and retain the facility in Edinburgh. I have also recently met with Prof Ludden, Executive Director of BGS, to discuss these matters and to consider alternative options to maintain the data and formations within Scotland. Energy officials have also been in contact with BGS directly on a number of issues including the consultation process and the impact on users. This dialogue is continuing.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what effect the proposed relocation of the UK continental shelf core and records collections to Keyworth will have on the oil and gas industry in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The core and records collection currently located at Gilmerton is widely used by oil and gas companies in Scotland for exploration and development purposes. We are of the view that if core data is to be used to greatest economic value the cores need to be situated in close proximity to its main users. Relocating the core data to Keyworth would affect access to the material from Scotland, increase costs to the oil and gas industry and ultimately result in the facility being used less. This could have negative implications for North Sea petroleum activities and subsequently the levels of oil recovered from the UKCS.</p>

  <p>The existing facility at Gilmerton is, in our view, of great value to academia in Scotland and the current proposal would significantly disadvantage research undertaken at Scottish universities. Relocation would result in much reduced access to the dataset by Scottish-based research students. The proposals would also undermine the growing opportunities for carbon storage research in Scotland. Scotland&rsquo;s universities are amongst the world leaders in carbon storage research and retaining research access to the core data at Gilmerton will be essential to the development of this crucial resource.</p>

  <p>Although we are not aware of any detailed assessment, it is likely that any relocation would have impact on some local businesses in Edinburgh in terms of hotel usage and other business services.</p>

  <p>This would be in addition to the negative impact upon Scottish based businesses directly affected by the proposal as outlined in response to questions S3W-31518 and S3W-31519 on 2 March 2010.</p>

  <p>The approval in 2004 by Ofgem for the Beauly-Denny 400kV overhead line was informed by a cost benefit analysis, which was based upon a comparison of network capital and operation costs over time. The developers will be required to obtain approval from Ofgem for the additional expenditure before enacting the various mitigation measures secured by the conditions of consent. I do not consider that such expenditure will prove an obstacle to ensuring that the visual and environmental impacts of the 400kV line are acceptably mitigated.</p>

  <p>The possible health risks associated with exposure to electric and magnetic fields have been addressed in the report of the Technical Assessor appointed to the Beauly Denny Public Inquiry.

  <p>This report notes that: &quot;The European Commission has concluded, with respect to EMF, that the precautionary principle should not be invoked because there are no clear scientific indications that the possible effects on human health may be potentially dangerous.

  <p>The police recorded crime statistics collected centrally are based on an aggregate return, and do not record the occupation of the victim. However, following the introduction of the Emergency Workers (Scotland) Act in 2005, a new distinct crime classification of &quot;Minor assault of an emergency worker&quot; was created. Note that this will also include minor assaults of police officers during any course of their duties.</p>

  <p>The registration figures for 2007 were particularly high, and it is likely that these figures partly reflect the impact of changes in tax rules in April 2007 surrounding managed service companies.</p>

  <p>VAT/PAYE registrations do not represent a complete picture of start-up activity as only companies with an annual turnover above the VAT threshold or who have employees on a Pay As You Earn (PAYE) scheme are required to register.</p>

  <p>Following the 2010 revaluation of business rates, the following table shows the number of business properties in each uplifted rateable value band for the Small Business Bonus Scheme (SBBS), broken down by local authority area.</p>

  <p>This table does not indicate SBBS eligibility and a substantial number of the properties included below will be part of larger chains or in receipt of other relief, such as empty property, charitable or rural relief and will not qualify for the bonus scheme.</p>

  <p>In 2008-09 some 64,000 properties qualified for SBBS and the expansion announced on 10 February to include small chains of properties with a cumulative rateable value under &pound;25,000 will bring an additional 3,600 properties into the scheme.</p>

  <p>The vast majority of capital resources are allocated by formula directly to NHS boards. NHS boards receive a capital resource limit within which they identify and prioritise their capital spending requirements. Boards are only obliged to bring capital projects over their delegated limits, for consideration and approval by the Capital Investment Group.</p>

  <p>Following the UK Government&rsquo;s pre-budget report announcement on 9 December 2009, it is clear that there is likely to be a significant reduction in the amount of capital funding available for the public sector, including the NHS. At this stage it is not clear how this will affect future devolved Scottish budgets. In line with this, NHS boards are currently reviewing their capital plans and are devising a process that will allow them to reach logical and well evidenced decisions on what investments they can take forward.</p>

  <p>The boards have recently submitted draft five year financial plans as they do annually. These plans are currently being assessed and are subject to review and possible change to reflect the evaluation currently being undertaken.</p>

  <p>Currently there are three health capital projects with a capital value of circa &pound;51.2 million which have been agreed by individual NHS boards, considered by the Capital Investment Group, but await formal Scottish Government approval as there are outstanding issues to be resolved. These projects are listed in the following table:</p>

  <p>Note: 1. This table counts all deaths for which any one of the following words or terms was mentioned in the death certificate: norovirus, noroviral, norwalk (as this is what norovirus was originally called when it was identified in 1968); small round structured virus (SRSV, a term which was used later) and winter vomiting (as such illnesses are usually caused by norovirus). It also includes the deaths for which the underlying cause or any contributory cause was coded, in terms of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD10) as A08.1, Acute gastroenteropathy due to Norwalk agent.</p>

  <p><strong>Frank Mulholland: </strong>The Police and the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service take cases of stalking and harassment very seriously. There are no specific offences of stalking or harassment in Scots law but such cases can be prosecuted as breach of the peace or threats and can be prosecuted in the High Court of Justiciary depending on the seriousness of the offence.</p>

  <p>Where a person is convicted of an offence involving harassment of the victim, the prosecutor may apply to the court to make an non-harassment order against the offender, requiring the offender to refrain from such conduct as the court prescribes. Breach of a non-harassment order is a criminal offence.</p>

  <p>Guidance to Prosecutors is contained in Chapter 22 of the Book of Regulations, which is available on our website at <a href="http://www.copfs.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.copfs.gov.uk</a>. In addition, Lord Advocate&rsquo;s Guidelines to Chief Constables on Stalking were issued in 1999 by the then Lord Advocate, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon.</p>

  <p>The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) and the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland (ACPOS) recently revised their Joint Protocol <em>&quot;In Partnership: Tackling Domestic Abuse&quot;</em> which targets abusive behaviour between partners and ex-partners, some of which may constitute stalking and harassment. The Protocol is also available on the COPFS website.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has lodged an amendment to the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Bill setting out a new charge which deals comprehensively with behaviour which would amount to stalking or harassment. If passed, all relevant guidelines will be reviewed and where necessary updated to take account of these changes.</p>

  <p>In saying &quot;six occasions&quot; the six occasions I had in mind were:</p>

  <p>On 4 February 2009 I led a Scottish national newspaper seminar which brought together stakeholders from across the Scotland&rsquo;s national newspaper industry, to discuss the challenges and the opportunities for the sector. Attendees included representatives from the Herald and Times Group, the Scotsman, the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) as well as a range of editors, journalists, publishers, distributors, newspaper associations, academics and consumers from across Scotland.</p>

  <p>On 26 February 2009 I met representatives of the Council of the Scottish Daily Newspaper Society which included Tim Blott, Managing Director, Herald and Times, Jim Raeburn, Scottish Daily Newspaper Society and Michael Johnston, Managing Director, Scotsman and Simon Fairclough who represented the Scottish Newspapers Publishers Association. At that meeting we discussed the newspaper industry in Scotland and the role of the Scottish Government, particularly with regard to local government recruitment portal and public information notices.</p>

  <p>On 2 April 2009 I met Ellis Watson, former CEO, Menzies Distribution, to discuss his proposed concept of providing all 17 year olds with a year long free subscription to a national newspaper.</p>

  <p>On 27 April 2009 I met Paul Holleran, the National Organiser for Scotland of the NUJ, to discuss the Daily Record/ Sunday Mail dispute.</p>

  <p>On 11 May 2009: I met Mark Hollinshead, Trinity Mirror to discuss the Daily Record/ Sunday Mail dispute.</p>

  <p>On 19 May 2009: I met Andrew, Christopher and Murray Thomson along with Ian Lamb of DC Thomson as they could not attend the session that I held on <br /> 4 February 2009. We discussed the challenges facing the industry and the local government jobs portal.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Sustainable Procurement Action Plan was issued to the public sector in Scotland in October 2009. The Scottish Government has achieved its target dates to 28 February 2010 and is on course to meet the remaining target dates in the Action Plan. Target dates/actions achieved to date include:</p>

  <p>A Senior Management champion was appointed in October 2009</p>

  <p>A public commitment by the Permanent Secretary was published on the Scottish Government&rsquo;s website in December 2009</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has signed up to the Suppliers Charter</p>

  <p>The &quot;Buy Sustainable Quick Wins&quot; specifications were communicated to the wider Scottish public in October 2008</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has a supplier engagement programme</p>

  <p>Use of the Public Contracts Scotland portal has been adopted by the relevant procurement organisations - Procurement Scotland and the Central Government Centre of Procurement Expertise</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has published guidance about the ability to specify sustainable options.</p>

  <p>In 2005 the Scottish Procurement Directorate issued guidance to the public sector on how to legally procure fair and ethically traded products and has adopted that policy in relation to its own catering arrangements. Sales of fair and ethically traded products through staff restaurants and for meetings amounted to &pound;278,066 in the 12 month trading period from March 2009 to February 2010, representing 14% of customer spending.</p>

  <p>The following projects have not drawn down their total funding allocated under the Wave and Tidal Energy Support Scheme (WATES):</p>

  <p>ScottishPower Renewables (previously known as CRE Energy)</p>

  <p>Ocean Power Technology</p>

  <p>Scotrenewables Marine Power Ltd.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is working closely with these developers and remain confident that these projects will meet the WATES deadline of March 2011.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, following discussions with AWS Ocean Energy Ltd, the Scottish Government has had to withdraw that company&rsquo;s WATES award of &pound;1.76 million. This is because the thorough review undertaken by AWS, and the significant changes aimed at improving their technology which emerged from that process, meant that their revised project and development plans no longer met the original WATES eligibility criteria.</p>

  <p>AWS has since achieved welcome success in securing a &pound;2 million investment from Scottish Enterprise&rsquo;s Scottish Co-investment Fund and further private investment from the Shell Technology Ventures Fund.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will recycle the &pound;1.76 million into a new wave and tidal fund, which we expect to launch during March.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-31018 by Frank Mulholland on 2 February 2010, whether guidance in any form has been issued or otherwise communicated to procurators fiscal to assist them in making a decision on whether or not to prosecute in such cases.</p>

  <p><strong>Frank Mulholland: </strong>There must be sufficient evidence in law before a prosecutor can decide whether or not it is in the public interest to prosecute. If there is sufficient evidence that a crime has been committed, the accused was the perpetrator and had the requisite mens rea (intention) the prosecutor will require to decide that prosecution is in the public interest. Every case is decided on the basis of its own particular facts and circumstances. No specific guidance is issued to Procurators Fiscal regarding assisted suicide. The Prosecution Code published by COPFS sets out the factors which can be taken in to account by procurators fiscal when deciding whether to prosecute. These considerations include the factors listed below at (i) to (xiii).</p>

  <p>(i) The nature and gravity of the offence</p>

  <p>(ii) The impact of the offence on the victim and other witnesses</p>

  <p>(iii) The age, background and personal circumstances of the accused</p>

  <p>(iv) The age and personal circumstances of the victim and other witnesses</p>

  <p>(v) The attitude of the victim</p>

  <p>(vi) The motive for the crime</p>

  <p>(vii) The age of the offence</p>

  <p>(viii) Mitigating circumstances</p>

  <p>(ix) The effect of prosecution on the accused</p>

  <p>(x) The risk of further offending</p>

  <p>(xi) The availability of a more appropriate civil remedy</p>
