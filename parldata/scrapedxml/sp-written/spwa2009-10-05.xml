  <p>The majority of the recommendations contained in the report relate to addressing local processes to consider individual patient treatment (exceptional prescribing) processes. The Scottish Government is preparing guidance for NHS boards which sets out the policy framework with regard to the introduction and availability of new medicines in the NHS in Scotland. A key requirement within the policy framework is the need for a fair, consistent and systematic process for requests for medicines to be prescribed on a case-by-case basis for individual patients.</p>

  <p>Anti-emetic (anti-nausea) treatments given to patients receiving chemotherapy are prescribed on an individual basis and according to the side effects a patient may be expected to experience as a result of that particular chemotherapy regime.</p>

  <p>All chemotherapy regimes are routinely assessed for the likelihood that they will cause nausea and vomiting. Chemotherapy units have written protocols in place for chemotherapy prescriptions which include a corresponding recommended anti-emetic regime(s). These protocols are based on the best available medical evidence, international best practice guidelines and local experience. Accordingly, anti-emetics are prescribed and administered to patients at the same time as their chemotherapy.</p>

  <p>The side effects of chemotherapy, including the occurrence of nausea and vomiting, will be assessed at each cycle and the anti-emetic regime altered as required.</p>

  <p>Information on the cost of specific drugs as defined by the British National Formulary (BNF), for the treatment of cancer for the last five financial years is given in the following table. This table only covers drugs prescribed in Scotland that were dispensed by community pharmacies or dispensing doctors anywhere in Scotland. It excludes the direct supply of medicines to patients from hospitals or clinics.</p>

  <p>Information on the total expenditure for drugs used in the treatment of cancer is not available centrally. This is because there are many different types of drugs used in cancer treatment, for example, analgesics for pain, steroids as an adjunct therapy or anti-emetics to help control nausea. There are no data available on the reason for prescribing an item and therefore is not possible to estimate the true cost of the drug treatments for cancer.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government understands that BT&rsquo;s trials for Broadband Enabling Technology (BET) in sites in Dingwall and Inverness were a technical success and that BET offers the opportunity for 2Mbps broadband services to be delivered to remote locations. Other than locations in BT&rsquo;s already-announced pilot programme, BT has stated that work to explore further areas which could potentially benefit from BET is already underway, but this will take time and is subject to funding availability.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has already made significant progress in expansion of broadband coverage in Scotland. The Broadband Reach Project, the first phase of which completed in May 2009, has provided basic broadband services to around 2,100 broadband Not Spots, many in rural and remote locations.</p>

  <p>Scottish Government ministers and officials regularly liaise with BT on a wide range of telecommunications issues and we have already shared our knowledge of Scottish broadband Not Spot locations with BT in connection with BET.</p>

  <p>The Forth Replacement Crossing (FRC) is a fast-tracked element of the Strategic Transport Projects Review (STPR) which sets out wider investment priorities over the next 20 years that will be delivered subject to the transport allocation within future spending reviews and affordability. As the need for maintaining cross Forth travel has been established as a priority, funding has been allocated to the FRC. Whilst this major development is underway, some other projects, particularly, rail improvements, will also be able to proceed.</p>

  <p>The FRC will include a dedicated public transport corridor on the Forth Road Bridge (FRB), improved park and ride facilities at Ferrytoll and dedicated public transport links from Ferrytoll across the FRB linking to the A90 west of the A8000. It will also include Intelligent Transport Systems from Halbeath to Newbridge to encourage the use of public transport and improve journey reliability.</p>

  <p>The FRC has targeted dedicated measures for high-occupancy vehicles and public transport, initially in the form of buses. Measures for higher occupancy private cars would require considerable additional roadspace which would, in turn, be likely to generate additional traffic.</p>

  <p>At South Queensferry, pedestrian and cyclist crossing facilities will be included to the south west of South Queensferry along the A904 Builyeon Road and the U221 Road via dedicated footpath/cycleways through the new South Queensferry Junction. The roundabout will be traffic signal controlled with pedestrian and cyclist phases activated on an on-demand basis.</p>

  <p>The economic and social consequences of the Forth Road Bridge being closed or restricted before a replacement crossing is in place would be untenable. The Forth Replacement Crossing has, therefore, been established as a priority within the STPR and funding allocated, in order to protect this vital link in the country&rsquo;s transport network.</p>

  <p>The Forth Replacement Crossing (FRC) is a fast-tracked element of the STPR which sets out wider investment priorities over the next 20 years that will be delivered subject to the transport allocation within future spending reviews and affordability. As the need for maintaining cross Forth travel has been established as a priority, the FRC has been progressed ahead of the majority of the other projects and, as such, environmental impacts and any necessary mitigation measures have now been assessed in detail for the FRC.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is aware that this guidance is now out of date and does not support joint working between social work, housing and the NHS. To address this, the Scottish Government issued revised draft guidance for public consultation on 2 December 2008. The consultation has now closed and officials are working on producing new guidance for publication in November.</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/12/03120911/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/12/03120911/0</a>.</p>

  <p>The new guidance no longer distinguishes between health and local authority responsibility, it encourages a partnership approach to the provision of equipment and adaptations. It will enable professionals, users and carers to better understand local health and social care partnerships responsibilities, and create a more consistent approach to the provision of equipment and adaptations across Scotland.</p>

  <p>The consultation process also highlighted that the local arrangements for funding of major adaptations within the different housing tenures requires further clarity. Work has commenced within the Scottish Government to produce further guidance on this complex issue.</p>

  <p>Under the auspices of the Scottish Procurement Reform Programme, the Scottish Government, its Agencies and public sector organisations across Scotland have worked together to deliver or access a wide range of collaborative procurement contracts which have been specifically developed to provide best value.</p>

  <p>Procurement Scotland, a division of the Scottish Procurement Directorate, has established national frameworks for Office Equipment and Office Supplies, removing the cost of tendering for many public sector organisations across Scotland who would otherwise have been required to run their own EU procurement processes. The multi supplier Office Equipment framework, awarded on 3 June 2009 for up to four years, has resulted in potential savings across the Scottish public sector of circa &pound;6 million over the framework duration. The Stationery framework, awarded on the 1st September 2008 for three years (as part of a suite of office supplies frameworks), has resulted in potential savings across the Scottish public sector of circa &pound;11 million over the framework duration.</p>

  <p>For vehicles, the Scottish Government are currently signed up to a Pan Government Framework Agreement through Buying Solutions. Accessing this framework enables the Scottish Government to secure motor vehicles and light commercial vehicles from all or a chosen number of suppliers.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government and its agencies have also removed the costs of a full tendering exercise for furniture by accessing UK wide collaborative frameworks established by Buying Solutions. This resulted in savings of &pound;744,000 in 2008-09.</p>

  <p>We amended our renewables legislation in June to provide higher levels of support for wave and tidal power than anywhere else in the UK, with five Renewables Obligation Certificates (ROCs) per megawatt hour for wave projects and three ROCs per megawatt hour for tidal stream projects. This is a deliberate signal of intent, and provides a long-term return for these generators. We know that this support is already attracting developers to look at potential projects and locations in Scottish waters in preference to other parts of the UK.</p>

  <p>Recruitment and deployment of teachers are matters for local authority employers to determine.</p>

  <p>Two of the recommendations of the Teacher Employment Working Group (chaired by COSLA) report published last year referred to post probationers and supply work. These are:</p>

  <p>Recommendation 4: Local authority employers should wherever possible use post-probation teachers to fill supply vacancies</p>

  <p>Recommendation 5: Local authorities should consider making more use of permanent supply pools to ensure stable employment opportunities are available to post-probation teachers.</p>

  <p>The purpose of these recommendations is to help to develop more opportunities for those newly qualified by reducing the use of retired teachers in supply. The recommendations, unanimously agreed by all parties in the working group including COSLA, on supply are for local authorities as the employers of teachers to take forward while bearing in mind both employment and age legislation.</p>

  <p>We are investing and planning to invest record sums in the Glasgow and West of Scotland area. Current projects include the M74 Completion; M80 Stepps to Hagg; M8 Baillieston to Newhouse (including the Raith Interchange and the Associated Network Improvements (ANI); the Airdrie to Bathgate Railway; rail upgrades between Glasgow Central and Paisley, and the Edinburgh Glasgow (rail) Improvements Programme (EGIP).</p>

  <p>In addition, the Strategic Transport Projects Review (STPR), announced on 10 December 2009, recommends a number of other projects, which will benefit Glasgow including Strategic Park &amp; Ride / Park &amp; Choose sites (including serving Glasgow) and West of Scotland Strategic Rail Enhancements.</p>

  <p>In aggregate, these investments will amount to between &pound;4.5 billion and &pound;6 billion.</p>
