  <p>The NFUS raised the principle of compensating dairy farming in the Less-Favoured Areas under the LFA legislation some time ago. A detailed paper on the subject was given to me by the Union at DairyScot on 30 November 2000. Whilst we are studying the paper in detail and will respond in due course, I must point out that budgets for the LFA Scheme have already been set. At this juncture, therefore, LFA dairy farming could only be covered under the scheme at the expense of beef and sheep enterprises.</p>

  <p>In the paper <i>Regulation of Early Education and Childcare &#8211; The Way Ahead, </i> published in May, we proposed that regulation involving examination of the quality of care should extend to care for children of primary school age, rather than being limited to care provided for under eights as at present. Where care was provided for children of secondary school age only, the paper indicated that regulation should be introduced but limited to fit person checks on staff. We have now carefully considered comments and have decided that full regulation should be applied to care for all children up to the age of 16. Measures to achieve this will be included in forthcoming legislation on regulation of care services.</p>

  <p>Such an assessment remains premature. Whilst quotas have now been set, we need to reflect fully on the impact of the 2001 quotas on the industry. I intend to discuss these issues with the fishing industry early in the New Year.

  <p>There is extensive co-operation between the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency on behalf of the Scottish Executive and also other enforcement authorities in the UK with those of other member states and third countries. Such co-operation is important to ensure the effective application of measures designed to conserve fish stocks. Examples of co-operation involving the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency and other enforcement authorities in the UK over the last 12 months include:</p>

  <p>exchanging and sharing information from monitoring and control activity with other member states as appropriate, but notably Denmark;</p>

  <p>sharing surveillance/monitoring information with Third Countries, namely Norway, Iceland and Faroes;</p>

  <p>participation, in Canada, in an International Fisheries Conference on sustainable fishing at the request of the Scottish Fishing Industry;</p>

  <p>enforcement operations in waters covered by the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission, and</p>

  <p>the development of an operational protocol on satellite monitoring with France, Spain, Belgium and Ireland. Similar operational protocols are also being developed with other member states and Norway.</p>

  <p>Decisions about which projects should be supported by landfill operators under the landfill tax credits scheme are a matter for the operator themselves as this funding is considered to be private funding. One of the approved criteria for which funding may be used is the maintenance and improvement of a public park or public amenity in the vicinity of a landfill site. Many such projects, and others, are influenced by local organisations offering to provide the required 10% contribution towards funding which cannot be covered by the credit scheme.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive encourages operators to provide funding to projects that benefit the local community or wider sustainable waste management and encourages communities to become directly involved.</p>

  <p>Forward Scotland, an organisation part-funded by the Executive, promotes the use of the Landfill Tax Credit Scheme across Scotland through advertising, seminars and events. Forward Scotland has helped set up local trusts across the country to take advantage of the credit scheme. There are currently eight such trusts.</p>

  <p>The trusts are local organisations which decide how and where money could be best spent in their area, in accordance with the rules of the credit scheme. Forward Scotland promotes the scheme and offers guidance and support to the trusts if they wish to participate. Forward Scotland has worked with the trusts on around 200 projects to date and currently handles about &pound;2.5 million of landfill tax credits each year.</p>

  <p>The Executive also supported the establishment of the Scottish Landfill Tax Credit Forum, set up in conjunction with Entrust (the credit scheme regulator) and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency.

  <p>The Scottish Executive is contributing to the strategy which was launched by the Prime Minister in June 1999 to attract more international students to the UK. Scottish Executive officials are already engaged with the British Council, Scottish Education &amp; Training and Scottish Trade International; bodies which, acting collaboratively, are well placed to promote the attraction of foreign students.</p>

  <p>Further education colleges are very active in the provision of ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages), also known as EAL (English as an Additional Language) and ESL (English as a Second Language). The provision is varied and is offered on a number of levels, including to UK residents who may be first generation migrants, asylum seekers and refugees. The courses are also very heavily promoted and are sold overseas with students from countries as diverse as China, India and the Koreas coming to Scotland to study.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish English Language Teaching in Consortium (SELTIC), is a consortium of public and private sector language schools promoting themselves as a destination for English language classes and offering advice and consultancy on all aspects of English language teaching.</p>
