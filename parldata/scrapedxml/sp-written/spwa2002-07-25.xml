  <p>Employment is a reserved issue. The primary responsibility for assisting unemployed people into work rests with Jobcentre Plus.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding these points, a sub-group of the Scottish Welfare to Work Advisory Task Force has recently been considering how to enhance the active management of the network of relevant agencies and intermediaries in Glasgow, with a view to improving the effectiveness of welfare-to-work programmes in the city.

  <p>Six million pounds of New Housing Partnership (NHP) funding was earmarked in 1999 for Fife Council's housing regeneration projects in Abbeyview, Lochgelly, Dysart and Buckhaven and Methil. &#163;104,580 NHP grant was paid in 1999-2000 and &#163;433,331 in 2001-02. These resources have allowed the council to undertake a number of activities associated with the transfer process. These include extensive tenant consultation and the provision of independent advice to tenants; the production of a stock condition survey and other technical reports; commissioning an independent valuation and providing project management costs for the development consortia. We are currently discussing with the council the level of resources required to progress the projects in the current financial year.</p>

  <p>The Executive is concerned about the effects on children of acrimonious separations, and provides financial support to various voluntary organisations offering mediation or other help to families in transition. The Executive accepts that children can suffer harmful effects where one or both parents deliberately set out to use the children as a weapon. However, it does not believe that Parental Alienation Syndrome is a sufficiently well defined medical term to make its diagnosis certain or its use appropriate in legislation. The existing law of Scotland can already deal with such behaviour.</p>

However, the Executive has encouraged the development of the Scottish Research Information System, by Scottish Higher Education Funding Council, Universities Scotland and Scottish Enterprise.
