  <p>Business closures are normally measured by VAT de-registrations. These are published annually on a calendar year basis. The latest available data is for 2001. Changes to the VAT threshold in 1994 mean that data before that date are not directly comparable with data from 1994 onwards.

  <p>The review of the location of Forest Enterprise Scotland was announced on 11 December 2002 and is being conducted in accordance with the Executive&#39;s relocation policy. When we announced the review, we said that a decision would be taken by the end of this year. However, we have been anxious to conclude the review as quickly as possible in order to minimise the uncertainty for staff. Following consultation with staff, stakeholders and the unions, the review team has now produced its report and I expect to be in a position to make an announcement in the next few weeks.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive promotes healthy eating in primary schools in a number of ways including the development of nutrient standards for school meals and by supporting the provision of breakfast clubs and fruit in nurseries and schools.</p>

  <p>Advice and support materials provided by the Scottish Executive give health education, including nutritional education, a secure place within the curriculum and seek to ensure that it is provided in all schools. The Scottish Health Promoting Schools Unit supports schools in becoming Health Promoting Schools. The main responsibility for the delivery and management of nutritional education within the curriculum, the quality of school meals and the provision of additional services such as breakfast clubs rests with local authorities.</p>

  <p>We have committed more than &#163;63 million over the next three years to support education authorities in rolling out the integrated community schools approach to all schools in their areas. Authorities and their partner agencies are also expected to make a financial commitment from their mainstream budgets and from other sources of funding available to them.</p>

  <p>We are monitoring the progress of roll-out through reports submitted annually by authorities to the Scottish Executive. Multi-disciplinary teams led by Her Majesty&#39;s Inspectorate of Schools are carrying out reviews of integrated community school clusters, and arrangements are being made for a national evaluation of the roll-out programme to start later this year.</p>

  <p>As we made clear in the previous answer, the most effective protection from Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS) is a completely smoke-free environment. The Scottish Executive does not endorse ventilation systems alone as offering complete protection against the health risks associated with passive smoking. While ventilation technology has the potential for reducing levels of exposure to second hand tobacco smoke and associated carcinogens provided it is properly operated and maintained, there remains no scientific evidence or consensus about whether there is any safe level of exposure to ETS.</p>

  <p>The aim of the statistical service in Scotland is to provide relevant and reliable statistical information, analysis and advice to meet the needs of government, business and the people of Scotland. It is the assessment of these needs which informs the process of gathering statistics.</p>

  <p>Users are consulted through an annual statistical plan, the SCOTSTAT user consultation network and various other formal and informal networks. When deciding to continue the collection of data or to introduce new collections, the statistical service considers the burden being placed on data providers, whether other sources are currently available, whether the proposed method of collection is the most appropriate and whether the data being collected is &quot;fit for purpose&quot;.</p>

  <p>Guidance on the use of mobile telecommunications equipment in Scottish hospitals and close to electromedical devices was provided in a letter on Mobile Phones - Possible Interference with Medical Devices (HDL(2001)21) issued by the Scottish Executive Health Department on 13 March 2001.</p>

  <p>In April 2001, the then Medical Devices Agency in England and Scottish Healthcare Supplies issued further advice on the potential for both the conventional Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) mobile phones and the new Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA) radio system to interfere with a range of medical devices. On the basis that the risk to medical devices from the use of TETRA handsets is comparable to that from GSM cellular phones, NHSScotland were advised that &quot;all personnel using TETRA handsets on hospital premises should be made aware of, and comply with, local policy on the use of cellular GSM phone systems&quot;.</p>
