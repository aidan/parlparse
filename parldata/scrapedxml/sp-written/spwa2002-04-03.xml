  <p>Since the figure for councils attended by Scottish ministers, given in answer to question S1W-22493, included two informal meetings of EU Ministers, the percentage given should have referred to the proportion of the total of all formal meetings of the EU Council of Ministers and informal meetings of EU Ministers.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what its response is to the report of the University Registrar&#146;s meeting held at Stirling University on 1 March 2002, which concluded that the Arts and Humanities Research Board (AHRB) is not able to &quot;separately identify awards made to Scottish students. They do not collect information on nationality as part of the application process. Therefore it will not be possible to prove whether &#163;1.4 million transferred from the Student Awards Agency for Scotland to the AHRB is ultimately spent on Scottish students&quot; and whether the transfer of postgraduate studentships in the humanities from a Scottish to a UK agency represents an accountable use of taxpayer&#146;s money.</p>

  <p>It is not normal practice for the Arts and Humanities Research Board (AHRB) or the Student Awards Agency for Scotland (SAAS) to record the nationality of postgraduate students, as nationality is not used as a criterion in determining eligibility for student support. Under the previous arrangements, whether or not a particular student fell to be dealt with by SAAS or the AHRB was determined by residency. The AHRB currently monitors and will continue to monitor the residency of postgraduate students. It will therefore remain possible to identify those students receiving awards from the AHRB who would previously have fallen within the remit of SAAS.</p>

  <p>Effective implementation of the <i>Framework for Mental Health Services in Scotland </i> is key to our ambition for a modern, responsive mental health service. The Mental Health and Well Being Support Group was established specifically to work with all the agencies on this objective and to monitor and report on the progress made. Area outcome reports are published within four weeks of each visit and are available on the Support Group's website at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/mhwbsg/">http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/mhwbsg/</a>.</p>

  <p>This activity reinforces the work of the Scottish Health Advisory Service, which actively reviews and reports on progress at NHS board level in delivering care and support for priority care groups, including mental health. Aspects of the performance of NHS bodies in delivering mental health services is also monitored through the new Performance Assessment Framework. Any significant problems highlighted will be discussed between the department and the NHS board at the annual accountability review. Agreed action will be set out in the accountability review summary letter, which will be published.</p>

  <p>The Executive has met with COSLA and many individual authorities to discuss the introduction of free local off-peak bus travel from October 2002, and there is an agreement in place to do so on a voluntary basis by enhancing existing concessionary travel schemes. In addition, the Executive established an Implementation Working Group, comprising representation from COSLA, ATCO, SPT and the bus industry, to take forward consideration of the many detailed issues associated with the introduction of these enhancements. It is for concessionary scheme managers to enter into detailed discussions with the bus industry at a local level in order to vary existing schemes to take account of these enhancements, and I understand that SPT as administrators of the joint Strathclyde scheme have begun such discussions.</p>

  <p>The Executive has reached agreement with COSLA and the local authorities to enhance existing concessionary travel schemes from October 2002 so as to provide free local off-peak bus travel for elderly and disabled people. The Executive is encouraging local authorities to consider whether the principle of free travel should be extended to local ferries, to ensure that elderly and disabled island residents have access to their nearest administrative centres.

  <p>Recent guidance from the Department of Transport, Local Government and the Regions, which co-ordinates UK TENs bids, indicates that a minimum grant threshold of &#8364;1 million is generally applied to TENs awards. Given that the EU may contribute no more than 10% of a scheme's investment cost, the total cost of a works project must usually be at least &#8364;10 million (&#163;6.25 million) to be eligible. The Dunragit Bypass is the only scheme on the A75 likely to meet this threshold. However, development of this scheme is still at an early stage and we have not yet taken a view on whether to make an application for TENs support.</p>

  <p>The level of the fee paid to a landfill operator for every tonne of waste disposed of at a site is a commercial decision for the operator of a landfill site. In Scotland and across the UK these gate charges are determined by supply and demand. Information on the effects of transfers of waste between different parts of the UK on charge levels is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>Each of the three water authorities have adopted slightly different policies but central to each is the continued use of those contractors who have a proven track record of cost effective delivery for them. Each authority operates a reduced-size list of contractors, derived in accordance with European Community procurement regulations.</p>

  <p>The Scottish water authorities cannot dictate to main contractors which sub contractors to utilise. Main contractors will use cost effective, reliable sub contractors who have geographical proximity to the project.</p>

  <p>The water authorities subcontract a wide variety of services from construction to IT support to estate management. The detailed information requested is not held centrally. It is estimated, however, that in relation to the authorities&#146; capital programmes only, between 85 - 95% of the money paid out will remain in the Scottish economy, regardless of the nationality of the contractor&#146;s base office.</p>
