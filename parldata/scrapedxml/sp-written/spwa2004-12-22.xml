  <p>Children&rsquo;s Panel Advisory Committees monitor panel member availability on an on-going basis. Target membership figures are not meaningful, as the number of panel members required in a local authority area at any time depends on the number of hearings called and the current level of availability of the existing members, which can vary. However, projections on recruitment needs for the coming year are determined in advance of the annual recruitment campaign.</p>

  <p>Since 2000 the national recruitment target has been exceeded by the number appointed. Turnover statistics can be referenced in the answer to question S2W-12921, answered on 22 December 2004. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="/webapp/wa.search">http://scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a>. Detailed information on projected recruitment needs compared with numbers of new panel members appointed since 2000 is given in a table <em>Children's Panel Member Recruitment by Local Authority Area, 1999-2000 &ndash; 2003-04</em>, which has been placed in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 34685).</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive liaises closely with all partners within the children&rsquo;s hearings system on an on-going basis in order to identify and address issues of concern.</p>

  <p>In 2002, independent research was undertaken to identify reasons why panel members resign. A retention strategy was prepared and consulted on with panel interests. The research and the strategy are available on the children&rsquo;s hearings website <a href="http://www.childrens-hearings.co.uk" target="_blank">www.childrens-hearings.co.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>The strategy has been monitored by the Publicity Working Group, which advises the Scottish Executive on recruitment and comprises representatives from all parts of the hearings system. Most measures have been implemented.</p>

  <p>All civil servants are required to act in accordance with the terms of the Civil Service Code, including their contact with MSPs. The Civil Service Code states that the constitutional and practical role of the civil service is to assist the duly constituted government of the day, with integrity, honesty, impartiality and objectivity. Specific guidance on contacts with MSPs is available for Scottish Executive staff, which refers to the principles of the Civil Service Code. The Scottish Executive staff directory has been available to MSPs and their staff since April 2001, through the Scottish Parliament intranet site. Currently there are no plans to change policy on MSPs having contact with civil servants.</p>

  <p>Future recruitment</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has experienced a period of growth since devolution leading to relatively high levels of recruitment. Given the tight constraints on administration costs recently announced we are clear that this will not continue. It is not possible to predict exact recruitment numbers over the coming five years. However, there is likely to be a continued need for some limited external recruitment to address turnover and to allow the Scottish Executive to recruit for specific specialist and professional skills to meet business needs.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive will ensure transparency in the delivery of efficiency savings.</p>

  <p>Paragraph 13 of <em>Building a Better Scotland: Efficient Government &ndash; Securing Efficiency, Effectiveness and Productivity</em> states that we will publish technical notes on the plans for cash-releasing savings by March 2005. Paragraph 24 states that we will publish technical notes on the plans for time-releasing efficiency savings by April 2005.</p>

  <p>Paragraph 48 states that departments and public bodies will be required to develop project plans for Efficient Government projects, which include clear milestones, identified lead and supporting roles, governance arrangements, measures for identifying and tracking benefits, and risk management.</p>

  <p>Paragraph 51 states that individual project plans will be built into the Executive&rsquo;s performance management systems. Departmental plans will set out how Efficient Government will continue to be taken forward across the Scottish public sector, and will include expectations for efficiency gains from each and every public body.</p>

  <p><em>Building a Better Scotland: Efficient Government</em> set out the right way forward for Scotland. Gershon also includes a LOOK target for civil service job cuts the Executive does not believe this is the right way to go about this.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive published a table of cash-releasing efficiency savings, by portfolio, on page 4 of <em>Building a Better Scotland: Efficient Government &ndash; Securing Efficiency, Effectiveness and Productivity</em> . Paragraph 24 of the document commits the Executive to publishing technical notes on the identified projects to secure &pound;300 million per annum of additional time-releasing efficiencies by April 2005.</p>

  <p>The responsibilities of Scottish portfolios differ considerably from UK Government Departments since UK Government Departments are responsible for areas of policy that are reserved to Westminster. Furthermore, we are taking a different approach to our efficiency review. As the responsibilities for the Scottish Executive portfolios and UK Departments are different and we are both taking different approaches to our efficiency review, it would serve no useful purpose to draw a direct comparison.</p>

  <p>Yes. The UK Government launched a procurement exercise, which included Scotland, for vaccinia immunoglobulin on 19 November 2004 to augment the small strategic stock currently stockpiled to support preparedness for mass vaccination on a UK-wide basis.</p>

  <p>Expressions of interest for the supply of vaccinia immunoglobulin have been received and are being reviewed. Selected suppliers will then be invited to submit tenders. Information about how much vaccinia immunoglobulin can be produced and the timescale for its supply will only become apparent at the tender evaluation stage. A decision on the quantity to be purchased will then be made.</p>
