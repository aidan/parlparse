However, information obtained from Lothian and Borders Police suggests that, in line with the arrangements laid down by Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland in the Manual of Guidance for the Test Purchase of Alcohol in Scotland, all 17 premises which failed on the first visit were subsequently revisited.

  <p>Only four years of data is available for the number of liquor licences suspended. This is because this information was not collected before 2003. The number of off-sales liquor licences suspended in 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006 is given in the following table:</p>

  <p>The legislation under which these licences were granted does not make provision for the revocation of a licence. However, legislation has recently been passed which does make such a provision and will come fully into force in 2009.</p>

  <p>Reducing the incidence of illegal sales to underage drinkers is a key priority for the Scottish Government as evidenced by our decision to roll-out alcohol test purchasing arrangements across Scotland. The benefits of this are now being seen as licensing boards the suspend licences of rogue retailers caught breaking the law.In addition, the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005 increases the penalties associated with underage sales from a &pound;1,000 fine to a &pound;5,000 fine or a three month jail sentence or both. The act also introduced Licensing Standards Officers who will ensure that licensed premises are operating in accordance with their licence conditions. The 2005 act comes fully into force in September 2009.</p>

  <p>The government is committed to involving children and young people in influencing policy and service delivery. We are taking forward a range of specific consultations designed for young people, working in partnership with the wider youth sector.We are also encouraging local authorities to consult with children and young people as part of their wider community engagement on service delivery. Community Planning Partnerships have a statutory duty to engage with young people in their area.Locally it is up to NHS health boards to engage their stakeholders. Our Better Health Better Care action plan will prompt fresh thinking on how we involve and engage with patients, including children and young people.</p>

  <p>Different circumstances will apply depending on how individuals pay their council tax and on procedures in place in each council area.

  <p>Local authorities are under a duty to involve all parents in their children&rsquo;s education and, in doing so, should take account of any communication needs that the family may have. The guidance for local authorities on the implementation of the Scottish Schools (Parental Involvement) Act 2006 states that &quot;families are not to be discriminated against on grounds of race, disability, gender, sexual orientation, language, faith or belief and age.&quot; The guidance also makes clear that &quot;education authorities should take into account factors that may act as barriers, discourage or inhibit parents&rsquo; involvement in their children's education or with the school.&quot;A toolkit providing further advice on the implementation of the act also includes a checklist for authorities to consider when drawing up their strategies for parental involvement. This refers to the need to consider parents whose circumstances make it difficult for them to be involved in their children&rsquo;s education.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to providing support to all parents, including those who are deaf or who have a disability.Services for parents include the Scottish child care website <a href="http://www.scottishchildcare.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.scottishchildcare.gov.uk</a> which provides links to local child care information services and a range of parenting support organisations and websites. Local authorities and voluntary organisations offering child care and parenting information are responsible for accessibility policies in relation to those specific services.Under the Disability Discrimination Act, any organisation providing services to the public (including local authorities and voluntary and private sector organisations) must not discriminate against disabled people in the way they provide their services. This may include making &quot;reasonable adjustments&quot; to the way services are delivered in order to enable access.</p>

  <p>The information requested is only available from March 2007. The tables present information as at March, June, September and December 2007. They do not represent the percentages of people in each parliamentary constituency who are registered. Registrations (numerator) are based on the postcode of the practice where the patient has registered with a general dental practitioner. The population (denominator) is based on where the patient resides, in this case the Scottish parliamentary constituency. In some cases, the number of registrations may exceed the actual number of &quot;people&quot; in the chosen population.Percentage of People Registered with an NHS dentist; by Age Group in Each Parliamentary Constituency in the South of Scotland Region</p>

  <p>&pound;23.7 million was allocated to NHS boards in 2007-08 for drug treatment and rehabilitation services. A further &pound;2.5 million was allocated to support the work of alcohol and drug action teams.NHS boards may also use some of their unified budget for drug treatment services. For example, the costs and fees for methadone mixture in 2006-07 amounted to &pound;12.6 million.&pound;2 million was also allocated to NHS boards in 2007-08 to provide treatment and care to those affected by hepatitis C, the vast majority of whom will be current or former drug users.</p>

  <p>&pound;24.6 million has been allocated to health boards in 2008-09, from the Justice portfolio alone, for drug treatment and rehabilitation services. A further &pound;2.65 million has been allocated to health boards in 2008-09 to support the work of Alcohol and Drug Action Teams.The spending review proposes that, subject to parliamentary approval, &pound;32 million in 2009-10 and &pound;32.8 million in 2010-11 from the Justice portfolio is allocated to tackling drug misuse. A decision will be made in due course about how much of these monies will be allocated to health boards.&pound;3.7 million has been allocated to health boards in 2008-9 to provide treatment and care to people affected by hepatitis C, the vast majority of whom will be current or former drug users. The spending review proposes that, subject to parliamentary approval, &pound;13.6 million in 2009-10 and &pound;19.4 million in 2010-11 will be made available to treat people affected by hepatitis C.Health boards may also use resources from their unified budget for drug treatment services. The work by the Auditor General on the scale and effectiveness of drugs expenditure will give us a better understanding of how much money is spent by local partners on drug use.</p>

  <p>No discussions have taken place with representatives of the Argyll and Bute Council or Jura Community Council on this matter. It is the council&rsquo;s responsibility to resolve any conflict between the works it has commissioned at Port Askaig and the operation of its own ferry services to Jura during very low water conditions. I understand that the council is currently reviewing the timetable for its Jura service to ensure that an appropriate service can continue to be provided and has begun trials on the use of the new fixed ramp.In the meantime, I am pleased to note that CalMac Ferries Ltd, following consultation with the Jura Community Council, has agreed to divert until further notice the 1800hrs sailings from Kennacraig to Port Ellen on Mondays and Fridays from Port Askaig, where the vessel previously remained berthed overnight, enabling overnight emergency cover to be maintained to Jura.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are responsible for planning and delivering services to meet the health needs of their resident population, funded through the general annual allocation. This includes funding the costs of orphan and ultra-orphan drugs which have been approved for use by the Scottish Medicines Consortium, or where there has been a positive outcome following an exceptional case review.NHS boards operate collective risk share arrangements for a defined range of services or therapies where the incidence of the condition to be treated is unpredictable and sporadic and where the effect is so financially significant that individual NHS boards could be at financial risk. A small number of orphan drugs are included in these arrangements.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has made clear its intention to move from student loans to a system of means-tested grants. To support this, we have allocated &pound;30 million in 2010-11 to begin this transition. &pound;40 million is the projected efficiency saving that would be made a result of this policy change. By consulting on these issues later this year, we will open up a number of other possible scenarios.

  <p>The key outputs from further and higher education are derived from the already well-established arrangements whereby, in return for the main recurrent grants paid to colleges and universities:institutions are required to deliver defined volumes of learning provision, and research-related funding reflects the volume and quality of research undertaken.As noted in <em>Efficiency Delivery Plans - May 2008, for the 2008-11 Efficiency Programme</em> , the Scottish Government plans to deliver cash releasing efficiencies by delivering an actual resource efficiency through colleges and universities which will provide the same service at a reduced cost.</p>

  <p>Since 2002 appointments to the office of judge have been made on the recommendation of the independent Judicial Appointments Board. The board&rsquo;s remit includes considering ways of recruiting a judiciary which is as representative as possible of the community they serve.</p>

  <p>The board has set up a Diversity Working Group to assist them in fulfilling this aspect of their remit. The group is tasked with gathering evidence in relation to diversity among the legal profession, and considering ways for increasing the proportion of people from under-represented groups who apply for judicial office, reportings its findings to the board. The Scottish Government is supporting the board in this work.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is sympathetic to the concerns of small-scale renewable energy scheme developers over delays in connecting to the electricity grid. We consider that delays in gaining connections to the grid system place a significant barrier in recognising the huge potential of our renewable energy sector. Our view is that change is required both in grid management and in the current system of &quot;queuing&quot;.Responsibility for connections to the Transmission network is a matter primarily for the UK Government. The Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR) has, in conjunction with the industry regulator Ofgem, been conducting a review of grid access arrangements over the last several months in which we are participating.We are also in continuous discussions with BERR, National Grid and the owners of the Transmission Network in Scotland, Scottish Power and Scottish and Southern Energy, on these issue and are committed to doing all that we can to ensure that the system for connections does not involve unnecessary delays for viable projects. These discussions are continuing at both official and ministerial level.</p>

We will continue to engage with the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR), National Grid and other stakeholders and press for a more sensible grid regime which gives priority access to projects with relevant planning consents and financing in place.New hydropower plants of all sizes are eligible for support under the Renewables Obligation (Scotland).</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises that grid reinforcements will be necessary if we are to capitalise on Scotland&rsquo;s renewables potential, especially in more remote areas such as the Highlands and Islands, where the resource is often strongest.We also believe that a more flexible approach to grid management could have a positive impact at both a transmission and distribution network level and could help to unlock significant renewables potential, prior to grid upgrades. We are participating in the current Transmission Access Review and urging the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform to quickly and effectively resolve this issue.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to developing a diverse clean energy mix, one which includes both hydropower and wind.We do not hold commercial information relating to the cost of developing loch-fed mini hydro schemes. However, the proposals for banding of the renewables obligation do reflect, more generally, the relative costs and maturity of different technologies.</p>

  <p>We believe there is significant potential for further hydro development in Scotland. The Forum for Renewable Energy Development in Scotland (FREDS) has commissioned a Scottish Hydro Resource Study which is examining the scale and location of this potential. The Study is due for completion shortly, with the Forum expected to report to ministers later in the summer.The Scottish Government will continue to engage with National Grid, Ofgem and other key stakeholders to seek solutions to transmission issues, including those affecting the development of future hydro schemes.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is supporting the development of a diverse mix of renewable energy technologies through a range of initiatives. This includes providing capital grant support for wave and tidal energy, biomass and hydrogen fuel cells projects, and our proposed amendments to the Renewables Obligation (Scotland), which will provide additional support for a range of emerging technologies.Under Section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989, we are currently considering proposals for eight hydro power projects and one tidal energy project.</p>

However, irrespective of how earnings may rise in the next three years, the number of Scottish students receiving support would be unaffected as under current funding rules all eligible students are entitled to at least a non-means tested loan.</p>

  <p>The latest year for which data are available for students receiving some form of support is for 2006-07. The table below provides data on the number of Scottish students receiving support from Student Awards Agency for Scotland (SAAS) in 2006-07 by parental/spousal residual income after allowable deductions. In 2006-07, 114,610 Scottish students received some form of support.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government carry out an annual teacher workforce planning exercise to estimate future requirements for teachers and the number of new teachers that require to be trained. That exercise is overseen by a Group with representatives of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, the Association of Directors of Education, The General Teaching Council for Scotland, teacher unions, Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education Higher Education Institutes and the Scottish Funding Council. We are currently working with higher education institutions to deliver on current forecasts of 20,000 new teachers in training by 2011.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-13207 by Maureen Watt on 3 June 2008, how many of the teachers completing their probationary years will have permanent teaching posts in August 2008, broken down by local authority.</p>

  <p>Local authorities are responsible for the employment of teachers and the form of contract. The information requested is not held centrally. It is also unlikely that local authorities will have finalised their staffing allocations for next session at this time of year.We have provided a record funding settlement of &pound;34.9 billion over the spending review period. Under the terms of the concordat we have agreed specific arrangements and sufficient funds for local authorities to maintain teacher numbers at the 2007 level against a backdrop of falling school rolls. Those arrangements will provide increasing opportunities for probationer teachers to find employment.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has not undertaken any studies into radar mitigation near to prospective wind farm sites. But we are in regular discussion with developers, communities, airport operators, aviation organisations and the Ministry of Defence on mitigation pans and are supporting a UK initiative to promote solutions to the impact of wind farms on aviation safety.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recommends that developers engage with aviation organisations and airport operators at an early stage in the design process. It is the responsibility of the developer and the relevant aviation consultee to develop a solution that can be applied in each case.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is working with UK Government departments and aviation bodies such as the Civil Aviation Authority, National Air Traffic Services and Scottish airports.The discussions seek to promote general solutions to potential radar interference from proposed wind farms, although it is for individual developers to promote solutions in specific cases.</p>
