  <p>We will bring forward the commencement order in due course. As indicated in the answer given to question S1W-19447 on 12 November 2001, the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 is the first part of our programme of property law reform, and we will assess the appropriate date for commencement when the next bill in the programme &ndash; the Title Conditions Bill &ndash; has been enacted. This bill was introduced to Parliament on 6 June. The implementation of both pieces of legislation must be carefully timed so as to ensure an orderly transition from one system of land tenure to another.</p>

  <p>The air service between Barra and Glasgow will be tendered on a one-year basis from 1 April 2003. There have been significant transport developments in the Western Isles including the provision of an enhanced ferry service on the Sound of Barra next year. Tendering the air service for one year provides a substantial overlap when both ferry and air services will be operating. An informed decision can then be taken about the future of the air service.</p>

  <p>All asylum seekers entering Scotland have a health check on arrival which takes account of their physical and mental health needs. NHS Greater Glasgow, which has received the majority of asylum seekers, has established a dedicated mental health support liaison service headed by a psychologist which is responsible for the assessment of asylum seekers as they enter Scotland. The service is part of a multi-agency asylum seeker and refugee team and is involved in training frontline staff both within hospitals and community-based services. Health visitors and the primary care team are well placed to support the mental health needs of their patients which include support and advice for families under stress.</p>

  <p>All asylum seekers entering Scotland have a health check on arrival which takes account of their physical and mental health needs. Those who are considered to be at risk of tuberculosis after the initial health assessment, by virtue of symptoms, history or any likelihood of exposure, are tested and followed up within the local health care system. However, tuberculosis is not considered to be a major health hazard amongst asylum seekers and refugees when compared to other groups.</p>

  <p>The association between smoking and lung cancer is well known; 90% of lung cancer patients are smokers or ex-smokers. The Scottish Executive published Smoking Cessation Guidelines in 2001 and &#163;1 million is available annually for smoking cessation services and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT).</p>

  <p>Information and advice on the effects of smoking, symptoms of lung cancer and where to seek medical help is readily available from a variety of sources including, for example, well women and well men clinics, Healthy Living Centres, GPs&rsquo; surgeries and hospitals.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive issued <i>Scottish Referral Guidelines for Suspected Cancer</i> in April 2002 to facilitate appropriate referral between primary and secondary care for patients whom a GP suspects may have cancer. The guidelines are also accessible to the wider public on the Cancer in Scotland website at <a href="www.show.scot.nhs.uk/sehd/cancerinscotland" target="_blank">www.show.scot.nhs.uk/sehd/cancerinscotland</a>.</p>

  <p>The information requested for 1999 onwards is given on page number 7 of <i>Examination Results in Scottish Schools 1999-2001</i> , published by the Scottish Executive in 2001. A copy of this publication is available in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 17908).</p>

  <p>Prior to 1999, these statistics are presented on the basis of an individual year, rather than cumulative attainment by the end of sixth year. They are not, therefore, directly comparable with the statistics from 1999 onwards.

  <p>I announced on 14 December 2000 that Environmentally Sensitive Area schemes (ESA) would close to new applications on 31 December 2000. All farmers and crofters in Scotland are eligible to apply to join the Rural Stewardship Scheme, including those with an existing ESA scheme agreement.</p>

  <p>I undertook a wide-ranging consultation exercise in March of this year, on proposals for a number of changes to the operation of agri-environment schemes as part of a process of improving the management of the limited resources contained within the Rural Development Plan for Scotland. One of these changes is that, with effect from 1 November, proposals to vary an existing ESA scheme agreement will be accepted only where there is a clear environmental benefit, and the change is affordable within the agreed financial limits of the agreement.</p>

  <p>I intend to consult early in 2003 on options for continued agri-environmental support when farmers&rsquo; and crofters&rsquo; existing ESA agreements come to an end.</p>

  <p>Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd&rsquo;s decision to provide some of its services between Gourock and Dunoon using a passenger-only, rather than a passenger and vehicle, vessel is a matter for the company because only the passenger element of the Gourock to Dunoon service is approved by ministers and eligible for subsidy. Scottish ministers have no locus in decisions made by the company on services provided outwith the undertaking.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has recently completed consultation on a draft service specification for Clyde and Hebrides ferry services planned for the period 2004-09. Final decisions arising from that consultation have yet to be taken.</p>

In addition, one Green Goddess broke down in Stirling on Saturday 26 October and another near Redford Barracks in Edinburgh on 12 November during their road test.

  <p>No such flood prevention scheme is before the Scottish Executive for its determination. However, because of sustained objections, the City of Edinburgh Council passed to the Scottish Executive its proposals to carry out works relating to a culvert overflow under the Roads (Scotland) Act 1984 in the Redford Road area of Colinton.</p>

  <p>Before reaching a decision on this matter, the Scottish ministers must be fully aware of all the facts surrounding the case. This is done by exchange of correspondence between the parties which is currently on-going. In view of the future involvement of Scottish ministers in determining this matter, it would not be appropriate for me to make any further comment at this time.</p>

  <p>The Children and Young People&rsquo;s Grant Scheme aims to assist voluntary and other organisations in developing services and promoting the welfare of children and young people in Scotland.</p>

  <p>It did not, strictly speaking replace previous schemes but it was anticipated, and has proved to be the case, that organisations working with children and young people who had received support through section 10 of the Further Education (Approved Associations) (Scotland) Grant Regulations 1989 would continue to be supported under the new scheme.</p>

  <p>The Children and Young People&rsquo;s Grant Scheme makes available three types of funding: core funding, project funding or training.</p>

  <p>In the year 2001-02 (the first year of the Children and Young People&rsquo;s Grant Scheme) we were able to provide Training Grant of just over &#163;62,000, or 2.3% of the total allocated. The amounts awarded to each organisation are given in the answer to question S1W-31116 today.

  <p>It was made clear during the consultation process that every home with a long-term life would be fully modernised to the Glasgow standard within 10.5 years after transfer. Each Local Housing Organisation is in the process of producing a management and investment plan for their area and final decisions about the investment strategy for the transferred stock will be made following discussions with the Glasgow Housing Association.</p>

  <p>The draft framework decision on the confiscation of crime-related proceeds, instrumentalities and property is still being negotiated within the EU and thus the Scottish Executive is continuing its determination of what the implications might be for Scotland. However, the UK, including Scotland, already has comprehensive provision in relation to confiscation of the proceeds of crime as provided for by the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.</p>

  <p>The draft Framework Decision (FD) on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to financial penalties envisages financial penalties imposed in one member state being enforced in another member state, if this proved necessary and if there was a request from the issuing state to this effect. The terms of this FD have not yet been finalised. However, the principle behind mutual recognition is that a judicial decision taken in one member state is accepted and enforced as it stands in another. It is not thought at this stage that this FD will have any significant impact on Scots law.</p>

  <p>The draft Council decision on the investigation and prosecution of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes is still under discussion and negotiation at EU level. The Scottish Executive is studying the decision to determine what the implications might be for Scotland.

  <p>No, numbers are currently about 260 but they have reached that number in recent months. The courts decide how many people to send to custody.

  <p>The Environmental Impact Assessment (Scotland) Regulations 1999 implement Council Directive 85/337/EEC, as amended by Council Directive 97/11/EC. These regulations, which came into force on 1 August 1999, replace The Environmental Assessment (Scotland) Regulations 1988. Guidance on the regulations is provided by Circular 15/1999.</p>

  <p>The changes that affect trunk roads comprise:</p>

  <p>i. Changes to the definition of project types for which an Environmental Statement is mandatory. As well as motorways and special roads, these now include the construction, realignment and/or widening of roads, which would be 10 kilometres or more in a continuous length, to provide four or more lanes.</p>

  <p>ii. The introduction of a screening process to determine whether an Environmental Statement shall be published for other trunk roads projects. Each project is assessed on a case-by-case basis against criteria defined within the regulations.</p>

  <p>Major trunk roads projects which do not require an Environmental Statement remain subject to environmental impact assessment in accordance with procedures set out in Volume 11 of the <i>Design Manual for Roads and Bridges</i> (DMRB), published in 1993. Changes to the DMRB since 1993 have comprised revisions to the assessment of water quality and drainage (February 1998) and air quality (most recently in March 2000, to reflect changes to The Air Quality Strategy).</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive set up the Scottish public sector property website to speed up sales and lettings of public sector property and expose it 24 hours a day to a wider market than other property marketing methods.</p>

  <p>It cost &#163;12,000 to establish, &#163;9,470 running costs in the first year and will cost &#163;9,000 for each of the succeeding two years, all plus VAT. There are currently over 1,700 properties currently on the site.</p>

  <p>Over time we expect there will be a reduction in advertising and marketing costs.</p>

  <p>No directions have been given to Scottish Water in relation to this incident.</p>

  <p>I wrote to Scottish Water on 26 September to advise them that ministers had considered whether a general scheme of compensation should be introduced for customers in the areas affected by the Boil Water notice in the Glasgow area.</p>

  <p>Our view was that it would not be appropriate to introduce such a scheme. This view was based on a number of factors as follows:</p>

  <p>an outbreak of illness appeared to have been prevented;</p>

  <p>bottled water was supplied to vulnerable customers;</p>

  <p>water could be rendered safe by boiling;</p>

  <p>there was no significant interruption to supply, and</p>

  <p>there was no obvious breach of Scottish Water&rsquo;s customer code of practice.</p>

  <p>Ministers acknowledged, however, that Scottish Water would have to consider claims for compensation made to it, and handle them on the basis of the facts and circumstances of each particular case.</p>

  <p>The regulation and safety of medicines is reserved and is the responsibility of the Medicines Control Agency.</p>

  <p>European and American regulatory authorities have recommended that vaccine manufacturers should phase out their use of thimerosal wherever possible as a precautionary measure. Manufacturers are actively developing research programmes to replace or reduce the level of thimerosal in vaccines. This may take time because the manufacturers are required to ensure that the replacement or elimination of thimerosal does not affect the safety or efficacy of the final product.</p>
