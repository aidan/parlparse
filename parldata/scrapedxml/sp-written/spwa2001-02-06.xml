  <p>ILAs are a way of helping people to invest in their own learning with financial support from the Executive. The initial response has been encouraging. Following on from the pilot schemes the initiative has been fully operational in Scotland from 1 September 2000. By the end of November more than 28,000 accounts had been opened, against the target of 100,000 by 2002, and over 7,000 people had already begun learning supported by their ILA.

  <p>A range of data is being collected to enable us to assess over time the use made of Individual Learning Accounts (ILAs) and the key characteristics of ILA holders, including age group, gender, occupation, area of residence and type, subject and level of learning undertaken.</p>

  <p>The data will reflect both the universal character of the scheme and its promotion, in particular, to the socially excluded and those in SMEs. Key statistics will be provided to the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee during the review of the operation of the scheme in the autumn.</p>

  <p>Neither the Scottish Executive Inquiry Reporters Unit (SEIRU) nor the Planning Audit Unit undertake the monitoring described. As set out in paragraph 65 of National Planning Policy Guideline 1, it is for individual local authorities to review their performance at appeal and take action as appropriate. In recent times, SEIRU has led a number of training seminars for both councillors and officers. These have been intended to enable more effective participation by planning authorities in the appeal process. More general training is also given by providing speakers from SEIRU for conferences and seminars attended by planning staff from both the public and private sectors.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-11898 by Sarah Boyack on 27 December 2000, what specific measures through the Scottish passenger rail franchise it will take to ensure that the rolling stock for rural services and less profitable lines is of a high standard and of the same standard as that used on more profitable and popular lines.</p>

  <p>We intend that our directions and guidance for the renewal of the Scottish passenger rail franchise will include references to improving the overall quality and specification of rolling stock in use across the entire Scottish passenger railway network. These references will not, however, specify the type of vehicle to be used on particular routes.</p>

  <p>As a non-departmental public body, established by the Transport Act 2000, the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) will be subject to external audit. Accountability for funding of the SRA by the Scottish Executive for the Scottish passenger rail franchise will be included in the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions&#8217; Accounts Direction and financial framework for the authority. The financial framework takes account of the requirements of the Scottish Executive.</p>
