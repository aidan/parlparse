  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive for what reason Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) guideline 87, Management of oesophageal and gastric cancer, states that &quot;Oesophageal and gastric cancers occur mainly in people over 55 years of age&quot; when many cases occur in people under the age of 55.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) Guideline 87 is intended to guide the management of any patient with oesophageal or gastric cancer, regardless of age. It does not state that these cancers occur exclusively in the over 55 age range. However, the incidence of these cancers is higher in people over 55 years of age, with 91% of oesophageal cancer and 92.5% of gastric cancer cases occurring in people over 55 years of age, between 2003-07. Use of the term &quot;mainly&quot; reflects these data.</p>

  <p>Further information on the incidence of oesophageal cancer can be found at http://www.isdscotland.org/isd/1493.html, and information on the incidence of gastric cancer can be found at:</p>

  <p>Better Cancer Care, An Action Plan recognised that early detection of cancer is crucial and the earlier it can be diagnosed, the better the chance of a positive outcome.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to improving awareness of possible cancer symptoms amongst members of the public and medical staff. The Scottish Cancer Taskforce (SCT) has been working with the Scottish Cancer Coalition in the area of awareness raising of cancer generally and recently held a national workshop to consider these issues in more detail. It will consider specific actions to help improve the awareness of cancer symptoms at a future meeting.</p>

  <p>Action has been taken to ensure doctors across the country have up to date referral guidelines to ensure patients presenting with possible symptoms of oesophageal cancer are quickly and efficiently referred for further investigation. Such guidelines include SIGN Guideline 87 on the Management of Oesophageal and Gastric Cancer and SIGN Guideline 68 on Dyspepsia (which is due to be updated this year). Managed clinical networks use these guidelines to develop patient referral and care pathways.</p>

  <p>Cancer services in Scotland have developed and improved significantly in recent years, with more doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals and state of the art equipment in all five cancer centres.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Centre for Telehealth (SCT) continues to support and encourage the clinical use of teledermatology. The SCT have indicated that the consensus view is that the clinical climate is not yet right for a national teledermatology solution. The SCT has recently become part of NHS24. As a service delivery and improvement organisation NHS24 will provide a national focus for telehealth related activity. NHS24 and the SCT are developing a national telehealth strategy and business plan in consultation with stakeholders. Next steps for projects such as the teledermatology project will be considered as part of this process which will be complete by April 2010.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to predict precisely all other circumstances. It might, however, include circumstances where non-lethal measures cannot be used because of potential impacts on other marine life. It might include circumstances where non-lethal measures prove ineffective against individual seals.

  <p>This information is not collected centrally.</p>

  <p>The new seal licensing system set out in the Marine (Scotland) Bill will, for the first time, collect information on anti-predator nets and acoustic deterrents as part of the licence application process.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-30205 by Richard Lochhead on 15 January 2010, whether the new seal licence system will ensure that all non-lethal measures are used by operators of aquaculture and fisheries equipment and whether a record will be kept of those non-lethal measures that prove to be ineffective and the reasons for their ineffectiveness.</p>

  <p>It may not be practical to insist that all non-lethal measures are used by fisheries or fish farms before a licence can be issued.</p>

  <p>There are a wide variety of non-lethal measures available. It is known that some are ineffective, or not suitable, in some areas, because of their impacts on other marine mammals.</p>

  <p>The new seal licence system will, for the first time, allow information on non-lethal measures currently in use and their perceived effectiveness to be collected for evaluation with a view to making recommendations for best practice.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-30205 by Richard Lochhead on 15 January 2010, when the cetacean-friendly seal scarer will be field tested and whether its use, if found to be effective, will be made mandatory for operators of aquaculture and fisheries equipment.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has recently approved funding to support the field testing process and this will begin soon. It would be wrong at this stage to prejudge the potential results of this process. It is, however, hoped that such non-lethal measures will eventually replace lethal options in most cases.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many seals have been culled under the Moray Firth Seal Management Plan; whether there are plans to extend the scheme across Scotland and, if so, how many seals might be culled in each year; how the plan relates to the new seal licence system, and whether culling will be used in cases where licences to shoot seals are not granted.</p>

  <p>There is no culling of seals in Scotland. The Moray Firth Seal Management Plan permits limited local seal management under licence conditions to protect fisheries.</p>

  <p>The following table is a record of seals licensed to be shot and actual seals shot since the plan started in 2005.</p>

  <p>The new seal licence system under the Marine (Scotland) Bill will control seal management across Scotland from 2011. Applications for a licence may be submitted by those seeking to manage seals in order to protect their fisheries or fish farms. Applications will be judged against strict criteria including information on damage and the effectiveness of non-lethal alternatives.</p>

  <p>It is not possible at this point to predict how many seal licence applications will be received, how many will be granted, how many seals will be licensed or how many might be killed under licence.</p>

  <p>Under the Marine (Scotland) Bill it will be an offence to kill or take seals without a licence.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-27902 on 25 January 2010 as it provides information on the number of special advisers and pay bands. Information relating to an individual&rsquo;s pay band is regarded as personal. The full year cost of the current team of special advisers is estimated to be &pound;765,000.
