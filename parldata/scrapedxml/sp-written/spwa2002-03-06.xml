  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it accepts the scientific findings by Professor Emeritus John Robinson of the Scottish Agricultural College, Aberdeen, of 29 November 1991 that in typical weather conditions 10% of the national sheepflock could die over the lambing season as a result of the current ban on fishmeal in ruminant feedstuff.</p>

  <p>In 1998, 33% of men and 15% of women aged 16-64 reported drinking above recommended weekly limits (21 units for men and 14 units for women). Twenty-six per cent of all women and 44% of all men reported drinking more than twice the recommended daily benchmarks on their heaviest drinking day. This information is taken from the 1998 <em>Scottish Health Survey</em> , a copy of which is available in the Parliament's Reference Centre (Bib. number 10471).</p>

  <p>The programme is administered by local authorities and housing associations for their own houses as part of the day to day administration of their stock. The amount of fees payable to Eaga for administering the programme in the private sector will depend on the number of systems installed, which in turn depends on the number of eligible households coming forward. It is therefore not possible at present to estimate the total cost, but fees for work in each dwelling will represent less than 7% of the average grant.</p>

  <p>Officials from the Justice Department are currently chairing the Implementation Group set up to carry into effect the recommendations of the Lord Advocate's Working Group on Child Witness Support. These recommendations cover a wide range of issues related to the experience of children within the criminal justice system. One of the major recommendations relates to supporting children prior to and at court and highlights the role of a child witness officer. Another central recommendation tackles the task of improving the conduct of interviews and precognitions with young witnesses. The implementation of the recommendations seeks to adopt an approach to child witnesses which recognises their vulnerability and serves their particular interests within the existing criminal justice system.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive will also shortly be publishing a consultation paper looking at whether further changes to the law of evidence are required to assist vulnerable witnesses (including children). The paper will look at the current statutory definition of "vulnerable person" and discuss possible changes to the special measures available at the moment to assist such witnesses when giving evidence, as well as possible new special measures.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to making special grant payments to Fife Council totalling &#163;2.384 million spread over financial years 2000-01 to 2003-04 inclusive, in support of additional rail services in Fife. In addition, the Executive are committed to providing extra rolling stock for operation on the Fife commuter lines. The Executive is currently assessing the best option as to how to achieve this.</p>

  <p>In the longer term, the lengthening of platforms in Fife under the Strategic Rail Authority's Incremental Output Statement programme will facilitate the operation of longer trains. We would also expect the successful bidder for the re-letting of the ScotRail franchise, which expires in March 2004, to come forward with innovative proposals on how it will address overcrowding across the Scottish railway network.</p>

  <p>A reduction in the number of people killed or seriously injured in road accidents by 18%.</p>

  <p>A reduction in the number of children killed or seriously injured by 25%.</p>

  <p>A reduction in the slight casualty rate by 4%.</p>

  <p>These are part of a range of targets set following consultation with the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland and Conveners of Police Authorities. Progress towards the targets will be monitored jointly by forces, police authorities and the Executive, but it will be for each force to decide how best to contribute to the national targets, taking account of local needs and priorities and the contribution that can be made by other bodies.</p>

  <p>First round bids had to be submitted by 14 December 2001 and there is a deadline of 30 September 2002 for second round bids. Scottish Executive Education Department circular 8/2001 indicated that "there may be some constraint on the extent to which unsuccessful first round bids can be reconsidered in the second round". This remains the position.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not hold the information about individual pupils and their families that would be needed to answer this question.</p>

  <p>The Inland Revenue publishes statistical information about Working Families Tax Credit and the Department for Work and Pensions publishes statistical information about income support, housing benefit and council tax benefit. These publications are freely available on the relevant department's websites at:</p>

  <p>The information is not available in the form requested. Definitive information and figures on class sizes will only be available once the results of the September 2001 School Census have been validated.</p>

  <p>However, in order to gauge the progress made by local authorities in meeting the Programme for Government commitment to reduce P1-P3 classes to 30 pupils or less, Scottish Executive officials have made enquiries of education authorities. Due to pupil movements within the school year, the figures change constantly, but they give a provisional picture in advance of validated data being available through the School Census results.</p>

  <p>Officials have identified a total of 13 classes that did not comply with The Education (Lower Primary Class Sizes) (Scotland) Regulations 1999. In each case, action is being taken by the education authority to resolve the problem. Of the other P1-P3 classes with more than 30 pupils, 61 had two teachers present in the classroom and 17 had "excepted pupils", as defined in the relevant regulations.</p>

  <p>These figures contrast with 939 P1-P3 classes of over 30 pupils in 1998 - the year before the class size programme began.</p>

  <p>This will depend on the school and the community. The principal purpose of a school in any community, rural or urban, is as a place in which pupils should receive education and learning directed to the development of their personality, talents and mental and physical abilities. Many schools also have a role in providing for other uses and activities, both for the children who attend the school and the wider community.</p>

  <p>The SPCB has not yet set any energy saving targets. The Parliament currently occupies a mixture of leased and serviced accommodation, making it difficult to obtain accurate energy consumption data. Energy saving targets will be established once the Parliament occupies Holyrood and baseline data can be established against which savings can be measured.</p>
