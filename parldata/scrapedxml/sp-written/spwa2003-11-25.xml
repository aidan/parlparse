  <p>The information requested is not held centrally at present. However, the team at the national alcohol information resource at ISD Scotland are currently discussing information needs with local alcohol action teams and will be considering how proposed developments in the collection of waiting times data for drug services can be applied to services for people with alcohol problems.</p>

  <p>The latest complete count of the number of individuals aged under 18 admitted to hospitals in Scotland with a diagnosis of drug misuse is shown in the following table. It is not always possible to explicitly identify illegal drug use from centrally held data, as some drug classifications include the misuse of prescribed drugs.</p>

  <p>Under existing arrangements, general practitioners have responsibility for their patients 24 hours a day, seven days per week. During periods of out-of-hours, the GP will either attend the patient himself/herself or may be part of an out of hours co-operative in which case a GP colleague will attend. As part of the GP&#8217;s terms of service, it is also open to him/her to delegate treatment to any other health care professional, such as a paramedic or nurse, who is competent to carry out such treatment.</p>

  <p>Under the terms of the new general medical services contract, which is subject to Parliament approving the Primary Medical Services (Scotland) Bill, GPs will be able to transfer responsibility for providing out-of-hours care to the NHS board, who in turn will have to ensure that alternative providers are available and that they meet mandatory accredited standards. The exact nature of these new arrangements are currently being developed by a national working group on out-of-hours as part of the implementation process for the new contract.</p>

  <p>A Registered Social Landlord (RSL) may ask for a reference from a prospective tenant&#8217;s landlord before housing them, but this requires the permission of the prospective tenant. It may also ask a local authority whether an Anti-Social Behaviour Order exists against that person, without obtaining consent.

  <p>The planning and provision of maternity services is in the first place a matter for NHS boards.</p>

  <p>The report of the expert group on acute maternity services (2002) makes it clear that acute maternity services should be planned and commissioned in a regional context whilst taking account of local needs, priorities and facilities. I emphasised the importance of this approach when I responded to the proposals made by NHS Argyll and Clyde.</p>

  <p>To facilitate this, we have provided funding for a regional maternity services co-ordinator in each of the three regional planning groups which should ensure that all NHS boards are adopting a pan-regional approach to planning maternity services. Each region is about to or is currently scoping existing maternity services, taking account existing infrastructures and current and recent NHS board maternity service reviews. Boards which have recently reviewed or are reviewing their maternity services include Highland, Orkney, Shetland, Tayside, Forth Valley, Glasgow and Argyll and Clyde.</p>

  <p><em>A Framework for Maternity Services</em> (2001) also notes the importance of cross-boundary planning and states that NHS boards should make sure that local consultation and public involvement takes place when planning maternity services.</p>

  <p>I have made it clear to NHS boards that when considering proposals for reconfiguration I will have to be satisfied that they are consistent with these national policy documents.</p>

  <p>The report of the expert group on acute maternity services (EGAMS) stated that one-to-one midwifery care should be the norm for all women during labour and childbirth. It also stated that professionals at all levels of maternity care must have appropriate training.</p>

  <p>As such all NHS boards are working towards achieving this standard to ensure that all women receive one-to-one skilled, evidence-based midwifery care whilst in labour. However, at present the information regarding which boards have achieved this is not centrally held.</p>

  <p>EGAMS stressed that all midwives caring for women in labour should have identified core competencies and skills. The Scottish maternity development programme provides local maternity courses which will help to achieve this.</p>

  <p>The Executive is developing a maternity services performance assessment framework for NHS boards that will take into account the standards set out in the EGAMS report.</p>

  <p>A copy of the requested information has been placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 29941).</p>

  <p>The tables show whole time equivalent (WTE) and headcount information relating to hospital and community midwives and the population by NHS board area. Rates of hospital and community midwives per 100,000 population and rates per 1,000 babies born are also given.</p>

  <p>The rates should be treated with caution. The variability in rates between health boards can be partly explained by the small number of midwives each rate is based on. Moreover, these rates do not take account of cross-border flows between health boards e.g. patients resident in one health board area may receive their midwifery services in another health board.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive Health Department published <em>A Framework for Maternity Services in</em> <em>Scotland</em> in February 2001. The document sets out a vision for maternity services in Scotland, and provides a &quot;template&quot; for best practice in maternity care for use by NHS service planners and the clinical professionals who are responsible for delivering these services.</p>

  <p>The report of the Expert Group on Acute Maternity Services published in December 2002 specified the range of services for women and neonates required in midwife-led community maternity units dealing with low risk pregnancies and labour and consultant-led units caring for women with low, medium or high risk or complex pregnancies and labour. It highlighted the fact that acute maternity services should be planned and commissioned in a regional context taking into account local needs.</p>

  <p>The Health Department also issued a Health Department Letter (HDL (2002) 10) in March 2002 giving guidance to NHS boards on regional planning for health care services.</p>

  <p>The rateable value is determined by the local assessor who estimates, using available evidence, the hypothetical rent which would be paid by a tenant for the rateable subjects. The poundage rate, which is set annually by Scottish ministers, is then multiplied by the rateable value to produce the rates liability. The relevant local authority will then send the bill to the occupier, deducting any appropriate rates relief. This is true for telecommunications subjects just as it is for all other types of property.</p>

  <p>We do not have any plans to use any surplus income to grant financial relief to the broadband sector. Direct subsidy to the telecommunications industry is very much restricted by EC state aids regulations to ensure that no individual operator is awarded competitive advantage. We are already taking forward a number of initiatives to promote broadband. Our most recent is worth up to &#163;24 million and has demand stimulation measures for the broadband sector. These include the broadband business incentive which provides grants to Scottish businesses who wish to take up a broadband connection.</p>

  <p>There are a number of issues that are being addressed for residential accommodation for looked after young people. These include the qualifications of staff in residential child care. All staff will have to acquire the necessary qualifications by 2008. Children in residential accommodation can have particularly poor educational outcomes, which was recognised by the allocation of &#163;10 million last year to improving the educational environment for children in care, particularly those in residential accommodation. We are now considering other policy initiatives to encourage the educational attainment of these young people, including the training and support offered to the staff in residential accommodation.</p>

  <p>A comprehensive review of the junction signing strategy and accident histories on the A90 between Aberdeen and Perth was undertaken in 1999. A number of junctions along the route have been improved following this review and further improvement works have been approved for 2003-04 between Aberdeen and Stonehaven.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Executive carries out an annual review of the trunk road network to identify accident cluster sites or areas with high accident rates. The junctions on the A90 between Aberdeen and the Angus border will be included in this review which is currently under way. Any relevant sites that can be treated by low cost engineering methods will be prioritised and added to the 2004-05 remedial programme.</p>

  <p>I have today approved the draft designation order for a single river basin district for Scotland. This is the sole issue remaining for transposition of the water framework directive.</p>

  <p>The designation has been supported by key stakeholders, who believe that a single river basin district to cover all Scottish waters, except those in the cross-border catchment, will allow for a cohesive approach to river basin management planning in Scotland. The consultation process brought out some concerns from stakeholders situated in Dumfries and Galloway that the area had been split between the Scotland River Basin District and the cross-border river basin district with England. These concerns have been addressed by including all Dumfries and Galloway catchments in the cross-border district. This will enable more effective management of that area.</p>

  <p>This designation sets the administrative boundaries for introducing a modernised approach to protecting and enhancing the water environment. The balance of all interests will be the cornerstone of this new approach.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has classified eight sites in Scotland as special protection areas for Capercaillie and these contain approximately 36% of the British breeding population. Scottish Natural Heritage recently provided new data to the Scottish Executive on the case for additional special protection areas for this bird species and these are currently being assessed by my officials in order that I can consider the case for classifying new sites for Capercaillie.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has identified any marine and coastal areas that are of international importance for seabirds and, if so, what measures it is taking to protect such areas from inappropriate development and commercial exploitation.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2003-11-25.S2W-4020.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80128" speakername="Allan Wilson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-03/wa1125.htm#21">

  <p>Forty-eight sites have been classified by the Scottish Executive as special protection areas (SPA) under the EC Birds Directive (79/409/EEC) which have one or more species of seabird as a qualifying interest. Eight of these are also designated as wetlands of international importance under the Ramsar Convention. These sites are listed in the following table.</p>

  <p>All SPAs for seabirds are &quot;European sites&quot; and are protected by the duties placed on competent authorities (through the 1994 habitats regulations) not to consent to plans or projects that would damage the conservation interest of the site. They may be protected by contractual measures (including management agreements with the proprietors or tenants). Where necessary ministers may introduce a special nature conservation order for a European site, prohibiting any operation which would be likely to damage the conservation interest of the site. Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) may make byelaws to protect European sites from damage by parties other than the owner/occupier. In European sites underpinned by Special Sites of Scientific Interest (SSSI) notifications, SNH is given the power to amend the lists of potential damaging operations (PDOs) which form part of an SSSI notification when this is necessary to bring them into line with the ecological objectives of a European site. It is Government policy that SPA and Ramsar sites be afforded similar protection.</p>

  <p>In the marine environment, all relevant authorities (such as harbour authorities, local authorities, and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency) having functions relevant to marine conservation, are obliged to exercise those functions to protect the integrity of European marine sites.</p>

  <p>National Planning Policy Guideline 14 sets out for planning authorities the overall national planning policy for the protection of the natural heritage in designated areas and the wider countryside including coastal areas. In terms of development planning, structure plans include policies for the protection and, where appropriate, enhancement of European sites and indicate their broad locations while local plans provide more detailed provision and identify the sites. The accompanying texts should emphasise the very strict protection that must be afforded to the interests for which European sites are designated and the implications this has for development proposals which would adversely affect those interests.</p>
