  <p>All hydroelectric output in Scotland is classified as renewable. Established stations with a capacity of up to 20MW and which have been refurbished since 1990 are also eligible for support under the Renewables Obligation (Scotland). Established stations with a capacity in excess of 20 megawatts are not eligible for support, while new schemes of any size are eligible. This ensures that support is targeted at new generating plant.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, <a name="QuestionText"> whether in light of the announcement of additional funding for VisitScotland&#8217;s marketing budget by the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport on 11 March 2004, funds previously earmarked for marketing by VisitScotland will be reallocated to administration or other budgets.</a></p>

  <p>No. All resources previously assigned to the VisitScotland marketing budgets for 2003-04, 2004-05 and 2005-06 will continue to be used to market Scotland as a must visit tourist destination. The additional resources totalling &#163;17 million that I announced in the Parliament on 11 March will similarly be used to build on VisitScotland&#8217;s current marketing activities at both home and abroad.</p>
