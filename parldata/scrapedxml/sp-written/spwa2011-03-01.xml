  <p>The majority of recommendations contained within the <em>A</em> <em>Fuller Life</em> report, published in 2004, were targeted towards local partnerships and service providers. The main recommendations for the Scottish Government were to raise awareness of alcohol-related brain damage and to support improved local service provision.</p>

  <p>In order to help achieve this, we committed to translating the principles and recommendations of <em>A Fuller Life</em> and the <em>Mind the Gaps</em> reports into practical advice to support joined-up local delivery to improve the awareness, support and service provision for people who have both mental health and substance misuse problems. This was published in <em>Closing the Gaps &ndash; Making a Difference</em> in December 2007.</p>

  <p>Scottish Government officials met with stakeholders on 5 March and 17 June 2008, and on 2 April, 20 July, 5 August, 19 August, 11 September and 17 November 2009. Issues discussed at these meetings included a survey of bee colonies to determine the presence of Varroa mites showing resistance to pyrethroid treatments, the Bee Health Strategy for Scotland and the European and American Foulbrood outbreaks.</p>

  <p>The Minister for Environment, Roseanna Cunningham MSP, met with stakeholders on 6<sup> </sup>January 2010 to discuss developments in bee health. The Minister made it clear that the Scottish Government was not in a position to offer financial support for European Foulbrood control or compensation to businesses. The Minister agreed that we would look at spend under the EU Apiculture programme; stated that we had committed additional resources for bee inspectors, and that we would develop and enhance our existing resources while working with the industry on a disease control plan for 2010 and on the issue of antibiotic residues. The Minister also stated, without making firm commitments, that we would consider how to support working groups for the Bee Health Strategy and consider the issues raised in the paper tabled by the Bee Farmers Association at the meeting. The Scottish Government will also continue to develop the Bee Health Strategy within the resources available.</p>

  <p>In addition the Scottish Government funded full time apiculture specialist at the Scottish Agricultural College liaises with stakeholders frequently during the provision of training, education and advice.</p>

  <p>There are two HEAT targets for alcohol and drugs:</p>

  <p>HEAT A11: to ensure that by March 2013, 90% of clients wait no longer than three weeks from referral received to appropriate drug or alcohol treatment that supports their recovery.</p>

  <p>HEAT H4: to deliver 149,449 alcohol brief interventions (ABIs) in primary care, accident and emergency and antenatal care by March 2011 with an extension to deliver an additional 61,080 ABIs by March 2012.</p>

  <p>With regard to HEAT A11 we have developed guidance on referral pathways (<a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Justice/law/DrugsStrategy/recovery/HEAT/referral-pathways" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Justice/law/DrugsStrategy/recovery/HEAT/referral-pathways</a>) in addition to a national resource, <em>A Wait off Our Shoulders </em>(<a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2010/06/02115503/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2010/06/02115503/0</a>), which aims to share learning of good practice to improve access to treatment and reduce waiting times through service redesign.</p>

  <p>Further guidance on <em>Drug and Alcohol Treatment Types</em> <a href="http://www.drugmisuse.isdscotland.org/wtpilot/DATWT_TreatmentTypes_rev.pdf" target="_blank">(www.drugmisuse.isdscotland.org/wtpilot/DATWT_TreatmentTypes_rev.pdf<em>)</em></a><em> </em>was published in 2010, which provides alcohol and drug partnerships (ADPs) and specialist services with advice on data entry to the new Scottish Drug and Alcohol Treatment Waiting Times Database.</p>

  <p>Guidance for delivery of the HEAT H4 target on alcohol brief interventions for 2011-12, will be issued to health boards and ADPs by the end of February 2011. This will subsequently be published on the NHS Health Scotland website.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Parliament elections are currently the responsibility of the UK Government. Since 2000, the Electoral Commission has been responsible for providing guidance for voters, including information on the operation of and the voting system for the Scottish Parliament. As a result the Scottish Government has not incurred any expenditure on these issues.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Parliament itself also provides public information on the workings of the Parliament and the voting system.</p>

  <p>Table 1 shows the 28-day hospital emergency readmission rate in the financial years ending 31 March 2009 and 2010, broken down by NHS board of residence. Data for the financial year ending 31 <sup> </sup> March 2011 will be available in September 2011.</p>

  <p>The period of 28 days is to some extent arbitrary, but has been widely adopted as maximising the trade off between including as many readmissions related to the initial admission as possible and excluding as many unrelated readmissions as possible. The figures include readmissions within 28 days whether or not the readmission was related to the previous hospital stay.</p>

  <p>We would expect all NHS boards to ensure their staff, including midwives, have the relevant continuous professional development required to undertake their role. To support this, NHS Health Scotland has developed materials and resources to support NHS staff in delivering education and intervention in relation to alcohol matters.</p>

  <p>As part of Alcohol Brief Intervention (ABI) HEAT target, antenatal care has been included as one of three priority settings. Work is ongoing to roll out a national training programme, led by NHS Health Scotland, to provide confident and competent practitioners in delivering ABIs. This includes a specifically tailored programme and resources for the antenatal setting.</p>

  <p>Lord MacLean wrote to me on 10 December 2010 informing me that because hearings scheduled for December 2010 had to be cancelled, due to adverse weather, there would be an impact on the overall inquiry timetable and a delay in publishing the final report at the end of May 2011.</p>

  <p>Lord MacLean also advised that, on further investigation of the commissioned witness statements and the evidence gathered, it had become apparent that for the experts to produce high quality and credible reports they would require additional time. It is extremely important that the final report and its recommendations are robust in order that the Scottish Government can consider how these recommendations can assist in continuing to raise the standard of care for patients in Scotland and that the lessons learned can be shared not just across NHS Scotland but worldwide.</p>

  <p>However, I have not yet agreed this further extension. Discussions with Lord MacLean continue and as soon as a date for publishing the final report has been agreed, I will inform the Parliament.</p>

  <p>The &pound;249 million figure quoted was an estimate made in 2010 and this figure is constantly being reviewed as we manage our budgets over the course of 2010-11. The final amounts and the timing of repayments will therefore not be known until the end of this financial year. Part of the &pound;249 million is for the front funding agreed by Edinburgh and Glasgow City Councils and it will be up to the local authorities to agree with the housing associations and cooperatives that they fund the timing of these repayments. As far as the rest of Scotland is concerned, outwith Glasgow and Edinburgh Transfer of Management of Development Funding agreements, the majority of the estimated housing association front funding is due for repayment and will be repaid in 2011-12; with the bulk of the remainder due for repayment in 2012-13.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has made representations to the UK Government on the effect of housing benefit changes throughout Scotland, drawing attention to the pressures the changes will cause to Scottish homelessness policy. This has included writing to Lord Freud, the UK Minister for Welfare Reform and sharing our Scottish Impact Assessment report with the Department for Work and Pensions. The report highlights the high proportion of housing benefit claimants in Glasgow compared to the rest of Scotland and includes a section on temporary accommodation changes.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Impact Assessment Report is available at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Built-Environment/Housing/supply-demand/chma/marketcontextmaterials/hbchangesscottishimpact/" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Built-Environment/Housing/supply-demand/chma/marketcontextmaterials/hbchangesscottishimpact/ </a></p>

  <p>We recognise that Glasgow City Council, in common with the other five stock-transferred local authorities, faces an additional financial pressure with these changes, as it is unable to provide temporary accommodation from its own stock. We have already commenced discussions with Glasgow City Council on the extent of the impact of this.</p>

  <p>Our ongoing partnership work with the Regional Housing Options Hubs seeks to promote a greater focus on homeless prevention via the Housing Options approach. This approach has received an enthusiastic welcome from local authorities and the work of hubs continues to move forward at an encouraging pace. However there are very real concerns from within the hubs that changes to Housing Benefit and the resultant impact on homelessness budgets is highly likely to hinder the successful progress of the Housing Options approach across the country.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government/COSLA Joint 2012 Steering Group on Homelessness has also very recently produced a report on the management of temporary accommodation, which outlines specific areas that local authorities may wish to consider as options to improve efficiency and realise savings in temporary homeless accommodation provision. A copy of the report is available at:</p>

Such funds have been used in a positive way to expand young people&rsquo;s horizons and increase the opportunities they have to develop their interests and skills, demonstrated by over 300,000 young participants across Scotland. This programme remains an effective way to create diversionary activities for young people, focussing their delivery to benefit communities that have suffered as a result of criminal activity.</p>

  <p>This commitment includes &pound;6.5 million to Youthlink Scotland to provide funding for projects which further support young people involved, or at risk from violence, alcohol, drugs or antisocial behaviour.</p>

  <p>We are working closely with NHS boards to ensure that the number of specialist beds matches the need and demand of children and adolescents. We are also encouraging NHS boards to develop their community based intensive outreach services in order to enable children and young people to return to their own communities at an earlier stage of their recovery.</p>

  <p>Since 2009 the Scottish Government have invested an additional &pound;2 million annually to support these developments which shorten the time young people have to be in hospital and free up capacity for others who require admission.</p>

  <p>We are operating a regional model of service delivery and presently have 51 beds with plans in place to increase the size of the Dundee Unit (which serves the North of Scotland Boards) from six beds to 12 and this will take the total bed numbers in Scotland to 57.</p>

  <p>We have been working closely with NHS boards to determine the number of beds that would best meet the needs and demand of the children and adolescent population in Scotland. We have also been working on encouraging the development of new models of service delivery which either shorten admissions or act as alternatives to admissions.</p>

  <p>The 2005 report <em>Building and Sustaining Specialist Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services by the Royal College of Psychiatrists</em>, recommended 20 to 40 inpatient beds per 1 million population across each of the five jurisdictions (England, Scotland, Wales Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic).</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive inpatient working group recommended in its document <em>Psychiatric Inpatient Services for Children and Young People in Scotland: A way Forward</em>, that &quot;planning should commence now for a phased increase to 60 psychiatric inpatient places for young people in Scotland with ongoing review of need and demand.&quot;</p>

  <p>The Gross Ingredient Cost of items dispensed under the MAS in 2009-10 was &pound;2.87 million with an average cost per item of &pound;2.03.
