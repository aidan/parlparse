  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how long on average it takes the Care Commission to provide appropriate accreditation for those who apply to become childminders; whether there is a backlog of around three months and a total time duration of four months to provide such accreditation; if so, whether the Executive considers such timescales acceptable and, if it does not, what steps it will take to reduce them.</p>

  <p>Information about the registration of care services by the Care Commission is not collected in this way.</p>

  <p>The Care Commission&rsquo;s corporate plan, including key performance indicators (KPIs), is approved by Scottish ministers. The plan for 2006-09 includes a KPI measuring the percentage of registrations completed within target times, based on the time between receipt of a valid application and the date of registration.</p>

  <p>In 2006-07 the target for completing childminders registration is 80% within three months. The definition of this target allows for registrations which take more than three months to process from receipt of the valid application where the cause of delay was outwith the Care Commission&rsquo;s control. Delays can be caused, for example, by awaiting Disclosure Scotland information or references about medical suitability, or a request by the applicant for the application to be put on hold. It is reasonable to take these into account when measuring the Care Commission&rsquo;s performance.</p>

  <p>On that basis, in Scotland between 1 April 2006 and 31 January 2007, 84% of childminders were registered within three months of receipt of a valid application.</p>

  <p>My officials regularly meet the Care Commission to discuss performance against targets in the corporate plan and remedial action where targets are not achieved.</p>

  <p>Further information about registration of care services can be obtained from the Chief Executive of the Care Commission:</p>

  <p>Jacquie Roberts<br /> Care Commission<br /> Compass House<br /> 11 Riverside Drive<br /> Dundee DD1 4NY<br /> Telephone: 01382 207109 (Personal Assistant to the Chief Executive).</p>

  <p>As from April 2002 the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001 removed the statutory distinction between residential care homes and nursing homes. Consequently, local authority expenditure on residential care homes and on nursing homes was combined from financial year 2002-03 onwards and reclassified as Older People - Care Homes (Non Respite). The following table shows expenditure in each of the last five years. The figures for 2001-02 are the combined figures under the two previous headings. Those from 2002-03 onwards are the figures under the single new heading.</p>

  <p>This question is relevant only to NHS dentistry in England and Wales. Fixed NHS dentistry budgets, as part of a defined contract for NHS dental services, form no part of the provision of NHS dentistry in Scotland, and it is therefore not possible for NHS dentists to exhaust their annual budgets.</p>

  <p>While my department does not keep records which would record this information I have been advised that there have been no instances, so far as my officials are aware, where a Fatal Accident Inquiry (FAI) has been reopened.</p>

  <p>There have been cases where an FAI has been the subject of judicial review on the grounds that the sheriff&rsquo;s findings were unreasonable. My department does not hold a record of the numbers of such cases but they are believed to be small. I am only aware of one such case since 1999 and in that case the court did not accept the argument that the sheriff&rsquo;s findings were unreasonable and should therefore be set aside.</p>

  <p>A consultation exercise was carried out in the first quarter of 2006 on a system of administrative penalties which gives alleged offenders the opportunity to accept a fixed financial penalty as an alternative to criminal prosecution. The Scottish Parliament voted through on 1 March 2007 the Fisheries and Aquaculture (Scotland) Bill which contains implementing provisions for such a system. Consultation is on-going with stakeholders regarding secondary legislation to extend the scheme to domestic legislation and not just European legislation. The system will be applicable to all vessels fishing within the Scottish zone including those whose vessels are registered in other European Union countries. The proposed date for implementation is 1 January 2008.</p>

  <p>Median waiting times are not an Executive target. Our policy is to reduce the longest waiting times for patients. On 31 December 2006, no patient with a guarantee had waited more than 26 weeks for a first out-patient appointment. This national maximum waiting time will be reduced to 18 weeks by the end of this year.</p>

  <p>Information on median and 99th percentile waiting times for treatment is given in Median and 99th percentile waiting times (days) for out-patient appointments and in-patient/day case admissions for selected specialties by NHS board; years ending 31 March 2002 - 2006 a copy of which has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 42300).</p>

  <p>The 99th percentile waiting time is used in preference to the maximum wait in these analyses. This approach is taken because the one percent of values that are larger than the 99th percentile cannot be relied upon; cases with very long waits may be a mixture of actual times and times that are a result of recording errors.</p>

  <p>Centrally held data cannot specifically identify either inpatient/day case admissions or outpatient appointments for pain relief specialties, thus, these data are not presented.</p>

  <p>Low Moss is being closed to make way for a new, modern and purpose built prison facility. The quick and efficient redeployment of staff is a key issue in any closure process. The Scottish Prison Service (SPS) ensure that trade union partners are fully involved in all aspects of prison closures.</p>

  <p>Improving standards of care in Scotland is what we set up the Care Commission to do. I am confident that the commission acts in the best interest of the many vulnerable people who use care services, and that it will take immediate and appropriate action when services do not come up to scratch, using the enforcement tools given to it by the Parliament.</p>

  <p>I welcome the publication of the commission&rsquo;s report on The Quality of Care Services in Scotland. The report demonstrates that overall the quality of care across Scotland is good, and that there are a great many excellent and innovative care services, including care homes for older people. It also presents some challenging findings, particularly in relation to care homes.</p>

  <p>The report gives the Care Commission the evidence specifically to target the service sectors where there is the greatest need for improvement. The commission will work with services and other national organisations to drive up the quality of care homes. This action will include focussing inspections on areas that matter most, such as privacy and good information and complaints systems, and working more closely with care homes that have the most complaints and requirements.</p>

  <p>To help it do this, the Care Commission employs professional advisors in areas such as nutrition and infection control to provide support and advice to its staff and to care service providers, and it promotes good practice through its website and in Care News. The commission is also developing a grading system for care services that will focus their resources on those providers most in need of improvement.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has provided funding to support the appointment by the Care Commission of a Nurse Consultant for Care Homes. Part of her role has been to create a learning network for staff in care homes. One of her projects focuses on nutrition, and the Care Commission Professional Adviser-Nutrition and its Dieticians network for care homes will work together on this initiative.</p>

  <p>In addition, from April 2007 the Scottish Executive and local councils will deliver a further &pound;20 million in new resources to increase care home fee levels in the independent sector. We intend that this increased investment will be targeted to further improve the quality of care, and we are discussing with the sector how that can best be done. We are also working to agree how fees will be linked to quality on a continuing basis from 2008.</p>
