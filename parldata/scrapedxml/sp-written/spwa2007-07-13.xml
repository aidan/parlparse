  <p>Local authorities in Scotland have, in the main, statutory powers as opposed to statutory obligations to provide burial facilities and crematoria for their area. In relation to the provision of burial facilities, local authorities have powers to provide new burial grounds. There is a limited duty only on local authorities to replace any burial ground in circumstances where an existing burial ground has been closed by order in council, in which event the replacement burial ground requires to be provided within six months of the order. In relation to the provision of crematoria, local authorities again have powers rather than duties to provide and maintain crematoria.</p>

  <p>Work on this has been completed already. The Primary 6 Target Report, published in January 2007, assessed the success of each local authority in reaching the primary school target set by the then administration. And an evaluation of the first three years of the Youth Music Initiative was published in March 2007. Both reports can be accessed on the Scottish Arts Council website. Scottish ministers will consider further evaluation in due course.</p>

  <p>Various studies from the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), Greenpeace and the World Alliance for Decentralised Energy (WADE) have assessed the feasibility, cost and benefits of decentralised energy systems. These studies suggest that local generation of electricity reduces transmission losses and combined heat and power (CHP) systems can operate at significantly higher efficiencies by reusing waste heat from electricity generation.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many death certificates have recorded MRSA as the cause of death in each year since 1999.</p>

  <p>It is unusual for MRSA infection to be an isolated cause of death, as a range of contributory factors are normally involved. The death certificates that have recorded MRSA as the underlying cause of death are, however, shown in the following table:</p>

  <p><table width="100%" border="BORDER" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#CCCCCC">
<tr>
<td width="45%" valign="bottom"> </td>
<td width="10%" align="center" valign="bottom">1999</td>
<td width="9%" align="center" valign="bottom">2000</td>
<td width="8%" align="center" valign="bottom">2001</td>
<td width="7%" align="center" valign="bottom">2002</td>
<td width="7%" align="center" valign="bottom">2003</td>
<td width="7%" align="center" valign="bottom">2004</td>
<td width="7%" align="center" valign="bottom">2005</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="45%" align="left" valign="bottom">MRSA recorded as the underlying cause of death</td>
<td width="10%" align="right" valign="bottom">22</td>
<td width="9%" align="right" valign="bottom">35</td>
<td width="8%" align="right" valign="bottom">36</td>
<td width="7%" align="right" valign="bottom">46</td>
<td width="7%" align="right" valign="bottom">39</td>
<td width="7%" align="right" valign="bottom">42</td>
<td width="7%" align="right" valign="bottom">38</td>
</tr>
</table></p>

  <p>The data provided in the above table should be noted with caution. Recording of MRSA infection on death certificates is based on the clinical judgement of each doctor. Changes in the number of cases year-on-year may therefore be influenced by increased public and professional awareness of MRSA and may not be a reliable indicator of the true incidence.</p>

  <p>The HAI Task Force has developed a comprehensive programme of measures to tackle Healthcare Associated Infections. The task force will be taking a new HAI programme forward from 2008-09 which will focus on targeting skin and soft tissue infections; examining the case for introducing an MRSA screening programme; reducing blood stream infections, and ensuring additional surveillance data is put in place in the areas of general medicine and care of the elderly.</p>

  <p>Since October 2006, reporting of all Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemias (MRSA and MSSA) has been mandatory. The last report <em>Scottish Surveillance of Healthcare Associated Infection Programme: Quarterly Report on MRSA Bacteraemias In Scotland, January 2003 &ndash; March 2007</em> was published by Health Protection Scotland (HPS) on 3 July, and confirms that serious MRSA infection rates remain stable. It is available from the HPS website at<br /> <a href="http://www.hps.scot.nhs.uk/surveillance/ReportsDetail.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.hps.scot.nhs.uk/surveillance/ReportsDetail.aspx</a>.</p>

  <p>Local authorities where tenants voted against stock transfer are developing standard delivery plans setting out how they will achieve the Scottish Housing Quality Standard (SHQS). It will be for those councils, as it is for all other councils in Scotland, to determine how best to fund the required investment using the financial resources available to them. Potential resources include tenants&rsquo; rents, increased efficiency, prudential borrowing, receipts from right to buy sales and disposal of other Housing Revenue Account assets.</p>

  <p>Yes. The pressured area mechanism was introduced by the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 and this legislation remains in force. However, the Scottish Government recognises the pressures which right to buy sales can place on affordable housing in some communities, and is keen to explore how the policy might be aligned more closely to local needs. This will include considering the effectiveness of pressured area designations, looking in particular at sales from 30 September 2007, when tenants affected by designations begin to be eligible to buy in significant numbers.</p>

  <p>I announced during the Parliamentary Housing Debate on 21 June that the Scottish Government would take forward its proposal to establish a Scottish Housing Support Fund, and in so doing that we would build on the successful Homestake programme and look to expand the scheme and move it forwards. In the meantime Homestake will continue to operate as at present.</p>

  <p>As the previous administration acknowledged, and as called for by many stakeholders, the current draft of the National Strategy and Action Plan on Race Equality requires further work.

  <p>The recently published <em>Scottish Planning Policy 6: Renewable Energy (SPP6</em> ) stipulates that prospective developers must adequately address the cumulative impact of their proposal. It also requires that Planning Authorities take account of projects that have already been built, as well as those consented but not yet built and those that are currently at the application stage. This, together with existing Scottish Natural Heritage guidance, should ensure that cumulative impacts are effectively mitigated. At this stage, we have no plans to commission research.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether there are any plans to review the funding criteria whereby farms are not eligible for loans from Loan Action Scotland to install small to medium-size wind turbines, given that the scheme is not oversubscribed.</p>

  <p>There are no plans to review the criteria in this way. The Loan Action Scotland scheme does not normally support projects in the agricultural sector as these are excluded due to EU State Aid rules. In addition, the scheme supports projects which deliver good carbon savings and have a payback period of less than five years. Investments in small to medium-size wind turbines generally result in much longer payback periods, usually in excess of 10 years.</p>
