  <p>In line with my answers to questions S2W-22373 and S2W-22374 on 27 January 2006, the Executive recognises the critical role played by successful and dynamic city-regions. Our principal aim is to make it easier for organisations to work together &ndash; both for greater efficiency and to improve their responsiveness to the needs of local people.</p>

  <p>Accordingly we continue to support a range of measures to improve joint working between agencies. These approaches include Community Planning, Community Health Partnerships, Regional Transport Partnerships, regional workforce planning in NHSScotland, strategic land-use planning at city-region level and other cross-boundary processes and networks.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the comments made by the Minister for Transport and Telecommunications on 15 March 2006 in respect of my national concessionary travel pass application ( <em>Official Report</em> c. 24045), whether his assurance on timescales applies to all individuals whose applications have been received.</p>

  <p>We will make every effort to ensure that everyone who submitted a valid application before 20 March will receive their entitlement card by 1 April 2006.

  <p>The benefits in achieving recognition for Edinburgh as UNESCO&rsquo;s first City of Literature are expected to be: raised awareness and prestige of Scotland&rsquo;s literature nationally and internationally; new initiatives attracted to Scotland; Edinburgh used as a model for other World Cities of Literature, providing partnerships with other cities with strong literary profiles and aspirations, and a focus and co-ordination for literary activity, encouraging greater participation at all levels of Scottish society.</p>

  <p>It is too soon to judge the full impact; however, some benefits already accrued are:</p>

  <p>the inaugural Mann Booker International Prize, one of the most valuable new international awards, was held in Edinburgh in 2005;</p>

  <p>during the Edinburgh International Book Festival in 2005 a high-profile delegation from UNESCO and from other potential cities of literature enjoyed a special programme of events;</p>

  <p>City of Refuge &ndash; in partnership with Norwich, Liverpool and Cardiff, to inaugurate a UK network of cities of refuge for writers in exile from their home countries over issues of freedom of speech;</p>

  <p>Edinburgh has also been gaining profile as a centre for publishing, with a new literary agency opening in August 2005 (the Maggie McKernan literary agency), and a new cross-party group on publishing set up by members of the Scottish Parliament, and</p>

  <p>development of a city-wide campaign to encourage Edinburgh citizens to read one book, to be launched in the autumn of 2006 with Robert Louis Stevenson&rsquo;s Kidnapped.</p>

  <p>Tourism in Edinburgh is performing very strongly indeed. Visitors&rsquo; interest in literary matters ranging from those with an interest in the works of Burns and Scott through to those with a fascination in the Da Vinci Code (Rosslyn Chapel). VisitScotland actively promotes Edinburgh&rsquo;s status as UNESCO City of Literature as a way of encouraging more visitors who are specifically interested in literary activities such as the Edinburgh International Book Festival to experience Edinburgh for themselves.</p>

  <p>A recent example is <em>The 100 Best Scottish Books</em> guide, which VisitScotland produced in conjunction with Orange to promote Edinburgh as UNESCO&rsquo;s City of Literature. This describes various literary tours including The Edinburgh Literary Pub Tour, Rebus Tours, Trainspotting Tour etc as well as indicating the locations best associated with some of Scotland&rsquo;s most famous authors.</p>

  <p>In addition, at this year&rsquo;s Tartan Week exhibition in New York VisitScotland will draw heavily on the interest in the Da Vinci Code to promote Edinburgh and specifically Rosslyn Chapel as a great place to visit.</p>

  <p>VisitScotland has also been liaising with Edinburgh World Heritage to work on ways in which it can continue to promote Edinburgh as UNESCO&rsquo;s City of Literature. Discussions have also taken place between VisitScotland officials and Edinburgh World Heritage&rsquo;s Communications Manager about new activities based around the literature theme.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to effective implementation of Modernising Medical Careers (MMC), the UK-wide reform of postgraduate medical training. Arrangements have not yet begun in Scotland to phase out the SHO grade. We are considering how best to assimilate both current training posts and, subject to open competition, the junior doctors who occupy them into the new MMC programmes.</p>

  <p>We recognise the concerns of current SHOs about their future employment options under MMC. Officials are working with stakeholders, including the BMA and NHS Education for Scotland, in planning for implementation to ensure an effective transition.</p>

  <p>Entry to, and progress through, MMC training will be competency-based, although the detailed selection arrangements for individual MMC specialty and general practice training programmes have yet to be finalised. Current SHOs will be eligible to apply for advertised MMC training programmes, subject to confirmation of the individual specialty selection criteria and to existing legislative requirements which govern appointment processes across the UK.</p>

  <p>The latest year for which such we have such data is 2002, taken from the Scottish Executive funded Energy Study published earlier this year. In Scotland in 2002 the electricity generation which was in excess of customer demand (allowing for transmission and distribution losses) was 8.034TWh. This electricity was exported to England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The precise net value of this is a commercial matter for electricity generators and suppliers. However, according to OFGEM, the average UK wholesale price for electricity in 2002 was &pound;15.20/MWh, on which basis the gross value of sales of electricity to England, Wales and Northern Ireland is estimated at &pound;122 million.</p>

  <p>The information requested is detailed in the table <em>Healthcare Services Devoted to Homeless People</em> , which has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 39272).</p>

  <p>The Homelessness Taskforce in its report <em>Homelessness: An Action Plan for Prevention and Effective Response (2002)</em> recommended that &quot;In the case of primary care services, specialist provision should be seen as transitional for all but a small number of homeless people. It should provide planned support over a reasonable period of time until individuals are re-housed and settled with access to their local GP practice and primary health care team. The general approach should be to support homeless people to maintain their current health networks or to establish new regular contact with mainstream health services&quot;.</p>

  <p>The <em>Health and Homelessness Standards</em> for NHS boards, published in March 2005, recognise that specialist homeless services may be appropriate for homeless people for a short period of time, but that the existence of such services should not mean that everyone who is homeless is automatically channelled through this route. The aim is to incorporate homeless people within mainstream services and ensure that these services are designed in ways that meet their needs.</p>

  <p>Standard 5 of the <em>Health and Homelessness Standards</em> assists NHS boards to understand the ways in which services can operate with the greatest positive impact on the health of homelessness people and the positioning of specialist services.</p>

  <p>Information on the <em>Health and Homelessness Standards</em> is available publicly from the Scottish Executive website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/03/20774/53761" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/03/20774/53761</a>.</p>

  <p>Formal responsibility for the marking of underwater hazards rests with a navigation authority with the appropriate legal powers. The position is different in freshwater than coastal waters, where the Northern Lighthouse Board has statutory responsibility for the maintenance of aids to navigation in Scottish waters, and where statutory harbour authorities have similar responsibilities. The Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park Authority is not a navigation authority, however, it maintains informal hazard buoys installed by its predecessor organisations. British Waterways Scotland is the appointed navigation authority for Lochs Ness, Oich and Lochy, which form part of the Caledonian Canal, and is responsible for the upkeep of navigation marks in these waters. We are not aware of a navigation authority for Loch Awe.</p>

  <p>The Executive is investing record levels in health and social care to improve the full range of community care services, including respite provision. Scottish Executive support for local authority community care funding in 2005-06 is &pound;1,670 million. Audit Scotland&rsquo;s annual indicators on respite show substantial increases in provision over the last two to three years. Additionally, local authorities receive a &pound;16 million Change Fund per annum, to help implement the recommendations in <em>The same as you?</em> review of services for people with learning disabilities. One of the recommendations is for further development of short breaks for people with learning disabilities.</p>

  <p>It is for local partners to purchase services as appropriate, including from the voluntary sector. councils and NHS boards are now being asked at a local partnership level to agree annual local improvement targets on respite. Targets can be for particular client groups, depending on priorities agreed with stakeholders, including service users and carers. Targets need to be agreed annually with the Executive and are aimed at delivering sustained improvements in this key service.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has not undertaken comparative studies between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom. We will produce a briefing shortly that interrogates the Scottish statistics by family unit breakdown but this will not make comparisons with Great Britain statistics.</p>

  <p>However, ministers continue to be involved in discussing ways to tackle child poverty with all of the administrations in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Ministers are actively involved in the Joint Ministerial Committee on Poverty, and at the recent meeting of the British Irish Council held in Edinburgh ministers from the eight member administrations agreed that their next topic for debate should be child poverty.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has made good progress with the <em>Controlling Light Pollution and Reducing Lighting Energy Consumption </em> document. The draft stage has now been completed and the final document is now being prepared with an anticipated publication date of May 2006.</p>

  <p>The purpose of this document is to offer advice and guidance to developers and planners on good practice methods that will both reduce the environmental impact of any scheme and reduce the energy use of them.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland has the operational responsibility for this area, and can be contacted for more information if required.</p>

  <p>Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE) provision for local roads is to be increased by &pound;60 million per annum in 2006-07 and 2007-08 (a 23% increase) as part of Spending Review 2004. The total GAE provision to local authorities for roads maintenance, which includes an allocation for street lighting, will amount to &pound;320 million per annum by 2007-08.</p>

  <p>It is for each roads authority to allocate spending based on local priorities, and this should include consideration of street lighting requirements. They are also expected to adopt best practice in terms of reducing light pollution and saving energy in any replacement programme.</p>

  <p>Roads authorities throughout Scotland have carried out surveys on behalf of the UK Road Lighting Board, listing the age and condition of their columns and lanterns. The standard of the existing stock varies greatly across the country, but it is clear that concerted action is required to bring the overall stock up to an acceptable standard.</p>

  <p>The level of detail requested is not available. However, overall Scottish local authority GAE allocations for road lighting for 2001-06 are listed in the following table. It should be noted that these allocations are not budgets or spending targets. They form part of the more complex local government funding formula used to calculate one revenue grant figure for each local authority. It is then up to each local authority to decide how best to allocate their resources based on their local needs and priorities.</p>

  <p>The SPCB is required to comply with European procurement law that requires us to be fair, transparent and non-discriminatory in our treatment of suppliers. Within these parameters we have set requirements for the contractor to supply fresh, seasonal produce which creates an opportunity for local supply and within this framework a number of Scottish products are supplied. We continue to encourage our contractor to identify further opportunities for the use of local produce.</p>
