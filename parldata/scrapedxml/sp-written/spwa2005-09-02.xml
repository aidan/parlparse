  <p>Occupiers of land do not commit an offence by having ragwort and other weeds listed in the Weeds Act 1959 on their land. An occupier who unreasonably fails to comply with a notice served under Section 1 of the Weeds Act 1959 is committing an offence and may, on summary conviction, be liable to a fine not exceeding level 3 of the standard scale.</p>

  <p>Where an occupier fails to comply with a notice, the Weeds Act 1959 also empowers Scottish ministers to take control action and recover the costs of this action from the occupier of the land.</p>

  <p>Local authorities have powers under Section 179 of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 to serve notice requiring occupiers to deal with any land whose condition is adversely affecting the amenity of other land in their district. If the occupier fails to comply with the notice, the planning authority may take control action and recover the costs of the action.</p>

  <p>Section 1 of the Roads (Scotland) Act 1984 places a general duty on local authorities to maintain local roads and verges, including controlling ragwort. Where ragwort is apparent on trunk road verges, embankments or central reserves, the Trunk Roads Maintenance Contracts require the operating companies, BEAR Scotland Ltd and Amey Highways Ltd, to control it by undertaking treatment, including hand pulling operations. The services and performance of these companies is monitored by an independent Performance Audit Group, appointed by the Executive. Appropriate action will be taken by the Executive if the requirements of the contract with regard to weed control are not met.</p>

  <p>It is an offence to plant or otherwise cause to grow in the wild certain invasive non-native plants including Giant Hogweed (Heracleum mantegazzianum). Penalties on summary conviction include imprisonment for up to six months and/or a fine not exceeding &pound;40,000. Local authorities may also take action where invasive non-native plants such as Giant Hogweed present a risk to public health and constitute a statutory nuisance.</p>

Two further Circulars (7/2003 and 11/2003) were issued on 8 September 2003 and 31 December 2003 providing further advice.</p>

  <p>The available information is given in the table. The statistics dealing with recorded crime and court proceedings are not directly comparable for a number of reasons. A person may be proceeded against for more than one crime or offence involving more than one victim, and a crime may be recorded in one year and proceedings taken in a subsequent year. Crimes and offences committed by children will also generally be dealt with through the children&rsquo;s hearings system rather than courts, while many minor offences such as motoring offences will typically be dealt with by alternatives to prosecution such as police or Procurator Fiscal conditional offers of fixed penalties.</p>

  <p>Robust procedures are in place to monitor access to and use of the Scottish Intelligence Database (SID). Over 90% of users have basic user level access to allow them to input data onto the system and to search the database. Those with enhanced access manage data within the application and create and audit system use. It is the responsibility of each force to determine the correct access level for their staff and to ensure that they receive appropriate training. SID has an extensive integral audit facility to monitor use and ensure that the integrity of SID is maintained.</p>

  <p>The available information is given in Table 19 of the bulletin <em>Criminal Proceedings in Scottish Courts, 2003</em> published by Scottish Executive in March 2005, a copy of which is available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 36012).</p>

  <p>The statistics held centrally cannot distinguish the methods of detection of those convicted of speeding.</p>

  <p>The available information relates to the revenue generated by safety camera partnerships in the Scottish Safety Camera Programme. The police can and do carry out speed enforcement outside the programme resulting in fixed penalties or fines, but the money raised from these cannot be identified separately in the statistics held centrally.</p>

  <p>As part of the Scottish Safety Camera Programme partnerships are allowed to recover the cost of camera enforcement from fine revenue as long as they follow strict rules agreed with HM Treasury. The latest available audited figures are for the period 2000-01 to 2003-04 when &pound;11.1 million of fine revenue was generated, with &pound;10.2 million of expenditure across all partnerships on safety camera activity. Any surplus generated and not used to fund the programme is required to be returned to HM Treasury.</p>

  <p>The Private Security Industry Act 2001 will be amended to extend the remit of the Security Industry Authority (SIA) to Scotland. Work is under way to prepare for the introduction of licensing in Scotland and it is expected that the first licences will be issued in early 2007.</p>

  <p>The intent of the Private Security Industry Act 2001 is to protect and reassure the public by preventing unsuitable people obtaining positions of trust in the private security industry and to raise the standards of the industry itself. The SIA will exercise this oversight over the industry. Companies will be able to apply for Approved Contractor Status which will demonstrate to the public that the company as a whole has met standards laid down by the SIA for the running of the company.</p>

  <p>The Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 contains provisions which, when commenced, will amend the Private Security Industry Act 2001 to extend the remit of the Security Industry Authority (SIA) to include Scotland. It is our intention to commence these provisions in early 2006 with a view to switching on licensable sectors within the Private Security Industry in Scotland in early 2007. All orders and regulations will be laid by Scottish ministers before the Scottish Parliament.</p>

  <p>Considerable work is already underway in the Scottish Executive and at the SIA to put in place arrangements to introduce licensing. This includes setting up training courses for each sector, liaison with stakeholders and the preparation of regulatory impact assessments for each sector.</p>
