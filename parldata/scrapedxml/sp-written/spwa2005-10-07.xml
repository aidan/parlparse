  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the (a) grant aided expenditure allocation to and (b) actual expenditure by each local authority was in respect of culture and the arts in each of the last three years.</p>

  <p>The last three years for which information is available on both grant aided expenditure and actual expenditure in respect of culture and the arts are 2001-02 to 2003-04. Information for each of these years, by local authority, is shown in the table below.</p>

  <p>The grant aided expenditure figures below form part of a much larger allocation process used to calculate revenue support grant by local authority. It is up to each local authority to decide how best to allocate the total amount allocated to it as revenue support grant, based on local needs and priorities.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the reasons are for the Forestry Commission&rsquo;s plans to relocate administrative and training operations from Ae, in Dumfries and Galloway, to Edinburgh at a time when the Executive has announced its commitment to decentralising posts away from Edinburgh.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-10-07.S2W-19512.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80011" speakername="Rhona Brankin" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa1007.htm#2">

  <p>The Forestry Commission has identified scope for increased efficiencies in its Human Resources Division, by combining the roles of two units: the Change Management team and Forestry Training Services, given the changing nature of learning and development. The business case points to savings and the benefits of closer integration with the rest of their human resource colleagues who work in Edinburgh.</p>

  <p>Less than ten per cent of Forestry Commission Scotland staff are based in Edinburgh, and the headquarters and supporting office for Forest Enterprise Scotland are located in Inverness and Dumfries respectively. This relocation of staff from Ae to the Commission&rsquo;s Silvan House in Edinburgh is not against the policy of the Scottish Executive. The offices at Silvan House include employees who are providing central services like Human Resources, for staff in England, Wales and Scotland. This relocation ensures that jobs are kept in Scotland which could otherwise be located in other parts of Britain, whilst delivering savings which may provide for an increased ability of Forestry Commission Scotland to put more staff in the front line.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has met its 2005 targets on (a) physical activity, (b) diet and (c) alcohol.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-10-07.S2W-19506.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80057" speakername="Mr Andy Kerr" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa1007.htm#3">

  <p>(a) There are no set targets for physical activity for 2005. The National Strategy for Physical Activity sets out a long-term target for 50% of all adults over 16 and 80% of all children aged 16 and under to meet the minimum recommended levels of physical activity by 2022.</p>

  <p>(b) Information on the dietary targets is not yet available. The Food Standards Agency Scotland (FSAS) will be publishing a report in November reviewing the progress up to 2003 on the Scottish Diet Action Plan targets. Due to the nature of the methodology this will be the most up-to-date data available. Regular monitoring will be put in place beyond this to provide data on progress towards the targets.</p>

  <p>(c) Progress towards national targets to reduce harmful drinking by adults is monitored through the Scottish Health Survey. The most recent survey was undertaken in 2003 and is expected to be published in November 2005.</p>

  <p>Progress towards the national target to reduce the number of young people who report drinking alcohol is monitored through the biennial Scottish Adolescent Lifestyle and Substance Use Survey. In the most recent survey, undertaken in 2004, 20% of 13-year-olds and 43% of 15-year-olds report drinking alcohol in the week before the survey. Since 2002, reported drinking has decreased among 13-year-olds from 23% (to 20%). Among 15-year-old boys reported drinking has decreased from 47% to 40% but remained the same for 15-year-old girls at 46% in both 2002 and 2004.</p>

  <p>Statins are available to patients on NHS prescription. These medicines are widely prescribed and, as with all medicines, the decision whether or not to prescribe a drug is a matter for the clinician concerned, in discussion with the patient.</p>

  <p>Over the past five years, prescribing of these drugs in Scotland has more than doubled from 1.299 million items in 2000-01 to 3.025 million items in 2004-05. These figures reflect prescribed items dispensed in the community and do not take into account medicines dispensed through the hospital service.</p>

  <p>The quality indicators in the new General Medical Services contract include cholesterol management for patients with coronary heart disease, diabetes, stroke or transient ischaemic attacks. Indicator sets are designed to encourage more structured care of patients with chronic diseases.</p>

  <p>Since July 2004, Simvastatin 10mg has been available for purchase from community pharmacists without a prescription. The decision to allow a statin to be available without a prescription gives people easier access to a preventative medicine and allows them more choice about how they can protect their own health.</p>

  <p>The UK Government is currently in discussion with trade unions to establish the overall policy framework for pension reforms and these are expected to be completed by the end of October. The UK Government will then set the pension policy parameters and context for scheme specific discussions, following which the review of the NHS scheme in Scotland will recommence.</p>
