  <p>The Scottish Advisory Committee on Alcohol Misuse (SACAM) was specifically set up to advice the Scottish Executive on the development and implementation of a coherent national strategy, and the most appropriate targeting of available resources.</p>

  <p>SACAM identified, within its first Action Plan, the range of developments necessary to lay firm foundations for effective implementation of a robust and sustainable strategy. The work currently in progress will help us to determine the most appropriate targeting of available resources in the longer term. At this stage, available funding is being used to support initial implementation of the Action Plan. Specific work in this respect includes the undertaking of a scoping review of alcohol misuse information; research into costs associated with alcohol misuse and cost-effectiveness of measures to reduce alcohol misuse which will shortly be commissioned; the preparation of an inventory of alcohol services; increased funding to Alcohol Misuse Co-ordinating Committees in recognition of their vital role in alcohol misuse at both local and national level, and to inform prevention and health promotion aspects of a national strategy, SACAM is planning to hold an event later this year to examine evidence and perspectives of alcohol misuse.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Cancer Group, which leads and directs Scotland&#8217;s cancer strategy, is working actively with the Scottish Executive and with the service to ensure that everyone with cancer has access to modern, high quality and responsive services, supported by up-to-date technology and information systems centred on their needs.</p>

  <p>I announced recently the first round of NHS Capital Modernisation Fund investments which will provide state of the art linear accelerators and treatment planning computers for the delivery of radiotherapy in Scotland&#8217;s Cancer Centres. Another example of technological investment to improve the care of people with cancer is the pilot telemedicine project involving the Glasgow &amp; West of Scotland Gynaecological cancer network which is funded by the Executive&#8217;s telemedicine initiative. A rolling equipment replacement programme is already in place for the Scottish Breast Screening Programme.</p>

  <p>I visited the Sea Mammal Research Unit, the statutory advisers on seals, in St. Andrews on 16 May when scientists confirmed that seal predation on salmonids in estuaries and the lower reaches of rivers is probably related to small numbers of &quot;rogue&quot; animals. I am advised that targeted shooting under the Conservation of Seals Act 1970 is likely to be the most effective way of addressing this problem.</p>

  <p>There appears to be no direct correlation between growing seal numbers in the sea and the decline in salmon stocks. In Scotland, as throughout the rest of the range of Atlantic salmon, catches have been declining for a number of years. The reasons for the decline are not clear but it is acknowledged that the mortality rate in the marine phase of the salmon&#8217;s life has increased, thus reducing the number of fish returning to our rivers each year. In addition to predation factors such as habitat degradation, disease, water quality and poor weather conditions may also have an effect on spawning populations.</p>

  <p>The issue of seal predation on freshwater fisheries already features in the consultation paper <i>Protecting and Promoting Scotland&#8217;s Freshwater Fish and Fisheries: A Review</i>, published recently. A copy of this is held in the Parliament Information Centre.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Public Pensions Agency is responsible for the administration of the NHS Superannuation Scheme. The agency is having a new computer system developed and has consequently been unable to provide scheme members, including general practitioners, with a statement of their benefit entitlement since December 1997. The system development is nearing completion and the agency expects to meet its target to issue scheme members with benefit statements this year.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1O-1879 by Ross Finnie on 8 June 2000, who would be liable to pay compensation should it subsequently be revealed that a hazardous substance, caused by GM contaminated oil seed rape, had entered the animal and human food chain.</p>

  <p>In the hypothetical situation to which you refer, I would advise that liability for the payment of compensation would be a matter for the civil courts and would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case.</p>

  <p>However, I would like to repeat the advice of the Food Standards Agency that any oil derived from the GM affected oilseed rape, planted last year, is as safe for food use as oil derived from its conventional counterpart.</p>

  <p>The Advisory Committee on Animal Feedingstuffs (ACAF) has also concluded that the adventitious presence of GM material in oilseed rape, at the levels reported, did not pose a threat to human or animal health via its use in animal feed.</p>

  <p>There has been one appointment to the board of Greater Glasgow Health Board since 1 July 1999.

  <p>The figure of &pound;18,000 quoted in question S1W-7449 did not include staff time spent preparing the document. <i>Rural Scotland: A New Approach</i> was produced with the assistance of contributions from a large number of officials across the Executive. The Scottish Executive does not routinely keep a record of the time spent by officials in carrying out particular tasks. It is not, therefore, possible to determine precisely the staff cost element. The document was circulated to a wide range of rural interests using standard consultation lists. <i>Rural Scotland: A New Approach</i> was a policy statement rather than a consultation document and responses were not specifically invited. Nevertheless, a number of written and verbal comments have been received. <br /></p>
