  <p>My officials have been informed that the UK Border Agency does not provide statistical information on a month by month basis. However, it has published quarterly reports for 2009 which are available on the UKBA website http://rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/immigration-asylum-publications.html.</p>

  <p>The reports detail the numbers of people who entered detention for immigration purposes &ndash; these include a breakdown by age and place of detention. However, they do not specify if the children were those of asylum seeking families.</p>

  <p>According to these reports a total of 100 children entered Dungavel detention centre.</p>

  <p>These figures are not subject to detailed checks. Some detainees may be recorded more than once, for example, the person has been detained on more than one separate occasion in the time period shown, such as a person who has left detention, but has subsequently been re-detained.</p>

  <p>I welcome the Immigration Minister&rsquo;s recent announcement that the detention of children at Dungavel is to end immediately. However, I remain opposed to detaining children of asylum seekers anywhere in the UK, including those who may be transferred from Scotland, and urge the new UK Government to introduce their new policy throughout the UK as quickly as possible.</p>

  <p>I am unclear how the UK Government will carry out its commitment to end the detention of children or whether this will include the end to dawn raids, however, I am aware that they have launched a comprehensive review. I took the opportunity to raise these issues in my letter to the new Home Secretary, Theresa May, on Tuesday 18 May and to Damian Green, the new Immigration Minister on Thursday 20 May<span lang="">. I also took these letters as an opportunity to offer support to the UK Government in finding a humane solution.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">I would like to take this opportunity to reassure you that my officials will be monitoring this change in practice and will continue to reaffirm our opposition to the forcible removal of children and dawn raids.</span></p>

  <p><span lang=""><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>Scottish Government Bee Inspectors commenced their programme of inspections in May 2010. Inspections have initially focussed on the apiaries of the commercial beekeepers in the Perthshire area that were most severely affected by European Foulbrood in 2009. Inspections are also being carried out in other areas where EFB and AFB was confirmed in 2009. In addition there will also be spot-checks throughout the country.</span></p>

  <p><span lang=""><strong>Peter Peacock (Highlands and Islands) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what its assessment is of the (a) health and (b) numbers of the bee population following the severe weather conditions in the winter of 2009-10.</span></p>

  <p><span lang=""><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>The health of the bee population will be clearer when more inspections have been completed this summer.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">An assessment of information provided by commercial bee farmers indicates that overwinter losses are highly variable between businesses, ranging from 10% or less to over 50% in a few cases. However, these losses cannot be unequivocally assigned to the impact of severe weather as a number of factors, including nutrition and health over previous years will also play a part.</span></p>

  <p><span lang=""><strong>Peter Peacock (Highlands and Islands) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what funding has been committed to monitor bee diseases in 2010-11 and what the equivalent figures were for (a) 2007-08 (b) 2008-09 and (c ) 2009-10.</span></p>

  <p><span lang=""><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>Funding is not allocated directly to the monitoring of bee diseases. The Scottish Government provides funding for a number of areas in relation to the health of honeybees including support for a team of 12 bee inspectors (four full-time equivalents) and a free diagnostic service at SASA to identify and confirm the presence of varroa and notifiable bee pests and diseases.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">Scottish Government also supports an apiculture specialist at the Scottish Agricultural College to provide comprehensive advisory, training and education programmes for beekeepers throughout Scotland. In addition Scottish Government have committed a contribution of &pound;500,000 to the &pound;10 million Insect Pollinator research initiative which will address issues of bee health.</span></p>

  <p><span lang=""><strong>Alex Neil: </strong>I am very pleased with the first year of the Energy Assistance Package (EAP), a four-stage package of help, targeted at people who are fuel poor, and recommended by the independent Scottish Fuel Poverty Forum. The EAP does much more than the old Central Heating Programme.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">In its first year the EAP delivered:</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">energy savings advice provided 81,933 times; </span></p>

  <p><span lang="">helped almost a 1,000 older households to increase their annual income, on average, by &pound;1,681; </span></p>

  <p><span lang="">helped 2,167 households to move to cheaper social tariffs, saving on average &pound;118 a year, and</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">installed heating or improved heating systems for over 11,500 households of which 7,000 installations were EAP referrals, 63% of the total. The average delivery time was a third of that under the central heating programme.</span></p>

  <p><span lang=""><strong>Alex Neil: </strong>The Scottish Government, by the end of this year, will have invested over &pound;129 million, since April 2008, through the Affordable Housing Investment Programme in the Highlands and Islands. This investment will have provided over 1,500 homes to the area. We recognise that demand exceeds supply and are working with our partners to try and find more efficient and effective ways to increase the supply of housing. New initiatives such as the Council House Build programme or the National Housing Trust offer opportunities for local authorities to engage with the Scottish Government to increase affordable housing in these areas.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">As well as increasing the supply of housing, the new Housing Bill, introduced to Parliament in January 2010, aims to safeguard existing social housing for future generations by reforming the right to buy. This will prevent new affordable housing being lost to the affordable market.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">The Highland Council has already made use of existing pressured area designation provisions to safeguard a portion of its existing stock from RTB sales and may apply to ministers to extend that designation beyond the original five year period. The Housing Bill also contains provisions to introduce more flexibility and local control over the designation of pressured areas.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">In addition to its direct funding role the Scottish Government continues to engage closely with the four local authorities, that cover the Highlands and Islands, in their strategic role of identifying local housing needs and setting local housing priorities.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">Home Reports are very different from Home Information Packs (HIPs) in England and Wales. The Home Report contains a Single Survey, Energy Report and Property Questionnaire whereas HIPs contain a number of legal documents but no survey.

  <p><span lang=""><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>There are several initiatives in place that aim to reduce the rate of inflation in the NHS. These primarily focus on the areas that consume a high percentage of the budget, i.e. pay, procurement and prescribing.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">NHS pay is determined at the UK level by independent pay review bodies. The Scottish Government feed into this process. Part of the evaluation of the pay review bodies is to consider the current state of the economy including growth, the labour market and inflation. In the procurement of services, national contracts are negotiated to ensure value for money.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">There are also initiatives in place to control the prices which the NHS is paying for both generic and proprietary drugs and to ensure remuneration arrangements for independent Primary Care contractors for 2010-11 are reasonable in current economic circumstances.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">NHS boards are also required to operate within their agreed revenue resource limit; operate within their capital resource limit; meet their cash requirement, and meet their cash efficiency target hence controlling the rate of expenditure within the NHS overall.</span></p>

  <p><span lang=""><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>The assimilation process of Agenda for Change is complete and all NHSScotland staff are being paid in accordance with the new system. Staff who were dissatisfied with their initial pay banding, however, had the right to request a review. The vast majority of these have now been done but some boards do still have reviews left to complete. Officials are monitoring progress closely and working with boards to establish a timeline for completion to ensure this last part of the Agenda for Change implementation process is finalised as quickly as possible.</span></p>

  <p><span lang=""><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>Our Better Health Better Care Action Plan launched in August 2007, set out our commitments to a robust NHS partnership with staff, patients and carers. Actions include:</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">The Better Together, Patient Experience Programme launched in 2008, which encourages and empowers patients, carers and staff to work together in partnership to provide patient centred care and improve NHS services for the benefit of everyone;</span></p>

  <p><span lang=""> The Patient Rights (Scotland) Bill, introduced to the Scottish Parliament in March, which aims to improve patients&rsquo; experiences of using health services and support people to become more involved in their health.</span></p>

  <p><span lang="">More recently we have also launched the Quality Strategy which will see the quality of care provided by the NHS measured for the first time through patients&rsquo; experience and the information used to drive up standards. The Quality Strategy will put patients at the heart of everything the NHS does and give people a new confidence in the health service.</span></p>
