  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether issues in regard to EEC subsidy rules have been a factor in the closure of the abattoir in Stornoway; what plans it has to address any concerns which the Scottish Crofters Union and the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals may have about the consequences of the closure of the abattoir, and what action it intends to take to prevent the loss of this facility.</p>

  <p>The European Community state aid framework exists to ensure a level playing field for all enterprises in Europe by ensuring that public bodies throughout the European Union do not provide selective support to businesses or undertakings. Aid cannot be given unless it fits one of the block exemption regulations or is notified to, and approved by, the European Commission. This aid cannot take the form of an &quot;operating aid&quot; or provide support for an enterprise that would otherwise fail. My officials have been working with Western Isles Council to help them identify legitimate ways in which they could help Heather Isles Meats in Stornoway stay in business. The decision whether to invest further in Heather Isles Meats rested with the council and a full meeting of the council concluded that it should not provide further support to the business under a rescue and restructuring package.</p>

  <p>In the interests of sustainable farming, it is important that there are profitable markets for livestock whether that is abattoirs or other farmers to finish the animals. While only one-third of livestock from the Western Isles is slaughtered on the Islands, the council remain fully committed to retaining slaughterhouse facilities throughout the Western Isles and are looking at how this aim can best be met.</p>

  <p>Neither the Scottish Crofters Federation nor the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals have approached the Executive.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Asymptomatic prostate cancer can remain dormant and undetected until death from other causes intervenes. Incidence has increased considerably since 1990, and some of this increase will be due to increasingly common incidental findings of small tumours in the prostate during surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia.</p>

  <p>2. A steep increase was observed between 1992 and 1993 which is associated with the introduction of the prostate specific antigen (PSA) test for diagnosis and disease monitoring leading to increased detection of prevalent cases. Incidence is slightly inflated in 1996 due to the introduction of a standard definition of incidence date across Scotland. There was a fall in incidence in 1997. A similar pattern of increased incidence followed by a fall following the introduction of the PSA test has been seen in England and Wales, and has also previously been seen in the USA.</p>

  <p>3. Mortality from prostate cancer has remained constant throughout the 1990s.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Asymptomatic prostate cancer can remain dormant and undetected until death from other causes intervenes. Incidence has increased considerably since early 1990, and some of this increase will be due to increasingly common incidental findings of small tumours in the prostate during surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia.</p>

  <p>2. The steep increase between 1992 and 1993 is associated with the introduction of the prostate specific antigen (PSA) test for diagnosis and disease monitoring leading to increased detection of prevalent cases. Incidence has been falling since 1997. A similar pattern of increased incidence followed by a fall following the introduction of the PSA test has been seen in England and Wales, and has also previously been seen in the USA.</p>

  <p>All NHS boards are responsible for promotion of the breast screening programme aimed at raising awareness particularly in areas of low uptake. The percentage of eligible women in Scotland in the age range 50-64, who accepted a routine invitation to attend breast screening in 2000, was 73% (minimum uptake target 70%).</p>

  <p>In 2000-01 Greater Glasgow, Lanarkshire and Lothian Health Boards were below the minimum with uptake rates of 66.1%, 69.3% and 69.7% respectively. A range of promotion activities are undertaken by the NHS boards to encourage women within low uptake areas such as more mobile screening units in inner city deprived areas, localised media campaigns and information in GP surgeries.</p>

  <p>Women over the age of 70 are not routinely invited for breast screening but may self refer. In 2000-01 <sup>1</sup> , the latest year for which data are available, the number of women over the age of 70 who were screened following self referral was 2,985.</p>

  <p>Claimants are advised that an initial claim check will be undertaken within 30 working days of receipt by the department. No deadline is set for payments, which inevitably depend on auditing claim forms and supporting documentation and, in most cases, a physical inspection of the project involved. The need to arrange the inspection programme cost-effectively means that there can be some delay in inspection visits, particularly in remote areas. The Executive, therefore, pays 75% of an eligible claim as soon as it is satisfied with the claim and supporting documentation. The balance of the claim is paid within 10 working days of receipt of a satisfactory inspection report. The relevant EC Regulations preclude reimbursement for any financial charges accrued pending payment.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is demonstrating its continuing commitment to victims and their families within the criminal justice system through the implementation of the <i>Scottish Strategy for Victims</i> . The strategy has been developed by the main criminal justice agencies with the objectives of improving support and information for victims as well as increasing opportunities for victims to participate in the criminal justice system. Each of the agencies has published an action plan to support the strategy and implementation is monitored by the Victims Steering Group, a multi-agency forum which promotes the interests of victims and their families within the justice system.</p>

  <p>As a result, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service has established the Victim Liaison Office to improve the availability of information about the progress of individual cases reported to Procurators Fiscal for victims and bereaved next of kin. The police have also resolved the data protection issues in relation to passing information to Victim Support Scotland to make it easier for victims of crime who wish it, to get the support they need.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill includes provisions to give victims certain rights to improve the position of victims and their families in the criminal justice system. Thus certain victims of crime, if they wish it, will have a statutory right to be informed of an offender&#146;s release from prison; to make representations to the Parole Board before a decision is taken on the release of a prisoner, and to receive information about the outcome of Parole Board reviews and licence conditions. The Executive also plans to pilot a scheme which will allow victims to make a statement about the impact of the crime to better inform decisions.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-18802 by Angus MacKay on 19 November 2001, whether the information given in that answer is comprehensive and accurate given the article in the <i>Scotland on Sunday</i> on 24 March 2002 referring to a failure to compile details of the political affiliation of appointments to non-departmental public bodies and whether it has any plans to amend that answer.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-04-17.S1W-24411.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80183" speakername="Mr Andy Kerr" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0417.htm#21">

  <p>As I made clear in the answer to question S1W-20118 on 26 March 2002 and in a letter to the member, a recent audit of data on political activity of current members of non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs), discovered that in most cases the correct procedures for recording details of political activity had been followed. However, I regret to say that it also discovered that in 411 individual cases, the political activity declaration had not been completed.</p>

  <p>The missing political activity declaration forms do affect the aggregate information about the political activity of appointees serving on NDPBs sponsored by the Executive, which was published in answer to question S1W-18802. Because records on individual appointments going back to 1996 are incomplete, we are unable to publish an amendment to that answer.</p>

  <p>I am extremely concerned that the correct procedure was not followed by officials in every case and have raised this matter with the Permanent Secretary. He has, in turn, instructed the Heads of the Executive Departments to ensure that the correct procedures are followed in every respect in future.</p>

  <p>The first phase of the extension of park and ride facilities at Croy Station will be constructed on land belonging to North Lanarkshire Council north of the railway and east of the B802 and will remain in the council&#146;s ownership. This site was chosen by Strathclyde Passenger Transport because it could be developed quickly to meet the immediate need for additional park and ride opportunities.</p>

  <p>Options for siting the second phase of the extended park and ride facilities will be considered by Strathclyde Passenger Transport and North Lanarkshire Council in consultation with Railtrack, ScotRail and landowners. This will form part of a detailed study before any decision is taken on the location and nature of the second phase.</p>

  <p>The Joint Venture Partnership has not yet been agreed. However, it will be a key condition that all tourism businesses will have equal access to the website and the national telephone number. The new company&#146;s business plan, which will require the agreement of VisitScotland and the Area Tourist Boards, will contain this condition. Changes to the Business Plan will also require the approval of these organisations.</p>

  <p>It is proposed that the private sector will have majority control of the company. However, there will be a wide range of contractual safeguards in place to control the actions of the company and to ensure that it does not act against the public interest. These will include, for example, the requirement for the ATBs/VisitScotland to approve the company Business Plan and any subsequent changes to it.</p>

  <p>The principle elements of the joint venture have been widely publicised &#150; not least in the Scottish Executive&#146;s <i>Strategy for Tourism</i> , published in February 2000. The joint venture is subject to a full EU procurement process and a prospectus for the project was published in June 2000. A project board has guided the project and has made strategic decisions on behalf of the public sector stakeholders. The board includes representatives of the Area Tourist Board (ATB) network, which represents around 16,000 tourism related businesses. ATBs have provided information about the project to their members, and VisitScotland has provided information in its <i>Signpost</i> magazine as well as meeting with trade organisations. The detail of the project has been developed during negotiations with the preferred bidder and it has therefore not been practicable to consult widely on any specific points.</p>

  <p>The Parliament recycles approximately eight tonnes of waste paper per month. However, it is not possible to express this figure as a percentage as we do not have an equivalent measure of the waste paper that is not recycled.</p>

  <p>It is estimated that 90% of plastic cups from vending machines are recycled each month. The Facilities Management Office is currently discussing options for recycling other waste plastics with its recycling contractor, LEEP (Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise Partnership).</p>
