  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many (a) farmers and (b) crofters have notified a reduction in their eligible land areas for the purposes of claiming under Single Farm Payment or Less Favoured Area Support schemes since new guidance was issued by ministers in May 2010.</p>

  <p>The member has raised the matter of land eligibility for these schemes in previous questions and in correspondence with me. I very much regret, therefore, that I must again remind him that the guidance issued was not new and had been represented to farmers and stakeholders well in advance of the May submission date for the single application forms. What constituted eligibility for these schemes, therefore, before the issue of the guidance and what constituted eligibility afterwards is the same.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s publicity about eligibility, the issue of the notes for guidance and the reminder of the provisions of EU legislation that allowed farmers to correct their claims, together, meant that farmers were given the opportunity to safeguard subsidies that are such a necessary part of their business viability. I was pleased that in excess of 2,000 businesses took this opportunity. I regret that I am not able to provide separate figures for farmers and crofters.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government shares the view of Jonathan Hall, Head of Rural Policy at the National Farmers Union Scotland, who gave evidence at the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee meeting held at Langholm on 7 September 2010 in relation to the Wildlife and Natural Environment (Scotland) Bill.

  <p>The Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2009 places a legal duty on Scottish Ministers to secure the provision of an advocacy service to be available on request and free of charge to support parents and young people in tribunal proceedings. The Scottish Government decided to run a competitive tendering process to identify one or more organisations which would be awarded a grant to run a suitably specified national advocacy service.</p>

  <p>All applications were assessed individually and then collectively by an assessment panel. Applications were assessed on the basis of the information provided in the application form. Each question was scored and then a weighting applied to that score to produce a final mark. The questions and assessment criteria covered:</p>

  <p>General operation and financial position of organisation;</p>

  <p>Promotion of equal opportunities;</p>

  <p>Information on the operation, management and location of the service;</p>

  <p>Ability to deliver the service within the maximum of &pound;100,000 per annum;</p>

  <p>Detailed timetable of activities for first year of operation and outline arrangements for years two and three;</p>

  <p>Explanation of how proposed service fits with organisation&rsquo;s current aims and objectives;</p>

  <p>Knowledge, experience and skills of staff and organisation;</p>

  <p>Detailed information on how the organisation would deliver service including initial assessment; referral routes; closure of cases; how advocacy would be provided; capacity to deliver a national and fully inclusive service; how the provider would deliver both lay and legal elements of the service; freedom from conflicts of interest; and accountability to service users;</p>

  <p>Training and development for staff;</p>

  <p>Partnership working;</p>

  <p>Information and awareness programme; and</p>

  <p>Quality assurance.</p>

  <p>Applicants were also required to provide copies of their health and safety policy; equal opportunities policy; confidentiality policy and environmental policy as well as confirming that all staff involved in the project would have Disclosure Scotland reports prior to commencement of the service.</p>

  <p>A co-ordinated support plan is an educational plan which involves, and notes the commitments by, other agencies in providing significant additional support to enable a child or young person to benefit from education.</p>

  <p>In September 2009, out of a total of 44,176 pupils in special schools and those with additional support needs in mainstream schools, 3,201 had a co-ordinated support plan. This information is publicly available in <em>Pupils in Scotland 2009</em> at:</p>

  <p>The term additional support needs applies to children or young people who, for whatever reason, require additional support, long or short term, to help them to make the most of their learning. The Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 places a duty on education authorities to identify, meet and keep under review the additional support needs of all pupils for whom they are responsible, and to tailor provision according to their individual needs. They will be supported, where necessary, by appropriate agencies such as Health Boards, Skills Development Scotland and other education authorities.</p>

  <p>There are, therefore, potentially a significant number of individuals who support pupils with additional support needs, including all teachers across Scotland. There are, however, some individuals who have a particular focus on pupils with additional support needs and the relevant data from the last two <em>Teachers in Scotland</em> reports provides this information.</p>

  <p>The Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2009 builds on, and amends, the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004. The 2004 Act provides the legal framework which underpins the system for identifying and addressing the additional support needs of children and young people who face barriers to learning.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government published an updated code of practice, <em>supporting children&rsquo;s learning</em> in August 2010. The code explains the duties on education authorities and other agencies to support children and young people&rsquo;s learning and provides guidance on the Act&rsquo;s provisions.</p>

  <p>An implementation group of expert professionals and stakeholders was established in December 2009 to provide advice and to support the implementation of the 2009 Act. Working in partnership with that implementation group the Scottish Government has produced some key documents to support implementation, which have been circulated to all local authorities, and held two information seminars. Learning and Teaching Scotland have also worked with the group to develop a range of materials to assist practitioners and Enquire have produced updated information for parents and young people. This work will support and complement the information and training being delivered at a local level.</p>

  <p>The 2004 Act includes provisions for resolving disputes where they arise. The Act makes provision for mediation services and arrangements for external independent adjudication as well as providing parents and young people with the right to refer particular matters to the Additional Support Needs Tribunals for Scotland. Following an open recruitment process new members and conveners have been appointed to the tribunals and to the list of independent adjudicators.</p>

  <p>Restoration of ecosystem function is a very broad objective. There is a very wide range of ecosystem types and a correspondingly diverse range of mechanisms which are potentially relevant to restoration of ecosystem function. It would not be practical to attempt a comprehensive listing of all such mechanisms. Examples might include measures which contribute to restoring soil structure, atmospheric quality, forest cover, ocean chemistry, dark skies, species populations or habitat structure and extent. Each of these might be advanced through a diverse range of mechanisms such as pollution control, land use planning; agri-environment measures, the marine management regime, forestry management, the protected area regime and habitat creation.</p>

  <p>A wide range of action is being taken by the Scottish Government and agencies, which can be gathered under three headings, information, trials and pilots, and large-scale ecological coherence proposals.</p>

  <p>Information is a critical element in improving ecological coherence as we need to translate the overall concept into practical land use and management changes. A partnership of Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), the Forestry Commission and Forest Research has led in producing such a tool (generally referred to as BEETLE) and Forest Research has undertaken a number of contracts to provide this information for specific projects.</p>

  <p>There have been a number of trials and pilots in specific areas to test the concepts and practicality of improving ecological coherence. For example, in 2006 Forestry Commission Scotland, SNH and Highland Birchwoods collaborated on a woodland establishment incentive, Highland Locational Premium. This provided incentives in proportion to the additional ecological coherence created by paying for increases in the size of native woodland ecological networks.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s National Planning Framework 2 identifies two projects of national status. The first of these is the Central Scotland Green Network, a project which includes ecological coherence within a wider spread of objectives. The second action is to develop a National Ecological Network.</p>

  <p>With independence, Scotland would be able to choose the right policy responses to suit its particular circumstances. The recent global financial crisis affected countries large and small. Norway, for example, managed its own banking crisis in the early 1990s, in the end emerging with a more resilient financial sector via a process under which the government actually made money on its investment in the banks. When the global crisis deepened in late 2008, Norway was able to offer securitised bonds totalling more than &pound;33 billion should its banks have needed them.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government, through the Partnership Information Network (PIN) policies, sets the minimum standard NHSScotland boards must meet when providing support for staff with health issues.

  <p>Earlier this year the Scottish Government and the Management Steering Group of NHS Scotland established the Occupational Health and Safety Strategic Forum. As part of its remit, I have asked the Forum to develop a new strategic framework for occupational health and safety provision for staff within NHSScotland, to replace the current strategy, <em>Towards a Safer, Healthier Workplace</em>, published in 1999.</p>

  <p>This strategic framework will provide an opportunity to confirm our commitment to a person centred approach towards health, wellbeing and safety at work, ensuring all staff are well supported by an integrated strategy that adds value to existing occupational health and safety policies and services.</p>

  <p>Following a tender exercise in May 2008, Quayle Munro (QM) was chosen to conduct the Policy and Financial Management Review (PFMR) of HIAL.</p>

  <p>QM was tasked to consider the following:</p>

  <p>the best future delivery model for the functions currently carried out by HIAL;</p>

  <p>company performance since 1999;</p>

  <p>the internal structures of HIAL;</p>

  <p>the government/HIAL working relationship, and</p>

  <p>working relations with other stakeholders.</p>

  <p>A joint HIAL/Scottish Government Steering Group was formed to guide the Review and the work of QM. QM&rsquo;s final report was presented to the Scottish Government in April 2009 and a copy has been provided to the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s Information Centre (Bib number 52068).</p>

  <p>The most significant conclusions from QM&rsquo;s work were that:</p>

  <p>HIAL&rsquo;s current status as a public corporation is best in moving forward on the basis that it affords the Scottish Government an appropriate and cost effective level of control over air service provision in the Highlands and Islands;</p>

  <p>the company should be afforded more flexibility on certain pay and staffing matters;</p>

  <p>a review of operating costs, subsidy levels and potentially categorisation should be conducted for Wick and Campbeltown Airports;</p>

  <p>the potential for operational efficiencies at Scatsta and Sumburgh Airports should be reviewed, and</p>

  <p>consideration should be given to HIAL bringing Highlands and Islands local authority owned airports into the group.</p>

  <p>For the reasons provided by QM, we agree with the conclusion that HIAL should remain a Public Corporation.</p>

  <p>On more flexibility for the company on pay policy, we agree that this would be a reasonable consideration for the company and whilst it would be free to present a business case, it should be clarified that ministers are not minded at this point to remove from public sector pay policy rules those Scottish public bodies which they currently apply to.</p>

  <p>Ministers remain committed to Wick and Campbeltown having appropriate transport connections. Whilst it is appropriate for HIAL to consider costs, subsidy levels and value for money at these airports, ministers believe that when considering the remoteness of the areas they serve and the lengthy surface connections which are often involved, their mainland status should not be a factor in any analysis or decisions taken.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s full response to the conclusions in QM&rsquo;s report has been provided to the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 52068).</p>

  <p>We will now draw-up an action plan in consultation with HIAL covering those conclusions agreed.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive in what ways the Scottish Social Housing Charter will differ from the Performance Standards for social landlords and homelessness functions.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-11-18.S3W-37433.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80370" speakername="Alex Neil" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa1118.htm#13">

  <p>Performance standards for social landlords and homelessness functions are statutory guidance that ministers issued under section 79(1) of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 (the 2001 Act). They were developed in consultation with COSLA and the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations and provide a framework for the current Scottish Housing Regulator to assess the performance of social landlords and for landlords to assess their own performance.</p>

  <p>The Housing (Scotland) Bill will repeal Section 79 of the 2001 Act and replace the performance standards with the Scottish Social Housing Charter, for which sections 31-33 of the Bill make provision.</p>

  <p>Section 33 of the Bill requires Scottish Ministers, before preparing the charter, to consult a wider range of stakeholders than was involved in developing the performance standards. These stakeholders include tenants, homeless persons and other users of housing services, as well as social landlords. The charter will provide the framework for the new, independent Scottish Housing Regulator to monitor, assess and report on (and where necessary intervene in) social landlords&rsquo; performance of housing activities. This provides a clear separation between setting standards (the role of ministers) and assessing performance against those standards (the role of the independent regulator).</p>

  <p>The involvement of service users and others, as well as landlords, in developing the charter is one of the most important ways in which it differs from the performance standards. Another is that the charter can set outcomes as well as standards. This will enable the charter to be cast in terms that will encourage social landlords to concentrate on the results that they should be delivering for tenants, homeless people and other service users. The Bill requires the regulator to monitor, assess and report annually on landlords&rsquo; performance against the charter and provides it with powers to intervene where a landlord is failing, or at risk of failing, to achieve the outcomes in the charter.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will not consult on the powers of the new, independent Scottish Housing Regulator to issue performance targets to social landlords (local authorities and registered social landlords) in the Housing (Scotland) Bill. The Bill, by requiring the regulator to consult on and publish a statement on the performance of its functions, including its powers to set performance improvement targets for social landlords, places the duty to consult in respect of these matters on the regulator. There is also a specific duty on the regulator to consult before it issues a performance improvement target.</p>

  <p>The number of local authority homes completed in each year since 1996-97 is published on the Scottish Government website by local authority area. All of these homes are for social rent. The following is a link to this data:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/Browse/Housing-Regeneration/HSfS/NewBuildLA" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/Browse/Housing-Regeneration/HSfS/NewBuildLA</a></p>

  <p>The number of housing association homes built for social rent over the past decade is shown in the following table by local authority area. Figures for 1999 are not shown as the time series is only available on a consistent basis from 2000-01.</p>

  <p>Information on new build for social rent by Scottish Parliamentary constituency area is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is considering the recommendations of the Independent Review of Sheriff and Jury Procedure and will respond publicly in the coming months.</p>

  <p>Some recommendations would require changes to legislation to be implemented, and those will need to be addressed by the next government in the forthcoming parliamentary session. Others do not require legislative change and can be implemented through improvements to working practice. The Scottish Government will work with criminal justice partners to pursue these improvements over the course of 2011.</p>

  <p>The United Kingdom Government is directly cutting Scotland's resources by &pound;1.3 billion next year. The decision to increase the interest rates on loans offered to councils by the Public Works Loan Board is an additional handicap.

  <p>The United Kingdom Government is directly cutting Scotland's resources by &pound;1.3 billion next year. The decision to increase the interest rates on loans offered to councils by the Public Works Loan Board is an additional handicap. This will increase the overall cost of tax incremental financing projects and also increase the time period over which non domestic rate receipts will repay the associated borrowing. While this will impact on the value for money of each project, the impact will vary from project to project.</p>

  <p>The decision to increase the interest rates on loans offered to councils by the Public Works Loan Board will increase the cost of council house building where this is funded from borrowing. Decisions on the investment in new housing are for individual councils to make, but the increase in interest rates will reduce their capacity to build new homes without increasing rent levels or cutting other costs to compensate.</p>

  <p>There has been an increase in overall respite weeks provision across Scotland. Statistics published on 28 September show that the amount of respite provision rose by 8,950 weeks between 2007-08 and 2009-10, exceeding the target of a rise of 6,000 weeks.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to <em>An Official Statistics Publication for Scotland: Respite Care</em>, published on 28 September 2010 which includes information for each local authority on total respite weeks, 2006-07 to 2009-10. Eight authorities have provided less respite weeks in 2009-10 compared with the position in 2007-08 (baseline year). The link is:</p>

  <p><em>The Carers and Young Carers Strategy</em>, published jointly with COSLA in July, has clear expectations around the provision of innovative, personalised short breaks/respite, preventative support and emergency respite. That is why I announced in the strategy &pound;1 million for short breaks in 2010-11. We have decided to roll this forward, making &pound;5 million in total to 2015. The National Carers Organisations are about to finalise proposals for the use of this funding.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-37107 by Stewart Stevenson on 3 November 2010, whether work on the transport plan for the 2014 Ryder Cup will include consideration of the reopening of Blackford railway station.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland have already considered a proposal to reopen Blackford railway station earlier this year as part of their assessment of AECOM's independent review published in April 2010 on behalf of the Campaign to Open Blackford Railway Station Again.</p>

  <p>The assessment concluded that the proposal did not fully integrate with the current and committed operation of the rail network. Due to the close proximity of Gleneagles station, Transport Scotland&rsquo;s investment hierarchy points to making best use of existing stations and the Ryder Cup transport planning will consider proposed improvements to Gleneagles station rather than reopening Blackford station.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has no plans to introduce a bus scrappage scheme. In July 2010 we launched the Scottish Green Bus Fund which will provide grants to bus operators for the purchase of low carbon buses. We are currently assessing the bids made for this fund and will announce the results in November.</p>

  <p>The estimated cost for the current Performance Audit Group contract is &pound;20 million over the seven year contract period. This represents a &pound;9.1 million reduction over the previous contract for 2002 to 2009, which was for &pound;29.1 million. The cost of the initial contract from 1995 to 2002 was &pound;8.9 million.</p>
