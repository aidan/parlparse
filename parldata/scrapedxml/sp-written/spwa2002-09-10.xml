  <p>These procedures are broadly the same in Scotland and in England. However, in Scotland, training providers are paid on achievement of milestones by individual apprentices. In England providers are paid on monthly profile for the duration of training.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-24669 by Mr Jim Wallace on 24 April 2002, how the rule of ownership of boundary divisions on an ad medium filum basis can be ascribed to fences that stand on and mark the boundary where, after specifying the type of fence, the title deeds of the adjacent parties state that the dividing fence is the (a) common and (b) mutual property of the parties to be maintained at equally shared cost by them.</p>

  <p>It is not appropriate for ministers to seek to interpret the law, as this is a matter for the courts. I am meeting the member on 2 October to discuss issues relating to boundary walls.</p>

  <p>Such representations may be made in a wide variety of ways. On a Scotland-wide basis, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service is represented on the District Courts Working Group and that provides a focus for discussion of a variety of issues.</p>

  <p>The most recent agenda included ways in which procurators fiscal could help courts in the Highlands to meet their target for delays between pleading diets and trials and electronic communication between procurators fiscal and courts.</p>

  <p>From time to time, the District Courts Association makes representations but it has not done so recently. Certain representations were made to the Justice 2 Committee Inquiry into the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service and a response was made to that committee.</p>

  <p>At local level, there are regular conversations between Justices, their clerks and procurators fiscal about issues of local application.</p>

  <p>Scottish Development International does not keep records of how many jobs are created by individual inward investors in a given year. The published figures reflect the number of jobs which a company plans to create or safeguard at the time its decision to invest in Scotland was made. The published figures refer only to projects in which Scottish Development International and its partners can claim to have had a significant involvement in ensuring that the project takes place in Scotland. The following figures relate to projects where a company has made a decision to invest or expand and where the main activity of the project is manufacturing. Not all jobs created by a manufacturing project are necessarily manufacturing jobs.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>For internal purposes, reports of job losses by companies, local enterprise companies and newspapers are monitored. However, the Executive cannot vouch for the accuracy and completeness of this information and therefore does not consider that it should form the basis of a response to the question.</p>

  <p>The revised guidelines are not due to be published until December 2002. The implementation of SIGN guidelines is a matter for NHS boards, in consultation with other authorities as appropriate. SIGN guidelines are best practice clinical guidelines and are not intended to be construed or to serve as standards of medical care. The ultimate judgement on a particular procedure or treatment plan is for the clinician treating the patient to make on the basis of individual circumstances and available options.</p>

  <p>The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service has a complaints procedure, details of which are available on the Crown Office website. The policy is to respond to all complaints quickly, courteously, fairly and efficiently and to take appropriate action when required. In addition, members of the public can, and often do, write to the Lord Advocate either personally or via their Member of Parliament. The Lord Advocate and his officials investigate concerns and complaints made in this way with a view to giving full and objective responses.</p>

  <p>Complaints of criminal conduct by police officers are investigated independently by Area Procurators Fiscal and reported to Crown Office for consideration of a Law Officer. Again details of this procedure are available on the departmental website. The procedures for handling complaints against the police, which do not involve criminal conduct, are regulated by statute. The legislation enables a dissatisfied complainant to ask Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary to review the case. A consultation paper was issued last year with proposals on ways to enhance the independence of the police complaints system and we are currently considering the next steps in light of the responses to that consultation.</p>

  <p>The Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1990 provides for the Scottish Legal Services Ombudsman to investigate complaints about the way in which the Law Society of Scotland has handled a complaint against a solicitor. The Ombudsman&#8217;s powers and relevant procedures are set out in sections 34, 34A, and 34B of the 1990 Act and schedule 3. A complaint to the Ombudsman marks the end of the appeals process, and the Ombudsman's written report setting out her conclusions on a complaint is final. The Scottish Legal Services Ombudsman is appointed by the Scottish ministers after consultation with the Lord President of the Court of Session and is independent of both the Law Society of Scotland and the Scottish ministers. Complaints about the service received from the Ombudsman's Office should be made to the Ombudsman. The Scottish ministers may give general directions to the Ombudsman about the scope and discharge of her functions, but do not at any time get involved with individual complaints. The General Directions which came into force on 1 April 1993 are set out in Appendix A to the Ombudsman&#8217;s Annual Report for 2001-02.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to make this forecast. The nature of renewable developments, and their timings, are matters for industry to determine, both within Scotland and the EU. Our policy is to increase the overall proportion of electricity generated in Scotland from renewable sources through use of a range of technologies, not only wind. Our current target is 18% by 2010. On 23 August, I launched a consultation document that seeks views on whether we can achieve a position whereby as much as 40% of our electricity can be generated from renewable sources by 2020.</p>

  <p>The provisions of The Cryptosporidium Directions 2002 requires Scottish Water to take account of the number of grazing animals on a catchment. Scottish Water does not control the livestock management practices on the vast majority of its catchments and so has limited ability to reduce the risk of cryptosporidium from this source. Where Scottish Water is in a position to control the livestock management practices, such as on part of the Loch Katrine catchment, steps are being taken to reduce the risk of cryptosporidium by eliminating the presence of grazing animals in line with the recommendations of the OCT report from Greater Glasgow Health Board and the risk reduction requirements contained in the directions. The Cryptosporidium Directions 2002 restate the provision in The Cryptosporidium Direction 2000, to take account of the provisions of The Water Industry (Scotland) Act 2002. The detail of the directions is unchanged.</p>

  <p>The policy of the Scottish Executive was set out in <i>Water Quality and Standards, Investment Priorities for Scotland&#8217;s Water Authorities 2002-2006</i> published in August 2001, which set out clearly the intention to improve all water treatment facilities assessed as high and moderate risk for cryptosporidium by 2005. This statement is underpinned by directions and regulations.</p>

  <p>The Cryptosporidium Direction 2002 (which updates The Cryptosporidium Direction 2000 in the light of the Water Industry Act 2002) requires the elimination of cryptosporidium oocysts from treated drinking water. The Water Supply (Water Quality)(Scotland) Regulations 2001 require the absence of organisms from treated drinking water (as indicated by total coliforms/faecal coliforms). The regulations set prescribed concentrations or values (PCVs) for 57 parameters and also require that the water does not contain any element, organism or substance at a concentration or value which would be detrimental to public health.</p>

  <p>The Council Directive 98/83/EC on the quality of water intended for human consumption provides a sound basis for both the consumers throughout the EU and the supplier of drinking water by setting minimum standards for drinking water. The implementation of this directive in Scotland through The Water Supply (Water Quality) (Scotland) Regulations 2001 sets standards for drinking water quality that are at least as strict and in some cases far stricter than that required by the directive. Enforcement of the regulations is the responsibility of the Drinking Water Quality Regulator for Scotland (DWQRfS), who was appointed under the provisions of the Water Industry (Scotland) Act 2002, who has ample powers to secure compliance.</p>
