  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-2183 by Iain Gray on 16 November 1999, how many elderly people have attended day care centres, broken down by local authority, in the years 1997-98, 1998-99 and 1999-date.</p>

  <p>The following table details the number of people attending day centres primarily intended for older people in 1997 and 1998. 1998 is the latest year for which data are available as this census is now conducted on a triennial basis. The methodology used in 1998 was different from that used in 1997 and therefore figures for the two years are not comparable.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Number attending is the number of people <u>on the register</u> of a centre during the census week in March, regardless of whether they actually attend the centre during that week.</p>

  <p>2. Figures are for day centres <u>primarily intended</u> for older people, some people attending these centres may belong to other client groups; it is also possible that some older people may attend centres primarily intended for other client groups.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-10377 by Susan Deacon on 1 November 2000, whether any balance of the resources allocated to each local authority to resolve problems of delayed discharge which is not required for this purpose is ring-fenced for the care of the elderly.</p>

  <p>Where local authorities have judged that they can resolve problems of delayed discharge without using all the resources allocated, they have been asked to deploy the balance to improve the level and extent of other services, for example those provided to older people.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-10377 by Susan Deacon on 1 November 2000, how it satisfied itself that any resources which local authorities are proposing to deploy elsewhere are not required in order to resolve problems of delayed discharge.</p>

  <p>Local authorities were required to discuss and agree their proposals with the corresponding health board(s) and Trust(s).

  <p>Each local authority is required to provide confirmation in mid-January 2001 that its proposal (or revised proposal) is being acted upon successfully.</p>

  <p>In conjunction, the department will continue to monitor delayed discharge through a national census. These will supply an ongoing flow of information on numbers, reasons and causes of delayed discharge. Among other things, this information will show whether or not local plans are delivering on outcomes.</p>

  <p>Where local authorities have judged that they can resolve problems of delayed discharge without using all of the resources allocated, they have been asked to redeploy the balance to improve the level and extent of other services, for example those provided to older people.</p>

  <p>We offered grant earlier this month to Phoenix House for an intensive day care rehabilitation facility in Aberdeen and to Turning Point for a day rehabilitation service in Aberdeenshire.</p>

  <p>We expect these to be supported in subsequent years through the substantial additional sums we are providing for treatment and rehabilitation of drug misusers within the overall package of &#163;100 million drug monies announced recently: &#163;10 million for treatment and &#163;21 million for rehabilitation over three years.

  <p>Services for individuals diagnosed within the autistic spectrum disorder are provided by health boards and local authorities, based on their assessment of the needs of their respective areas. Increased awareness and better understanding of all mental illness are part of our social inclusion agenda for all, and of our work to maximise the life opportunities for all vulnerable individuals and groups.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to improving the quality of health and social care services, and the general wellbeing of people with learning disabilities and mental health problems, to enable them to play a full part in society. The Learning Disability Review Report, launched on 11 May, recommends the establishment of a national service network to improve awareness and understanding of the needs of people within the autistic spectrum disorder. Together with a new Scottish Centre for Learning Disabilities, both will have important roles in how future services are designed and delivered.</p>

  <p>The report also recommends that local authorities and health boards should jointly draw up &quot;partnership in practice&quot; (PiP) agreements by June 2001 which will serve as the strategic planning document for meeting the needs of all people with learning disabilities. A key component of these first PiP&#8217;s should include proposals for how local authorities and health boards will meet the needs of those within the autistic spectrum disorder in their area, and cover mainstream and specialist support services.</p>

  <p>We are providing &#163;36 million over the next three years for a Change Fund to assist local authorities implement the report.</p>

  <p>The system of bonuses and penalties for Trusts based on performance against New Deal targets and standards which I announced in September 1999 was intended to act as an incentive to overcome the remaining obstacles to full compliance. At the time the latest returns from Trusts indicated that only 10% of junior doctors in Scotland were working outside the 56 hour limit. The detailed work which the New Deal Implementation Support Group (ISG) undertook with Trusts prior to its report to me in March 2000 revealed that the scale of non-compliance was greater than previously reported.</p>

  <p>In the light of information from the ISG, I informed Trusts that, while I remained determined that junior doctors&#8217; hours and working conditions must be improved as a matter of priority, I would postpone the imposition of financial penalties provided that they initiated remedial action. The ISG has since worked with Trusts to identify problems and develop solutions in this area.</p>

  <p>The concept of introducing incentives for those Trusts to meet New Deal targets has subsequently been incorporated into the agreement between the UK Health Departments and the BMA for a new contract for junior doctors. The contract which took effect from 1 December will reward the most hard pressed junior doctors and provide a real financial incentive for Trusts to reduce doctors&#8217; hours. The cost to Trusts of non-compliant posts will increase significantly at intervals throughout the next two years. The Scottish Executive has worked with the Scottish Junior Doctors&#8217; Committee (SJDC) and NHS Trusts in Scotland to implement the contract.</p>

  <p>On 28 June I announced that we would recruit 100 extra junior doctors in Scotland to be targeted at areas with an identified need for additional resources. We have already appointed 40 junior doctors in shortage specialties. The remaining 60 will be in place by the end of this financial year.</p>

  <p>Health boards were recently given their revenue allocations for 2001-02. The average increase in unified budgets is 6.5% which represents a cash increase of over &#163;270 million. This is on top of significant increases in funding during 2000-01. It is the responsibility of health boards to determine local priorities for the use of funds including meeting the targets and standards of the New Deal for Junior Doctors.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is aware of the Enforcement Protocol which has been launched in England and Wales, and is working with COSLA and Scottish Trading Standards towards the development of a Scottish Tobacco Enforcement Protocol for use by local authorities in carrying out their duty in relation to the Children and Young Person (Protection from Tobacco) Act 1991.</p>

  <p>The Lord Advocate is currently reviewing prosecution policy in relation to the use of children in test purchases of tobacco products. The outcome of this review will be taken into account in finalising the Scottish Protocol.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the announcement by the Deputy Minister for Sport and Culture in the Parliament on 9 November 2000, why there was no specific reference to support for voluntary sector sports clubs or local Sports Councils.</p>

  <p>The Executive fully recognise the vital role played by volunteers in clubs and local sports councils in the local delivery of sport in Scotland, and we, and <b>sport</b> scotland, are committed to seeing it developed further and I expect the positive outcome of the spending review for <b>sport</b> scotland announced on 9 November will be of benefit to all engaged in sport in Scotland. I understand, for example, that <b>sport</b> scotland will soon introduce a club development programme which will benefit local clubs. It is also promoting a volunteer development programme in conjunction with the Scottish Association of Local Sports Council (SALSC), the umbrella body of local sports councils, and local authorities. <b>sport</b> scotland supports SALSC through an annual grant currently at &#163;21,000. Funding for local sports councils is a matter for individual local authorities.</p>

  <p>A working group, comprising representatives of local authorities, relevant public agencies and voluntary bodies representing the interests of young people leaving local authority care, is considering carefully the best way to achieve a &quot;one stop&quot; service providing advice, guidance and financial assistance.</p>

  <p>We expect to receive its report early this year.</p>

  <p>The principal recruitment agency used by the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to fill temporary vacancies is Pertemps. The SPCB also uses Kelly Services and Office Personnel but to a much lesser extent.</p>
