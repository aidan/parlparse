  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-17718 by George Lyon on 22 July 2005, what the reasons were for methadone being a factor in methadone-related drug deaths and whether any prosecutions are being considered as a result.</p>

  <p>The National Investigation into Drug-Related Deaths in 2003 has shown that poly-drug misuse remains the main cause of death and that few deaths are caused by methadone alone. Further research is required to establish why individual drugs from a mixture of substances ingested contribute to death.</p>

  <p>According to information from Scottish police forces, only one prosecution is pending for the supply of methadone leading to a drugs death. Where criminal proceedings are taken in these circumstances, the charge libelled will be that of culpable homicide.</p>

  <p>The rules governing the importation to the EU of meat and meat products from third countries, including Brazil and Argentina, are laid down in Council Directive 1972/462/EEC (as amended).</p>

  <p>The Directive requires, amongst other things, that each consignment is accompanied by a Public Health Certificate which contains information about the origin of the meat or meat products, and a health attestation that they comply with the requirements laid down in the directive.

  <p><em>The same as you? </em> National Implementation Group has 25 members, seven of whom are people who use services or family carers. In addition, implementation is supported by a National Users and Carers Group which has 18 members, 12 of whom are people who use services or family carers. The membership of short-life working groups has varied over the life of each group depending on the issues being considered and the availability of members. However, on average the number of members for each group who were people who use services or family carers was as follows:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>Hospital Closure, 2 <br />
              Employment, 3<br />
              (Both groups completed their work in December 2003.)</p>
<p>Advocacy, 4<br />
              Children, 3<br />
              Day services, 2.</p>
</blockquote></p>

  <p>Members who represent voluntary organisations on the groups may also have personal experience of caring for a person with learning disabilities. All group members who have a learning disability are supported at meetings by support workers from the organisations they represent.</p>

  <p>In addition to actual representation on the groups, many people who use services, carers, and parents contribute to the work of the groups through a variety of means, such as workshops, conferences or questionnaires.</p>
