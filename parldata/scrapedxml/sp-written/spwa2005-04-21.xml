  <p>Since 1994, the Scottish Office and Scottish Executive have operated an Organic Aid Scheme (OAS) which is part of the Scottish Rural Development Plan, supporting the conversion of land to organic status. This scheme was introduced as a means of securing the environmental benefits of organic conversion. Our aim is to support the accelerated growth of organic farming where this can make the best contribution to environmental sustainability.</p>

  <p>The Rural Stewardship Scheme, which is also part of the Scottish Rural Development Plan, helps ensure that farming is a lead player in the protection and enhancement of our environment. The scheme, which is open to organic farmers, is designed to encourage farmers, crofters and common grazings committees to adopt environmentally friendly practices and to maintain and enhance particular habitats, features and areas of high ecological value.</p>

  <p>The Executive provides funding in the region of &pound;234,000 per annum for the Scottish Agricultural Colleges (SAC) Advisory Activities in support of the Organic Aid Scheme (OAS) and Organic Farming.</p>

  <p>Executive funding supports: telephone advice (including the SAC Organic Helpline); farm walks and technical meetings based on a network of six demonstration farms; technical publications, and the SAC organic farming website. For more detailed individually-tailored advice, SAC offers a charged consultancy service.</p>

  <p>This programme of activity is offered through a group of 20 organic advisers located at SAC&rsquo;s network of advisory offices, backed up by a Senior Organic Farming Specialist and a group of subject specialists.</p>

  <p>The Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) is designated as the inspection authority responsible for the inspection system under Regulation 2092/91. DEFRA is also authorised to act on behalf of Scottish ministers in respect of any functions exercisable by them as the authority responsible for the operation of the inspection system, the approval and supervision of inspection bodies.

  <p>In March 2000, the European Commission introduced a logo through Commission Regulation (EC) 331/2000 bearing the words &quot;Organic Farming &ndash; EC Control System&quot; to be used on a voluntary basis by producers whose systems and products have been found on inspection to satisfy EU Regulations. As this is on a voluntary basis, the Scottish Executive have not introduced measures to ensure the use of this logo.</p>

  <p>As you will be aware, the actions set up under Action 1 (information and promotion campaigns) and Action 19 (more extensive use of logo on imported products) of the European Organic Action Plan will facilitate more extensive use of the EU logo.</p>

  <p>Tentative data on breaches of antisocial behaviour orders granted in local authority areas is available for 2003-04. During this period, 213 orders were in force and 144 (67%) were allegedly breached during the year. However, the independent researchers who collated this data for the Scottish Executive have advised that confusion over the term &quot;breach&quot; during the research means that this finding must be treated with extreme caution. The lack of robust data means that it is not possible to provide a reliable breakdown on a local authority basis for 2003-04. A further survey will be undertaken this summer which should clarify the position for 2004-05.</p>

  <p>There is a national computerised call-recall system in place which ensures that eligible women, who are registered with a general practitioner and are in the age range 50 to 69 (64 where age extension has not been implemented) years are invited for breast screening every three years.</p>

  <p>To ensure that all eligible women are called and recalled at a three-year interval the SBSP has an invitation policy of calling/recalling by a GP. GPs hold current registration details for women in their practice and SBSP systematically calls women in the eligible age range, practice by practice. Therefore each practice in Scotland is called once every three years and depending when that occurs a woman will be invited for the first time when she is 50, 51 or 52 years old.</p>

  <p>At any point in time should a woman feel there is a change in their breast or have any concerns they should see their GP to decide whether a referral to the symptomatic service is required.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Heating bills may increase after installation of a new central heating system on the programme, but these increases must be viewed alongside the increase in heat and warmth in the property that a new central heating system affords. And, when a new central heating system is installed the property is eligible to receive all the available insulation measures from loft insulation, cavity fill, pipe and tank insulation, draughtproofing and low energy light bulbs.</p>

  <p>We would encourage recipients of assistance on the central heating programme, who are concerned about their fuel bills, to contact the Executive to discuss their concerns.

The oil boilers available on the Programme have a maximum SEDBUK rating of 85.7%, comparable with gas boilers that have a maximum SEDBUK rating of 82.1%.</p>

  <p>Where available, applicants have the option of either gas, electric oil or solid fuel central heating. Therefore, in areas where gas supplies are not available, an applicant may have the option of a new electric, oil or solid fuel central heating system.</p>

  <p>The answer in S2W-14302 outlines the range of agencies that can use physical restraint. As the answer states, the legal authority underpinning the use of restraint equipment depends on the circumstances. The steps taken to verify whether restraint is appropriate or should be requested to be removed prior to treatment is a matter of professional judgement based on risk.</p>

  <p>I can of course only answer this question from the perspective of Scots Law: other jurisdictions will define computer related crime according to their own domestic legal systems.</p>

  <p>However, the position in Scots Law is that it is likely that any publication of statements on the internet which was in contempt of court, would be prosecuted in Scotland as a contempt of court. There may additionally be offences related to the use of computers but a charge either at common law or under the Contempt of Court Act 1981 is the more likely outcome. Contempt of court is not one of the crimes listed in the European Arrest Warrant Framework Decision, and as a result, it would be necessary to establish dual criminality before extradition proceedings could be commenced.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-13580 by Cathy Jamieson on 28 January 2005, what percentage of recorded incidents of assault of a police officer resulted in convictions in each year from 1994 to 2004, broken down by police force area.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-04-21.40.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80053" speakername="Cathy Jamieson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa0421.htm#14">

  <p>The available information on convictions relates to offences under section 41(1)(a) of the Police (Scotland) Act 1967. This section of the 1967 act provides that any person who &quot;assaults, resists, obstructs molests or hinders a constable&hellip;&quot; shall be guilty of an offence. Offences which specifically involve an assault on a police officer can not generally be identified separately from other section 41(1)(a) offences in the data held centrally. Similarly, other assaults on police officers which may result in other charges such as serious assault or attempted murder can not be identified separately in the available statistics. It is not therefore possible to make like with like comparisons between the number of convictions and the number of recorded incidents from the data held centrally.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what level of legal aid is available to individuals and communities wishing to bring cases against polluters.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-04-21.41.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80046" speakername="Hugh Henry" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa0421.htm#15">

  <p>Under the Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 1986, legal aid can be made available only to individuals not to community groups or communities. Cases against polluters may involve either civil or criminal action.</p>

  <p>Individuals and communities cannot bring criminal prosecutions. Criminal prosecutions can only be brought by the Crown Office Procurator Fiscal Service as it has the sole responsibility for instituting criminal prosecutions in Scotland. Prosecutions may arise from reports by outside organisations with statutory responsibility for matters in relation to pollution. Criminal legal aid may be available for any person who is the subject of such a prosecution.</p>

  <p>Civil legal aid may be made available to an individual if the three statutory tests of financial eligibility, probable cause and reasonableness are met as is the case with any civil legal aid application.</p>

  <p>Further statutory considerations apply to civil legal aid applications if there are others that have a joint interest in the proceedings. The Scottish Legal Aid Board can grant civil legal aid only if the refusal of legal aid would cause severe prejudice to the individual applicant and it would not be reasonable to expect others that might have an interest in the action to defray the costs that otherwise fall to be paid under the grant of civil legal aid.</p>

  <p>The exact number of people diagnosed with depression in Scotland is not available centrally. However, national estimates of the numbers of people consulting for depression can be given based on the number of patients seen for the condition in general medical practices participating in PTI (Practice Team Information). PTI data are obtained from a sample of Scottish general practices whose population is broadly nationally representative of the Scottish population in terms of age, sex, deprivation category and rural/urban mix.</p>

  <p>The estimated number of patients seen in general practices in Scotland for depression, based on PTI data, is as follows.</p>

  <p>Estimated Number of Patients seen for Depression, by Age Group and Gender, Year Ending 31 March 2004</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what involvement it will have in the review of low-level radioactive waste management policy recently announced by the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and what the review involves.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-04-21.44.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80032" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa0421.htm#17">

  <p>The review of policy for the long-term management of the UK&rsquo;s low-level radioactive waste (LLW) has been agreed by the Scottish ministers and ministers of the UK government and the other devolved administrations.</p>

  <p><a name="50318w09.html_para8" id="50318w09.html_para8"></a>LLW is generated by a wide range of activities involving the use of radioactive substances. They include the operation of nuclear reactors, the operation of other nuclear processing facilities, the decommissioning and clean up of nuclear sites, non-nuclear industrial activities, the medical use of radioactive materials, and research and educational activities.</p>

  <p><a name="50318w09.html_para9" id="50318w09.html_para9"></a>While relatively low, the level of radioactivity in LLW can span a very wide range (about five orders of magnitude). Not least because of this, it has been managed in a number of ways in the past: using the national disposal facility at Drigg in Cumbria, using various forms of disposal on the nuclear site on which the waste was generated, using controlled burial to landfill and, for small quantities of very low-level waste, through disposal with other ordinary refuse.</p>

  <p><a name="50318w09.html_para10" id="50318w09.html_para10"></a>With many nuclear sites and facilities moving into their decommissioning phase, and with the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) being set up to deal with this, it has been increasingly recognised that there will be a very large volume of LLW to be dealt with.<a name="column_496" id="column_496"></a></p>

  <p>The proposed policy review will consider how best to use those forms of long term management that already exist and in particular:</p>

  <p>the best use of the Drigg facility;</p>

  <p>the merits of transporting LLW from its source of origin, and</p>

  <p>the relative advantages of on site disposal as opposed to controlled burial to landfill offsite.</p>

  <p><a name="50318w09.html_para11" id="50318w09.html_para11"></a><a name="50318w09.html_para12" id="50318w09.html_para12"></a>The aim is to identify a policy framework, which will update that set out in the 1995 White Paper <em>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy: Final Conclusions</em> (Cm2919) to cover the future management of LLW, notably by the NDA. It will set out the broad requirements and principles within which future management decisions will be made. <a name="50318w09.html_para13" id="50318w09.html_para13"></a>The initial stages are being overseen by a steering group drawn from the Government&rsquo;s Radioactive Waste Policy Group (RWPG). RWPG, on which the Executive is represented, is made up of UK Government, devolved administrations and regulatory body representatives and meets regularly, several times a year, to discuss radioactive waste management policy and regulatory issues.</p>

  <p>The steering group consists of representatives of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), the Department for Trade and Industry (DTI), the Ministry of Defence (MoD), the Scottish Executive, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), the Environment Agency (EA), the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and the NDA. It is jointly chaired by Defra and the NDA and meetings are also attended by representatives of British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL), the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA), British Energy (BEn) and GE Healthcare and UK Nirex to assist with the preparation of data on the types and volumes of waste to be dealt with, University College London (UCL) who have been appointed as the independent facilitators for two stakeholder workshops to be held during the course of 2005 and Atkins who are providing more general technical support to the work. The steering group&rsquo;s remit is to provide draft consultation material for RWPG to consider by October/November 2005 so that revised policy proposals can be issued around the turn of the year.</p>

  <p><a name="50318w09.html_para14" id="50318w09.html_para14"></a>The LLW review will be carried out in parallel with the work of the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management (CoRWM), which is assessing options for the long-term management of the UK&rsquo;s higher activity wastes. However, the LLW review is about how best to apply existing options for long-term management, unlike CoRWM&rsquo;s work which is seeking to identify options for long-term management of the higher activity wastes. RWPG will ensure that those managing the LLW review take account of the work of CoRWM.</p>

This guidance will support the Futurebuilders Scotland Programme, which aims to extend and strengthen the role of the social economy sector in delivering better public services.</p>

  <p>In addition, the guidance <em>Best Value: Making Choices</em> advises local authorities of a number of steps they can take to support local small and medium-sized enterprises without compromising fairness in the award of a contract. These include paying invoices from small and medium-size businesses quickly, advertising all contract opportunities in regular newsletters supplied to all local businesses and providing training sessions on &quot;how to bid for council contracts&quot;.</p>

  <p>Vision: a picture of what will be achieved over the transformation period and what success will look like;</p>
