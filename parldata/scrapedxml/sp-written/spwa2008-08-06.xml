  <p>NHS 24 is not required to specifically monitor call volumes in relation to changes to GP surgery hours. They do, however, constantly monitor volumes of calls both during and out with peak demand times.</p>

  <p>The purpose of extended hours is to increase the opportunity for patients to access routine scheduled appointments with GPs. We are not expecting people to attend their GP surgery who would otherwise have phoned NHS 24 because of an unscheduled care requirement.</p>

  <p>There are no plans to monitor the effect of extended hours on NHS 24 call volumes.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not collate information on the total spend in recruiting its staff. Information is collated on certain aspects of cost of recruitment where the spend is made through the centrally managed contracts which have been put in place by Scottish Government HR and procurement professionals to support recruitment activity. Spend is not split by geographical region. The following tables show relevant spend on civil service recruitment under two contracts for recruitment advertising and related services, and another for assessment centres and related services for the periods requested.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government staff handbook makes it clear that staff incurring car parking fines for parking illegally whilst on official business will not be reimbursed from official funds.</p>

  <p>However there are occasions when circumstances arise which are beyond the control of officials and which prevent officials returning to parked vehicles in time to avoid incurring parking fines. Such occasions are very rare but do sometimes arise. An example would be where there is a meeting between a Minister and the public, supported by an official, which overruns the scheduled time allocated.</p>

  <p>Since May 2007, five occasions have arisen where the Scottish Government has reimbursed officials for car parking fines incurred, at a total cost of &pound;171.50. A clear audit trail outlining the individual reasons for applying for reimbursement is held on file for audit inspection.</p>

  <p>Information about parking fines is contained in the following table.</p>
