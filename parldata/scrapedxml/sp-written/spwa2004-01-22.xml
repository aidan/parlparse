  <p>A great deal has been achieved since the Plan for Action on alcohol problems was published in 2002. Current action includes a national responsible drinking campaign targeting 18- to 25-year-olds and we will shortly be announcing additional resources for alcohol support and treatment services. We are about to begin a review of progress in delivering the Plan for Action and determine priorities for future action. We expect to complete this review by the end of April.</p>

  <p>The statistics suggest that offenders given community service orders generally have lower reconviction rates than those discharged from a custodial sentence, although this difference is less pronounced when the age and number of previous convictions of offenders are taken into account.</p>

  <p>The figures are in the Statistical Bulletin CrJ/2003/1 published in March 2003 which provides data on reconviction rates of offenders discharged from custody or given non-custodial sentenced in 1997. The statistical bulletin is available in the Parliament's Reference Centre (Bib. number 27185).</p>

  <p>In anticipation of the impact of the Debt Arrangement and Attachment (Scotland) Act 2002, the Scottish Executive has provided an additional &pound;3 million per annum to boost the number of money advisers in Scotland.

  <p>The Executive is keen to ensure access to NHS general dental services for all those who wish them and for this reason I announced on 20 November 2003 a wide-ranging review of dental services in Scotland.

  <p>Scotland's financial services sector has demonstrated solid growth over the past decade and continues to perform robustly. Against the background of challenges from increased global competition, however, there is no room for complacency. The Scottish Executive recognises this and has responded to calls for a greater engagement with the sector by establishing the Financial Services Strategy Group (FSSG). The FSSG, which I chair, is charged with developing and delivering a long-term strategy in order to sustain and maximise the success of the sector as a whole, including fund management activities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive currently collects information on the number of eviction actions taken against council tenants which proceeded to court, the number of cases which resulted in an eviction order and the number of cases which resulted in an eviction. This return only commenced in April 2001 and data are available for Glasgow City Council up to December 2002. Data on applications which did not result in a court case are not collected centrally.</p>

  <p>The data on evictions for each local authority are published quarterly in the Scottish Executive Statistical Bulletin (Housing Series)<em> Housing Trends in Scotland</em>. This is available online in the published data section of the Housing Statistics Branch reference site (<a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/stats/housing/hsbref" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/stats/housing/hsbref</a>), or from the SPICe library.</p>

  <p>For the financial year 2001-02, there were 2,779 actions taken which proceeded to court. For the last period during which Glasgow City Council submitted a return, which was April-December 2002, there were 1,787 eviction actions which proceeded to court.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what funds are available for tenant and resident associations in areas of deprivation and low household incomes where such voluntary organisations seek to renovate local neighbourhoods and make them more secure.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Acting Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her reply is as follows:</p>

  <p>Direct funding for tenant and resident associations is the responsibility of individual landlords and should be identified within their tenant participation strategy. The Executive supports activities to empower tenants to develop their homes and communities, which includes the provision of a tenant participation team, based within Communities Scotland. Also, from April 2004 the Scottish Executive will introduce a national tenants grants scheme providing &pound;400,000 over two years for registered tenant organisations to develop innovative and replicable approaches in tenant participation.</p>

  <p>The Social Inclusion Partnership Programme also provides &pound;60 million in 2003-04 to tackle social exclusion and promote regeneration in disadvantaged communities across Scotland. Decisions on how the social inclusion partnership fund is allocated are taken locally and in Inverclyde, as in other areas, voluntary organisations may be able to access these funds. In addition, the Better Neighbourhoods Services Fund is providing &pound;40 million in 2003-04 and &pound;31.2 million in 2004-05 to improve services to disadvantaged communities in 12 Pathfinder areas across Scotland, including Inverclyde. Decisions on how funds are allocated are taken locally in line with the local outcome agreement approved by the Executive.</p>

  <p>If tenants and residents associations are working in partnership with a housing association to help them develop a wider role in regeneration they may also be able to access resources from Communities Scotland.</p>

  <p>The report in question is a working paper commissioned some time ago from Information and Statistics Division by the Health Department. The department is reviewing the information presented in the paper. A number of actions to address the issues highlighted are already under way, both at departmental and NHS board/local authority level. Examples include use of joint NHS/social care rapid reaction teams to help organise care and treatment of elderly patients at home; and work being undertaken by the Centre for Change and Innovation on patterns of emergency NHS care. The overall aim is to ensure that patients are treated in the most suitable environment and experience the highest possible quality of care.</p>

  <p>The Executive keeps National Planning Policy Guidelines (NPPGs) under review and revises them as appropriate. The response to the Review of Strategic Planning (published in June 2002), indicated our intention to rename National Planning Policy Guidelines as Scottish Planning Policies and to make them more concise and the policy content more explicit. The response also included an indicative programme for the review and updating of NPPGs and publication as Scottish Planning Policies (SPPs). This indicative programme is reproduced below. Publication dates indicate when each NPPG or SPP was last reviewed. Information is also given on current progress on the review and updating of particular NPPGs.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive continues to have full confidence in the quality of Scottish farmed salmon products. This confidence is underpinned by advice from the Food Standards Agency (FSA), a body independent from government.</p>

  <p>The FSA has published its advice through a number of media notices. This advice is that Scottish farmed salmon meets the relevant food safety and health standards used in the UK, EU, World Health Organisation and indeed the US for the substances covered in the US scientific report.</p>

  <p>Further, the FSA actively promotes advice to consumers that it is beneficial for them to consume at least two portions of fish per week, one of which should be oily (such as salmon).</p>

Primary responsibility for ensuring that incinerators comply with the Waste Incineration (Scotland) Regulations 2003 lies with operators and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA).
