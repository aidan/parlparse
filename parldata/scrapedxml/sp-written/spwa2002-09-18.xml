  <p>Local authorities are responsible for making and administering concessionary travel schemes under the Transport Act 1985 and it is for them to negotiate the level of reimbursement provided to operators of local bus services.

  <p>I have asked John Ewing, the Chief Executive of the Scottish Court Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Court Service is currently assessing the scale and extent of the work required to bring the court up to the level of compliance required by the Disability Discrimination Act. In most courts there is already disabled access to the sheriff clerk&#146;s offices but in other cases work may be needed to extend the access to a wider range of courts, jury rooms and witness accommodation. The full extent of work needed and costings have yet to be determined. The following table lists the courts where work is likely to be required.</p>

  <p>Tain Sheriff Court has no facility to allow easy access for disabled persons. However Lochmaddy, Dingwall and Portree all have disabled access into the building and disabled toilet provisions. In addition Portree has a stair lift to gain access to the courtroom on the first floor.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Court Service is currently undertaking an audit of the court estate to determine the scale and extent of work required throughout the Estate to ensure compliance with the Disability Discrimination Act. Additional resources have been provided to the Court Service to enable any reasonable and necessary adaptations to proceed. The information is not collected centrally in respect of District Courts as responsibility for this rests with the relevant local authority.</p>

  <p>In determining the level of business conducted in any sheriff court consideration is given to the wide range of criminal and civil business which may be conducted in the court. This covers procedural hearings as well as those required for determining the case. Regard is also had to the level of administrative work carried out by the court in respect of matters which may not require an appearance before the sheriff in court.</p>

  <p>I have asked John Ewing, Chief Executive of the Scottish Court Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>A number of rural courts have custody suites within the court building. Eleven rural sheriff courts do not have custody holding facilities within the court building. Nine of these (Duns, Fort William, Jedburgh, Kirkwall, Lerwick, Oban, Portree, Stonehaven and Wick) are adjacent to the local police station from which prisoners in custody can be taken into the court without using the public courthouse. In the case of Peebles and Rothesay prisoners are held in the police station which is located a short distance from the court.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Court Service is currently reviewing the custody accommodation across the court estate in consultation with the police to determine what, if any, improvements to that accommodation is required. No decisions have yet been taken on whether it will be necessary to provide such accommodation in locations other than Peebles.</p>

  <p>The ministerial targets set for the Scottish Court Service include targets relating to quality of service. Quality of service in the sheriff courts is measured by the percentage of sheriff courts achieving administrative standards agreed with the Sheriff Principal and by the percentage of court houses meeting the Coming to Court standards. The results are reported in the <i>Scottish Court Service Annual Report and Accounts</i> .</p>

  <p>The consultation paper on the delivery of court services in the Peebles area is currently being finalised and should be issued by the end of September. It will be circulated to a wide range of bodies and individuals who have expressed an interest in this topic, including the judiciary, local magistrates, court users such as local solicitors as well as statutory authorities such as Borders Council, Lothian and Borders Police and the Procurator Fiscal Service. Copies of the consultation paper will also be sent to local members of the Scottish and UK Parliament. In addition copies will be made available at the Sheriff Clerk&#146;s office in Peebles and Selkirk for the public.</p>

  <p>The duration of the consultation period will be a minimum of 12 weeks from date of issue. The paper will contain statistical information on the wide range of business transacted at the court in addition to information on court sitting times.</p>

  <p>The Executive was notified of the council&#146;s intention to adopt the plan on 24 July 2002. A Direction was issued on 14 August deferring adoption of the plan to allow more time for the Executive to consider the plans contents. Following such consideration, it was decided, on 12 September, to cancel the direction. It is now for the council to decide how to proceed and the approval of the Scottish ministers is not required. This is in line with the Executive&#146;s general policy that local planning matters are primarily the responsibility of planning authorities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive provides support to the UK-wide Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP). WRAP has established a Business Development Service which aims to assist businesses which sell, buy, process or collect recycled glass, paper, wood or plastic to attract finance and investment. This service is free and the advice is tailored to the individual business. WRAP also periodically offers funding for capital investment and research and development purposes. To date &#163;369,500 has been awarded to three companies in Scotland. Further information is available on their website (www.wrap.org.uk).</p>

  <p>In addition, where recycling companies have projects that meet the eligibility criteria, they can apply for Regional Selective Assistance (RSA).</p>

  <p>This is a matter for local authorities. The information requested is not held centrally. However, the organisation RECOUP carried out a study into plastics recycling which showed that 12 of the 32 local authorities in Scotland had a plastics collection in 2001.</p>

  <p>The Executive distributed &#163;3 million in March 2001 to allow local authorities to establish or expand recycling schemes including the collection of plastics. This funding has allowed a number of local authorities to provide separate kerbside collections, which include plastics as well as plastic bottle banks at recycling centres and plastic balers.</p>

  <p>Consultation was a continuing thread throughout the Central Scotland Transport Corridor Studies, for each of the A80, A8 and M74 corridors, and involved a steering group, a consultative forum and focus groups. In addition, the Scottish Executive has taken advice from an External Advisory Panel of four eminent academics, established to provide an independent and impartial overview of the direction and content of the studies.

  <p>The Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) and the General Register Office for Scotland (GROS) were not formally consulted over the proposed ethnic background and national identity categories, but the Scottish Executive did take into consideration the classifications used in the 2001 Census of Population, conducted by the GROS. The recommendations of the CRE in their consultation document<i> Ethnic Monitoring &#150; a guide for public authorities</i> were also taken into account in compiling the categories.</p>

  <p>Comments on the categories were also sought from the Centre for Education for Racial Equality in Scotland (CERES). However, not all of CERES&#146; suggestions could be taken on board given the need to ensure that the categories used in the September 2002 School Census matched closely with those in the 2001 Census of Population to ensure comparability and consistency across different data sources.</p>

  <p>The national identity and ethnic background categories used in the school census are subject to review to ensure that they remain relevant and well understood. This will ensure that on-going work at a national level on equality and inclusion issues is reflected in future censuses.</p>

  <p>The Executive wishes to ensure that children are freely able to raise genuine matters of concern. Education authorities have a duty of care to their pupils and should always take appropriate action in relation to this duty. At the same time authorities should take steps to protect individual teachers against malicious complaints. Allegations of physical violence by teachers, in the first instance, are matters for education authorities and the police in the first instance. All such cases should be thoroughly investigated in relation to the subsequent disciplinary issues. The Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers is currently considering revised disciplinary procedures which will ensure that appropriate investigations are carried out in ways which protect the legitimate interests of both teachers and children.</p>

  <p>The Executive funded a pilot smartcard project in Aberdeen through the first round of the Modernising Government Fund. Aberdeen City Council has used this support to develop a citizen's smartcard with concessionary fares for elderly people being a core application. Every bus in Aberdeen will be fitted with smartcard readers and the smartcards themselves will be rolled out to all concessionary card holders over the next few months.</p>

  <p>The Executive, through the second round of the Modernising Government Fund, has encouraged a consortium of local authorities to work together to further develop the Aberdeen model. We took this approach in order to develop a Scottish-wide solution and a standard approach to smartcard technology. This will deliver economies of scale and provide a platform to further develop smartcard technology to support multiple applications, including further transport developments.</p>

  <p>More generally, the Transport (Scotland) Act 2001 provides local authorities with powers to develop integrated joint ticketing schemes between bus operators.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive why Scottish Water applies surface water collection charges to businesses that do not discharge any surface water into Scottish Water sewers in the north and the west of Scotland but does not apply such charges to such businesses in the east of Scotland.</p>

  <p>This is a matter for Scottish Water. The Chief Executive's response is:</p>

  <p>Each of the three authorities had their own charges scheme and charged differently for water services. In the former west and north areas the surface water drainage charge covered drainage from both roads and private property, whereas in the east the surface water drainage charge only covered property drainage. Road drainage costs were included as part of the volumetric sewage charge.</p>

  <p>In the former east area, if a customer&#146;s property does not drain to the public sewer then the surface water drainage charge is cancelled but the customer still pays road drainage charges as part of the volumetric sewage charge. In the former north and west areas, the surface water drainage charge is reduced for properties not draining to the sewer and only the cost of road drainage is charged.</p>

  <p>Scottish Water is continuously reviewing its charges and will be evaluating how customers are charged for surface water drainage as it develops a harmonised charging structure across Scotland.</p>

  <p>This is a matter for Scottish Water. The Chief Executive's response is:</p>

  <p>None. Scottish Water was not established until 1 April 2002. Charges schemes for 2002-03 had been developed by the three former water authorities in anticipation of the creation of Scottish Water. These schemes were developed in consultation with the Water Industry Commissioner on the basis of the revenues cap agreed in the light of the Quality and Standards process which was subject to full public consultation by Scottish ministers.</p>
