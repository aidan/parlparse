  <p>Ambulances also get moved from one division to another to ensure that they are utilised effectively and to even out the mileage over the fleet.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Law Commission expects to publish its first discussion paper on the theoretical basis of registration of title in Scotland in January 2004.

  <p>We await its proposals, which it is anticipated will substantially replace the 1979 act, although the extent of this is of course a matter for the commission to consider.

  <p>There has been no research conducted by the Scottish Executive into the re-use of single-use equipment in the NHS. The guidance from the Medicines &amp; Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA, previously the Medical Devices Agency, MDA) in their Device Bulletin DB(2000)04, <em>Single-use medical devices: implications and consequences of re-use</em> , is clear that devices designated by the manufacturer as single use must not be re-used. Subsequent Scottish Executive guidance, issued to the service in February 2001, states that a senior manager within each NHS trust should be designated as having overall responsibility for ensuring that the MHRA guidance is followed.</p>

  <p>It is for individual NHS boards to determine annually the level of funding required for new and replacement medical equipment taking into account other local priorities. NHS boards can use both capital and revenue resources to meet equipment costs.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Executive has centrally funded programmes in excess of &#163;40 million since 2000 for investment in medical equipment. Other initiatives such as the Capital Modernisation Fund have provided resources for investment in medical equipment - particularly linear accelerators.</p>

  <p>It is for management in NHS boards and trusts to ensure equipment is adequately maintained in the NHS and also to make sure that there is clarity about delegated responsibilities for maintenance.</p>

  <p>Audit Scotland published a report, <em>Equipped to Care</em> in March 2001. This provided NHS boards with recommendations on strategic management, funding and acquisition and maintenance of medical equipment. The Executive surveyed individual NHS acute trusts and island health boards in 2002. The survey found that acute trusts and island health boards had either implemented or were actively working towards implementing the Audit Scotland recommendations. Audit Scotland are currently undertaking a follow-up audit which is due to report towards the end of 2003. The Executive will consider the findings and recommendations in due course.</p>

  <p>The Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 requires that employees must be properly trained in the use of any equipment they are required to use.</p>

  <p>Audit Scotland published a report, <em>Equipped to Care</em> in March 2001. This provided NHS boards with recommendations covering the strategic management, funding and acquisition and maintenance of medical equipment. A specific recommendation was made regarding the introduction of formal training policies on the use of medical equipment where these were not already in place. The Executive surveyed individual NHS acute trusts and island health boards in 2002. The survey found that acute trusts and island health boards had either implemented or were working towards implementing the Audit Scotland recommendation. Audit Scotland are currently undertaking a follow-up audit which is due to report towards the end of 2003. The Executive will consider the findings and recommendations in due course.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has established a PE review group to review the wider perspective of PE in the school curriculum and to consider how schools can be supported to provide a quality PE educational experience. Its report is due by the end of the year. In addition, work is currently under way on developing an Active Schools Implementation Plan in response to the Physical Activity Task Force&#8217;s recommendations for pre-school and school-aged children. &#163;24 million has also been made available over the three years to 2005-06 to adapt and develop the existing School Sports Co-ordinator and Active Primary Schools Programmes as part of the Active Schools Programme. Learning and Teaching Scotland have been commissioned by the Scottish Executive to further investigate local authority provision for swimming and to identify barriers to swimming provision and suggest solutions through good practice case studies.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many vaccines currently administered contain mercury preservatives and, of these, which vaccines are given to children.</p>

  <p>The only vaccines used in the UK routine childhood immunisation programme that contain a mercury compound are the diphtheria, tetanus and wholecell pertussis (DTwP) and diphtheria and tetanus vaccines. The mercury is present as ethylmercury in the excipient thiomersal. There is no thiomersal in the following vaccines currently in use in the UK: MMR, Hib, oral polio, meningitis C, BCG, pneumococcal vaccines or the acellular pertussis DTP vaccine (DTaP) used as a booster in the childhood immunisation programme. Thiomersal is also present in some influenza and hepatitis B vaccines.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what powers exist to control the collection of lugworms for fishing bait from beaches and whether it will use any such powers to regulate the commercial collection of live bait from beaches in East Lothian.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2003-10-27.26.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80128" speakername="Allan Wilson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-03/wa1027.htm#21">

  <p>The powers available to control this type of activity would depend on the rationale for wishing to control it. The Scottish Executive has no current plans to regulate the commercial collection of live bait from beaches in East Lothian.</p>

  <p>Where the area of activity is a national/local nature reserve or a marine nature reserve, byelaws can be made under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 and the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 respectively. Other relevant byelaw-making powers are contained in the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982.</p>

  <p>Where there is concern about damage or destruction in a Site of Special Scientific Interest, a Nature Conservation Order could be made under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Where the area is a &quot;European site&quot; as defined under the Conservation (Natural Habitats, and Conservation) Regulations 1994, a Special Nature Conservation Order may be made.</p>

  <p>The power to make byelaws covering &quot;European sites&quot; is also contained in the 1994 regulations. Such byelaws would also have the ability to extend to areas surrounding or adjoining the site.</p>
