  <p>The latest statistics for Scotland as a whole show that over the financial year 2001-02, 36% <strong> </strong> of households had access to the internet from home. This compares with 41% of households in England, 31% of households in Wales, 31% of households in Northern Ireland and 40% of households across the UK.</p>

  <p>The same survey (ONS Expenditure and Food Survey) estimated that 24% of households in Scotland had access to the internet in financial year 2000-01.</p>

  <p>In order to make comparisons between different countries it is necessary that the surveys used to collect the information use harmonised questions. There are to date no European wide surveys that collect information in a comparable form to the ONS survey.</p>

  <p>There are no statistics available for the percentage of the population with access to an e-mail address, at home at work, in Scotland or in other countries. Theoretically, anyone can have access to an e-mail address if they have access to the internet via a variety of technologies ranging from PCs, digital TV, WAP mobile phones, video game consoles or handheld computers.</p>

  <p>Some surveys do measure use of e-mail (rather than access) and in Scotland, for those people that have home access to the internet, more than 75% use e-mail (Scottish Household Survey (SHS) 2001).</p>

  <p>In order to make comparisons between different countries, it is necessary that the surveys used to collect the information use harmonised questions. There are to date no European wide surveys that collect information in a comparable form to the SHS survey.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is also working with local authorities to ensure that all secondary school children have individual access to e-mail and that primary school children have access to either an individual or class e-mail address.</p>

  <p>Direct Payments Scotland (DPS) aims to increase awareness of direct payments amongst community care service users and their carers, local authorities, service providers and support organisations. DPS will help establish and develop both local user-led support organisations and a national good practice exchange. DPS is working closely with local and national support organisations and local authority staff to identify and address training needs.</p>

  <p>DPS is highlighting direct payments through a national information service, including website, regular newsletters, seminars, training events and visits to local support organisations and local authorities. DPS is also working with national organisations, such as Age Concern Scotland, to help increase awareness of direct payments.</p>

  <p>The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 received Royal Assent on 24 July. The act enhances the powers to confiscate assets following conviction, strengthens police powers of investigation, introduces new powers of civil recovery and cash seizure, and allows for the taxation of suspected criminal assets.</p>

  <p>It is intended to implement the new cash seizure powers in December 2002, and the bulk of the rest of the act in February 2003. To this end, a major implementation programme is well under way, involving relevant officials and agencies across the UK. Scottish Executive and Crown Office officials are represented on the Home Office Implementation Group, and a separate Scottish implementation group has also been set up.</p>

  <p>In particular, the existing Crown Office Criminal Confiscation Unit will be strengthened and a new Civil Recovery Unit set up. There will also be a major training exercise involving Procurators Fiscal, Police and Customs and Excise officers.</p>

  <p>The Executive is very concerned about attacks on emergency service personnel and I am sure that this Parliament joins me in condemning this totally unacceptable behaviour. We want those involved to be detected and apprehended by the police and dealt with firmly by the courts. The Executive is arranging a seminar this autumn which will bring together a wide range of professionals to identify how we might impact on those &quot;hard to reach&quot; groups who indulge in this kind of behaviour.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to ending fuel poverty by 2016 and has set an interim target that the number of households in fuel poverty will fall by 30% between 2002 and 2006. This target was set following discussions with the Fuel Poverty Advisory Group which includes as members the energy companies, COSLA, Friends of the Earth, Energy Action Scotland, Help the Aged, Age Concern, the Energy Saving Trust, Ofgem, energywatch and the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations. The target is subject to review in 2003 when information from the 2002 Scottish House Condition Survey becomes available.</p>

  <p>All GPs are eligible for an annual payment (currently &#163;2,510) for providing out-of-hours services and for a night visit fee (currently &#163;25.10) for each face to face consultation carried out between the hours of 10pm and 8am. These fees and allowances are prescribed in the Statement of Fees and Allowances payable to GPs and are paid from the NHS Board&#146;s General Medical Services demand-led budget.</p>

  <p>In addition, NHS Island Boards and Primary Care Trusts assist in the provision of out-of-hours services in their area by providing funding from the Out of Hours Development Fund. The fund forms part of the overall cash limited budget given to boards each year. The following table provides a breakdown of each area&#146;s expenditure on out-of-hours services from the development fund over the last three years.

  <p>Yes. The Scottish Executive, on behalf of the other devolved administrations, has responded to the Agriculture and Environment Biotechnology Commission (AEBC) proposals for a public debate in advance of decisions on the possible commercialisation of GM crops. The response, which will be published on the AEBC website, makes clear that the public debate must encompass all areas of the UK and enable distinct regional views and values to be heard.</p>

  <p>Ministers have accepted the AEBC recommendation for the appointment of a steering board independent of government to oversee the debate. Appointments to the board are not the responsibility of government but will aim to reflect the need to maintain diversity and to have a balance of views and opinions from all sides of the GM debate and from around all regions of the UK. The membership of the steering board and the format for the debate will be announced, by the AEBC Chairman, in due course.</p>

  <p>The Executive has been supporting developing work by Partnerships UK for some time with Argyll and Bute Council. Good progress has been made with the council in developing a variant model, founded on the standard public private partnership (PPP) model, but dealing with the issues of internal distribution of surpluses (i.e. non-profit distributing) and stakeholder involvement. The 25 June announcement of over &#163;1 billion in schools infrastructure by Cathy Jamieson supported this project with revenue support for an investment value of &#163;80 million.</p>

  <p>However, the test of whether this model will work lies in a live procurement situation, and the funding announcement now allows Argyll and Bute, supported financially by the Executive and with the continued expertise of Partnerships UK, to enter the procurement stages. It will take about a year for that process to reach the stage where we can properly assess whether this variant model has been successful as a new delivery vehicle.</p>

  <p>The Executive evaluated the SNP&#146;s Scottish Investment Trust proposal last year. Whilst it had in principle the advantage of aggregating borrowing to lever in more competitive lending rates, the proposal was flawed in claiming that a private sector trust would be able to access borrowing rates at the same low rates as Government itself. If to achieve this the Government had to act as guarantor to the trust, then loans to the trust would count as public expenditure and assets created would score as on the public sector balance sheet. If that were the result, then some key advantages of PPP would be negated. Also, there were unanswered questions about issues such as control over appointments as trustees, and accountability over such a powerful funding body influencing public infrastructure investment.</p>

  <p>Other trust models claiming to be based on not-for-profit objectives have been publicised. However, to date none has been submitted for consideration of revenue support from the Executive. Unless new issues emerge, and until it is ready for wider application in due course, the Executive will continue to focus its interest in new developments efficiently and with strong technical support in the Argyll and Bute model.</p>

  <p>Deployment of staff is a matter for local authorities and information on the use of temporary contracts is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>It is clear from our general discussions with local authorities that a large number of temporary contracts have always come to an end, for a variety of reasons, at the end of the school session. It is also clear that many of these teachers secure work early in the new session as vacancies arise and supply cover needs emerge. We have no reason to expect any change to this pattern and will be monitoring the impact of the Teacher Induction Scheme on existing probationers closely.</p>

  <p>Funding has already been agreed to assist in the implementation of the Teacher Induction Scheme and there are no plans to make any additional distribution to local authorities.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers may direct Scottish Water in the exercise of its functions using powers contained in section 56(3) of the Water Industry (Scotland) Act. I am aware of problems with odour at the new treatment works at Kirkcaldy. This is an operational matter for Scottish Water. I understand work is in hand to identify and resolve the problem, including the installation of improved deodorising units by early October 2002.</p>

  <p>Scottish Water first became aware of increased levels of cryptosporidium in the Glasgow water supply on Friday 2 August. This information was immediately passed on to Greater Glasgow NHS Board. However, it was not until levels increased further on Saturday 3 August that the health board decided that there was a significant risk to the health of the general public.</p>

  <p>The principal source of the contamination was Mugdock reservoir. Scottish Water altered the distribution system to avoid using water from Mugdock reservoir until the levels of cryptosporidium in the reservoir fell to an acceptable level.</p>

  <p>In the longer term, Scottish Water has given Scottish ministers an undertaking to reduce the risk of cryptosporidium entering the Glasgow water supply by constructing a new water treatment works by the end of 2005.</p>

  <p>No guarantee can be given that there will not be a recurrence of the recent contamination of the Glasgow water supply. The risk of contamination is the same as it has been for over 100 years and it will not be reduced until the existing treatment works at Milngavie has been replaced. Scottish Water has given Scottish ministers a commitment to build a new works by the end of 2005.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, the cryptosporidium direction requires that Scottish Water continuously monitors for cryptosporidium at Milngavie and immediately alerts the health authorities to any detection of the parasite in the water.</p>
