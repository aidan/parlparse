  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what total amount of assets and proceeds of crime was (a) recovered from serious organised crime and (b) allocated to the CashBack for Communities scheme in (i) 2007-08, (ii) 2008-09 and (iii) 2009-10.</p>

  <p>The money secured by the Crown Office is the amount the courts have authorised to be recovered, but there can be a delay before that money is secured and paid into the Scottish Consolidated Fund. This can result in a difference between the COPFS figures announced each year and the amount available to be spent in the following year on Cashback. The annual allocation to the Cashback programme is based on what is transferred to the Scottish Consolidated Fund.</p>

  <p>In addition, in 2008-09 and 2009-10, around &pound;500,000 has also been set aside for the Crown Office and the police service to provide specialist staff and financial investigators to boost their capacity in recovering even more assets and criminal profits.</p>

  <p>The total amount of money secured by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (including both the National Casework Division and Civil Recovery Unit) through the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 is &pound;5.5 million (2007-08), &pound;6.3 million (2008-09) and &pound;5.5 million (2009-10). The amounts allocated to the Cashback for Communities scheme were &pound;4.4 million (2007-08), &pound;5.4 million (2008-09) and &pound;5.0 million (2009-10).</p>

  <p>No distinction is made for the level of criminality that has led to the recovery of money and assets so it is not possible to advise the proportion of money that comes from serious organised crime.</p>

  <p>Local authorities are required by the Standards in Scotland&rsquo;s Schools etc Act 2000 to make special arrangements for pupils who are unable to attend school due to prolonged ill health to receive education elsewhere than at an educational establishment. This duty applies in relation to all children and young people who are unable to attend school due to prolonged ill health irrespective of illness, age and where they live.</p>

  <p>NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has a number of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with other NHS boards across Scotland. The SLAs are based on a three-year, rolling average activity level and cover all specialties within the board rather than separate agreements with Royal Hospital for Sick Children. The three-year rolling averages are reviewed with health boards on an annual basis and any activity or financial adjustments are made to the SLA at that stage As part of the year-end accounting process for 2009-10, all NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde balances were formally agreed with other NHS boards.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive when the NHSScotland Resource Allocation Committee (NRAC) formula for funding NHS boards will be fully implemented for each board.</p>

  <p>In order to ensure there was a smooth transition to new funding arrangements for NHS Scotland the Scottish Government committed to phasing in the target shares calculated by the NRAC Formula by way of &quot;differential growth&quot;. Under this methodology, all boards continue to enjoy real-terms growth in their allocations year-on-year, with those below their target share receiving more growth than those above until the new distribution is achieved over time. In this way no board receives a cut in funding.</p>

  <p>This approach to phasing in funding has been the practice under both the previous SHARE and Arbuthnott formulae. Despite the constraints of the current economic and financial climate, an additional &pound;13 million has been provided to NHS boards below target in financial year 2010-11.</p>

  <p>As the target shares of NHS boards change on an annual basis to reflect changes in the relative need of their populations, it is not possible to provide a date when all NHS boards will reach their target share. However, we will ensure that this happens are quickly as resources allow.</p>

  <p>As at 1 April 2010, the locum rates for doctors in training and specialty doctors are set out in Section 8 of NHS Circular PCS (DD) 2010/4. Rates for locum consultants are set slightly differently. If a locum has never held a substantive NHS consultant post they are paid at the first point of the consultant contract salary scale as set out in Appendix 3 of NHS Circular PCS (DD) 2010/5. However, if they have gained consultant level experience outside the NHS, this is normally taken into account when agreeing their starting salary. Electronic versions of the circulars are available at <a href="http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk" target="_blank">www.show.scot.nhs.uk</a> .</p>

  <p>In March 2010 we reminded NHS boards of the need to comply with the existing code of practice for the management of temporary medical staff. We accept Audit Scotland&rsquo;s subsequent recommendation that the code of practice should be updated. We are currently consulting with NHSScotland chief executives on a package of measures designed to reduce demand for temporary medical staff and, where their use is unavoidable, ensure they are both high quality and affordable. These proposals, developed by a group which includes key stakeholders including NHS representatives, and the British Medical Association, will address issues around performance management of locums. Final guidance for boards on the implementation of the proposals expected to be published later this year.</p>

  <p>Most of the changes to the planning system came into force on 3 August 2009 and, for the most part, apply only to planning applications or appeals made on or after that date.</p>

  <p>Planning application procedures only apply to proposed wind farms up to 50 megawatts, while proposed developments exceeding 50 megawatts are determined under Section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 by the Scottish Ministers. Accordingly, the Scottish Government Energy Consents Unit have revised the pre-application scoping process for developers. This fresh approach re-emphasises the need to focus on early engagement and on efforts to assist the developer in identifying the key environmental issues of their proposal by drawing on the knowledge and experience of local authorities, Scottish Environment Protection Agency and Scottish Natural Heritage and other bodies such as the Forestry Commission at pre-application stage thereby reducing the need for later alterations that could lead to delay. The introduction of focussed and specific gate-checking meetings has been warmly received by planning authorities and other consultees. Gate-checking is carried out following receipt of an applicant&rsquo;s Environmental Statement and allows the parties involved to test understanding and clarify issues directly with the developer. It has proven to be particularly useful when dealing with complex, large scale applications.</p>

  <p>With reference to <em>The Press and Journal</em> article of 10 June 2010 regarding Calliachar, the earlier decision related to an application made under the Electricity Act, with the current application being subject to a planning decision by the Scottish Ministers under the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997. A decision on the case will be made as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>Scottish Planning Policy (SPP) was launched on 4 February 2010 and includes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s planning policies on the siting of wind farms. The SPP is part of the recent reforms to the planning system and states that planning authorities should prepare spatial frameworks for wind farms in their development plans. Development plans will be reviewed on a five-yearly cycle providing more confidence to investors, communities and to planning authorities in the decision making process. The SPP is available on the Scottish Government&rsquo;s website:</p>
