  <p>A list of the prosecutions which have been brought under section 19 of the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004 is as follows.</p>

  <p>1. Upper Solway Flats and Marshes SSSI, SPA, Ramsar and Solway Firth Special Area of Conservation, Dumfries Sheriff Court (2007). A land owner was charged and prosecuted for dumping and spreading hardcore for the purposes of forming a vehicle track without the required consent from Scottish Natural Heritage. The Court invited the guilty party to voluntarily restore the damaged feature before returning for sentencing. The habitat was restored and the Court issued an admonishment.</p>

  <p>2. Shingle Islands SSSI and Special Area of Conservation (SAC), Perth Sheriff Court (2007 &ndash; 09). The charge related to the carrying out of works to extend a flood embankment through the Shingle Islands SSSI without consent from Scottish Natural Heritage. On the basis that the prosecution failed to bring forward evidence that the accused required to be granted consent by Scottish Natural Heritage, the Court found that there was no case to answer.</p>

  <p>3. Slamannan Plateau SSSI &amp; Special Protection Area (SPA), Falkirk Sheriff Court (2007 - 09). This site hosts over 50% of the GB population of wintering Taiga bean geese. The charge related to the erection of a large farm building within the SSSI without consent from Scottish Natural Heritage. Following the case being heard in court (intermediate diet) the Procurator Fiscal convened a meeting with Scottish Natural Heritage to explore aspects of the case and any satisfactory alternatives to prosecution. After a potential alternative was identified and proven to be successful, the procurator fiscal closed the case.</p>

  <p>4. Arran Northern Mountains SSSI and Arran Moors SSSI; Arran Moors SPA, Kilmarnock Sheriff Court (2008). Charges were brought for intentional or reckless damage to the SSSI after a fire was started. The Court reached a guilty verdict, sentencing the guilty parties to community service.</p>
