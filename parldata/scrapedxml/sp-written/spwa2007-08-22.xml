  <p>The Scottish Government established the British Sign Language (BSL) and Linguistic Access Working Group in 2000 and it has been working within a strategic plan since then to deliver improved access for deaf people. There is chronic under capacity to deliver many of the required improvements and the group have identified the long term targets necessary to achieve them. These targets include systematically increasing the pool of BSL teachers available, particularly at advanced levels of BSL and developing a coherent progression route for BSL learners.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has funded in the past and continues to fund a number of initiatives to increase the numbers of people learning BSL. A major project has been supported since 2004 to build the numbers of teachers of BSL who can then train others to teach. The Scottish Association of Sign Language Interpreters leads on this and the first ever Graduate Certificate in the Training of the Trainers of BSL Tutors is being delivered by Heriot-Watt University with the first graduates due to complete this year. Consideration is currently being given to how the impact of this pioneering course can be best harnessed<strong>. </strong>We understand that the Scottish Qualifications Authority will have in place a Professional Development Award in tutoring British Sign Language by early next year.</p>

  <p>Funding has been provided for two voluntary organisations to enable them to have their BSL qualifications credit rated onto the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework (SCQF) so that BSL learners become part of the national framework. This was achieved by one organisation in June 2007 and the other continues to work towards it.</p>

  <p>A number of smaller initiatives have been supported, such as offering BSL tuition in schools, and the Scottish Government will continue to work closely with the BSL and the Linguistic Working Group and with other partners to increase the learning of BSL at all educational levels. Responsibility for increasing the numbers of BSL learners resides with a number of partner agencies outside of the government, such as the Scottish Qualifications Authority and the Scottish Funding Council. The government will work proactively with these agencies in addition to continuing to collaborate closely with the member organisations of the working group which already provide much of the current BSL tuition taking place in Scotland.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The average cost of constructing a home for social rent during 2006-07 was &pound;117,762. This can be broken down as follows:</p>

  <p>It is for West Dunbartonshire Council rather than ministers to manage any risks identified in its standard delivery plan and to determine how best to fund the investment required to meet the Scottish Housing Quality Standard.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the average consumption of milk has been in each year since 1980, broken down by socio-economic group.</p>

  <p>I am informed by the Food Standards Agency Scotland (FSAS) that there is no single data set that provides information on the average consumption of milk by socio-economic group between 1980 and the present time. Thus, data on the average consumption of milk by socio-economic group was obtained from the National Food Survey of GB, which only provides information up to the year 2000. The data is not Scotland specific.</p>

  <p>The data from 1980 up to the year 2000 is provided in table 1 by seven income groups (A, B, C, D, E1, E2 and Old Age Pensioners (OAP)). Households with one or more earners are categorised into groups A to D. Those in group A earn more than those in group D. Households without an earner are categorised into either group E1 or E2, with those in group E1 earning more than those in group E2.</p>

  <p>The following table details the payments made to First ScotRail Limited since 4 October 2004 when the current franchise agreement commenced. All figures are based on the franchise payment amounts specified in the franchise agreement adjusted, which allows for adjustments for price indexation, performance penalties or payments and variations or changes made to the agreement. The SRA and SPT were responsible for franchise payments during 2004-05 and the early part of the 2005-06 years.</p>

  <p>Scottish smoke-free legislation, already one of the most comprehensive in the world, has only been in place for 18 months.
