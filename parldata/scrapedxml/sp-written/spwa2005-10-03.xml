  <p>Payments under the Single Farm Payment Scheme are due to be made between 1 December 2005 and 30 June 2006. The timing and amount of payment is dependent on agreement at EU level to legislation providing for partial or advance payments, ahead of finalising the calculation of payment entitlement. This is because a small percentage of the final payment level depends on National Reserve allocations across the UK. My department is on track to deliver Scottish payment entitlements, including National Reserve calculations, on time for payment when the payment window opens at the start of December, subject to EU approval.</p>

  <p>Tables are available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre. Table 1 (Bib. number 37547) shows the combined figures for acute and psychiatric hospital discharges with an explicit diagnosis of alcohol related conditions in Fife, Tayside and Forth Valley NHS areas for the period 1998-99 to 2001-02. This has been reported as discharge information because the detail is drawn from two datasets and one of these datasets records discharge data only. Complete data on psychiatric discharges are unavailable for 2002-03 to 2004-05.</p>

  <p>Table 2 (Bib. number 37548) provides information on discharges from acute hospitals only for the period requested. For acute hospitals, only discharge data exists. The 2004-05 figures are provisional.</p>

  <p>As outlined in the answer to question S2W-19176 on 20 September 2005, the main task of the strategic group will be to produce an action plan to address the current inequalities that exist for minority ethnic communities in the labour market in Scotland. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament's website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="../../../webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a> .</p>

  <p>The action plan will identify what work needs to be taken forward to achieve the following long-term outcomes:</p>

  <p>Reduction of the minority ethnic employment gap.</p>

  <p>Elimination of the &quot;ethnic penalty&quot;.</p>

  <p>Reduction in occupational segregation.</p>

  <p>Increased access to finance and business support services for minority ethnic entrepreneurs.</p>

  <p>Economic integration of new migrants.</p>

  <p>Working towards better inclusion of minority ethnic employees at every level of the workforce.</p>

  <p>The group&rsquo;s formal remit will be agreed at its first meeting. An important consideration for the group will be to ensure that work undertaken in Scotland complements work being carried out by the UK government.</p>

  <p>The procurement process used by the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency (SFPA) is set out in EU Procurement Directives. The SFPA sought expressions of interest to construct this vessel on 18 August 2005, for return by 26 September 2005. On current plans, the agency aims to short-list the yards expressing such interest and invite tenders for return by end-November. Thereafter, the received tenders will be assessed to identify a preferred bidder with whom a contract will be negotiated. It is usual practice for the period of time for tender assessment to be kept flexible, and therefore no date has been set of the award of &quot;preferred bidder&quot; status or for the final contract award.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>GRO grant funding for private developers for the provision of low-cost housing for owner occupation has been a long-standing mainstream programme of the Executive. Although the scheme was suspended in March 2001, pending resolution of compliance with European Union State Aid procedures, it was reinstated in March 2002 and is still operational.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to carrying out an assessment of needs for ME services. It has, however, proved difficult to identify the best means of taking this forward. The former Scottish Needs Assessment Programme has been in abeyance for some years and the infrastructure which supported it no longer exists. After consideration of all options the Executive has decided that the work must be put out to tender. This will be done as soon as the financial resources to support it can be identified.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&rsquo;s central heating programme aims to ensure that everyone of pension age, whether or not they are disabled, has central heating and adequate home insulation. In addition, the Warm Deal scheme offers a package of home insulation measures to people on a range of benefits including a number of disability benefits. I would encourage everyone in receipt of the Winter Fuel Payment and the Cold Weather Payment to ensure that they use these payments to heat their home.</p>
