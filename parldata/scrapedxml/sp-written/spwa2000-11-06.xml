  <p>Direct air links between Scotland and European destinations can have benefits for the Scottish economy. Decisions on the development of new links are, however, for the commercial judgment of airlines as well as airport operators who assess the potential for new services. The Enterprise Networks and others with a relevant interest in the establishment of new links can also assist in determining the need and demand for such services.</p>

  <p>The statistical information requested is not available centrally. The Scottish Ambulance Service, however, has statistical data on violence towards its staff and that can be obtained by writing to Mr Adrian Lucas, Chief Executive, Scottish Ambulance Service, National Headquarters, Tipperlinn Road, Edinburgh, EH10 5UU. He will also be able to advise you about the action being taken locally with staff and the trade unions to protect staff.</p>

  <p>With regard to the action being taken by the Scottish Executive Health Department to address the issue of violence towards staff, I refer the member to the answer I gave to question S1W-10293.</p>

  <p>An interim report was received in June from the Steering Group set up to take forward the Review of Police and Fire Structures. Ministers&#8217; consideration of that report has been informed by the report of the inspection by Her Majesty&#8217;s Chief Inspector of Constabulary of the Scottish Criminal Record Office fingerprint service which was published in September. In the light of this Ministers have concluded that initial priority should be given to developing proposals for a fundamental reform of the structure of police common services. Once the details of this reform have been settled it will then be necessary to look further at local structures to ensure that these can deliver the service required by communities, effectively, efficiently and accountably. We have also decided that work on police and fire structures should now proceed separately but continue to be linked, so that the immediate priority for further work on fire should be a review of the scope for developing collaborative services with a view to improving service efficiency. As with the police service, it may then be appropriate to look further at local structure in the light of the conclusions reached on collaborative services. I will be consulting the two services on the way in which the further work will be taken forward.</p>

The Executive understands the concerns of businesses, and particularly manufacturers trading with Europe, about the value of the exchange rate.

The MPC sets interest rates for the UK economy as a whole but it takes into account a wide range of regional and sectoral data, drawing on information from its Scottish and other Regional Agents. In order that the MPC is fully aware of what is happening in Scotland, the Executive provides a monthly assessment on current Scottish economic conditions to the bank&#8217;s Scottish agent.</p>

  <p>No detailed analysis has been carried out on the economic impact of heather beetle on moorland.</p>

  <p>Heather Beetle (<i>Lochmaea</i> <i>suturalis</i>) has been increasing throughout the UK moorlands since 1995; the warm spring and summer has led to a particular increase this year, leading to some loss of heather cover throughout the UK. Information and guidance on the problem has been prepared for land managers by Scottish Natural Heritage and the Heather Trust and will feature in the next edition of the Joint Nature Conservation Committee&#8217;s <i>Uplands</i> <i>Newsletter</i>.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to announce that following very helpful and constructive discussions between officials and the industry, and as part of a UK-wide initiative, we propose to introduce two key measures to promote the safety at sea of fishermen and fishing vessels.</p>

  <p>There is a key need to improve the safety culture within the industry. We need to make sure every fisherman is aware of safety issues and the risks involved in what is an inherently dangerous occupation. We therefore propose to make available up to &pound;0.5 million in each of the next three financial years to promote the delivery of safety training for fishermen in Scotland.</p>

  <p>That will include courses to update safety awareness; training in accident prevention and risk assessment, and safety training for new entrants to the industry. Discussions about course development and delivery are already underway and consultation on the detail of implementation will continue. Delivery will be via the Sea Fish Industry Authority and is planned to commence from 1 April next year.</p>

  <p>We also propose to make available grant funding, of up to 40% of project costs, to support trials and testing of innovative or experimental equipment designed to help prevent accidents and improve safety at sea. Funding under that scheme will be made available as soon as possible around the end of this year.</p>

  <p>I am grateful to the industry representatives and others who have contributed to the development of these proposals. In particular, this initiative was driven forward with great enthusiasm by my predecessor, John Home Robertson. I share his determination to build a safety culture and I hope these measures will be welcomed and that fishermen will take advantage of the opportunities they offer. We have a common interest in improving safety. I believe these measures will contribute significantly towards that.</p>

  <p>The instant appointments proposals have been incorporated into a much broader Scotland-wide programme, which is now underway, of Electronic Clinical Communications Implementation (ECCI) between Primary and Secondary Care. Five lead sites have been selected (Argyll and Clyde, West Lothian, Tayside, Grampian and Highland) with the remainder of the NHSiS following on in two further phases. The range of clinical communications includes:</p>

  <p>widespread email including seeking consultants&#8217; opinion;</p>

  <p>co-ordinated referral information;</p>

  <p>electronic booking &#8211; protocol based where appropriate (previously referred to as instant appointments);</p>

  <p>test ordering and results receiving;</p>

  <p>discharge letters and summaries and clinic letters; and</p>

  <p>information in support of shared care.</p>

  <p>There are many benefits for patients and staff in these e-health initiatives which will lead to a closer integration of Primary and Secondary Care services ensuring that patients are at the centre of healthcare delivery.</p>

This will be an important consultation for Scotland and other parts of the United Kingdom: I shall issue a press statement on Monday supporting it and will also lay the document before the Scottish Parliament. Copies will be widely available from my Department and through the Stationary Office, and from the Department in London.

  <p>In my statement on 28 September I made it clear that the M74 option which currently has planning permission is not acceptable, in terms of both its environmental impact and value for money.

  <p>The Executive, directly and with our partners, is committed to the delivery of the M74 Northern Extension as a strategic link for the west of Scotland.

  <p>Repairs to the trunk road network in Scotland (and hence Mid Scotland and Fife) are carried out on an ongoing basis. Programmes of work are developed based on need and carried out by order of priority. Annual budgets are set to ensure this work is undertaken timeously.</p>

  <p>No. The Public Transport Fund was specifically created to assist local authorities in providing key value for money developments to their public transport network. Some of the public transport projects supported include improvements to the local road infrastructure bringing associated environmental and safety benefits. Scottish Ministers provide local authorities annually with a block allocation for capital expenditure on a number of services, including roads and transport. It is entirely a matter for local authorities to decide the priority to be given to local roads projects, in terms of all the services for which they are responsible, and allocate resources accordingly.</p>

This information is available to personnel working on the project who require to have access to it in the course of their duties and to members of the Holyrood Progress Group. My answer to question S1W-9469 made it clear that tender information was regarded as commercially confidential while the possibility remains of similar packages being tendered. I also indicated that it may become appropriate, in due course, to release information of this nature with the consent of the relevant contractors. I understand that the Progress Group will be making these assessments on an ongoing basis as the project progresses and consulting with contractors accordingly.</p>

  <p>As at 1 July 1999, all staff working in the Parliament were employed by the Scottish Executive and had been recruited by them on our behalf. Out of a total of 319 staff in post at that time: 96 were career civil servants from the Scottish Executive; eight were seconded from Westminster; and 215 had been recruited directly from a variety of sources such as local government, central government departments, other public sector bodies and the private sector. A detailed breakdown is not readily available.</p>

  <p>So far as the current staffing situation is concerned, out of a total of 371 staff in post: 316 are employed by the SPCB direct; 53 are seconded from the Scottish Executive, and two are seconded from Westminster.</p>

  <p>Under the current SPCB policy on Smoking in the Workplace, smoking is not permitted at any time in any of the buildings in the parliamentary complex except in a designated smoking area. At the moment, the central courtyard behind PHQ is the only designated smoking area.</p>

  <p>The SPCB has recently commissioned a survey of all members and staff to see whether or not designated smoking areas should be provided for in our new complex at Holyrood. The outcome of this survey will inform its decision on this issue.</p>
