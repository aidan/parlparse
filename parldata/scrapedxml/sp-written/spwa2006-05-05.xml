  <p>I am pleased to announce the launch today of a public consultation exercise on the policy on architecture for Scotland. The consultation is designed to stimulate public debate on the future direction of architecture policy; to seek views on the Executive&rsquo;s progress to date in implementing its previous policy, and to inform the development of a renewed policy on architecture. The consultation paper is available online at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/consultations" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/consultations</a></p>

  <p>The consultation will be formally launched by me in Perth this afternoon at the annual Convention of the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland (RIAS).</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive why Working for Families funding was removed at short notice from two projects in north-west Dumfries being undertaken by the Maxwelltown Umbrella Group, namely the Grow Your Own project and the Building Healthy Communities project.</p>

  <p>The decision was taken at a local level following a period of review of all Working for Families projects. The Working for Families Steering Group in Dumfries and Galloway, which includes internal council members and external representatives, made a collective decision that funding for both projects would not be continued and that resources could be better utilised elsewhere. The original funding for both projects was agreed up to the end of 2005-06 only with no agreement in place to continue funding past March 2006.</p>

  <p>Seven of the 16 local concessionary travel schemes included arrangements which enabled eligible people to travel with a companion either free or at a discounted rate.

  <p>The Scotland-wide Free Bus Scheme for Older and Disabled People fully meets our commitment to extend concessionary travel for people in the groups concerned. It is a major achievement under which over a million older and disabled people can travel free on buses throughout Scotland at any time of day. The first two years of operation will be critical in building up the evidence base for future analysis of the scheme. We will be happy to use this evidence to look at where issues emerge and review the scheme in light of our experience. Meantime, we have no current plans to extend the scheme and therefore no plans to hold discussions with NHS boards.</p>

  <p>In August 2005, the Scottish Executive, in partnership with the Scotland Office, issued an invitation to tender for the provision of e-counting facilities for the 2007 combined elections. Bidders were asked to provide costings for the provision of between six and 32 local authority count centres. After a preferred supplier was selected, a series of trials were held in Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh during February and March 2006. Each of Scotland&rsquo;s 32 local authorities was invited to attend the trials.</p>

  <p>Following the successful completion of these trials, the project proceeded to the acceptance phase. This took place during the week beginning 24 April and the results are currently being evaluated.</p>

  <p>No decisions have yet been taken on the number and location of counting centres should e-counting be adopted for the elections in 2007. The Executive has recently issued a discussion letter on this topic to local authorities. The final decision on where the Returning Officer holds his or her count rests with them.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not hold information on the number of students who apply for a course at an English university when the same, or a similar course, is not available at a Scottish institution. The Universities and Colleges Admissions Service is responsible for handling applications on behalf of the institutions.</p>

  <p>Scottish Universities are autonomous institutions, responsible for developing their own course provision. All accredited courses are funded by the Scottish Funding Council according to its funding allocation formula.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-23170 by Malcolm Chisholm on 20 March 2006, whether it is also negotiating to transfer surplus public sector housing to providers of affordable housing and, in particular, whether it is pursuing an agreement with the Ministry of Defence to transfer empty houses at Smuggler&rsquo;s Way, Arden Hill, Alexander Place, Jupiter Place and Beech Grove in Rhu, Argyll and Bute, to a registered social landlord or other provider of affordable housing.</p>

  <p>There are past instances where we have supported the transfer of surplus public sector housing to Registered Social Landlords, and further opportunities to do so will be considered when they arise.</p>

  <p>In respect of the specific sites mentioned in the question, exploratory discussions were held with the Ministry of Defence in 2004, but did not reach a conclusion as the properties in question fell to be considered as part of a wider accommodation review being undertaken by that Department. My officials in Communities Scotland intend to approach the Ministry of Defence to re-open discussions.</p>

  <p>As the Scottish Environment Protection Agency&rsquo;s Landfill Allowance Scheme Quarterly Monitoring Returns show, we are making good progress towards meeting the 2006 and 2008 recycling and composting targets.

  <p>Scottish ministers do not have a statutory role to consent to suspension of detention of non-restricted patients. The underpinning principles in relation to escorted and unescorted leave for restricted patients are contained in Chapter 5 (Suspension of Detention) of the <em>Memorandum of Procedure</em> which provides guidance to professionals managing restricted patients. The <em>Memorandum of Procedure</em> is currently being revised to take account of the recommendations contained in the Mental Welfare Commission Inquiry Report into the care and treatment of Mr L and Mr M and provisions contained in the <em>Management of Offenders Etc (Scotland) Act 2005</em> . Revised Care Programme Approach guidance is being developed to establish joint arrangements for the effective risk management of restricted patients requiring that all those engaged in the patient&rsquo;s care have an understanding of the risks presented by the patient and of the factors that might suggest a relapse in the patient&rsquo;s condition and be prepared to act where those factors appear to be manifest. A working version of the <em>Memorandum of Procedure</em> is available on:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/health/mentalhealthdivision" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/health/mentalhealthdivision</a>.</p>

  <p>The guidance in the <em>Memorandum of Procedure</em> is developed by consultation with professionals in the field, and with advice from the Psychiatric Adviser in the Health Department, and is endorsed by Scottish ministers.</p>

  <p>There was one formal inspection carried out in each of the last three years. Many of the areas covered by licence applications are well known to and visited by our advisors, Scottish Natural Heritage, Fisheries Research Services and The Scottish Agricultural Science Agency, through their other duties. Site visits are normally conducted for a first application, or where circumstances have changed, or where doubt exists over the validity of the information supplied.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not hold this information centrally but is aware of the following;</p>

  <p>Red-Breasted Mergansers</p>

  <p>The most recent estimate of numbers of breeding red-breasted mergansers are:</p>

  <p>561 males (299 to 915, 95% Confidence Limits)</p>

  <p>591 redheads (females and immatures) (262-1,019, 95% Confidence Limits).</p>

  <p>These estimates are based on counts made in 1987 and 1997 prior to the main breeding period, and are regarded as minimum estimates.</p>

  <p>Data from the Wetland Bird Survey indicate that mergansers are widespread throughout Scotland, and that there has been virtually no change overall in the size of the population at key census sites over the last ten years.</p>

  <p>Goosanders</p>

  <p>The most recent estimate of numbers of breeding goosanders are:</p>

  <p>1,422 males (988 to 1,882, 95% Confidence Limits)</p>

  <p>2,041 redheads (females and immatures) (1,537-2,589, 95% Confidence Limits).</p>

  <p>These estimates are based on counts made in 1987 and 1997. These counts were made during the main breeding period for goosanders.</p>

  <p>Data from the Wetland Bird Survey indicate that goosanders are widespread throughout Scotland. There may have been a slight increase in the size of the breeding population, but a slight decrease in the size of the over-wintering population.</p>
