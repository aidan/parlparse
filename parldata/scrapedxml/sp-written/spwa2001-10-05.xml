  <p>Availability and extension of services is a commercial matter for operators which we would expect to be dependent upon demand. The Executive&#8217;s strategy, based on the aggregated procurement of public sector connectivity, aims to provide a volume of demand that will help providers make a business case regarding upgrading of existing services.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the statement in its report <i>Connecting Scotland: our broadband future</i> that competition must be encouraged, what measures it plans to take to ensure that local supply procured on a local basis is not monopolised by one company, given that BT plc is the prime owner of local loop technology.</p>

  <p>A formal procurement process has not yet commenced. The Scottish Executive is not in a position to anticipate the content of bidders&#8217; proposals. The procurement strategy is to ensure that the solutions procured are those which most appropriately meet the broadband strategy objectives.</p>

  <p>Telecommunications companies can take advantage of local loop unbundling and, more generally, it is open to telecommunications companies to offer solutions which involve purchase by themselves from BT. The Executive has also stated that it expects a range of technologies will be required to meet procurement needs in the Pathfinder areas, including, in some instances, solutions which bypass the copper local loop.</p>

  <p>NHSScotland has contract arrangements under NHSnet until early 2004. NHSScotland will be exploring with the Digital Scotland Unit of the Scottish Executive, and with NHS suppliers, the options for procurement action before and after current NHSnet contracts expire.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Higher Education Funding Council and the Scottish Further Education Funding Council are responsible for the provision of the SuperJANET network in Scotland, and for connections to all further education (FE) and higher education (HE) institutions in Scotland. The most recent FE/HE procurements were too far advanced, and too specialised, to be brought within the Executive&#8217;s current plans for aggregation. However, the funding councils have agreed with Digital Scotland to seek to co-ordinate future procurements wherever possible.</p>

  <p>Health department officials have kept colleagues in Department of Health and the NHS Information Authority informed of the proposals set out in <i>Connecting Scotland: our broadband future </i> on the basis that existing contract arrangements will be sustained and will not constrain exploration of options for broadband delivery in the period leading up to the expiry of NHSnet contracts and beyond.</p>

  <p>SuperJANET4 is an academic network operated by the Joint Information Systems Committee on behalf of the UK&#8217;s higher and further education communities. The Scottish Higher Education Funding Council and the Scottish Further Education Funding Council are members of the JISC and are responsible for the provision of the SuperJANET network in Scotland and the Scottish Executive has had discussions with UKERNA. The development of SuperJANET will not constrain the proposals set out in Connecting Scotland.</p>

  <p>Liberate has been subject to a programme of safety surveillance since it was licensed in 1996. During this period there have been no reports of transmission of pathogenic virus infections (hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV) and only two reports of mild allergy type reactions.</p>

  <p>The following statement is included in the product literature:</p>

  <p>Despite a good clinical record the nature of products prepared from human blood or plasma are such that the transmission of infectious agents, including pathogens of a hitherto unknown origin, cannot be excluded entirely.</p>

  <p>The development of antibodies to Factor VIII in recipients of Factor VIII concentrates can prevent the treatment from being effective. This is a serious complication of therapy in the treatment of haemophilia A. The frequency of such antibodies occurring in patients treated with Liberate (1.8% of patients treated) is substantially lower than with other plasma derived or recombinant products.</p>

  <p>Secondary legislation will be required based on the provisions of section 11 of Housing (Scotland) Act 2001, to ensure that all tenants with secure tenancies or with assured tenancies with a preserved right to buy, before the introduction of the Scottish secure tenancy, can continue to exercise the right to buy on existing terms and conditions after the introduction of the Scottish secure tenancy.</p>

  <p>In addition, paragraph (13)17 of schedule 10 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001, when commenced, will repeal the Preserved Right to Buy as set out in section 81A of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 and the associated regulations. The Preserved Right to Buy applies to secure tenants whose houses are the subject of a disposal to a &quot;private sector landlord&quot; which is defined in the 1987 Act to include registered housing associations. At present, such tenants continue to have the right to buy even when the transferee landlord has charitable status. In order to achieve a similar result after the introduction of the Scottish secure tenancy, the intention is to use secondary legislation to continue the protection given to any pre-existing right to buy entitlement of tenants in houses which are transferred to a registered social landlord that had charitable status at Royal Assent of the 2001 Act.</p>

  <p>Pro bono legal services provided by solicitors and advocates are primarily an issue for the legal profession itself. Methods of improving access to civil justice more generally are being discussed by a broadly-based working group which I set up to consider how a community legal service might be developed for Scotland. I expect to receive its report at the end of October, and will consider the way forward once I have studied it.</p>

  <p>No. Renewable energy research and development funding is a reserved matter, and the programme is the responsibility of the Department of Trade and Industry. Many Scottish projects have benefited from this funding over the last decade, and should continue to do so as extra resources are devoted to the programme over the coming years.

  <p>The Scottish Executive contracts with the new trunk road Operating Companies (OCs) contain procedures to address incidents that result in trunk road and motorway closures.</p>

  <p>The contracts require OCs to record all incidents where a trunk road is closed and they are required to initiate certain actions as soon as possible but not longer than predefined timescales following the notification of an incident that requires the closure or partial closure of a road. The contracts require the OCs to prepare an Emergency Response Plan that is issued to the emergency services. This plan contains information which enables the police, who would initiate a road closure, to call on the OCs to provide additional resources, if necessary, to assist the emergency services and maintain safety.</p>

  <p>The impact of the recent tragic events on the tourism industry will be taken into account in the review of our tourism strategy, which was already under way. On marketing, for example, VisitScotland has already indicated that changes will be made. We intend to present our proposals to a conference that is being organised by the industry on 19 November.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-17371 by Ross Finnie on 22 August 2001, what investigations it plans to make into the circumstances surrounding the managerial restructuring of West of Scotland Water Authority, including the severance package offered to its former Chief Executive Mr Ernie Chambers, given that this restructuring exercise took place after the intention to merge Scotland&#8217;s three existing water authorities into a new single Scotland-wide authority had been announced.</p>

  <p>None, as my answer to question S1W-17371 made clear there are no grounds for such an investigation.</p>

  <p>I wrote to the member on 22 July enclosing three tables showing individual licences granted by the Scottish Office and the Scottish Executive under section 16 since 1990. My answer to S1W-16300 explained that comprehensive information is only readily available for the period since 1990. The tables I provided with my letter show licences by year, species and purpose. Copies of all three tables have been placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 16175).</p>

  <p>Copies of relevant general licences were also enclosed with my letter. Copies of all general licences currently in force have been placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>In relation to statistics on refusals of licence applications, I refer the member to the answers given to questions S1W-16300 and S1W-17693.</p>

  <p>The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 makes no specific provision for licences to control predators. Section 16 of the Act permits licences to be issued, in certain circumstances, for the purpose of conserving wild birds and wild animals and in order to prevent serious damage to livestock and fisheries.</p>

  <p>I wrote to the member on 22 July providing three tables showing licences granted by the Scottish Office and the Scottish Executive under section 16 since 1990. Cases involving predatory species, and the relevant section 16 purpose, can be determined from each table. Copies of the tables have also been placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 16175). My answer to question S1W-16300 explained that comprehensive information is only readily available for the period since 1990.</p>

  <p>A summary of individual licences under section 16 issued in respect of predatory species between 1990 and 2000 is given. Figures for the 2000-01 season have not yet been fully compiled.</p>

  <p>General licences under section 16 also permit the control of certain common bird species with predatory behaviour, such as crows, rooks, magpies, jackdaws, jays, greater and lesser black-backed gulls and herring gulls. Copies of all general licences have been placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>No licence is required for the control of mammalian predators such as foxes, weasels, stoats or mink, which are not included on Schedule 5 of the Act, provided legitimate methods of killing are employed.</p>
