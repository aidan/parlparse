  <p>The Scottish Government does not hold data on the use of antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) for preventing gang members from associating with each other. ASBOs can be useful for tackling disorder but are only one of many tools available to local agencies. Enforcement measures alone will not solve the deep seated problems that fuel disorder in our communities. Only by pursuing an holistic multi-agency approach that places prevention and early intervention at the centre, through education and support, will do that.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has invested &pound;1.6 million in the Community Initiative to Reduce Violence (CIRV) &ndash; the Glasgow gangs initiative with education, prevention and rehabilitation at the heart of the initiative which is being led by the Violence Reduction Unit. This will create a systematic framework for coordination, focused around risk/needs assessment and then provision of an appropriate range of joined-up services, ranging from enforcement through to intensive support. It will deliver a holistic and coordinated plan to reduce violence among territorial gangs in the East of Glasgow.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-19933 by Adam Ingram on 30 January 2009, what actions it will take to ensure that children&rsquo;s and adults&rsquo; services in local authorities work effectively together to share information and plan services for young people with autism who are approaching adulthood.</p>

  <p>As set out in the answer to question S3W-19933 on 30 January 2009, the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 requires education authorities to take action, where appropriate, to help young people with additional support needs, including autism, to make the transition from school to post-school life successfully. Under the definition employed in the act, an &quot;education authority&quot; encompasses a local authority as a whole, including its children&rsquo;s and adults&rsquo; services. As detailed in that earlier reply we have taken action on a number of fronts to strengthen transition pathways and improve life outcomes for all young people with autism. In addition, initiatives to improve information sharing and service planning for all children and young people under the <em>Getting it right for every child</em> programme and following the publication of the Early Years Framework will help in relation to children and young people affected by autism, as in relation to all children.</p>

  <p>Costs for the home test kits, laboratory functions, call/recall office and helpline are centrally funded and managed.</p>

  <p>NHS Education Scotland (NES) was commissioned in March 2006 to develop a national programme to support the education and training of health care professionals undertaking endoscopy. The estimates of numbers required were 150 clinicians and 25 non-medical endoscopists to help increase endoscopy capacity as part of the preparation for roll-out of the Scottish Bowel Screening Programme. Since 2006, NES has trained 171 clinicians and 31 non-medical endoscopists.</p>

  <p>Additionally, those screened positive patients who require further hospital care such as a diagnostic test or treatment will be covered by the 62 day target to treatment. The Scottish Government has also made significant funding available towards the delivery of our 18 weeks &quot;whole - journey&quot; (referral to treatment) target which includes improvement in reducing waiting times for diagnostic services such as endoscopy. These new targets are due to delivery by the end of December 2011.</p>

  <p>Young people are required to attend non-advanced full-time courses, including highers, in order to be eligible to apply for an Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA). Within the school sector, full-time usually means at least 21 guided learning hours per week. In colleges, a course with at least 720 planned hours within one academic year qualifies as full-time.</p>

  <p>There is a degree of flexibility around the number of hours making up a full-time course, particularly for vulnerable students who may require non-standard attendance patterns. Each student is required to sign a learning agreement which will contain conditions on attendance and agreed learning goals.</p>

  <p>I can confirm that at present there are 7,256 people on the waiting list for registration with a dentist under NHS arrangements in the Wick and Thurso area.</p>

  <p>There are long-term problems with access to general dental services (GDS) in Highland where independent general dental practitioners (GDPs) have taken the decision to reduce their commitment to the NHS. As independent contractors NHS boards cannot force GDPs to register patients under NHS arrangements.</p>

  <p>This information is not held.</p>

  <p>The majority of dentists are independent contractors who are responsible for managing access to NHS dental services at their own practices. Information on the number of patients directly approaching independent dentists for access to NHS general dental services is not held.</p>

  <p>Most NHS boards have dental advice lines and may keep information on the number of patients contacting the board for help in accessing NHS dental treatment. This information is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Adolescent Lifestyle and Substance Use Survey (SALSUS) is a series of biennial surveys commissioned by ISD Scotland on behalf of the Scottish Government to gather data on the prevalence, attitudes and behaviour of young people in Scotland with regard to smoking, drinking and drug use.</p>

  <p>The 2006 survey provides information on alcohol consumption, at national and local level, for 13 and 15-year-olds. Nationally, it found that 84% of 15-year-olds and 57% of 13-year-olds had had an alcoholic drink. Both represent a decrease on the 2004 results of 88% for 15-year-olds and 68% for 13-year-olds.</p>

  <p>Our Framework for Action on alcohol misuse outlines the measures we are putting in place to tackle underage drinking and we will be evaluating the success of these through data from SALSUS and other sources such as alcohol related hospital admissions.</p>

  <p>The 2006 local authority reports are available at:</p>

  <p>The results of the 2008 survey will be published later this year.</p>

  <p>Information on what is spent directly and indirectly on drug and alcohol services is not held centrally. Funding is allocated to NHS boards for drug and alcohol treatment and support services. It is for NHS boards together with partners in local Alcohol and Drug Action Teams to decide which services to fund based on identified local need.</p>

  <p>In 2007-08, &pound;1,591,000 was allocated to NHS Lanarkshire to fund drug treatment and support services and &pound;832,722 for alcohol treatment and support services.</p>

  <p>In addition, local authorities allocate funding for alcohol and drug services on the basis of their local needs and priorities. In the past, this level of funding has been significant, and at least comparable to the ring-fenced funding provided to NHS boards. NHS boards also use resources from their unified budget to supplement funds made available through the alcohol and drug misuse budgets.</p>

  <p>Audit Scotland is currently undertaking a study on the scale and effectiveness of spend on alcohol and drugs. The findings from this study are due to be published shortly and should help provide a more complete picture of what is spent.</p>

  <p>Funding is allocated to NHS boards for drug and alcohol treatment and support services and for the delivery of alcohol brief interventions. It is for NHS boards together with local Alcohol and Drug Action Teams to decide which services to fund based on identified local need.</p>

  <p>In 2008-09, &pound;1,651,000 was allocated to NHS Lanarkshire to fund drug treatment and support services and &pound;2,455,698 for alcohol brief interventions and treatment and support services.</p>

  <p>NHS boards also use resources from their unified budget to supplement funds made available through the alcohol and drug misuse budgets. &pound;46 million has been allocated to NHS boards over 2008-11 to provide treatment and care to those people affected by hepatitis C, the vast majority of whom will be current or former drug users.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government intends to continue pursuit of our six-point economic recovery programme. We will also continue to press the UK government to reverse its decision to reduce Scottish spending by as much as &pound;500 million in 2010-11 and the year after, as the proposed spending cut is the wrong decision, especially in a time of recession.</p>

  <p>Enjoyment of wildlife and landscape generally conform to standard definitions of public goods. For example, appreciation of scenery is freely available to all and the pleasure from the study of wildlife can be shared by all. However, there are also gains from land use which are not public goods and in some instances controls to avoid disturbance of wildlife or sensitive environments may be desirable or necessary in the wider public interest.</p>

  <p>Capital charges are not levied on a hectarage basis, but on the value of assets shown on a department&rsquo;s balance sheet. The charge is 3.5% of the average value over an accounting period. Capital charges for the national forest estate amounted to &pound;23.4 million in 2007-08 and since the estate covers some 665,000 hectares we can calculate that the average cost per hectare was &pound;35.</p>

  <p>The Scottish House Condition Survey is the source of official figures for fuel poverty. The latest figures available are for 2007. In 2007, about 586,000 households were in fuel poverty. Since the figures are derived from a survey there is an associated 95% confidence interval which is +/- 68,000 households - giving an estimated 95% confidence interval from 517,000 to 654,000 households.</p>

  <p>The figures are produced annually rather than quarterly. The figures for 2008 will be available in October 2009.</p>

  <p>As the figures demonstrate, the vast majority of these deaths are caused by clots in the coronary arteries, which result in certain types of heart attack, and clots in the brain, which result in certain types of stroke.</p>

  <p>In view of the responses generated by the answer given to the question S3W-12541 on 9 May 2008, it should be emphasised that of the 12,289 deaths in 2007, 257 were related to pulmonary embolism and there were also 112 deaths in which Deep Vein Thrombosis was recorded as the underlying cause of death.</p>

National Debtline anticipates spending &pound;7.3 million in total during 2009. National Debtline started operating in April 1987. There is no planned end date.</p>

Some 3% of clients were signposted on for debt advice elsewhere (generally because they needed face-to-face advice) and 17.5% of clients were signposted elsewhere for matters other than debt (for example, to a doctor or lawyer).</p>

  <p>National Debtline is highly effective in helping clients to resolve their debt problems and to avoid further difficulties with debt.</p>

  <p>In their 2008 evaluation, 80% of clients reported that they were able to reach an adviser on the first attempt. 95% of clients expressed themselves as satisfied or very satisfied with National Debtline&rsquo;s service (79% very satisfied), and 98% of clients said they would recommend or probably recommend the service to someone else who was experiencing difficulty with debt (85% definitely recommend). 91% of clients who set up an arrangement with their creditors said they had maintained it.</p>

  <p>90% of clients felt that they were more knowledgeable about financial matters after receiving advice from National Debtline, and 85% of clients thought that they would be less likely to find themselves in a similar situation again.</p>

  <p>Information on the charging policies of each local authority for specific social care services or client groups is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The National Assistance (Assessment of Resources) Regulations 1992 provide the framework for local authorities to charge for care that they provide or arrange in residential care homes, including for people with learning disabilities.</p>

  <p>Under Section 87 (1A) of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 a local authority may charge for certain adult non-personal domiciliary services it provides. In keeping with local accountability, it is for local authorities to decide their charging policies for these non-personal care services. The legislation requires that any charges levied should not be more than appears to be reasonably practicable for the recipient to pay, taking account of his or her other financial commitments.</p>

  <p>Guidance issued to local authorities by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities in January 2006 recommends a consistent framework for charging and encourages councils to demonstrate that they are following best practice. The guidance is currently under review by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities.</p>

  <p>In the majority of appeals dealt with by the Directorate for Planning and Environmental Appeals (DPEA), the decision is made by a Reporter appointed by Scottish ministers, ministers have therefore no involvement in the decision. In certain instances cases are determined by Scottish ministers. In these cases the reporter will submit a report with recommendations to ministers who make the final decision on the case.</p>

  <p>For comparisons sake, the percentage of planning appeals allowed by reporters in 2008 for the South Lanarkshire Council area was 39%. This is slightly higher than the national average of 36% of appeals allowed by reporters in 2008.</p>

  <p>No weaning programmes for tube-fed infants equivalent to the one provided in the Kinderpsychosomatik ward in the Graz Children&rsquo;s Hospital are provided by the NHS in Scotland.</p>

  <p>It is the opinion of some professionals that there is insufficient evidence of the potential benefits of the Graz model or of its outcome in different clinical situations to determine whether it is appropriate for an infant or child to be referred.</p>

  <p>In Scotland, weaning infants and children off tube feeding takes place in paediatric units using a multi-disciplinary approach involving paediatricians, paediatric dietitians, speech and language therapists and psychologists. Treatment is based on the individual needs of the infant or child and their family.</p>

  <p>There are two routes by which an NHS patient can go abroad for treatment in certain European countries. The long established E112 scheme, when the NHS agrees to treatment abroad and pays for it beforehand and, following a judgement in the European Court of Justice in 2006, under Article 49 (of the European Treaty which guarantees the rights of service users to access services) where the patient pays for their treatment and is reimbursed by the NHS once it has been carried out. However, in both scenarios, prior authorisation is required from the relevant NHS board responsible for the provision of the patient&rsquo;s health care.</p>

  <p>Guidance was issued to NHS boards in October 2007, which sets out the considerations that should be taken into account in deciding whether it is appropriate to authorise treatment abroad and, if so, by which route.</p>

  <p>In more general terms, there are proposals for a cross-border health care directive, which, amongst other things, would codify the Article 49 case law.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government <em>Infrastructure Investment Plan 2008</em>, published in March 2008, provides details of the funding and planned investment in the prison estate. This includes the redevelopment of some prisons on existing or new sites and forms part of a rolling programme designed to create a fit for purpose prison estate. During 2008-09 to 2010-11, an average of &pound;120 million per annum will be provided to support this programme.</p>

  <p>The rebuild cost for each prison in the prison estate is not available. Typically, the cost of redeveloping an existing prison (with around 700 prisoner places) would be in the region of some &pound;100-130 million depending on the particular site, role of the prison, design, planning considerations, market pricing etc.</p>

  <p>The primary purpose of the regulatory impact assessment (RIA) was to consider the impact of proposals on business and, in particular, on small businesses. Almost 65 per cent of meetings held to discuss the RIA were with tobacco retailers and 60 per cent of written representations in relation to the RIA were from tobacco retailers. Other representations made in relation to the RIA were from local government, health interest groups and tobacco manufacturers. Just over 80% of letters received by the Scottish Government in response to proposals in <em>Scotland&rsquo;s Future is Smoke Free: A Smoking Prevention Action Plan </em> were from retailers.</p>

  <p>Initial evidence on how the abolition of the graduate endowment fee has impacted on young peoples&rsquo; decision to study should be available from the Student Income, Expenditure and Debt Survey (SIEDS) which is due to be published in late spring 2009. We will consider commissioning specific research into the impact of the abolition of the graduate endowment fee once the findings of this survey have been analysed. This will also be subject to sufficient resources being available to fund any further work.</p>

  <p>Funding for all establishments is provided according to the establishment&rsquo;s needs based on historical funding, the staffing arrangements in that particular establishment, any changes to key services or contracts, and the need to generate efficiency savings.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The SPS do not know what particular offences involved knives. Many assaults, murders or culpable homicides may have involved the use of a knife, and the offence of carrying an offensive weapon may include carrying a knife. However, this will not be recorded on the offender&rsquo;s warrant. One offence description mentions &quot;knife&quot; specifically; that is &quot;To Carry a knife&quot;. 55 young offenders have this offence recorded in their current warrant.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>In 2007-08 a total of 944 substance related interventions were delivered in Scottish prisons against a target of 800. Of these 139 (14.7%) were delivered to prisoners under 21-years-old of which 92 (9.7%) were delivered in Polmont. These interventions are either alcohol specific or include this under the wider heading of substance misuse.</p>

  <p>During 2008-09 delivery of the &quot;Substance Related Offending Behaviour Programme&quot; was extended to HM YOI Polmont, HMP and YOI Cornton Vale, HMP Barlinnie, HMP Edinburgh and HMP Glenochil.</p>

  <p>The following prisons currently holding young offenders now deliver the listed Substance Misuse interventions:</p>

  <p>HM YOI Polmont: &quot;Alcohol Awareness&quot;, &quot;First Step&quot; and &quot;Substance Related Offending Behaviour Programme&quot;.</p>

  <p>HMP and YOI Cornton Vale: &quot;Alcohol Awareness&quot;, &quot;Drugs Action for Change&quot; and &quot;Substance Related Offending Behaviour Programme&quot;.</p>

  <p>HMP Greenock: &quot;Alcohol Awareness&quot; and &quot;Drugs Action for Change&quot;.</p>

  <p>HMP Perth: &quot;Alcohol Awareness&quot; and &quot;First Step&quot;.</p>

  <p>In addition, offenders also have access to &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot; and the &quot;Enhanced Addictions Casework Service (EACS)&quot;. This provides a range of interventions and in-prison support to those serving 31 days or over and sets up throughcare referrals, based on agreed criteria, with external service providers to ensure continuation of support in the community.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Prison Service does not centrally collate data on the number of young offenders who have a formal diagnosis of learning disability. However, the SPS does seek to address the presenting needs of prisoners identified with learning disability and learning difficulties.</p>

  <p>The SPS has reviewed its service provision for learning disability and difficulties and is seeking to implement an improved detection and alerting process to identify such people in custody.</p>

  <p>Assessment of learning needs shows that 64% of women offenders and 90% of prisoners in HM YOI Polmont experience communication and literacy difficulties.</p>

  <p>The Action for Children Scotland Renfrewshire Primary Support Project is in line with the principles of <em>Preventing Offending by Young People &ndash; A Framework for Action </em> (Bib. number 46408), published in June 2008.</p>

  <p>In this partnership Framework, we made a commitment to develop an evidence base around what works in early and effective intervention. Over the coming months we will undertake research which will look at a wide range of responses available and their effectiveness, with a view to identifying and disseminating good practice.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not intend to initiate programmes but will support local agencies to learn from evidence of what works, and plan services accordingly.</p>
