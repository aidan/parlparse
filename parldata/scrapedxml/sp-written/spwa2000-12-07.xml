  <p>The EU contribution to the cost of Organic Aid Scheme (OAS) commitments entered into before 31 December 2000 is estimated to be as follows:</p>

  <p>Agri-environment scheme commitments (including the OAS) entered into from 1 January 2001 will be funded from resources generated by the application of modulation to the CAP direct payment schemes. It is anticipated that modulation will generate EU resources for agri-environment schemes as follows:</p>

  <p>The precise amounts will depend on the level of CAP direct payments in each year. The proportion, which will be devoted to the OAS, will depend on the number and value of applications submitted by farmers.</p>

  <p>There are no plans to collect this information centrally. However, the Executive has commissioned the Chartered Institute of Housing in Scotland to undertake a follow-up to its survey last year on the use of anti-social behaviour orders and the extended powers of eviction for anti-social behaviour under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. The outcome of this survey will be published in the spring and a copy will be placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre.</p>

  <p>Guidance was issued to local authorities on 15 March 1999 on the procedures and best practice to be adopted in handling these Orders. Further good practice guidance will be commissioned to fill any gaps identified by the new survey, by the recent Mullen Report on the Use of Civil Legal Remedy for Neighbour Nuisance in Scotland and by the Anti-Social Behaviour Champion, when appointed.</p>

  <p>The UK Government is studying all of the BSE Inquiry team&#8217;s findings with care and their substantive response to the report will be published in the coming months. The Scottish Executive is fully engaged in contributing to this response. The UK Government will provide an update on progress before the end of the year.</p>

  <p>The Phillips Report is concerned with issues and events relating to animal health and food safety between 1986 and 1996. Strict measures have been introduced since then to prohibit the use of mammalian bone meal in feed for all farmed livestock. The Over Thirty Months Scheme and regulations requiring the removal of specified risk material control both the age and type of bovine material which enters the food chain. These measures are kept under constant review by the Food Standards Agency, which provides the Government with independent advice. The agency has stated that the report does not give rise to any immediate need for new food safety measures.</p>

  <p>The first summit meeting of the British-Irish Council identified five subjects, transport, social inclusion, environment, the knowledge economy and drugs, for priority attention. The lead administrations for each have since been developing proposals and work programmes for co-operation and information exchange on these subjects; the subject of social inclusion is the joint lead responsibility of the Scottish Executive and the National Assembly for Wales.</p>

  <p>Ministers met in London on 2 October to discuss work on the environment, and officials from the various administrations have met to consider proposals on the other four subjects. The UK and Irish Governments, who form a joint Secretariat to the council, hope shortly to confirm arrangements for a second council summit, in Dublin, which will consider the developing work programmes.</p>

  <p>As I indicated on 6 November (question S1W-10937), we are making up to &pound;1.5 million available over the next three financial years to support the delivery of safety training for fishermen in Scotland. Delivery is planned to commence from next April. Other aspects of training may also be eligible for support under the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG).</p>

  <p>We will also make available grant funding of up to 40% of eligible project costs to support testing and trials of innovative safety equipment.</p>

  <p>These measures succeed the Fishing Vessels (Safety Improvements) (Grants) Scheme 1995, which operated on a UK basis and funding for which ended last year.</p>

  <p>Lay members of the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland&#8217;s service review groups will receive reimbursement of travel and subsistence expenses and compensation for loss of earnings in accordance with NHS rules.</p>

  <p>The board has decided not to pay lay members (unlike, I believe, the General Medical Council (GMC) and the Centre for Health Improvement (CHI)) because the board felt that this would breach the tradition of voluntarism and in response to views expressed by a number of potential lay members that payment would compromise their independence.</p>

  <p>Technically qualified members of the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland&#8217;s service review groups will receive no payment other than reimbursement of travel and subsistence if they are NHS employees. This is in accordance with Health Department policy and the funding for the board was calculated on this basis.

  <p>Nominations to the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland&#8217;s service review groups were invited from all NHS Trusts in Scotland, from Health Councils and from a wide range of voluntary organisations. In addition, individuals who, for example, attended the board&#8217;s open meetings, have been invited to put themselves forward. Selection from the pool of nominations will be undertaken by the board&#8217;s staff in accordance with selection criteria the board has determined. The board is also working to develop more open procedures to enable as many people as possible to put themselves forward.</p>

  <p>* Although piloting took place in Glasgow, the purpose there was to explore the use of two highly targeted schemes rather than assess the wider potential for diversion. Numbers for Glasgow were not collected during the course of the evaluation.</p>

  <p>Information on the offences allegedly committed by diverted accused is not held centrally. However, such data was collected by researchers as part of the evaluation of the pilot schemes. The evaluation report <i>Diversion from Prosecution to Social Work and Other Agencies: Evaluation of the 100% Funding Pilot Programmes </i>was published in January as part of the Executive&#8217;s Central Research Unit&#8217;s Criminology Series and I am arranging for a copy of this to be sent to the member.</p>

  <p>Diversion is the referral of an accused to the supervision of a social worker, psychiatrist, psychologist or mediator for the purposes of support, treatment or other action as an alternative to prosecution. It has its formal origins in the Second Report of the Stewart Committee on Alternatives to Prosecution. The object of diversion is to obtain, in a case in which prosecution would otherwise be justified, a disposal which, having regard to the personal circumstances of the accused, is more satisfactory on humanitarian grounds than prosecution or which may prevent the re-occurrence of offending conduct through early or intensive intervention outwith the court.</p>

  <p>Diversion arrangements are local and therefore vary throughout the country. Procurators fiscal hold very detailed guidelines which address the different models available but it is possible to state here the three essential features of the guidance which are common to all arrangements. Those features are:</p>

  <p>In considering diversion, as in considering any other option, procurators fiscal are instructed to have regard to the whole circumstances including the gravity of the offence and the interests of the victim.</p>

  <p>People rather than cases are diverted. Subject to a long-standing Lord Advocate&#8217;s direction that offenders who breach Sex Offender Orders should not be considered for diversion, no other category of crime is automatically excused from a diversion scheme. As a general rule, however, the more serious the criminal conduct, the more likely it is that prosecution rather than diversion should take place.</p>

  <p>Before an accused is considered for diversion there must be sufficient evidence to prosecute. Where the procurator fiscal receives a case and decides <i>not</i> to prosecute, for whatever reason, but considers that the accused would nevertheless benefit from social work intervention, then he may still bring the case to the attention of the Social Work Department, but such cases <i>do</i> <i>not</i> form part of a diversion scheme.</p>

  <p>Under the &quot;deferred prosecution&quot; model, with diversion to the Social Work Department (which represents the most common arrangement), the process is generally as follows:</p>

  <p>the procurator fiscal decides that a case is worthy of prosecution but considers that diversion should be canvassed;</p>

  <p>the procurator fiscal contacts the Social Work Department and, if appropriate, sends to them a copy of the police report;</p>

  <p>the Social Work Department check their own records from which they may be able to decide whether they consider the accused would be a suitable candidate for assessment for diversion;</p>

  <p>the Social Work Department reports their view to the procurator fiscal as to suitability for assessment;</p>

  <p>the procurator fiscal writes to the accused asking if he is willing to participate in the assessment process;</p>

  <p>if within seven days the accused says that he is not willing to participate (and thus opts out) the procurator fiscal should notify the Social Work Department and thereafter reconsider the case for prosecution;</p>

  <p>if the accused does not opt out then the Social Work Department will arrange to interview the accused;</p>

  <p>within 21 days, the Social Work Department provides a written report to the procurator fiscal on the outcome of the interview;</p>

  <p>the procurator fiscal decides whether to divert or prosecute and intimates his decision to both the Social Work Department and the accused;</p>

  <p>no later than three months thereafter, the Social Work Department will submit a progress report to the procurator fiscal. If diversion is proceeding satisfactorily then intimation that no proceedings are to be taken is made to the accused. If diversion is not proceeding satisfactorily the accused is be prosecuted without further delay, and</p>

  <p>on completion of diversion the Social Work Department will submit a final report to the procurator fiscal in order that success or otherwise may be monitored.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to announce that the fifth progress report of action to implement our wide-ranging Land Reform Action Plan is published today. All MSPs are receiving copies.</p>

  <p>Members should note that, since the last progress report:</p>

  <p>the Scottish Law Commission has published proposals and a draft Bill to reform title conditions;</p>

  <p>a contract has been let for research to consider the need for improved information on rural landholdings;</p>

  <p>the Crofters Commission has published guidance on community management; and</p>

  <p>the New Opportunities Fund has announced the Award Partner to administer the &pound;10.8 million Scottish Land Fund (a partnership of Highlands &amp; Islands Enterprise and Scottish Enterprise).</p>

  <p>Although hyperbaric oxygen therapy may give symptomatic relief to some multiple sclerosis sufferers, there is no clinical evidence to suggest that it is in any way effective in arresting the progress of multiple sclerosis. There is, therefore, no national policy or national arrangements for the provision of this therapy.</p>

  <p>The Executive has statutory responsibility to provide funding for the National Museums and Galleries of Scotland, but the responsibility for independent museums lies solely with those who create and operate them. Many of the 160 independent museums, which were set up without reference to the Executive or its predecessor, are facing financial difficulties and the Executive cannot be expected to fund them all.</p>

  <p>Section 68 of the Transport (Scotland) Bill will enable Scottish Ministers to set, common to all Scottish local authorities, a basic level of concession for pensioners and disabled people travelling within Scotland. No maximum level of concession is specified in section 68.</p>

  <p>New resources will be provided to local authorities to enhance existing concessionary fares schemes in order to provide pensioners and people with disabilities in Scotland with free local bus travel within existing scheme boundaries from October 2002 for journeys outwith the morning peak. The eligibility criteria for disabled people are entirely a matter for the local authorities operating existing concessionary fares schemes.</p>

  <p>The existing voluntary national concessionary fares scheme for blind and partially sighted people continues to deliver free travel throughout Scotland on train, bus and ferry services.</p>

  <p><i>The Attrition of Sexual Offences in the Criminal Justice System</i> was a feasibility study, completed in June 1999, which provided preliminary findings from a pilot sample. Since then, consideration of the responses to the consultation paper <i>Towards A Just Conclusion</i> indicated that the priority was to produce legislative proposals to improve the protection of victims in sex offence cases. We have now published our proposals for restrictions on cross-examination of complainers in sex offence cases and will be working on further proposals to protect other vulnerable victims.</p>

  <p>We are committed to taking forward, in the New Year, related research on vulnerable witnesses and an investigation of the treatment of sexual offence witnesses in court. We will keep the requirement for further research under review. Additionally, we are working on new information technology systems which should make it easier to track individual cases and aid future research.</p>

  <p>Scottish Executive statistics will be reviewed within the National Statistics framework, at least every five years, involving external experts as appropriate. These reviews will be wide-ranging and will take account of the needs of users of the information, while considering the burden that meeting these imposes on data providers. A UK-wide review programme is being developed for each broad subject area (National Statistics theme) and consultation on the proposed three-year work plans for 2001-02 onwards is currently in progress. Details are available on the National Statistics website, http://www.statistics.gov.uk.</p>

  <p>I will shortly be releasing the second Scottish Executive Statistical Plan, for 2001-02, for consultation. This will provide an opportunity to comment on all aspects of our statistical programme, including the need for statistics on particular topics or areas. Responses to the consultation on the first plan, issued earlier this year, did not suggest any major shortfalls in the range of statistics we have available. We specifically highlighted that we had identified a growing need for more detailed local data: we will be bringing forward proposals for meeting that.</p>

  <p>Scottish health statistics are not collected by the Executive and so were not within the initial scope of National Statistics. The Minister for Health and Community Care is currently considering detailed proposals on the extension of the scope of National Statistics to include health data. All information within scope will be covered by the same review arrangements described above.</p>
