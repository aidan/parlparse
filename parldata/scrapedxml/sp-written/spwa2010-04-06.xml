  <p>If a patient decides to opt out then information is deleted from the ECS database. The only information held about a patient that has opted out will be the patient forename, surname, CHI number and opt out status.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many cases of inappropriate or illegal access to patient emergency care records have (a) been recorded, (b) resulted in prosecution and (c) resulted in action by a health professional council.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not centrally hold information on the number of recorded unauthorised viewings of the ECS by health professionals. It is the responsibility of individual health boards to report and investigate in line with their own local policies and procedures. Nevertheless it is understood that (a) there have been three cases of inappropriate access and one case reported to Procurator Fiscal, (b) there have been no prosecutions to date and (c) one case is currently being investigated by the GMC.</p>

  <p>NHS Tayside&rsquo;s percentage share of the overall initial revenue allocation to territorial NHS boards in 2010-11 was 7.97%, this compares to their NRAC target share of 7.84%.</p>

  <p>I have confirmed that no Board will receive less funding than it does at present as a result of transition to the NRAC formula and any changes will be phased in over a number of years as has been the practice under both the previous SHARE and Arbuthnott formulae.</p>
