  <p>I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that Chernobyl-related restrictions will continue until there is no longer a risk of sheep which exceed the control level entering the food chain.</p>

  <p>Since 1987, the number of restricted farms in Scotland has gradually reduced from 73 to 10 as of 10 February 2006. Radioactive levels continue to decline on the few remaining restricted farms in Scotland; however environmental variability of these levels means it is not possible to specify when restrictions may be removed.</p>

  <p>The Executive is unaware of any peer-reviewed evidence that the prevalence of autism has actually increased. However, due to a variety of factors, including increased awareness, better diagnosis and wider diagnostic criteria more children and young people are being diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. What is important is that their needs are identified as early as possible and are supported appropriately. The Scottish Executive&rsquo;s policy focuses on service development on the basis of current, evaluated evidence that autism is a lifelong condition. As such the Executive does not currently consider there is a need to investigate environmental factors in relation to the incidence of autism.</p>

  <p>The purpose of Sure Start Scotland funding is to give children the best possible start in life through the improvement of their social and emotional development, health and ability to learn, and through the strengthening of their families and communities.</p>

  <p>Because local authorities have the discretion to deploy Sure Start resources to best fit local needs, and these resources are frequently combined with other funding streams to maximise their efficiency and impact, it is not possible to state categorically which kinds of services are and are not provided. However, in general terms, Sure Start funding is frequently used to provide a wide range of family support services, from home-based support, playgroups and cr&egrave;ches to outreach support, toy and book libraries and support for the development of better parenting skills.</p>

  <p>The Executive consulted on a draft integrated early years strategy in 2003. In the intervening period, integrated children&rsquo;s services planning and related developments have taken this agenda forward at a more strategic level.

  <p>It is a legislative requirement that cameras used to detect speeding offences receive approval from the Secretary of State. This approval means that the device has met the specific technical requirements laid down by the Home Office Scientific Development Branch. The approval process is necessary in order that evidence from the device can be admissible as evidence at court.</p>

  <p>The evidence from the camera, which will form the Crown evidence, is served upon the accused in advance of the trial. At trial, the accused will have the opportunity to test the Crown evidence and also to present to the court any defence to the charge.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive did not offer any additional support to local government as a result of the recent storms nor did we receive any requests for assistance.</p>

  <p>The Executive supports local authorities&rsquo; net revenue expenditure on road maintenance and winter maintenance through the core local government finance settlement. All local authorities receive their needs-based share of the road maintenance and winter maintenance Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE) allocations and it is up to each local authority to decide how best to allocate these resources based on their local needs and priorities.</p>

  <p>The roads maintenance GAE amounts to &pound;158.7 million in the current financial year rising to &pound;195.3 million next year. Similarly the winter maintenance GAE will increase from &pound;52.8 million this year to &pound;64.9 million next year.</p>

  <p>We are working with the UK Government to tackle poverty in Scotland, taking forward activities at our own hand through our Closing the Opportunity Gap approach.</p>

  <p><em>Details of Scottish Executive Spending on Initiatives Aimed at Eradicating Child Poverty</em> was published on 22 July 2004 and can be accessed at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/FOI/19260/poverty" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/FOI/19260/poverty</a>.</p>

  <p>This includes on-going programmes such as Working for Families and the Changing Children&rsquo;s Services Fund.</p>

  <p>The need for additional programmes to eradicate child poverty will be considered at the next and subsequent Spending Reviews.</p>

  <p>The total Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE) is &pound;8.7 billion in 2005-06 and will be &pound;9 billion in 2006-07, and &pound;9.2 billion in 2007-08.</p>

  <p>Comparison between GAE for children&rsquo;s social work and budgeted spend does not take account of other resources provided to support services for children including other government grants or expenditure funded locally by the council tax. Other resources allocated by the Scottish Executive include around &pound;57 million from the Sure Start programme which is intended to provide more integrated services for our most vulnerable children and families and the Changing Children&rsquo;s Services Fund which will provide over &pound;65 million to support the modernisation and integration of services for children. From 2006-07, &pound;15 million from the Changing Children&rsquo;s Services Fund will be included in GAE with a further transfer of &pound;20 million from 2007-08.</p>
