  <p>The Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS), a mandatory EC requirement for the control of CAP agricultural subsidies, defines a farm business as all the production units managed by a farmer situated within the same member state&rsquo;s territory. Certain of these businesses submit cross border IACS Single Farm Payment applications to the country containing the majority of land. My department expects 84 Scottish area (SFP) aid applications to include English land. Similarly, there will be 78 English area aid applications, which will include Scottish land and three area aid applications from Northern Ireland with Scottish land.</p>

  <p>The percentage figures provided in the answer to question S2W-15713 were calculated on the basis of all urgent calls received by the ambulance service, most of which are from GPs. Percentages calculated from the figures given above will therefore differ very slightly from those provided in the previous answer.</p>

  <p>The time for ambulance response agreed between the ambulance service control room and a GP is a guideline and not a target. An ambulance tasked to respond to a GP urgent call may be diverted to respond to a category A (life threatening) call if it can provide the quickest response to that call. Such a diversion would be communicated to the GP or the patient. Where a GP decides that a patient&rsquo;s need for an ambulance is urgent, the GP will dial 999 and the call will be categorised (where appropriate) as category A leading to an immediate ambulance response.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-15713 by Mr Andy Kerr on 5 May 2005, what evidence it has to indicate that &quot;the reduction in performance in some areas, especially those with sizeable urban conurbations, may be seen as an indicator of the progress the Scottish Ambulance Service is making towards delivery of its eight minute response time target for category A (life threatening) calls&quot; and whether it is able to evaluate this progress.</p>

  <p>Ambulance service figures provided in the answer to question S2W-16528, answered on 25 May 2005, show that in the period since August 2002, when the priority based dispatch system was first introduced, the number of GP urgent calls has fallen substantially &ndash; from about 16,000 a year to around 4,300. The priority based dispatch system enables ambulance controllers to direct the most appropriate ambulance resource to category A (life threatening) incidents. At the same time, the proportion of category A cases responded to within eight minutes has increased from 54% in April 2004 to 60% in April 2005. The ambulance service believes that the reduction in GP urgent calls is at least partly attributable to GPs dialling 999 to request an ambulance for patients, in the knowledge that the priority based despatch system will ensure that calls are prioritised appropriately. The ambulance service constantly monitors its performance towards the target of responding to 75% of category A calls in eight minutes by March 2008.</p>

  <p>The target set for the ambulance service is that, by March 2008, 75% of Category A (life threatening) calls will receive a response within eight minutes. In April 2005, the service achieved performance of 60.2%, up from 54.3% in the corresponding month a year earlier. The ambulance service has assured me that it is on track to meet the March 2008 target.</p>

  <p>The results from the rural analysis were used by the Executive to improve the evidence base and to get a better understanding of how, if at all, businesses in rural areas differ from businesses in urban areas. For instance, the results were used in the production of our booklet, <em>Rural Scotland &ndash; Key Facts</em> , which brings together key facts related to rural Scotland in an accessible way, and also our Annual Rural Report 2004, which details our achievements for rural Scotland over the preceding year. This increased knowledge helps inform how we tailor our policies and interventions right across the Executive to make sure we take account of the needs of people in rural areas.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the former head of its EU office in Brussels was asked to step down from this post after the standard four years of service for a post of this nature, in light of the statement by its spokesperson in <em>Scotland on Sunday</em> on 27 March 2005 that four years was the standard length for such a post.</p>

  <p>The former Head of the EU Office in Brussels was in post from the establishment of the office on 1 May 1999 until his retirement on 31 October 2004. The nature and scope of the job changed considerably over that time. The timing of personnel changes is always a management decision based on the requirements of the post and of the Executive although four years is the norm for such posts.</p>

  <p>The Executive has no plans to measure the economic, environmental and social impact of shooting sports. However, further to the answers to questions S2W-15297 on 15 April 2005 and S2W-16232 on 5 May 2005, the Country Sports Tourism Group has estimated the value of country sports in Scotland, of which shooting is an important component.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, following the introduction of the five-in-one vaccine in August 2004, whether parents of children who previously received the separate oral version of the polio vaccine will be offered the oral vaccine and the previous four-in-one vaccine when a booster is due, in order to alleviate concerns that the new vaccine may overload the child's immune system and increase the risk of adverse reactions.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-05-25.24.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80057" speakername="Mr Andy Kerr" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa0525.htm#14">

  <p>The new five-in-one vaccine is the only vaccine available via the NHS against the serious diseases of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and polio.</p>

  <p>The previous and new vaccines are compatible, so children will be fully protected as long as they complete the programme of immunisations, including the pre-school boosters, in the childhood vaccination programme. Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) has now replaced the live oral polio vaccine (OPV) for all routine indications, including the childhood vaccination programme. This gives less risk of side effects as the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) does not carry any risk of causing vaccine associated paralytic polio (a rare complication that occurred with the oral polio vaccine (OPV)).</p>

  <p>The new five-in-one vaccine for infants provides effective protection against diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (whooping cough), Hib and inactivated polio (IPV). Vaccines for pre-school children boost this protection and include diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis and inactivated polio components in one combined vaccine.</p>

  <p>There is no evidence that the routine childhood combination vaccines overload the immune system. Vaccines only use a very small part of a child&rsquo;s immune system and children come into contact with thousands of bacteria and viruses in the environment every day.</p>
