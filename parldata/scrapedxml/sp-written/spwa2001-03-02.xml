  <p>Employment policy is reserved to the UK Government which takes the lead on funding and delivery of the New Deal. In Scotland, it does this in partnership with the Scottish Executive and contributing Scottish organisations.</p>

  <p>The expenditure on each New Deal programme in Scotland to January 2001 was:</p>

  <p>New Deal for Lone Parents: &#163;7 million</p>

  <p>New Deal for Disabled People: &#163;1 million</p>

  <p>New Deal for Partners of Unemployed People: &#163;1 million</p>

  <p>New Deal 25 plus: &#163;23 million</p>

  <p>(e) New Deal 50 plus: &#163;1 million</p>

  <p>These figures do not take account of a proportion of the total costs due to time lags in claims from New Deal service providers and subsequent reimbursement.</p>

  <p>In addition, there are central running and marketing costs for each programme which have not been included in these figures.</p>

  <p>The number of people in Scotland who have taken part in each New Deal at the end of December 2000 are:</p>

  <p>New Deal for Lone Parents: 19,600 (to end November 2000)</p>

  <p>Figure refers to numbers attending an initial interview.</p>

  <p>New Deal for Disabled People: 2,300</p>

  <p>This figure only includes the personal adviser service based in Lanarkshire.</p>

  <p>New Deal for Partners of Unemployed People: 800</p>

  <p>This figure refers to those attending an initial interview.</p>

  <p>New Deal for 25+: 34,500</p>

  <p>New Deal for 50+: 3,100</p>

  <p>The figures for ND50+ relate to the number of Employment Credit Starts. At present, caseload figures are not published.</p>
