  <p>Under the Waiting Times Framework, local service providers will submit waiting times information on a monthly basis to Drug Action Teams. This information will be used to identify local pressures and blockages, and as a basis for action to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of services. Aggregated information from the Drug Action Teams will be submitted to the Executive on a quarterly basis.</p>

  <p>Waiting times for individual services can also be affected by a wide range of factors, and can vary rapidly. It is not, therefore, our intention to publish information on waiting times for individual services.</p>

  <p>Service providers and local Drug Action Teams must have accurate and up to date information on waiting times in their areas so that problems can be identified and addressed as quickly as possible. Local waiting times can be affected by a wide range of factors and circumstances, and can vary rapidly.</p>

  <p>Local service providers will provide waiting times information on a monthly basis to their Drug Action Teams, and the Executive will receive quarterly returns from the Drug Action Teams. The administrative and financial impacts of the new Waiting Times Framework were considered during its development, but the burdens were not thought to be significant, since the majority of the data items were already being recorded by agencies.</p>

This commits the Executive to ensuring that all of its staff, regardless of gender, ethnicity or disability, receive equal pay for doing work of equal value. The Scottish Executive has also completed two equal pay audits as part of an ongoing commitment to monitor and review its pay system to ensure it is free from bias. Other measures include the provision of equal pay training for those responsible for the design of the pay system and an on-going review of the pay rules to ensure they comply with best equal pay practice.</p>

  <p>2 Includes births where NHS board of residence is unknown or outside Scotland.</p>

  <p>3 Drug misuse is defined using the following International Classification of Disease (10th Rev.) codes:</p>

  <p>P04.4- Foetus and newborn affected by maternal use of drugs of addiction.</p>

  <p>P96.1- Neonatal withdrawal symptoms from maternal use of drugs of addiction.</p>

  <p>4.* - Incomplete data.</p>

  <p>Data for 01/02 and 02/03 are considered incomplete. This is due partly to the introduction of the Scottish Birth Record (SBR) which replaces the SMR11 (sick babies only). The SBR is currently being incrementally implemented across Scotland with a view to recording information on all births by Spring/Summer 2005.</p>

  <p>The regulation and safety of medicines is reserved and is the responsibility of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).</p>

  <p>The MHRA investigates all allegations of counterfeit medicines in the UK, the vast majority of which are not associated with the tightly regulated legitimate supply chain. Action in the form of legal proceedings is taken when appropriate.</p>

  <p>Counterfeit medicines is a global problem, therefore the MHRA is liaising closely with international regulatory partners and the pharmaceutical industry to ensure that the tackling of counterfeiting medicines remains a priority activity.</p>

  <p>The MHRA runs a medicines surveillance testing scheme which uses specific analytical methods to test thousands of &quot;off the shelf&quot; products annually for authentication. To date, none of the tests has identified a counterfeit product.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-7172 by Malcolm Chisholm on 20 April 2004 and in light of the advice by the Committee on Safety of Medicines that it is general clinical experience that patients taking any antidepressant may develop an increase in suicidal behaviour in the first few weeks of treatment, what support will be given to patients during this period.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2004-07-28.S2W-9539.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80018" speakername="Malcolm Chisholm" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-04/wa0728.htm#9">

  <p>Depression and anxiety disorders are serious conditions which are known to be associated with an increased risk of suicidal behaviour. Prescribers and other care providers involved with patients taking antidepressants will be aware of the recognised side effects of treatment. Guidance, available to prescribers, recommends that patients with depression should be asked about suicidal thoughts and those considered to be at risk should be closely monitored.</p>

  <p>The safety of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, including any link to an increased risk of suicide, is currently undergoing intensive review by an expert working group of the Committee on Safety of Medicines. The group is expected to finish its work later this year, at which time it will publish a final report.</p>

  <p>Clinicians are also aware of the benefits for patients of talking treatments which can help reduce or remove reliance on drug based regimes and put the patient more in control of their care. An example of this approach is the &quot;Doing Well by People with Depression&quot; programme, funded over three years by the Centre for Change and Innovation. This programme is looking at how we manage mild to moderate depression better in primary care. The programme is taking a whole systems approach but specifically it is looking at how we can use interventions such as counselling, self help, psychological interventions such as cognitive behaviour therapy and also the voluntary sector to help improve the patient&rsquo;s treatment and experience as well as attempting to free up GP time and capacity.</p>

  <p>Only those private landlords who are not assessed as fit and proper persons will find that their registration applications are rejected or revoked and, in these circumstances the tenant will retain his or her protections against eviction under the letting contract and under statute. We do not believe that this will lead to a significant increase in homelessness and it should help to improve standards within the sector.</p>

  <p>In my recent news release issued on 7 July, I explained that we are looking at ways to expand the supply of affordable housing for sale and rent in Scotland through discussions with Homes for Scotland including ways of expand the supply of starter homes for sale on larger, planned sites in areas under pressure.</p>

  <p>As part of the modernisation of the planning system, we aim to ensure that development plans, which include allocations for housing, are up to date and that the approval system is streamlined and speeded up. We are also planning to issue supplementary guidance later this year on ways in which the planning system can facilitate the provision of affordable housing, including affordable housing linked to developments by private builders. And as part of the Affordable Housing Review, the Scottish Executive has published research into The Irish Planning System and Affordable Housing, which we shall study with interest.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not have robust information on the total number of houses in multiple occupation which are eligible to be licensed.</p>

  <p>The Executive is providing &pound;1 million in this and each of the next two financial years to help local authorities improve their HMO licensing systems and ensure that all existing HMOs are licensed. As part of the process of setting objectives for the use of this funding, each authority was asked to estimate the number of licensable HMOs in their area. The total of these estimates was 18,312, at 30 June 2003. However, this should only be taken as a rough indication of numbers, as the robustness of the estimate for each local authority area depends on the level of identification activity carried out to date.</p>

  <p>The most recent figure for the number of HMO licences in force is 1922, at 31 March 2003. Statistics for the year 2003-04 are not yet available.</p>

  <p>No guidance has issued to NHS boards in respect of the sale of assets such as magnetic resonance imaging scanners. NHS boards are given general revenue and capital allocations and it is for the boards to decide, based on their local knowledge of local needs, how these resources should be deployed. The provision/replacement of medical equipment is managed locally by NHS boards.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-8682 by Mr Andy Kerr on 15 June 2004, what steps it is taking to ensure that evaluations by the Scottish Assessors of non-domestic properties valued with reference to cost, as opposed to those valued with reference to rent, produce a like-for-like valuation with comparable premises in England, given that the Valuation Office Agency bases cost valuations on the cost of building a comparable modern building while the Scottish Assessors base valuations on the cost of constructing exactly the same building as is being evaluated.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2004-07-28.S2W-9498.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80057" speakername="Mr Andy Kerr" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-04/wa0728.htm#13">

  <p>The Scottish Assessors, who act independently of central and local government, base their valuations on the cost of constructing a comparable modern property that provides the same standards of quality, services and space as the property to be valued. In the case of properties already of &quot;modern construction&quot;, valuations can therefore be based on the generally recognised level of cost of constructing exactly the same property as being valued. In the case of commonly occurring properties from an earlier era, costs are based on the comparable modern property.</p>

  <p>In both cases, the same cost basis is used i.e. the cost of constructing a comparable modern property. This cost is estimated by reference to reliable average unit cost rates derived from the analysis of actual costs. The approach used is in harmony with Valuation Office Agency practice and there is an established exchange of relevant cost information and analyses between the Scottish Assessors Association and the Valuation Office Agency to provide consistent cost bases.</p>

  <p>In 2003 the Scottish Executive appointed a stakeholder group to assist in identifying the issues for our consultation paper <em>Rights of Appeal in Planning</em> . The group is made up of people from local authorities, industry and trade union bodies, community and environmental groups, and other planning experts. The group has held two meetings with Executive officials.</p>

  <p>In the past year, Scottish Ministers and officials have met many organisations and individuals in order to discuss a wide range of issues. The planning system in general and rights of appeal in particular will have been discussed at some of those meetings.</p>

  <p>As part of the current consultation on <em>Rights of Appeal in Planning</em>, the Executive is engaged in a programme of meetings with key stakeholders, such as business, environmental, local authority and community representatives.</p>

  <p>No. The Executive believes that the way to assist people with poor health is to undertake the Partnership Agreement review of prescription charges for people with chronic health conditions and young people in full-time education or training.

  <p>Growing the economy is our top priority and transport provides the connections that help to promote economic prosperity. Transport links get people to work, goods to market, students to education and enable people to access public services. Our connections, both internally and to the wider world, are an important factor in our competitiveness as a business location and play a crucial role in attracting tourists to Scotland and in spreading the benefits of tourism across the country. Through the Scottish Transport Appraisal Guidance, the contribution of transport improvements to the economy is fully assessed alongside impacts on the environment, safety, social inclusion and integration.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&rsquo;s investment in direct air links, where these are the only viable transport option, is consistent with our objectives of improving Scotland&rsquo;s connectivity and expanding our economic base.</p>

  <p>Direct links can also reduce greenhouse gas emissions by avoiding the need for two or more air flights from hub airports throughout Scotland.</p>

  <p>We are also committed to making an equitable contribution to UK climate change commitments and are taking action across a range of sectors designed to deliver overall greenhouse gas emissions savings. Existing policies and measures in Scotland and the UK are expected to deliver the reductions required to meet the UK Kyoto target.</p>

  <p>As a general rule commercial insurance would only be justified if the cost of claims, including administration costs, was calculated as likely to exceed the cost of insurance premiums.

  <p>: In total to date there have been 10 members&rsquo; staff (9 with plans with one provider and 1 with a plan with another provider) affected by the decision to cease making pension contributions from the Parliament&rsquo;s bank account by direct debit. The SPCB has been kept informed of this issue, including the efforts made to resolve it. The SPCB has not yet been informed of the most recent case but will be so informed when it meets again in September.</p>

  <p>: In terms of the collection and pay over of Members&rsquo; staff pension contributions, the SPCB acts as agents for members. The SPCB is fully committed to ensuring that the correct amount of pension contributions is collected and paid over on time. The sums are calculated and collected via payroll system and procedures are in place to ensure that accurate records are kept and monies are paid over on time and with an accompanying schedule of payment, in line with OPRA rules. Under current arrangements compliance with OPRA rules can be guaranteed which was not the case under the former arrangements whereby providers could collect monies using the direct debit facility.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body, further to the answer to question S2W-1861 by Mr Duncan McNeil on 28 August 2003, why &quot;experience has shown&quot; that the SPCB could not guarantee to make payments by the 19th of the month following the pay run in which the contributions are collected and what that experience has been; why the SPCB is unable to make an arrangement which complies with this time deadline using direct debit, and when the SPCB will provide a full explanation of this matter to MSPs.</p>

  <p>: Previously, contributions were paid by a combination of BACS, cheques and direct debits. In the case of the direct debit facility, it gave pension providers authority to collect contributions direct from an SPCB bank account. However, experience showed that:</p>

  <p>if an individual&rsquo;s pension contribution increased by a small amount certain pension providers continued to collect the amount previously agreed and refused to accept any increases of less than &pound;10.00 per month;</p>

  <p>pension providers were able to take money out of the bank account in situations where the Personnel Office had not been notified that a pension was in place;</p>

  <p>pension providers were collecting contributions in lump sums making it very difficult to identify for whom the contributions were being collected;</p>

  <p>pension providers continued to collect contributions for several months after an individual had ceased employment despite being advised that their employment had been terminated;</p>

  <p>once a pension contribution rate had been set some pension providers would not accept any revised amounts, for example, increases due to pay awards, changes to contracted hours or backdated payments.</p>

  <p>More importantly, however, new pension legislation changes came into effect from 6 April 2001 which required the SPCB to review its procedures. Under the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority (OPRA) the new rules for employers&rsquo; state that they have an obligation to:</p>

  <p>calculate the employers&rsquo; and employees&rsquo; contributions for each individual member of staff;</p>

  <p>pay the correct amount of contributions over by the 19th of the month following the pay run in which the contributions are collected;</p>

  <p>maintain a record of payments made;</p>

  <p>provide each pension provider with a schedule as a record of payments made.</p>

  <p>Because of the problems being experienced the SPCB believed that it could not comply with the new OPRA rules whilst the then existing direct debit arrangements remained and deemed it necessary to review and change its procedures. The decision was taken to close down the direct debit facility and pay all contributions either by cheque, BACS or by standing order. This change gave the SPCB control over this matter to ensure that it met its obligations under the new OPRA rules. All pension providers were informed in writing of the decision.</p>

  <p>The SPCB does not believe it could comply, on behalf of members with all of the obligations placed on them as employers under OPRA rules were it to reinstate the direct debit facility and therefore has no intention of doing so. This full answer ensures that members have a full explanation of the matter.</p>

  <p>: At present, the SPCB does not maintain records of the percentage of companies providing this type of information. However, tenderers&rsquo; submissions for SPCB contracts are assessed against relevant environmental and equalities criteria.</p>

  <p>For example, companies are asked to provide evidence of independently accredited environmental management systems, e.g. ISO 14000 certification. Also, for items containing a significant timber component (e.g. furniture), companies are asked to submit evidence that timber is obtained from responsibly managed forests.</p>

  <p>Even for low value/risk requirements, tenderers are asked to provide a copy of their environmental policy statement, together with any environmental initiatives the company has undertaken that would directly benefit the SPCB.</p>

  <p>To support the SPCB&rsquo;s Equalities in Procurement Policy, tenderers are also commonly asked to provide details of their equal opportunities policy and detail what steps are taken to ensure the delivery of equality of opportunity and treatment as both an employer and service provider.</p>

  <p>In addition, the SPCB is currently developing a set of policies and procedures to underpin its responsible purchasing initiative, encompassing professionalism and ethics, environment and sustainability and equalities and social justice.</p>
