  <p>Scottish Statutory Instrument (Scotland) number (2001 No. 259), which sets the statutory rules for the Farm Business Development Scheme (FBDS), legislates for the submission of single project applications attracting a maximum grant of &#163;25,000, or for collaborative ventures. A collaborative venture is defined in the legislation as "a project which is jointly submitted by three or more eligible persons in relation to three or more eligible businesses". The grant ceiling for a collaborative project is &#163;30,000 per eligible business.</p>

  <p>The SSI came into force on 2 July 2001 and has not been amended. There was, however, an anomaly in the scheme literature which was amended in April 2002. Unfortunately, the literature which accompanied the scheme indicated that joint applications (i.e. applications from two agricultural businesses) were eligible under the scheme. This statement was incorrect, since an FBDS application coming from two agricultural businesses does not fulfil the legal definitions of eligibility as set out at section 2(1) of the covering legal instrument.</p>

  <p>There has been no change in the legislation as described above. A wide ranging review of the scheme is to be undertaken with a view to reporting to Scottish ministers later this year, and the issue of joint applications will be considered as part of the review. One of the aims of the scheme remains to encourage collaboration within the farming sector and this is reflected in the higher level of grant ceiling available to collaborative ventures.</p>

  <p>Animal health and welfare are devolved matters so the Scottish Executive has the lead role in the formulation of policy which is applied in Scotland. In doing so it must comply with European Union legislation on animal health issues and needs to take account of animal health position in other parts of Great Britain.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive was well aware of the issues relating to employment within the construction industry before the publication of the Construction Industry Training Board's report in February 2002. In January 2001, we commissioned research to establish where construction skills gaps existed and what might be done to address them.</p>

  <p>In response to the research findings published earlier this year, the Scottish Welfare to Work Task Force established a construction sub-group to develop an appropriate construction industry training course for New Deal clients in Scotland. Working with employers, the sub-group focuses on establishing local partnerships to enable the disadvantaged and long-term unemployed to move into suitable construction jobs.</p>

  <p>In addition, Future Skills Scotland and Careers Scotland have agreed to identify opportunities for careers and training in areas where skills are in demand. We are working with Careers Scotland and the Construction Industry Training Board to promote awareness of opportunities in the construction industry, in line with the promotion of the Modern Apprenticeships programme. Almost 5,000 Modern Apprentices are now in construction-related training.</p>

  <p>The terms pyrolysis liquid and bio-oil are used to refer to a number of different substances. While these generally will not be hazardous, the precise answer in individual cases will be for the relevant firm to consider with the relevant regulatory bodies, such as the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the Health and Safety Executive.</p>

  <p>A full programme of training in what the act involves has been offered to GPs over the past 18 months. This included:</p>

  <p>four seminars on the act which were funded by the Scottish Executive;</p>

  <p>a training video which was circulated widely;</p>

  <p>leaflets and aides memoire for doctors, and</p>

  <p>guidance produced in consultation with the British Medical Association.</p>

  <p>Information on training on assessment of patients is not collected centrally. The assessment of whether a patient lacks the capacity to make decisions about medical treatment is a matter for the clinical judgement of the individual doctor. If a doctor considers that he or she requires additional training to be able to conduct assessments then it is for the GP as an independent practitioner to seek the training as necessary. Guidance and assistance on training needs for GPs is available from NHS Education for Scotland via the postgraduate Directors of General Practice Education. Under the Statement of Fees and Allowances for GPs, each GP principal is eligible to receive an annual Postgraduate Education Allowance to support an agreed amount of training.</p>

  <p>Under the terms of the consent to release this variety of genetically modified oilseed rape, the consent holder must ensure that no harvested rapeseed from oilseed rape grown within 50 metres of the GM plants will be put into the human food or animal feed chains. The farmer is at liberty to market any conventional oilseed rape growing beyond this 50 metre separation distance. Our advisers are confident that such a crop poses absolutely no threat to human or animal health.</p>

  <p>The Commission published interim measures in October 2000 for dealing with the issue of adventitious presence of GM seeds in conventional seed and has been working up draft proposals for legislative change. These proposals have evolved over time and have been the subject of two separate consultation exercises with interested organisations. A further, and I expect near final version, in the form of draft legislative proposals, has now been published by the Commission and I am arranging for a further period of consultation with stakeholders. I have arranged for copies of these documents to be available in the Parliament's Reference Centre. The Executive will take into account all the views that are expressed on the Commission's proposals in helping to frame the UK's position in Brussels.</p>

  <p>The revised proposals include maximum thresholds for the presence of GM material in conventional seed and requirements to minimise, monitor and test for such occurrence.</p>

  <p>Current monitoring of the RSI target involves a three-stage assessment, which is repeated annually. Full details of the methodology being employed are contained in the reply given to question S1W-18044 on 11 September 2001.</p>

  <p>The report of the full three-stage assessment of the incidence of rough sleeping in Scotland in 2001-02 is now available. I am placing copies in the Parliament's Reference Centre (Bib. number 22633).</p>

  <p>In summary, the report indicates that during the October 2001 study period of 14 days 471 people reported sleeping rough at least once. This compares to 500 people in the May 2001 study period. Whilst the report shows an overall reduction in the number of people sleeping rough it also shows an increase in the average number per night (from 64 to 87) indicating that this fewer number of individuals are sleeping out more frequently.</p>

  <p>An assessment of available accommodation showed that on a targeted night during the October study period, when 117 people reported they had slept rough, 181 bed spaces were available across Scotland. Analysis at local authority level shows that in all but five authorities, available accommodation was sufficient to meet, or exceeded demand.</p>

  <p>I welcome this report which provides invaluable detailed information about the issues and problems facing the reducing number of people who find themselves sleeping rough. The Executive will use this report in its continuing work with local authorities to improve the connection between people sleeping rough and the services and accommodation which have been funded through the Rough Sleepers Initiative. This work will be supported by the strengthened duties set out in the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 (to be commenced in September) which will ensure, at a minimum, the right to temporary accommodation for anyone assessed as homeless.</p>

  <p>Detailed progress on the delivery of the social justice target will be reported in the 2002 social justice report.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mr Bob Millar, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Communities Scotland's programme allocations reflect ministerial priorities and link the national distribution of resources to Area Teams, based upon the measurement of social exclusion. The area programme allocation is then developed in close consultation with partners, reflecting a broad range of existing partnership arrangements and leading to locally devised programmes and decision-making. Programmes are based upon local housing market and needs analysis to identify, consistent with our strategy, the demands, needs and opportunities for housing investment.</p>

  <p>Communities Scotland's allocation to North and North East Scotland on Housing Accommodation for Particular Needs is as follows:</p>

  <p>Communities Scotland - Expenditure in North and North East Scotland on Housing Accommodation for Particular Needs (2001-02 to 2002-03)</p>

  <p>Allergy was recognised by the Specialist Training Authority as constituting a related but distinct specialty as recently as June 1999. Accordingly, the effects of specialist training in that discipline will take time to be fully reflected in NHS provision, and there were therefore no training grade or consultant staff recorded in the specialty as at 30 September 2001.</p>

  <p>Training in the assessment and treatment of allergic reactions is a facet within a number of general medical specialties and also forms part of general undergraduate medical education. All doctors in NHSScotland will therefore have received a certain level of training in this area, though it is not possible to identify those who have a specific interest in the treatment of anaphylaxis.</p>

  <p>The Forward Strategy for Scottish Agriculture, developed by the Executive in partnership with stakeholders from the food and farming industries and the environmental sector, sets out an action plan which is relevant to the organic sector as well as to other forms of environmentally sustainable farming. Specific to the organic sector, it challenges the sector to:</p>

  <p>(i) identify and tailor production to consumer demand and market outlets;</p>

  <p>(ii) develop the supply chain so that organic producers are matched by sufficient processing capacity;</p>

  <p>(iii) in the livestock sector, identify finishers to whom store producers can sell their produce;</p>

  <p>(iv) ensure the right business and technical advice is available on how to convert to, and, as importantly, maintain organic farming in Scottish conditions, and</p>

  <p>(v) ensure that Scottish farmers are able to use organic standards which avoid gold plating and reflect Scottish conditions.</p>

  <p>The Executive encourages the development of the organic sector in Scotland in a number of ways. These include the Organic Aid Scheme (OAS), which provides annual payments for five years for farmers converting their land, assistance under the Processing and Marketing Grants Scheme and the Marketing Development Scheme for projects that strengthen the organic food chain, the funding of an organic helpline operated by the Scottish Agricultural College, and the recently published <em>Guide to Organic Marketing</em> funded by the Executive.</p>

  <p>The Executive has recently completed a consultation exercise on measures to improve the operation of agri-environment schemes, including the OAS, in the short term. The Executive is considering responses to that consultation paper, and also possible longer-term changes to agri-environmental measures to enable them more effectively to support a range of environmentally sustainable forms of farming.</p>

Since then, it has met five times in 2000 and five times in 2001 and has so far met twice this year, on 5 February and 15 May. The membership has changed once, following a review of ministerial committees and working groups in January this year, when some rationalisation was agreed. The sub-committee currently has the following members: the Minister for Social Justice, the Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning, the Minister for Finance and Public Services, the Deputy Minister for Environment and Rural Development and the Deputy Minister for Tourism Culture and Sport. Details of the remit and membership of all Cabinet sub-committees are available on the Scottish Executive website.</p>

  <p>There are no plans to develop such a campaign. However, the guidance "Talking Sense", referred to in the answer given to question S1W-27354 today, contains a section on violence within the family which provides advice to women who are in danger of being, or are being, abused, physically, emotionally or sexually by someone they love or trust.</p>

  <p>The remit of the Sustainable Development Forum for Scotland is to provide a focus for Scottish thinking and action on sustainable development.</p>

  <p>Adverts in the national press on 7 June invited nominations and requests to attend. Information was also available at: www.sustainable.scotland.gov.uk. The adverts indicated that we want to ensure that the forum has a wide range of participants from all sectors. The first 75 applicants were invited to the first meeting of the forum, which was held in Dundee on 24 July. No selection criteria have been applied, other than that where there were two or more applicants from the same organisation they have been invited to nominate one person to attend. We do not envisage the forum having a fixed or exclusive membership. Applicants who were unsuccessful, or who are unable to attend the first meeting, will be given priority for subsequent meetings. All applicants are being encouraged to keep in touch with the forum via our website at:</p>

  <p>It would not be appropriate to set out the arrangements. However, guidance issued by the Cabinet Office and the national security authorities covering the threat from chemical and biological agents has been taken on board together with advice received from the Lothian NHS Public Health Department and customised to suit the Parliament's circumstances. The Parliament's Police Unit, experts from Lothian and Borders Police HQ and other emergency services personnel would of course be involved in dealing with any incident.</p>
