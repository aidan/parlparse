  <p>A study carried out on behalf of HITRANS by the transport consultants Steer Davies Gleave in June 2004 estimated that the Net Present Value (NPV) over a 30-year period of the economic benefits of a blanket imposition of Public Service Obligations (PSOs) across air routes in the Highlands and Islands, together with HITRANS&rsquo; suggested enhancement for the air services, was &pound;400 million (1998 prices).</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the ministerial statement by the Minister for Transport and Telecommunications on 1 March 2006 ( <em>Official Report</em> c. 23596), in what ways extra revenue raised by bridge tolls is being invested in local transport improvements.</p>

  <p>Toll revenues at the Tay Road Bridge cover essential maintenance and operational costs, and cover debt servicing costs. There is no additional revenue for other transport improvements.</p>

  <p>At the Forth Road Bridge, decisions on projects that the Forth Estuary Transport Authority (FETA) might fund are a matter for FETA. The authority has, or is already contributing to a number of projects, including the upgrading of the A8000; extension of the Ferry Toll Park and Ride facility on the north side of the bridge; a feasibility study into a cross Forth commuter ferry service, and construction of a new link road to Rosyth ferry port.</p>

  <p>Our 2005 Housing Policy Statement set out the comprehensive range of actions that we are taking to improve housing supply and affordability in the market and to increase provision of affordable housing. The policy statement built upon the findings of a wide ranging review of housing supply and affordability in Scotland. Our review revealed a very mixed picture, with large parts of the country having a net surplus of affordable housing (most notably in the Greater Glasgow area), while elsewhere there was a sizeable net shortfall (most notably in Edinburgh and the Lothians). Even within local authority areas there are geographical imbalances and the pattern of shortage and surplus is extremely complex. We are continuing to improve our evidence base and have commissioned Heriot-Watt University to update their affordability model for us to inform future policy. The update will be available later this year.</p>

  <p>In addition to a significant increase in investment in affordable housing, the actions set out in our policy statement include planning reform, revised planning advice on affordable housing, a shared equity home ownership scheme and a commitment to address infrastructure constraints. We continue to explore further measures that might ease affordability difficulties and on 7 March I announced my intention to chair a joint planning and housing forum involving local authorities which will seek to identify and resolve obstacles in the most pressured areas. Local authorities too have an important strategic role to play in the delivery of affordable housing, informed by soundly-based Local Housing Strategies.</p>

  <p>Decisions on the future ownership and management of council housing are for councils themselves and their tenants. Councils are required to ensure that their houses will meet the Scottish Housing Quality Standard by 2015. Transfer is one means of accessing substantial new housing investment to improve the stock whilst keeping rents affordable. Councils choosing to develop a transfer proposal can apply for financial assistance for this purpose through the Community Ownership Programme.</p>

  <p>Under the 1998-99 and 1999-2002 New Housing Partnerships Initiatives, funding was made available to councils to assess the condition of their housing stock and the cost of bringing it up to modern day standards and maintaining it in good condition over the longer term. As a result a number of councils, including the City of Glasgow and the Scottish Borders, concluded that they could not deliver the investment required and keep rents affordable and that transfer to community ownership offered the best way forward.</p>

  <p>Under the existing common law, an individual can be found guilty of the crime of culpable homicide in a variety of circumstances and, consequently, there is no single, all-encompassing definition of this crime. However, generally speaking, there are two forms of culpable homicide: involuntary culpable homicide and voluntary culpable homicide.</p>

  <p>Involuntary culpable homicide can occur where an unintended death occurs either as a result of a criminal act (such as an assault), or as a result of culpable negligence. Voluntary culpable homicide applies to cases where death is caused by an intentional or wickedly reckless act but there are certain mitigating factors present which result in the offence being culpable homicide rather than murder.</p>

This information shows that there is no geographical pattern which explains the length of time a postal application takes to reach BCMS from different parts of the country. However, where it can be proved that a postal delay has occurred in delivering the application to the BCMS the passport will be issued on appeal.</p>

  <p>The British Cattle Movement Service (BCMS) receives approximately 20 million notifications per year of which three million are birth notifications. Due to this volume and the automated scanning processes that the BCMS use to deal with birth applications it would be very difficult to retain both the application and the envelope. Therefore there are no current plans to ask the BCMS to change their processes.</p>

  <p>The &pound;2.7 million award was given to Lanarkshire Acute Hospital NHS Trust from the Capital Modernisation Fund, which was a centrally based initiative. MEL (1999)75 which issued on 7 October 1999 invited NHS trusts to submit proposals for the re-design of their Accident and Emergency Services, to improve the quality of service and to address issues of accessibility. The MEL set out the criteria which the successful proposals should address and stated that only those proposals which successfully met the criteria would receive funding. The criteria were:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>1. Funding would only be available for the capital costs and trusts and health boards had to agree to meet consequent revenue effects;<br />
              2. Bids had to be consistent with the recommendations for the development of emergency services outlined in the Acute Services Review, and with local strategies for the management of emergencies;<br />
              3. An inter-relationship between NHS Direct pilots, telemedicine and accident and emergency investments were welcomed, although developments had to be flexible enough to cope with the different time frames;<br />
              4. Proposals had to address the redesign agenda set out in the White Paper &quot;<em>Designed to Care</em>&quot; and define new ways of working and caring for patients, and<br />
              5. Successful proposals had to outline the opportunities for joint working between primary care, accident and emergency and other secondary care services.</p>

  <p>The information requested is shown in the table.</p>

  <p>Since 2004, Information Services Division (ISD) has collected data on a national basis comprising an out-patient waiting list. This is a monthly census which includes information on all patients waiting to be seen at consultant-led out-patient clinics, following referral by a General Medical or Dental Practitioner. The first census data published was the out-patient waiting list on 30 September 2004, and over the ensuing months, ISD worked, and continues to work, closely with NHS boards to improve data quality.</p>

  <p>In the first few months following the first publication, many clinics did not have computerised waiting lists, and some NHS board areas submitted manual aggregate counts for some specialties that did not record availability status codes. Two NHS boards were not able to submit any data. Although data quality has now improved considerably, monthly comparison of outpatients with availability status codes must be undertaken with caution.</p>

  <p>Although the percentage of patients on the waiting list with availability status codes has increased slightly between 30 September 2004 and 31 December 2005, it is important to note that the total number of patients on the waiting list has reduced dramatically in this period - by 29%.</p>

  <p>Availability Status Codes for first out-patient appointments are all patient-driven - patients who declined a reasonable offer of an appointment and patients who did not attend for a pre-arranged appointment and gave no warning of their non-attendance.</p>

  <p>Fertility rates are largely a product of personal choice and are not primarily a matter for the Executive. Scotland&rsquo;s total fertility rate has been falling relative to other parts of the United Kingdom, although remains slightly above the EU average. Despite this downward trend over the past two decades in Scotland, it is difficult to predict future fertility levels due to the complex factors which influence fertility decline</p>

  <p>There are many social and environmental factors which influence successful conception, such as female bodyweight, smoking, alcohol, drug misuse and sexually transmitted diseases. Also, the widespread use of contraception amongst sexually active people, alongside social choices to have smaller families or to have no children, mean that less children are being born than in the past.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to an on-going programme of both health and sexual health improvement and the promotion of informed lifestyle choices. Longer term labour market considerations continue to be addressed through initiatives such as Fresh Talent.</p>

  <p>The Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route will connect existing and proposed park and ride sites around the city. Removal of through traffic and reduction of traffic on city streets will allow the reallocation of road space to buses and cyclists and make bus journeys particularly on radial routes much more reliable.

  <p>Outline programme information is available on the Transport Scotland website: <a href="http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.transportscotland.gov.uk</a> .</p>

  <p>Following my announcement of the preferred route on 1 December detailed engineering and environmental work is now underway with the aim of narrowing down the road corridor in April and then publishing a draft special road scheme setting out the line proposed for the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route (AWPR) and link to Stonehaven this is part of the AWPR, and an Environmental Statement at the end of 2006. Other road orders and a CPO will follow.</p>

  <p>I would expect a Public Local Inquiry to be held towards the end of 2007. Following the Reporter&rsquo;s recommendations, if it is then decided to proceed with the scheme, line orders and compulsory purchase orders would be expected to be made in 2008. Settlement of compensation claims for land acquired would normally follow the making of these orders.</p>

  <p>Subject to the satisfactory completion of these procedures the earliest start for construction is 2009 with the road opening to traffic late 2011.</p>

  <p>Upgrading the road through these settlements raises a number of difficulties along the route including the number of existing accesses and the space available for widening.</p>

  <p>At 1 February 2006, 3,068 registered sex offenders were recorded by the Scottish Criminal Record Office as being administered by Scottish Police Forces. This information is now available on the Scottish Criminal Record Office&rsquo;s Publication Scheme found at: <a href="http://www.scro.police.uk/foi/?id=28" target="_blank">http://www.scro.police.uk/foi/?id=28</a> .</p>

  <p>The period of time an individual is subject to the registration requirements is held on ViSOR (Violent Offender and Sex Offender Register), the IT database which enables the police to share information and intelligence on registered and unregistered sex offenders, violent offenders, dangerous offenders and potentially dangerous persons. The publication or release of information held on ViSOR is a matter for police forces individually and collectively to consider.</p>

  <p>The Forth Estuary Transport Authority (FETA) was created to oversee the operation, management and maintenance of the Forth Road Bridge and has a wider scope of responsibility than the former joint board. FETA was given these wider powers, including the powers to promote road user charging schemes, to allow it to prepare and implement a strategy for transportation.</p>

  <p>The Executive will not be in a position to make an announcement on the need for a replacement crossing of the Forth until the Forth Estuary Transport Authority has concluded a number of concurrent technical investigations and the Executive has completed its early considerations for a replacement crossing as part of the strategic projects review. The scope and form of any such replacement crossing, its cost and funding mechanism will not be determined until later in the process.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p><em>Futurebuilders Scotland</em> provides funding to support the development of a stronger social economy to deliver more and better public services for people in disadvantaged neighbourhoods or groups. Futurebuilders Scotland is an investment to achieve a step change in the organisation.</p>
</blockquote></p>

  <p>To date the Futurebuilders Scotland Funds have provided grant funding of:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>Investment Fund - 44 approvals for &pound;6,206,660.<br />
              Learning Fund &ndash; 88 approvals for &pound;387,351.<br />
              Seedcorn Fund - 196 approvals for &pound;5,713,749.</p>
</blockquote></p>

  <p>Detailed evaluation will take place over the remaining 18 months of the Futurebuilders Scotland programme. The outputs will include details of how the programme has helped develop the growth of the social economy sector, which includes social enterprises.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it considers that the exemption for petroleum coke from the Waste Incineration Directive provides a possible precedent for a similar exemption for tallow.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-03-15.89.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80011" speakername="Rhona Brankin" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0315.htm#26">

  <p>Petroleum coke is not exempted from the Waste Incineration Directive (WID). Only material which is waste as defined in the Waste Framework Directive (75/442/EEC, as amended) falls to be regulated under WID. The European Court of Justice has decided that where petroleum coke is produced through a deliberate choice in the refining industry and is subsequently certain to be re-used it does not constitute a waste, and consequently falls under neither Directive. If the petroleum coke were to be discarded, however, it would fall under both Directives.</p>

  <p>Tallow, on the other hand, is an inevitable residue of a waste treatment process (i.e. the rendering of animals). Furthermore, the EC Animal By-Products Regulation (1774/2002/EC) specifically requires tallow to be disposed of as waste in accordance with WID. For both these reasons, tallow falls within the meaning of &quot;discard&quot; and is thus waste under the Waste Framework Directive, and therefore within the scope of WID.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-22762 by Cathy Jamieson on 1 March 2006, how it plans to extend secure accommodation by 29 places.</p>

  <p>A shortlist of five current and potential providers selected was selected on 20 December 2002. They were invited to provide more detailed proposals and costs to deliver the 29 place increase and modernise the secure estate overall. Distribution of the additional 29 places was announced on 24 March 2003.</p>

  <p>Glasgow City Council, one of the providers announced at that time, announced on 15 October 2004 their intention to withdraw from the redevelopment of Kerelaw School. The 12 places Kerelaw would have provided will now be provided at the Good Shepherd Centre and at St Phillips.</p>

  <p>When complete by 2007 the secure estate will therefore consist of 125 places, distributed as follows:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>24 mixed at St Philip&rsquo;s (opened 6 March 2006)<br />
              18 girls only at Good Shepherd (due to open June 2006)<br />
              18 boys only at Kibble (due to open spring 2007)<br />
              18 mixed at Rossie (due to be redeveloped by December 2007)<br />
              31 mixed at St Mary&rsquo;s (existing provision)<br />
              12 mixed in Edinburgh (existing provision)<br />
              4 mixed in The Elms (existing provision).</p>
