  <p>Scottish Executive guidance encourages all consultation teams to use a range of consultation methods and to ensure that their exercise is as inclusive as possible. Teams are advised, where appropriate, to involve equality groups in planning their exercise and to seek advice from appropriate organisations on issues such as distribution and format of consultation materials. <em> </em> Individual consultation teams are, however, best placed to decide how to consult on any particular issue, taking account of a full range of factors, such as communication impairments and the nature of the target audience.</p>

  <p>Ardoch Roman fort and annexe are privately owned and are scheduled as monuments of national importance under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979.</p>

  <p>The on-going management of the site is the responsibility of the owner. Historic Scotland has, however, paid grants on several occasions for works to improve the management of the site.</p>

  <p>The most serious and visible management problem at Ardoch is the burrowing of rabbits. Negotiations are currently in progress between Historic Scotland and the owners of the monument over a management agreement aimed at reducing rabbit numbers on the northern half of the site. This would run in conjunction with a programme of archaeological management on the southern half of the site under the Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department&rsquo;s Rural Stewardship Scheme.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, the Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has taken action on a number of fronts to help to improve energy efficiency in dwellings, including insulating almost 200,000 homes through the Warm Deal Programme and installing central heating and insulation in over 41,000 homes through the central heating programme. The Scottish House Condition Survey 2002 shows that the number in fuel poverty had more than halved to 13% since the last report in 1996. The Scottish Housing Quality Standard aims to provide additional energy efficient measures, where technically feasible, to achieve a minimum National Home Energy Rating rating of five or Standard Assessment Procedure rating of 50.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, the Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Individual local authorities were asked to submit their initial Home Energy Conservation Act (HECA) strategies to the then Secretary of State by the end of 1997. The initial HECA strategies that included local authorities target improvements in energy efficiency are used as the baseline to monitor the impact of HECA. The Scottish Housing Quality Standard provides guidance on desired energy efficiency ratings.</p>

  <p>There are no current plans to introduce mandatory targets.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what criteria require to be met prior to any proposed loss of green space in urban areas being referred to the Executive.</p>

  <p>The extent of any Executive involvement in such matters will depend on issues such as the nature of the project leading to the loss of such space, any formal designation on the site and the particular consent procedures involved.</p>

  <p>To take the planning system as an example, planning procedures do not contain a specific requirement for planning authorities to notify the Executive of planning applications involving loss of green space in urban areas.</p>

  <p>However, there are a number of categories of proposal where notification of the Scottish ministers is required, and within which applications for development of such open space might fall. For example, applications for development on playing fields where <strong></strong>sportscotland have advised against granting planning permission or applications where development is contrary to an approved structure plan because the land involved is designated green belt.</p>

  <p>Details of these notification requirements are contained in the <em>Town and Country</em> <em>Planning (Notification of Applications) (Scotland) Direction 1997</em>, as amended. A copy of this direction is contained in Circular 4/1997: Notification of Applications, which is available in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 33972).</p>

  <p>Details of some of the amendments to the 1997 Direction which may be of interest in this context can be found in:</p>

  <p><em>Circular 43/1997: The Town and Country Planning (Notification of Applications) (Scotland) Amendment Direction 1997 </em>(Bib. number 33973)</p>

  <p><em>Circular 15/1998: The Town and Country Planning (Notification of Applications) (Scotland) Amendment Direction 1998 </em>(Bib. number 33974)</p>

  <p>Notification of a planning application to the Scottish ministers allows them to consider whether or not the application should be called-in for their determination.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>All offenders with a substance misuse problem will be assessed on admission and referred to SPS Addiction Services. All substance misusing offenders have an opportunity to participate in transitional care where they have up to 12 weeks support in the community post release with housing, access to a GP and harm reduction information. For prisoners serving less than 31 days, this has been further enhanced with the introduction of crisis transitional care. Crisis being the limited time to liaise, refer and work with offenders whilst in prison.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Yes. The exemptions under which the SPS withheld information from the published version of the contract are subject to a public interest test. The SPS concluded that the harm likely to arise from the publication of the withheld information outweighed the public interest in releasing the information.</p>

  <p>The appeal allowed was within Dumfries and Galloway at Carlesgill Hill, Langholm (case referenced (1) in the table). Planning permission had been granted in 1996 for the erection of five wind turbines with a total capacity of 1.5 MW. The appeal was against the refusal of Dumfries and Galloway Council to vary a condition on that permission, the effect of which would have been to permit an increased size for the towers and rotor blades, giving an overall height of 53.5m compared to the 44m permitted in 1996. The capacity of the proposed new turbines was not specified in the appeal. In allowing the appeal the Reporter concluded that the larger turbines would not contravene the relevant provisions of the Dumfries and Galloway Structure plan; that support for the variation was to be found in National Planning Policy Guidance 6 Renewable Energy; that in static mode the higher turbines would not significantly increase the dominance of the wind farm, and that the slower speed of the larger turbines would outweigh the adverse landscape impact.</p>

  <p>The case at Carlesgill Hill in Dumfries and Galloway (referenced (2) in the table) proposed three wind turbines, with an overall height of 99.5m. Capacity was not specified in the proposal, but details of two possible examples of turbines were provided for the appeal, with capacities of 1.75MW and 2.0MW respectively.</p>

  <p>The case at Carlesgill Hill in Dumfries and Galloway (referenced (3) in the table) related to the same condition of the 1996 planning permission which was the subject of case (1). The effect of the proposal would be the erection of five turbines with an overall height of 99.5m. As with Case (2), capacity was not specified in the proposal, but details of two possible examples of turbines were provided for the appeal, with capacities of 1.75MW and 2.0MW respectively.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, following reports in <em>The Herald</em> on 17 September 2004, what its policy is in respect of the costs of landslide prevention and maintenance of land prone to landslide that is adjacent to adopted roads including trunk roads and, in particular, whether it will meet any costs incurred by landowners in this regard and, if so, which costs and on what basis.</p>

  <p>Following the major landslips which occurred during August 2004, the Executive has commissioned a study to consider the whole impact of landslips on trunk roads in Scotland. Part of the study will review what mitigation measures might be possible and will also consider the implications of such mitigation measures including the responsibilities and potential liabilities of landowners.</p>

  <p>Until the findings of the study have been reported, it is too early to indicate what the financial implications of any mitigation measures might be and where the responsibility for implementing such measures might lie.</p>

  <p>Local authorities have a general duty to deal with emergencies such as flooding, and there is no automatic entitlement to special assistance. In exceptional circumstances, authorities can apply under the Bellwin Scheme for emergency assistance to meet any undue financial burden. The Bellwin Scheme was activated following the recent landslips and any claims for eligible expenditure will be considered by the Scottish Executive when they are received.</p>
