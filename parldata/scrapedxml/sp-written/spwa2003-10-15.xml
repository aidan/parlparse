  <p>The development of a new direct transatlantic route serving Scotland represents a significant enhancement in Scotland&#8217;s business and tourism links with the United States. It also reduces the miles travelled by putting travellers direct to their destination without the need to travel to a hub airport.</p>

  <p>The Edinburgh to New York service is complementary to the current Glasgow service.</p>

  <p>Procurators fiscal receive in the region of 300,000 reports annually from the police and over fifty specialist reporting agencies. Around 35,000 of those are from specialist reporting agencies, the majority of whom do not yet report cases electronically. To obtain this data would require, in addition to writing a programme to interrogate the system, a significant amount of manual checking and interpretation of data. Consequently, it would only be possible to provide the information requested at disproportionate cost.</p>

  <p>The information requested related to only one reporting agency and involved 22 reports. An exact figure cannot be provided, but it is estimated that the staff costs to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service of searching for, retrieving, checking and presenting the data requested was in the region of &#163;400. The data was also checked by HM Customs and Excise Staff against their records.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is in regular contact with the UK Government on a wide range of issues, including regional pay. Responsibility for public sector pay is a devolved matter (with the exception of the civil service in Scotland) and it will be for the Scottish Executive to decide what is appropriate in our circumstances.</p>

  <p>The consultation on the proposed new transport agency and regional transport partnerships will continue until 17 December. The consultation paper <em>Scotland&#8217;s Transport, Proposals for a New Approach to Transport in Scotland</em> is available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre, from the Scottish Executive and on the Scottish Executive website. It is important that as many individuals and organisations as possible with an interest in improving transport delivery in Scotland - including appropriate trade unions - contribute to the consultation. I had a useful discussion with the Scottish Trades Union Congress on a range of transport issues including the proposed strategic transport authority on 4 September.</p>
