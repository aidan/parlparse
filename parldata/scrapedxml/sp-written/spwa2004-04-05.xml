  <p>I have today published a consultation document, <em>Family Matters: Improving Family Law in Scotland</em> . Copies of the consultation document are available in the Parliament's Reference Centre. This consultation deals, among others, with issues of great significance for children and those who care for them. We will be seeking views from a wide range of stakeholders, organisations and individuals on our proposals.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive when it will publish the review of the livestock improvement scheme and what plans it has for the continuation and improvement of the scheme.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2004-04-05.3.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80128" speakername="Allan Wilson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-04/wa0405.htm#3">

  <p>In their present forms, the Crofting Counties Agricultural Grants Scheme and the support for livestock improvement have been in place for a long time. We recognise that there are opportunities to refocus crofting support to provide better value for money. That is why the Crofters Commission has consulted comprehensively on the future of these crofting support schemes.</p>

  <p>I have considered the future of crofting support in the light of the responses to that consultation and, in the case of livestock improvement, I have also considered an extensive and detailed evaluation of these schemes, conducted by the Scottish Agricultural College.</p>

  <p>Significant elements of the proposals on which we consulted require primary legislation before they can be implemented but I believe that some of the changes that can be made without primary legislation should be made as soon as possible. I believe that these changes will enhance effectiveness, efficiency and value for money and modernise crofting support arrangements.</p>

  <p>I propose to modify the Crofting Counties Agricultural Grant Scheme to provide that all support will be subject to approval of an application. I also plan to increase the maximum limit on eligible expenditure over a two year period to &pound;50,000 for individuals and &pound;125,000 for eligible groups. In addition I aim to increase standard costs rates to bring them into line with those under the Agricultural Business Development Scheme and introduce new arrangements to deal fairly with applicants and control spending where demand for grants exceeds the scheme budget. However, alongside these improvements, grants rates need to be brought into line with those in other capital grant schemes. So grant rates over 50% of costs will no longer be available.</p>

  <p>On livestock improvement, I propose to continue support for the improvement of cattle stocks and intend to replace the current Bull Hire Scheme with a new grant scheme to be developed over the next few months and to come into operation as soon as possible. In this connection a study will be undertaken to establish whether the stud farm operation at Inverness can be reorganised so that it can play a viable role in the new scheme. I propose to close the Ram Purchase Scheme and the Shetland Ram Scheme forthwith. However, in connection with the former we will explore the possibility of providing training in ram selection and purchase, including a mentoring visit to a sale, if there is a demand for such assistance.</p>

  <p>In all cases current commitments will be honoured. These will be interim measures and will remain in place until plans for a comprehensive crofting development programme can be finalised and legislation to enable the Crofters Commission to run such a scheme can be enacted.</p>

  <p>Copies of the report on the evaluation of the Livestock Improvements Schemes and of a summary of the responses to the consultation on the proposals for the crofting development programme have been placed in the Parliament's Reference Centre (Bib. numbers 32087 and 32088). The responses to the consultation are available for inspection at the Crofters Commission, Castle Wynd, Inverness, IV2 3EQ.</p>
