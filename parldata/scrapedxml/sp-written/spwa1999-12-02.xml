  <p>During the current financial year, 850 applications for grant assistance under the Agricultural Business Improvement Scheme (ABIS) have been approved. The outstanding applications are being assessed in accordance with my announcement on 16 November that, subject to the Scheme&#8217;s rules, applications would be approved for: resource audits; information technology; alternative agricultural production; mobile sheep fanks and dippers; and self-standing systems for the storage and disposal of farm waste. The remaining financial provision for ABIS will be fully committed by 31 December 1999.</p>

  <p>The information required to provide this comparison is not held centrally. However, I refer you to a letter that I sent to Fergus Ewing MSP on 30 June 1999, a copy of which I have placed in the Information Centre of the Scottish Parliament. It sets out clearly why I believe a straightforward comparison of public and private sector borrowing rates is inappropriate.</p>

  <p>Information on the percentage of GP practices offering specialist Asthma clinics is not held centrally. However, many practices are involved in Chronic Disease Management Programmes for Asthma where the practice can receive a payment for providing an organised programme for the care of patients with Asthma. Programmes have to provide specific services, such as education of newly diagnosed patients, regular review of the patient etc, and have to be approved by the Primary Care Trust. The percentage of practices which receive payments for such programmes are shown in the attached table.</p>

  <p>It is for North Glasgow University Hospitals NHS Trust to decide which services should be provided at the proposed Ambulatory Care and Diagnostic Centre (ACAD) at Stobhill Hospital.</p>

  <p>I understand, however, that the request from Marie Curie to have access to the proposed ACAD came after the original design was developed. The original design had some extra space available and it was suggested that space might be made available to Marie Curie. The original design was rejected by Greater Glasgow Health Board and redesign work is continuing. At no time was accommodation for Marie Curie part of the formal consideration of space required for the ACAD.</p>

  <p>The Marie Curie services will continue to be provided from their existing location.</p>

  <p>Young people&#8217;s active participation in decisions affecting their lives and interests is central to our Action Programme for Youth on which we are working with local authorities and the voluntary sector. I have seen several examples of this in practice and commend it to all councils and voluntary organisations. <br /></p>
