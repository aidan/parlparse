  <p>Due to the extremely positive response from employers, Skills Development Scotland closed the Apprenticeship Grant Scheme to new applications on 5 February.</p>

  <p>At close of business on 10 February 2010 Skills Development Scotland had received 1,115 applications from employers to receive the Apprenticeship Grant. At that stage, 678 of these applications had been approved by Skills Development Scotland, providing support for 2,260 individual apprentices. The remaining applications were still being processed by Skills Development Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government along with others across the public sector continue to support the traditional arts industry throughout Scotland. The Scottish Arts Council, as the main funding body for the arts in Scotland, supports a variety of traditional arts organisations through its foundation, project and flexible funding arrangements. It also provides support for individual traditional artists through creative and professional development funding. In future Creative Scotland will assume this role. The Traditional Arts Working Group has recently published its report providing recommendations for the future public sector support of the traditional arts in Scotland. The Scottish Government has welcomed the report and will be responding in full to the recommendations later this year. The report is published at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2010/01/28100441/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2010/01/28100441/0</a> .</p>

  <p>The approach taken by community learning and development (CLD) staff and their skill set align closely with those needed for Curriculum for Excellence. CLD is represented on the Curriculum for Excellence (CfE) Management Board by Duncan Simpson, Chair of the CLD Standards Council.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is currently encouraging the development of the CLD workforce in all settings and sectors through the establishment of the CLD Standards Council and the CLD workforce Up-skilling Programme. This programme is supporting local employers, through CLD Partnerships across Scotland, to produce workforce development strategies and widen Continuing Professional Development (CPD) opportunities. This will support employers in their responsibility to ensure that staff have the skills and training they need, including a focus on how they can contribute to CfE.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what assessment it has made of the finding of the <em>2008-09 Scottish Crime and Justice Survey: Drug Use</em> that the reported use of cocaine had increased between 2006 and 2008-09 among adults aged 16 to 59 and what action it plans to take.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-02-24.S3W-31337.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80306" speakername="Fergus Ewing" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa0224.htm#7">

  <p>The 2008-09 Scottish Crime and Justice Survey: Drug Use found that reported use of cocaine amongst adults aged 16 to 59 years in the year prior to survey remained stable in 2006 and 2008-09 (3.7% in both 2006 and 2008-09). That said even though the rate has remained stable it remains too high and the Scottish Government is not complacent about cocaine use in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Educating Scots about the risk and harms of drug misuse in a way that is relevant and meaningful to them is key. Know the Score - our drug prevention campaign - has been both successful and innovative through it&rsquo;s website, helpline and cocaine awareness weekends, in ensuring that people are aware of and understand the risks and dangers in taking these drugs, presenting it in a factual, non-glamorising and credible way.</p>

  <p>On 22 January 2010, I launched the latest &quot;Know the Score&quot; campaign highlighting the dangers of Cocaine. This campaign raises awareness of the risks associated with cocaine such as increased heart rate, chest pains, paranoia and stroke. The campaign highlights these messages through cinema advertisement, spotify ads, outdoor media and online support to dispel the myth that cocaine is a &quot;safe party drug&quot;.</p>

  <p>We also continue to support the Scottish Police Service in their efforts to disrupt drug dealing and organised crime groups by investing in policing and have set up the Serious Organised Crime (SOC) Taskforce. In June 2008 the SOC Taskforce published a national strategy <em>Letting Our Communities Flourish</em>. This new Strategy has been supported with a major boost of around &pound;4 million over two years to the SCDEA budget, which will be used to recruit around 80 new specialist police officers and civilian staff.</p>

  <p>Skills Development Scotland has been tasked to work with training providers to ensure that all provision enables young people undertaking a national training programme to develop the four capacities of Curriculum for Excellence.</p>

  <p>Key documents have been sent to employer organisations and employers have been involved in Curriculum for Excellence support events. For example, five support events for Building the Curriculum 4 are planned for March 2010, and will involve local employers working with schools, as well as representation from Chambers of Commerce, the Support Training Action Group (STAG) and Scottish Training Federation (STF).</p>

  <p>STAG and STF are also involved in national training programmes linking with enterprise in education. Determined to Succeed (the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Enterprise in Education strategy) has worked in partnership with Skills Development Scotland, the Scottish Training Federation and the Scottish Training Action Group to identify appropriate support for their members to promote understanding of enterprising approaches to delivery of Curriculum for Excellence and the effectiveness of such approaches in securing positive outcomes for learners.</p>

  <p>As part of the Employer Engagement strand of Determined to Succeed, local authorities have been supported to undertake work directly with work based learning providers, enabling them to address and engage with developments in education including Curriculum for Excellence.</p>

  <p>EEBL (Enterprise in Education Business Links) teacher placement in business also provides opportunities for sharing and joint development opportunities around Curriculum for Excellence.</p>

  <p>Under its plans to provide greater information on government expenditure the Scottish Government has committed to publish online all items of expenditure above &pound;25,000. This scheme will commence with the publication of our expenditure for April 2010 and will continue on a monthly basis thereafter.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government provides information about its capital programme annually in the Draft Budget, over a three year horizon through the Scottish Spending Review, and over a ten year horizon through the Infrastructure Investment Plan. The Government&rsquo;s regular reports to the Public Audit Committee set out the planned expenditure profile and timescale for major capital projects which we are taking forward.</p>

  <p>The per capita spend is calculated on the basis of the total spend by each of the boards in 2008-09 including elements of non-recurring funding.</p>

  <p>The bulk of funding made available to NHS boards is allocated on the basis of formula. The formula assesses each NHS board&rsquo;s relative need for funding using information about its population size and characteristics that influence the need for healthcare in terms of hospital services, community services and GP prescribing. To prevent turbulence, the move to formula target shares is being phased in over a number of years to ensure that no NHS board loses out. In 2008-09, NHS Shetland and NHS Western Isles received baseline allocations which were above their formula target shares and NHS Orkney received a baseline allocation below its formula target share.</p>

  <p>The variations between the boards&rsquo; per capita spend reflects the relative healthcare needs of each board&rsquo;s resident population under the allocation formula, each board&rsquo;s current allocation of funds relative to its formula target allocation and the impact of the inclusion of elements of non-recurring funding.</p>

  <p>We have already established a Psychological Therapies Group (PTG) to administer the implementation of the advice in <em>The Matri</em>x - a tool for NHS boards to use in reviewing available evidence and in considering which psychological interventions might best be used to meet local need and demand. Recently formed sub-groups of the PTG oversee <em>The Matrix</em>&rsquo;s continuous updating and expansion into other key priority areas in mental health.</p>

  <p>NES is working to increase the provision of training in evidence based interventions which are effective for depression (at both certificate and diploma level) such as CBT and other therapies, as well as funding Psychological Therapies Training Co-ordinator posts in boards to provide the educational infrastructure necessary to ensure training and supervision are well organised, sustainable and have maximum service impact.</p>

  <p>The highest number of these admissions are of young males aged 15 and over where admissions to adult wards are usually for short periods at times of crisis where there are concerns about the safety of the person. In some cases it will also be the case that admission to an adult facility is judged by clinicians to be the most appropriate setting for the young person, taking account of their needs and safety and the safety of others. The small increase in 2008 is also likely to be in part as a result of the closure of the inpatient facility for young people in Gartnavel Royal Hospital and the opening of the new facility in Skye House as for a transition period admissions were redirected to adult facilities. We expect to see improvement in 2009-10 figures.</p>

  <p>Before a medicine can receive a marketing authorisation (licence) in the UK, the manufacturer must submit supporting data to the MHRA or the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) demonstrating that the quality, safety and efficacy of the product are satisfactory for its intended use. The decision to seek a marketing authorisation is a commercial decision for the manufacturer.</p>

  <p>However, there is provision in both UK and European legislation which allow doctors, on their own direct personal responsibility, to prescribe a medicinal product specially prepared and for administration to a particular patient to meet a special clinical need. It is possible for a pharmaceutical company to produce LDN formulations to supply pharmacists, at the request of a doctor, for use by an individual on a &quot;named patient&quot; basis. This would be a matter for the individual patient and their doctor to discuss and consider whether the use of LDN is appropriate for their particular clinical need.</p>

  <p>In 2005, the Scottish Government and the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) co-funded Scotland&rsquo;s Demography Research Programme, which was also supported by the General Register Office for Scotland (GROS). The programme aimed to develop greater understanding of the key aspects of fertility, migration and ageing to inform the evidence base on demographic issues in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The programme was completed in 2007 and the research outputs were published on the Scottish Government website:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Research/by-topic/public-services-and-gvt/Demography-Research-Prog" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Research/by-topic/public-services-and-gvt/Demography-Research-Prog</a>.</p>

  <p>This included research by Strathclyde University on the Macroeconomic Impacts of Demographic Change in Scotland, and research by Stirling University on Scotland&rsquo;s Ageing Population. Following this, GROS and the Scottish Government commissioned Strathclyde University to update their analysis to incorporate the 2006-based population projections. This analysis was published on the Scottish Government website in August 2008:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Research/by-topic/public-services-and-gvt/Demography-Research-Prog/Macroeconomic-Impacts" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Research/by-topic/public-services-and-gvt/Demography-Research-Prog/Macroeconomic-Impacts</a>.</p>

  <p>The General Register Office for Scotland (GROS) has also produced analysis which considers potential changes to the composition of Scotland&rsquo;s population using the most recent population projections. In October 2009, GROS produced a paper providing a detailed analysis of the 2008-based population projections for Scotland:</p>
