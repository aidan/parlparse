  <p>Since these applications were recorded, the Executive has established the Homelessness Task Force, which I chair, to consider the causes of homelessness and to make recommendations on improving legislation and services. We have already accepted the interim recommendations of the task force for changes to the homelessness legislation to increase the duties of local authorities and registered social landlords towards homeless people, and to increase the rights of homeless people under the legislation. These amendments will be taken forward in the forthcoming Housing Bill.</p>

  <p>We have also increased funding for the Rough Sleepers Initiative to &pound;40 million in the period 1997 to 2002, and have provided additional funding this year to stop the inappropriate use of bed and breakfast as temporary accommodation.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will ensure that the aim of reducing suicides is not undermined by any shortage of resources in health boards and social work departments.</p>

  <p>Any resource implications that arise from Scottish Executive policies on suicide prevention will be identified and acted upon. Indeed, the <i>Framework for Mental Health Services in Scotland</i> , published in 1997, which offers best practice in the organisation of care and preventative measures, already recognises the isolation that can lead to suicide attempts and encourages health boards and their partner care agencies to organise appropriate services to match needs, for example, programmes of assertive outreach that ensure continuing contact with those considered at risk. We remain determined to tackle suicide through both specific and general measures.</p>

  <p>However, health boards and social work departments are not the only agents involved in achieving a reduction in the number of suicides in Scotland. An individual&#8217;s decision to commit suicide is dependent on a large number of social, economic, personal, and psychological factors. The Scottish Executive agenda to improve the health and wellbeing of the people of Scotland is intended to tackle such factors and to reduce this tragic loss of life.</p>

  <p>Twenty-six bids have been made to the third round of the Public Transport Fund for projects commencing in 2001-02. The projects are listed in the table below.</p>

  <p>The size and nature of the projects varies markedly. Some of the relatively small projects have not provided a detailed analysis of all the elements needed to estimate the Net Present Value (NPV) of the project. The economic appraisal (and hence the NPV) is only one of the criteria the Executive takes into account when assessing bids to the Public Transport Fund. The assessment considers each bid against the Government&#8217;s five criteria of economy, integration, safety, accessibility and the environmental impacts.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not hold information on the cost of the bus infrastructure part of the CERT scheme which is the responsibility of the City of Edinburgh Council as the local roads authority. Capital allocations of &pound;15 million have been made available from the Transport Challenge Fund and the council is also seeking private finance for the project which is estimated to cost &pound;49 million.</p>

  <p>The CERT guided busway is about nine kilometres in length.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has identified funding of &pound;9 million in 1999-2000 and &pound;14 million in the current year to support the Sure Start Scotland initiative. This funding has been allocated to local authorities. Guidance issued by the Scottish Executive asks local authorities to involve voluntary organisations with relevant expertise in both the planning and delivery of services that will best meet local needs.</p>

  <p>Under the terms of the <i>Memorandum of Understanding</i> between the two bodies, the Holyrood Progress Group is required to provide the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body with detailed monthly reports on progress and expenditure. The latest cost estimates and the value of let contracts are included in the reports as would be the outcome of any &quot;risk assessment&quot; or &quot;value management&quot; exercises.

  <p>The Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body regards details of the amount of fees paid to professional consultants as commercially confidential since the publication of such information could prejudice consultants&#8217; legitimate commercial interests and impede fair competition between them and their competitors. Disclosure would be in breach of the individual tender agreements and could not be made without the agreement of the firms involved. The Spencely report correctly treated the individual fee amounts as commercially confidential, whilst indicating a total figure for professional fees.</p>
