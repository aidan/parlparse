  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the average agri-environment payment was per hectare of utilisable agricultural land for the last year for which figures are available and what comparative information it has for (a) England, (b) Wales, (c) Northern Ireland and (d) the European Union as a whole.</p>

  <p>The average agri-environment payment in Scotland in 2005 per hectare of utilisable agricultural land was &pound;3.02. The comparable figures for (a) England, (b) Wales, (c) Northern Ireland and (d) the European Union as a whole are (a) &pound;21.31, (b) &pound;33.22, (c) &pound;10.00 and (d) &pound;11.43*. One of the significant factors underlying the wide variation in figures for payments per hectare of utilisable agricultural land between different countries in the EU is the significant variation in the intensity of agricultural utilisation; average levels of payment per agricultural holding show much less variation.</p>

  <p>Note: *The EU figure relates to 2001, the most recent year for which information is available.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is absolutely committed to improving the life chances of all Scots and tackling the poverty and disadvantage which far too many Scots suffer.</p>

  <p>We are committed to sharing the UK Government&rsquo;s long-term target to eradicate child poverty by 2020. We are aware that poverty is about more than a lack of decent income. It is also about ill health, educational achievement, access to services, and maximising opportunities in the labour market for parents. Policies across the Scottish Government are working on all these areas and we will continue to work to maximise the impact these have and ensure they are effectively joined-up at national and local level.</p>

  <p>We are currently reviewing existing policy commitments in this area and will make clear what our priorities are in the coming months. However, by developing policies that reflect our overarching strategic principles of making Scotland a Wealthier and Fairer, Healthier, Safer, Smarter and Greener nation, we will be taking meaningful steps towards tackling child poverty.</p>

  <p>Under the previous administration, the management arrangements governing fishing quotas have been under review for some time as part of a joint UK Quota Management Change Programme (QMCP).</p>

  <p>I have asked my officials as a matter of urgency to review progress and provide advice on the best route forward to serve Scottish interests, including meeting the needs of active fishermen and fishing communities. The role of producer organisations - an intrinsic aspect of fisheries management in Scotland - will also be considered.</p>

  <p>I recognise the need to balance environmental and economic sustainability of fishing activities. Within Europe, Scottish fishermen have been at the forefront of developing fishing techniques which reduce the impact of fishing. I will engage with fishermen, fishing communities and environmental bodies on any further measures the sector might take, in particular developing long-term management plans to secure the sustainability of stocks.</p>

  <p>The introduction of car parking charging, or revision of existing arrangements, is a matter for NHS boards in light of local circumstances. Car parking charging should not be introduced as a means of generating income but may be justified if the income generated is used by the board to cover any significant costs in providing parking facilities (e.g. capital charges, maintenance costs, administration costs, security costs, security lighting, CCTV); to cover the cost of providing new or improved parking facilities or making existing facilities more secure; or to better manage car parking facilities by discouraging unauthorised users (e.g. fly-parkers) but in so doing, measures taken to discourage unauthorised users must not be detrimental to the car parking arrangements for staff, patients, carers and visitors.</p>

  <p>In all cases charges should reflect a reasonable balance between the perceived needs of staff, patients and visitors, the general cost of car parking in the area, and the costs of maintaining car parking facilities.</p>

  <p>NHS boards must be able to demonstrate the level of income generated from car parking and how it has been utilised. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has confirmed that income from the charges imposed would be pooled across the hospital sites and used exclusively to fund improvements to parking, transport and traffic management.</p>

  <p>NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde is to negotiate with the public transport providers for new or extended services and provide public transport information on-site, both paper based or electronic. It also intends to provide information on sustainable transport options given and information on existing shuttle bus services currently in operation.</p>

  <p>The introduction of the Car Parking policy by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS board will see the creation of 350 new jobs and the new income will be invested in ambitious environmentally friendly transport solutions to tempt more staff out of their cars including:</p>

  <p>Interest free instalment plan to buy Strathclyde Passenger Transport Zone Cards.</p>

  <p>Develop managed staff car share schemes.</p>

  <p>Introduction of expanded hospital pool-car scheme.</p>

  <p>Develop inter-hospital staff shuttle bus service.</p>

  <p>Interest free bike loans.</p>

  <p>We have established new workforce planning arrangements in Scotland to help match the supply of staff to the workforce demand from NHS boards. Board plans published in April 2007 provide staffing projections for all staff groups to deliver their planned patient services. Early analysis of the board plans gives no indication of demand for sonographers exceeding supply. However, NHS Education for Scotland continues to support improvements and increased learning opportunities for sonographers.</p>

  <p>I have had an introductory meeting with Julia Bracewell (Chair) and Stewart Harris (Chief Executive) of sportscotland at which I confirmed that there would be no decisions on the future of sportscotland without a full appreciation of the facts and that the future of sportscotland would be considered within the context of the wider review of public bodies announced by the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth on 24 May 2007.</p>

  <p>Sportscotland is the distributor of the lottery sports fund in Scotland. If a change of status meant that sportscotland no longer existed then arrangements would need to be made to consider which other organisation could best fulfil this role.</p>

  <p>However, the Scottish Government will continue to ensure the smooth distribution of lottery funding to sport in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The issue of any change in the status of sportscotland has no bearing on the building of the National Indoor Sports Arena.</p>

  <p>The building of the National Indoor Sports Arena will be undertaken as part of the National Regional Sports Facility Strategy, and will not be affected by any decisions taken in relation to the status of sportscotland.</p>

  <p>The national audit of GP Practices is not yet complete. However, since the audit began on 8 November 2006 one further GP practice in Grampian and two in Forth Valley have announced that certain vaccines may have been stored at temperatures outside the recommended range. As a result, some patients were offered booster vaccinations.</p>

This bid is currently being assessed for value for money.

  <p>We recognise that a number of areas of the building are lit by less efficient tungsten filament lamps. Replacing these lamps will contribute towards our three year energy reduction target, which is currently on course to be achieved. A start has been made on identifying practical options for replacing lamps in a number of areas. In 2008 a full study will be undertaken to identify where it will be cost effective and feasible to replace lamps with energy saving ones.</p>
