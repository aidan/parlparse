  <p>The Scottish Government recognises the need for increased awareness in this respect and will continue to look for appropriate opportunities to do so. For example, we would propose to cover it in the multi-faceted campaign that is currently being developed in conjunction with Young Scot and other agencies, to raise the awareness, profile and acceptance of the Young Scot National Entitlement Card as a proof of age card.</p>

  <p>Information on the use of pesticides, including insecticides, has been collected and published regularly by the Scottish Agricultural Science Agency (SASA). A comparison can therefore be made of SASA&rsquo;s most recent (2006) findings for cereals with the equivalent figures for 1996. This comparison shows a decrease in the amount of insecticides used, from 7,330kg on the 64,501 hectares of cereals which were treated with insecticides in 1996 to 5,661kg on the 83,905 hectares of cereals which were treated with insecticides in 2006. Each survey is however a snapshot of a particular year, with the amount of insecticide used in any given year depending on factors such as the weather conditions and the disease challenge. There have therefore been increases and decreases within the decade in question, as the following table shows:</p>

  <p>Monitoring of the professional use of agrochemical pesticides in Scotland is carried out by SASA (formerly the Scottish Agricultural Science Agency). Surveys are carried out on a cyclical basis and are synchronised with other surveys covering the whole of the UK. The major arable crops such as cereals, potatoes and oilseed rape are surveyed biennially, and all others such as soft fruit, vegetables, protected crops and hardy nursery stock every four years. Reports are published as hard copy and also on the SASA website at:</p>

  <p>Pesticide products are approved for specific purposes, i.e. to control specified pests, diseases and weeds in particular situations (for example for late blight on potatoes or aphids on broccoli and cabbages). The use of insecticides will therefore depend to a large extent on where crops are grown, the particular crop being treated and the reason for treating the crop. There will therefore be large regional variations in the use of insecticides across Scotland due to the variations in cropping patterns.</p>

  <p>All pesticides are strictly regulated under the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985 and associated regulations. In recent years many older insecticides have been taken off the market following the on-going review of all agrochemical pesticides under Directive 91/414/EEC. It is possible that more pesticide active ingredients will be removed from the market as a result of a revision of that Directive, which revision is currently under discussion in the European Parliament.</p>

  <p>There are no scientific published studies at present which provide any evidence of a causal link between the reduction of the honeybee population in Scotland and the use of insecticides. Insecticides have been used for many years, with a fairly static usage pattern, whereas the fall in bee populations has occurred more recently. The evidence thus far would suggest no specific link between insecticide usage and bee populations.</p>

  <p>Insecticides by their very nature have an impact on target insects, and if used improperly (i.e. not according to label instructions) can affect local bee populations. All agrochemical products have labels which detail the crops, rates of application and conditions under which they can be used, often referred to as Good Agricultural Practice. Detailed risk assessments are carried out on all pesticide active ingredients before a product can be marketed in the UK. Part of this process will assess the risk to beneficial insects such as honeybees prior to approval, and specific conditions may be placed on products which limit how they can be used.</p>

  <p>In addition to the label, all users have to use pesticides according to the Code of Practice for Using Plant Protection Products in Scotland 2006. Section 3.8.5 provides specific details on how to protect bees. For example those pesticides labelled &quot;harmful&quot;, &quot;dangerous&quot;, &quot;extremely dangerous&quot; or &quot;high risk to bees&quot; should not be applied if crops or weeds are in open flower or part bloom, unless this is allowed by the product label.</p>

  <p>A pre-diabetic state is defined as &quot;impaired fasting glucose&quot;, or &quot;impaired glucose tolerance&quot;, and can be diagnosed from an analysis of a patient&rsquo;s glucose levels using either a glucose tolerance test or a fasting glucose test. Insulin testing is not appropriate, for the reasons given to the answer to question S3W-16946 on 5 November 2008.</p>

  <p>The National Screening Committee (NSC) has recommended that population screening for diabetes, including type 2 diabetes, should not be offered as it fails to meet a number of the committee&rsquo;s key criteria. The NSC does however recommend the introduction of a vascular risk management programme, which is consistent with the approach set out in SIGN Guideline 97 on risk estimation and the prevention of cardiovascular disease.</p>

  <p>In line with our commitment to tackling health inequalities, the <em>Keep Well</em> programme, which focuses on cardiovascular disease, including diabetes, provides the opportunity for those aged 45 to 64 living in deprived communities to attend a health check at which they are assessed for the risk or onset of preventable ill health.</p>

  <p>The optimal test for the early identification of diabetes remains uncertain. Insulin is not a reliable indicator, however. People with type 2 diabetes have insulin resistance, which means they may have raised glucose levels in spite of having insulin levels within the range considered to be normal.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Public Health Network has recently been asked by the Scottish Diabetes Group to undertake a needs assessment on diabetes, and that work offers an opportunity to consider the issue of early intervention to prevent the onset of diabetes.</p>

  <p>We recognise the significant value of investing in anticipatory care <em>. Better Health, Better Care</em> commits the Scottish Government to developing programmes such as <em>Keep Well</em> and <em>Well North</em> . Both are targeted at those individuals at high risk of developing serious preventable illness, including type 2 diabetes. Programme interventions include help with making lifestyle changes, as well as medical interventions, to reduce risks and treat any newly detected health conditions.</p>

  <p>There is no treatment that can prevent the onset of type 1 diabetes, but early identification of the condition remains important in order to allow for the prevention of the serious complications which can be associated with it.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government expects NHS boards to ensure that 100% of the population is covered by an optimal reperfusion service, in line with the recommendations in SIGN Guideline 93. Within those arrangements, 71 to 84% of the population are likely to be within 40 minutes&rsquo; travel time of a hospital with a primary PCI service. The variation relates to the time of day and travelling conditions.</p>

  <p>The recommendation in SIGN Guideline 93 is however that when primary PCI cannot be provided within 90 minutes from time of diagnosis, patients with an ST elevation acute coronary syndrome should receive immediate thrombolytic therapy, and it is on that basis that the optimal reperfusion service is being planned. A travel time of 40 minutes therefore needs to be seen as part of an overall patient journey of 90 minutes from time of diagnosis to treatment.</p>

  <p>In allocating the accelerated spend, we will prioritise bringing forward new construction but will also spend on off the shelf units and land acquisitions where this is strategically sensible and offers good value for money. Allocations will be made to projects rather than to specific local authority areas and will be prioritised to:</p>

  <p>housing market areas with shortfalls</p>

  <p>homelessness pressures</p>

  <p>local pressured areas or specific regeneration projects.</p>

  <p>Prosecutors have no targets for the number of prosecutions which should be brought against licence-holders who sell alcohol to intoxicated customers. Decisions to prosecute are taken on a case-by-case basis when reports of such offences are received from the police.</p>

  <p>There are no such recorded figures because only subsections (1) to (3) and (6) of section 105 of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005 are in force. The remaining subsections of section 105 will come into force on 1 September 2009. Until then, transitional arrangements apply and these are set out in sections (3) to (5) of the Licensing (Scotland) Act (Commencement No. 2 and Transitional Provisions) Order 2006.</p>

  <p>A leaflet <em>Alcohol Licensing in your Community</em> is available which sets out information on the key changes, including supporting or objecting the award of a new premises licence, how to take action if there are problems with premises when it is trading, and information on the role of Licensing Standards Officers and Local Licensing Forums. These leaflets have been made available to community councils, Citizens Advice Scotland, and Alcohol Focus Scotland for distribution. In addition, information is available on the infoscotland website.</p>

  <p>We also expect licensed premises to play their part in advising customers, particularly in relation to the hours during which alcohol may be sold if these have changed.</p>

  <p>Guidance is given to prospective personal licence holders as part of the training required by the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005. Before a personal licence can be granted, the applicant must possess a licensing qualification. The training which leads to the award of a qualification includes training in respect of the offences under the act.</p>

  <p>NHS Borders advises me that it provides psychological and psychiatric therapies, as appropriate, and follows national guidance for people with post traumatic stress following service in the armed forces. Current and ex-members of the armed forces are given priority when referred by their GP, in keeping with government guidance. After referral, full assessment takes place with individually tailored interventions and treatment depending on the diagnosis and corresponding care plan.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government contributed fully to the MOD command paper published in summer 2008 and published our commitments paper the same day. Both documents set out the current and future proposals for service personnel care and support. We are now considering the responses to our consultations on Scotland&rsquo;s veterans and forces&rsquo; communities designed to further inform arrangements for assessing, addressing and meeting well-being and welfare needs.</p>

  <p>We continue to work with the MOD and other UK health departments to pilot new community-based models of care that address the particular mental health needs of veterans. For Scotland an innovative mental health pilot designed in partnership with NHS Lothian and Combat Stress will, from early next year, provide a community based walk in &quot;one stop shop&quot; for veterans&rsquo; mental health care in the centre of Edinburgh. This new provision forms part of our ambition to improve and extend the overall quality of services and support for service personnel, their families and for veterans and progress with which will also inform approaches in other areas.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The SPS announced on 22 October 2008 its intention to commence work to identify and acquire a site to replace HM Prison Greenock.</p>

  <p>The characteristics of the existing prison site do not support redevelopment alongside normal prison operations therefore a new site is required.</p>

  <p>HM Prison Inverclyde will replace HM Prison Greenock and the SPS has commenced looking for a potential site for this new prison within or near to the Inverclyde area.</p>

  <p>Funding will be provided to the SPS to build a replacement for HM Prison Greenock on the preferred site identified in this process.</p>

  <p>Information on banks as equity investors in PFI projects, where held, is provided in the following table. The information reflects the position when the original project contracts were signed. Equity investors are able to sell their investment subsequently.</p>

  <p>The major funding for PFI projects is from institutions providing debt finance, many of which are banks. Information on these institutions, where held, can be found on the Scottish Government website under &lsquo;&quot;done deals&quot; at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/ppp" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/ppp</a>. The institutions listed are those at the point of original contract signature. After a project becomes operational, it may be refinanced and funders may change.

  <p>We expect that any application for an offshore wind farm will require an environmental impact assessment (EIA). The EIA should be informed by relevant plans, programmes and strategies for which a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) has been undertaken.

  <p>Local authorities&rsquo; and COSLA&rsquo;s commitment to making school facilities more accessible for community use is already well documented. The Audit Scotland report <em>Improving the School Estate</em> indicated that many schools are providing community access to facilities and new build schools are often designed with community use in mind. The report highlights good practice but also identifies areas for improvement. The Scottish Government and COSLA have jointly accepted all of the recommendations in the report, and have established a Working Group to consider how they should be taken forward in the development of the new School Estate Strategy.</p>

  <p>The Scotland Act 1998 (as amended) sets out the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament and provides for many of the functions of the Scottish ministers. Nothing in the 1998 Act prevents the Scottish Parliament or the Scottish ministers from forming or expressing a view on a reserved matter. This is unsurprising given the relevance of reserved issues to many matters which are, in Scotland, devolved. Moreover, the memorandum of understanding between the UK Government and the devolved administrations, in place since devolution, expressly recognises that devolved legislatures are entitled to debate non-devolved matters.</p>

  <p>We are not aware of any evidence to suggest that restrictions on the display of tobacco displays will lead to an increase in illicit tobacco products. However, the Scottish Government recognises that smuggled or counterfeit tobacco products constitute a serious public health risk by undermining efforts to reduce tobacco consumption. As set out in the Smoking Prevention Action Plan, <em>Scotland&rsquo;s future is Smoke-free</em> , which was published in May 2008 the Scottish Government is committed to collaborating with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs to reduce the impact of illicit sales of tobacco products on Scottish communities. This action will be linked to the proposed new Enhanced Tobacco Sales Enforcement Programme which will be formally launched within the next few months.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is currently developing a full Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) which will examine in detail the risks and benefits of the proposed legislative action. Retailers have been given the opportunity to feed into the RIA. We are, of course, committed to a vibrant small business sector and are doing a great deal to support them. While there can be no compromise on the Scottish Government&rsquo;s goal of protecting children and young people, and the population as a whole, from the misery and distress of cancer, heart disease and other smoking related illness, we are keen to work with retailers on making the implementation process as easy as possible, including exploring ways to keep costs incurred to a minimum.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is currently developing a full Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) which will examine the impact on business of the proposed legislative action. There is no reason to believe that restrictions on displays, which would apply to shops of all sizes, will lead to a shift in trade from small retailers to supermarkets. However, this will be taken into account in the RIA.</p>

  <p>As I made clear in my statement to the Scottish Parliament on 21 May 2008 to launch the Smoking Prevention Action Plan, <em>Scotland&rsquo;s Future is Smoke-free</em> , the Scottish Government believes that a comprehensive and co-ordinated programme of measures is necessary to dissuade children and young people from smoking. Tackling the trade on illicit tobacco products and restricting the display of tobacco products in shops are both important in their own way.</p>

  <p>Future investment in Scotland&rsquo;s nationally strategic transport network is being considered as part of Transport Scotland&rsquo;s Strategic Transport Projects Review (STPR), which will lead to a transport programme targeted at facilitating better movement of people across Scotland to increase wealth and enable more people to share fairly in that wealth.</p>

  <p>STPR will recommend a programme of interventions for delivery beyond the current programme. Funding for interventions will depend upon decisions in future spending reviews and affordability.</p>

  <p>It is preferable for a decision to be made as a family. The law allows a young person under the age of 16 to give consent themselves if a suitably qualified health professional deems they are capable of understanding what is being proposed. This is explained to parents in the HPV Questions and Answers booklet which is issued along with the information leaflet and consent form.</p>

  <p>Procurement of the vaccine was undertaken on a UK wide basis by the Department of Health, as part of a formal EU procurement process. Both vaccines were scored against a number of pre-set scientific and cost effectiveness criteria. These criteria were shared with the manufacturers during the process so that they were fully informed of the criteria against which their bids would be evaluated.</p>

  <p>No. Licensing processes are completely independent of one another. In the UK we only use products that have received a European licence.</p>
