  <p>The Executive welcomes this new study.</p>

  <p>The NRPB, which provides expert advice on these matters, considers that this new report provides no additional scientific evidence to require a change in exposure guidelines.</p>

  <p>That said, the Executive fully supports the report&#8217;s recommendation that the current uncertainty indicates a need for further research. Current research includes a number of Government-funded studies in this country and support for the multi-national Electromagnetic Fields Project set up and co-ordinated by the World Health Organisation. The UK Government will also work with the NRPB to begin new research into the factors that lead to certain households having higher levels of electromagnetic fields.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive fully recognises the seriousness of this disease. The veterinary assessment in Scotland is that all the cases to date are linked. The slaughter and eradication process is working well with cases dealt with promptly as they arise. It is not possible to predict at this stage how many cases will finally emerge. The Executive has daily dialogue on the outbreak with Scottish farming representatives.</p>

  <p>There are no current plans to vaccinate against foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) although supplies of vaccines are of course available.</p>

  <p>The EU does not permit the use of FMD vaccine by member states. Their policy like that of the UK Government and the Scottish Executive is to eradicate the disease through a compulsory slaughter and compensation policy. There is a provision for member states to make a special case for vaccine use where this is considered beneficial on the basis of veterinary advice.</p>

  <p>The use of vaccines is by no means straightforward. Problems can arise where disease is masked and therefore spread. There are also adverse trade implications because other member states and many third countries demand FMD freedom to permit trade in most animals and animal products.</p>

  <p>Checks on imports of meat are agreed at EU level and any changes to these arrangements must be similarly agreed.</p>

  <p>Within the EU all animals are subject to both ante mortem and post mortem veterinary checks at point of slaughter. Meat passed for human consumption is health-marked, at which point it can be freely traded within the EU. This does not apply where restrictions such as those under the current foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) emergency or any other animal health problem are in force.</p>

  <p>Meat coming into the EU from third countries must be slaughtered in an approved premises and enter the EU via a border inspection post. At this point it undergoes 100% identity and documentary checks along with physical checks where these are required. The checks concerned are carried out by official veterinary surgeons. In the event of any disease outbreak in third countries, import bans would be imposed.</p>

  <p>A range of issues arising from the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease will be considered as part of the normal review process once the outbreak is properly contained.</p>

  <p>I understand that the Food Standards Agency are ensuring that food safety checks on imported meat are being stepped up to cope with any increased level of imports resulting from FMD restrictions in the UK.</p>

  <p>sportscotland, on the Scottish Executive&#8217;s behalf, is taking a number of steps to promote football for women and girls.</p>

  <p>In the case of the structure of the women&#8217;s game, these steps include ongoing investment in a Women&#8217;s and Girl&#8217;s Football Co-ordinator as part of the Youth Sport Programme and the provision of a funding package for the setting up of a Women&#8217;s Football Department within the Scottish Football Association (SFA) &#8211; this currently consists of the Scottish National Women&#8217;s Team Coach/Director of Women&#8217;s Football, two Assistant Directors and a Marketing Officer. Funding is also being provided to promote the provision of Partnership Posts in local authority areas and, to date, the employment of four full-time Women&#8217;s Football Development Officers has been agreed with a fifth under discussion. In addition, <strong></strong>sportscotland funds the Executive Administrator&#8217;s post within the Scottish Women&#8217;s Football Association, which has the responsibility for girl&#8217;s and women&#8217;s league football.</p>

  <p>At international level, <strong></strong>sportscotland funds the national squad through the Talented Athlete Programme, while at youth level it works closely with schools through the remit of the Youth Sport Co-ordinator.</p>

  <p><strong></strong>sportscotland also maintains regular dialogue with the SFA about implementation of the Women&#8217;s Football four-year development, now in its second year. In addition to this, I hope to meet with representatives of women&#8217;s football in the near future myself to discuss issues relating to the women&#8217;s game.</p>

  <p><i>The same as you?</i> , our review of services for people with learning disabilities, was well received when published last year.</p>

  <p>Local authorities are acting on many of the report&#8217;s recommendations, using existing resources. I understand they are making progress with, for example:</p>

  <p>joint working;</p>

  <p>alternatives to traditional day opportunities;</p>

  <p>employment opportunities, and</p>

  <p>advocacy schemes.</p>

  <p>In addition, resources of &#163;36 million over three years are available from 1 April 2001 to support implementation of the review.</p>

  <p>Local authorities and their partners are required to submit their first Partnership in Practice agreements to the Executive by June this year. They will be closely monitored.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it intends to introduce legislation to support the maintenance of the moratorium on compulsory competitive tendering.</p>

  <p>Yes.</p>

  <p>Annually the Executive has repeated its commitment to continue a moratorium on Compulsory Competitive Tendering (CCT) in local government until we are ready to introduce legislation to provide a statutory Best Value regime. We are still considering the detail of such legislation, and to date have published two consultation papers on its various aspects: <i>Best Value: next steps</i>, laid before Parliament in June last year, and <i>A</i> <i>Power of Community Initiative etc</i>, laid before Parliament last November.</p>

  <p>I have now been advised that one of the provisions which support the moratorium - section 2(10) of the Local Government Act 1988 &#8211; needs amendment to enable the full moratorium to continue until we are ready to introduce legislative proposals on Best Value.</p>

  <p>Unless the amendment is made, CCT will be imposed on 1 January 2002 on the following activities: the collection of refuse, the cleaning of buildings and other cleaning, catering for purposes of schools and welfare and other catering, the management of sports and leisure facilities, maintenance of ground and the repair and maintenance of vehicles.</p>

  <p>Such a development would involve substantial costs for local authorities and disrupt the development of Best Value.</p>

  <p>I would therefore like to announce the Executive&#8217;s intention shortly to introduce a small Bill which will amend the Local Government Act 1988 and remove this deadline. We propose to introduce this Bill as early as possible during this parliamentary year.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s longer term plans remain to repeal CCT as part of the new statutory regime for local authorities based on a duty of Best Value.</p>

  <p>Yes.

  <p>Under new arrangements used to determine capital consents for police forces for 2001-02, three quarters of the total available was allocated according to an agreed formula based on population. The balance was set aside for projects costing over &#163;1 million.</p>

  <p>Bids were invited from all forces and five projects were submitted. Two projects were submitted by Strathclyde Police, one for a new police station in Irvine and the other for a new Divisional Headquarters in Motherwell. The total value of the bids submitted exceeded the amount available for allocation. A panel drawn from HM Inspectorate of Constabulary, the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland and COSLA considered each project on its merits and recommended to ministers that funding be made available for three of these - for the Motherwell project and projects submitted by Lothian and Borders Police and Northern Constabulary.

  <p>New, more transparent, arrangements were used to determine capital consents for police forces for 2001-02 following recommendations in a report by the Accounts Commission and Her Majesty&#8217;s Inspectorate of Constabulary. Under the new arrangements, three quarters of the total available was allocated across forces using an agreed formula based on population adjusted for sparsity. The balance was set aside for projects costing over &#163;1 million. Bids were invited from all forces and five projects were submitted. A panel drawn from HM Inspectorate of Constabulary, the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland and COSLA considered each project on its merits and made recommendations to ministers. These recommendations were accepted and the projected expenditures for the three successful projects (submitted by Strathclyde Police, Lothian and Borders Police and Northern Constabulary) were added to individual allocations.</p>

  <p>At present, Her Majesty&#8217;s Inspectors of Schools are an integral part of the Scottish Executive Education Department and their work is monitored by senior management and ministers in the same way as the rest of the department&#8217;s activity. Some of the work of the Inspectorate is carried out under contract to external bodies who are responsible for their own monitoring arrangements. Various aspects of the Inspectorate&#8217;s performance are a matter of public record.</p>

  <p>As I announced to the Parliament on 23 November 2000, the Inspectorate will be established as an Executive Agency of the Scottish Executive from 1 April 2001. As part of that process, I shall put in place arrangements for agreeing performance targets with the agency, and to monitor and report to Parliament on the work of the agency. These arrangements will be set out in a Framework Document covering this and other aspects of the agency, which will be made available to Parliament.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Crown Office, the Scottish Children&#8217;s Reporter Administration, social work departments, health boards and child welfare organisations in consultation with the Law Society of Scotland and the Faculty of Advocates are developing a code of practice which will include guidance on the provision of therapy before children give evidence. It will also assist in ensuring that the appropriate agencies provide the necessary help to those children who need it either before, or after, court proceedings.</p>
