  <p>There are no plans to commission further trials of digital hearing aids.

  <p>Funding allocations to NHS boards are made on an annual basis. It is for local NHS boards and trusts to prioritise their funding to meet the needs of residents within their area of responsibility.</p>

  <p>In April this year, as a short-term measure and to reduce unacceptably long waiting times for audiology services, I announced additional funding of &#163;750,000 across NHS boards during 2002-03. NHS Fife received &#163;49,600 as their share of the additional funds.</p>

  <p>When the wide-ranging review of audiology services, commissioned by the Executive last year, reports in the autumn we shall be well placed to identify the best way forward for audiology services in Scotland.</p>

  <p>For the purposes of crofting legislation a croft is defined by section 3 of the Crofters (Scotland) Act 1993. The Crofters Commission policies apply to all land undisputedly covered by that restrictive, statutory definition. All crofts should be recorded in the Register of Crofts and the Crofters Commission has an obligation under section 41 of the 1993 act to ensure that they are. Only land that falls within the definition of a croft in the 1993 act can be recorded in the Register of Crofts. Land which does not fall within the definition of a croft in section 3 of the 1993 act is not croft land and the Crofters Commission has no policies in relation to such land.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what progress has been made with the development of broadband services in rural communities and what the (a) current and (b) anticipated levels of coverage are under present targets.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive set out its broadband strategy last year in <i>Connecting Scotland: Our Broadband Future</i> and our vision was to make broadband connections more affordable and pervasive across the country, including in rural areas.</p>

  <p>As part of that strategy, the Executive has developed the Pathfinder initiatives to aggregate public sector demand for broadband in the Highlands and Islands and South of Scotland. It is hoped that this major investment on the part of the public sector will help to stimulate both demand for and supply of broadband within these areas, which might not be immediately covered by the commercial market. Work on the Pathfinder initiative is well in hand.</p>

  <p>Our strategy also undertook to identify where there was a need for direct support measures; our programme under the UK Broadband Fund is developing this element through almost a dozen projects managed by Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise. These include awareness raising measures and technology trials in rural areas, such as Powerline Carrier and Wireless pilots, which aim to determine the potential of these technologies for delivering broadband in rural communities.</p>

  <p>The UK Government has set a general target on broadband which is to &quot;have the most extensive and competitive broadband market in the G7 by 2005&quot; and the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s broadband strategy is designed to contribute to this overall objective.</p>

  <p>Currently, about half of the Scottish population has access to broadband via terrestrial ADSL and/or cable-modem equivalents.</p>

  <p>People suffering from anorexia nervosa are treated and supported through mainstream mental health and social work services, and treatment is undertaken mainly in out-patient settings, with very few in-patient and day cases.

  <p>As part of the Global Connections Strategy launched in October 2001, the Executive stated its aim of attracting high value economic activity to Scotland and stressed the importance of helping anchor companies in Scotland. Scottish Development International officials based both at home and overseas continue to work closely with new and existing clients to identify new inward investment opportunities, including the possibility that companies may wish to establish their European headquarters in Scotland.</p>

  <p>A number of incentives are available to companies wishing to establish headquarters in Scotland ranging from grants, most notably Regional Selective Assistance grant within the Assisted Areas of Scotland to help with sourcing customers, suppliers and suitably skilled employees.</p>

  <p>For high potential companies which are owned and are headquartered in Scotland, the Global Companies Development Process offers tailored support to global companies or companies who wish to become global.</p>

  <p>Article 1 of Protocol 1 of the Convention states "No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law."</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has carried out an audit of all areas of activity in order to identify any potential incompatibilities with the Convention.

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally. A service-led group, chaired by a NHS Trust Chief Executive, has been established to consider the issue of missed appointments. NHS boards and trusts, together with primary care teams are already working to ensure that wherever possible if an appointment is cancelled it can be filled by another patient. Patients also have a responsibility to ensure that where they are likely to have difficulty in attending an appointment they inform their practice or clinic as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>We are actively pursuing the recommendations from the Scottish Diet Action Plan aimed at reducing salt intake by more than a third by 2005. Guidelines have been produced for the improvement of nutritional standards in schools, hospitals and catering establishments which encourage the adoption of healthier practices into all aspects of catering, including reduction in usage of salt. At a UK level, the Food Standards Agency is pursuing a number of initiatives involving major retailers and manufacturers to reduce the level of salt in processed foods.</p>

  <p>The relationship between salt and blood pressure was considered by the Committee on the Medical Aspects of Food Policy (COMA) in its 1994 report, <i>Nutritional Aspects of Cardiovascular Disease, </i> which recommended a reduction in the average intake of salt by the adult population from 9g per day, the levels current at the time, to 6g <i> </i> per day (5g per day in women and 7g per day in men). A similar proportionate reduction in the salt content of children&rsquo;s diets was recommended but insufficient data were available to enable quantification.</p>

  <p>Scientific evidence suggests the main health risk associated with high salt intakes relates to elevated blood pressure or hypertension, which is an important contributory factor to coronary heart disease and stroke. The majority of evidence is derived from studies on adults; there is very little evidence available regarding the effect of high salt intake on children.</p>

  <p>No representations have been made to the University of Dundee by the Executive in this regard. Higher education institutions are autonomous bodies and decisions concerning staffing levels and human resource management are a primarily a matter for individual institutions and their governing bodies.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what action the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council (SHEFC) is taking in relation to (a) monitoring compliance by universities with grant funding conditions and (b) ensuring that internal personnel and staff management strategies are in place and are being demonstrated to university staff and that any action taken by universities which directly affects staff are consistent with such strategies.</p>

  <p>SHEFC monitors the use of funds to which a specific condition has been applied to the offer of a grant in a variety of ways. The new condition of core grants introduced by SHEFC from 2002-03 includes a requirement that institutions, taking account of their own particular circumstances and context, devise and implement strategies which effectively address human resource policies and management and to demonstrate their key actions and strategies for human resources to stakeholders. Monitoring of progress will be done primarily through information provided in institutions' strategic plans which SHEFC are currently considering in respect of 2002-03.</p>

  <p>Higher education institutions are autonomous bodies and the primary responsibility for ensuring that an institution's actions are consistent with its strategic plan remains with the governing body and management of each institution.</p>

  <p>Information on patients who did not attend a hospital appointment is available only for first out-patient appointments. The number, and percentage, of patients who did not attend (DNA) their first out-patient appointment, for the years ended 31 March 2000, 31 March 2001 and 31 March 2002, by NHS board, is given in the following table.</p>

  <p>There are many reasons why patients might fail to attend a hospital appointment. Work is currently under way to examine ways of reducing the number of patients who do not keep appointments, to identify and disseminate good practice, and to consider the development of targets to drive improvements in performance. The group is expected to report before the end of 2002.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not collect data on the number of empty properties in each local authority area. Ministers recognised that empty homes were a serious issue and the Empty Homes Initiative, which was introduced in 1997 and extended until March 2002, encouraged local authorities to identify the extent of the problem in their local area and provided funding to help meet the identified need. It now falls to local authorities to take this issue forward as part of their Local Housing Strategy.</p>

  <p>In general, criminal trials in Scotland must be held in the presence of the accused. There are, however, certain exceptions to the general rule.</p>

  <p>If during the course of his trial an accused person so misconducts himself that a proper trial cannot take place, the court may order that the trial proceed in his absence.</p>

  <p>In summary proceedings an accused may be tried in his absence where he fails to appear in court after being duly notified and he is charged with a statutory offence:</p>

  <p>for which a sentence of imprisonment cannot be imposed, or</p>

  <p>in relation to which there is provision authorising procedure in the absence of the accused.</p>

  <p>In addition, an examination of the facts, held to determine whether an accused person who is insane did the acts or made the omission alleged, may proceed in the absence of the accused where it appears to the court that it is not practical or appropriate for the accused to attend.</p>

  <p>In civil proceedings decree may be granted in the absence of a defender after service of a writ or summons.</p>

  <p>Details of trials in absentia in the criminal courts in Scotland are not collected centrally. The number of decrees granted in absence in civil proceedings in Scotland are published annually in the Civil Judicial Statistics.</p>

  <p>I see no reason why responsible canoeists and angling should not be able to co-exist on the same stretch of water. I understand that the current voluntary code relating to canoeing and angling works well and this will be reinforced by guidance in the Scottish Outdoor Access Code.</p>

  <p>Section 6(f)(ii) of the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill excludes from access rights land developed or set out for a particular recreational purpose while in use for that purpose. It applies to rivers navigable by canoe but is not intended to permit fishermen to prohibit canoeists from exercising access rights in relation to a river when fishing is under way. I accept, however, that the provision as presently drafted may in some cases be legitimately used for that purpose. For example, the construction of pools in a river bed for the purpose of fisheries management would be caught by that provision and fishermen could claim that access rights are not exercisable in relation to any such river when fishing is under way. That is not our policy. Amendment 153 to the bill seeks to<strong> </strong>address this issue and we have indicated that we would be content to accept it. This amendment would have the effect that<strong> </strong>rivers developed for fishing will not be excluded, under section 6(f), from the responsible exercise of access rights when fishing is taking place.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive fully recognises the importance of the publishing industry in Scotland. Not only because of the economic impact of the sector, but because of its potential to feed high-value intellectual properties into other creative sectors such as film, TV and electronic games.</p>

  <p>Through the Scottish Enterprise &quot;Creative Industries&quot; cluster it is working closely with organisations, such as the Scottish Arts Council and the Scottish Publishing Association, in a wide range of areas from assistance with developing new overseas markets to developing into e-business.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether there are any implications for the retailing of books, the supply of books to libraries and the selling of books published in Scotland as a result of take-overs and commercial failures in the publishing sector and what action it is taking to address any such implications.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive acknowledges that market forces and the consolidation of retail bookselling have caused large-scale competition in the bookselling trade.</p>

  <p>The supply and selling of books published in Scotland is a commercial issue between the publishers and the retail outlets.</p>

  <p>However, Scottish Enterprise is currently engaged in a study to evaluate the potential of building a more active network of literary agents in Scotland to provide better access to market for Scottish writers through local publishers.</p>

  <p>Statutory responsibility for local libraries, the level of resources allocated and the service they provide, lies with local authorities.</p>

  <p>Data about injury road accidents are collected by the police and reported to the Scottish Executive using the STATS 19 statistical report form. These returns cover only accidents in which one or more people were injured: they do not cover damage only accidents.</p>

  <p>The Executive&rsquo;s statistical database can provide figures on the number of injury accidents by police force area, by local authority area and for specified lengths of individual roads.</p>

  <p>The areas covered by Strathclyde Police Divisions N and Q correspond to North Lanarkshire and South Lanarkshire Councils respectively. The following table gives the numbers of injury road accidents which were identified in the STATS 19 returns as occurring in North Lanarkshire and South Lanarkshire in the five years 1997 to 2001 inclusive.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that the statistics given are based upon the data which are held in the central statistical database and which were collected by the police at the time of the accident and subsequently reported to the Executive. They may differ from any figures which the local authority would provide now, because they do not take account of any subsequent changes or corrections that the local authority may have made to the statistical information, for use at local level, about the location of each accident, based upon its knowledge of the road and area concerned.</p>

  <p>This information is not available. Farms subject to movement restrictions (Designated Area Orders - DAOs) for infectious pancreatic necrosis and bacterial kidney disease since 1979 follow. These tables give a general indication of the number of cases. Some DAOs are historical because farmers have not sought their revocation and some sites have been subject to more than one DAO per year. DAOs are served on suspicion or confirmation of the presence of the disease agent but this does not necessarily mean a clinical outbreak.</p>

  <p>Regulations can be revoked or simplified both by specific instruments addressing these regulations and by elements contained in more wide-ranging instruments. It is therefore not possible to give figures for reductions in bureaucracy. The Executive works to ensure that all regulations are necessary and proportionate. In particular, for regulations which impact on business, charities and the voluntary sector, the use of the Regulatory Impact Assessment and the Review Regulatory Impact Assessment should guarantee that regulations are proportionate, necessary and fit for purpose when they are introduced and remain so over time.</p>

In tandem with this, <strong></strong> sportscotland will consult on the development of its strategy for distribution of the Lottery Sport Fund.

  <p>A pool of several specialist advisers staff the Breathing Space line, with two usually on duty during opening hours. These advisers mostly have a social work or other professional mental health background. Staff receive several days&rsquo; intensive training on a range of topics before working on the line: this includes input about psychiatric illnesses and how to discuss sensitively the types of symptoms and concerns which can arise with the most common mental illnesses.</p>

  <p>&#163;18.4 million has been allocated to promote healthy lifestyle choices amongst children and young people, including the promotion of sport and the provision of coaching and equipment. A number of voluntary youth organisations will benefit from the Quality of Life funding, but the exact allocation to these organisations is a matter for each local authority to decide.</p>

  <p>for activities that promote Scottish Executive objectives;</p>

  <p>to support capacity building within organisations on the basis of agreed outputs;</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has provided &#163;228 million to more than 700 voluntary groups in 2002-03. The majority of these operate at a national level and their programmes and services are not always disaggregated by geographical area. Although many of these will impact upon the East Dunbartonshire Council area, the Executive would need to ask each grant recipient to provide the information requested. This would include a disproportionate cost.</p>

  <p>The Health and Safety Executive guidance, <i>Managing Health and Safety In Swimming Pools,</i> states that:</p>

  <p>&quot;Manual checking of the water by taking appropriate tests for disinfectant and pH levels, together with other chemical tests that are recommended by PWTAG (The Pool Water Treatment Advisory Group), are a fundamental requirement for all pools. Some pools are fitted with automatic controllers that measure the amounts of disinfectant or the pH of the pool and then vary the dose rate in accordance with the readings. In a pool where these devices are working well and can be relied upon for their accuracy then manually testing the water before the pool is used, after the cessation of use, and one intermediate test may provide sufficient monitoring. In a pool where dosing is controlled manually, the pool should be tested prior to use and every 2 hours thereafter through to closing.&quot;</p>

  <p>The requirement for and frequency of testing is a matter for individual hospitals to determine based upon risk assessments and governed by good practice arrangements.</p>

  <p>Some guidance is provided for example in <i>Scottish Health Technical Memorandum 2027</i> which recommends water sampling at six-monthly intervals wherever bulk drinking water storage exceeds 1,000 litres and is supplied from the water undertaker.</p>

  <p>Frequency of sampling where given is provided for initial guidance only as the frequency will vary to suit particular sites, locations, design parameters and particular principles employed.</p>

  <p>I am pleased that we have been able to directly support the Scottish Youth Parliament, the Young Scot youth information service and the National Youth Portal, Scotland&rsquo;s first interactive Youth Website. These all play a major role in informing and encouraging the active participation of young people in Scotland. In addition, Connect Youth, which supports local youth fora throughout Scotland is co-ordinated by YouthLink Scotland, which receives Scottish Executive funding.</p>

  <p>In schools, the 5-14 Programme offers a number of opportunities for pupils to learn about citizenship education under personal and social development, religious and moral education and, in particular, under social subjects within environmental studies.</p>

  <p>Schools are also asked to set out in their annual school development plans how they have consulted pupils and involved them in decision making. Examples of interesting ways in which the consultation and involvement of decision making is being carried out will be put on the National Priorities website where shared information across authorities and schools is being held.</p>

  <p>Following publication of their report<i> Education for Citizenship in Scotland: A Paper for Discussion and Development,</i> we have asked Learning and Teaching Scotland to consider the most effective means of taking forward the report&rsquo;s recommendations. This will form the basis for a national framework for education for citizenship for 3- to 18-year-olds.</p>
