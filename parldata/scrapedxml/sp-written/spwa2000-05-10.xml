  <p>It is estimated that fewer than 20% of young people who have been looked after by local authorities go into further and higher education.</p>

  <p>Improving educational achievements for this vulnerable group of young people is one of our priorities in developing a strategic framework for Children&#8217;s Services. Our social justice targets also include a commitment that all young people leaving care will achieve at least standard grades in Mathematics and English by 2003.</p>

  <p>Figures for each local authority cannot be given due to the limited data available.

  <p>The Scottish Executive has considered this matter very carefully. It has taken into account the nature of the disease, its obligations under UK and EC legislation, the potential read over effect for other animal and plant diseases and the socio-economic implications for the areas in which the affected farms are situated. It has also had regard to the policy adopted in other fish disease cases in recent years. The issue generally has consumed a great deal of time and effort since the Executive came into being on 1 July 1999.</p>

  <p>The Executive is currently working to develop a suitable definition that will clarify whether a trawl shall be considered to be a single trawl or a multiple trawl so that fishermen know which size of mesh must be used in the cod end of the net. The Executive will issue this definition as soon as practicable, either as formal guidance or in forthcoming legislation. It is the intention of the Executive that any definition so issued should assist the aims of conservation.</p>

  <p>The tables below show the available information on (a) patient attendances and (b) orthoptists, but the two tables are not directly comparable and should therefore be interpreted with caution.</p>

  <p>Numbers of attendances of patients seen by orthoptists by health board area for financial year 1998-99 are shown in Table 1.</p>

  <p>The number of orthoptists employed in the NHS in each of the health boards in Scotland is shown in Table 2. This table shows the number and whole time equivalent employed at 30 September 1998. This data only includes staff in post at the time of the census and does not take into account any vacancies that existed at this point in time. Therefore, it may not represent staffing levels present throughout the financial year. For this reason this data, when related to throughput of patients, cannot be used to provide a robust comparison of workload per orthoptist in each health board.</p>

  <p>The Chief Scientist Office (CSO) within The Scottish Executive Health Department has responsibility for encouraging and supporting research into health services and patient care within the NHS in Scotland. Although CSO has received no research proposals of a sufficiently high standard on Meares-Irlen syndrome (which is the term sometimes used to refer to the collection of symptoms and signs of visual fatigue when reading) and therefore does not directly fund research on this condition at present, they would be pleased to receive applications for research funding.</p>

  <p>Glasgow Caledonian University is the host institution and principal grant-holder for the Nursing Research Initiative for Scotland (NRIS). When the founding Director retired, Glasgow Caledonian advertised for a full-time director on two separate occasions. Despite this, they were unable to recruit a suitable replacement and they therefore explored other ways to provide scientific leadership. As a result of a direct approach from Glasgow Caledonian to Stirling University, an agreement was reached to release Professor Niven on a part-time (one-third) basis to lead the Unit. The savings from this part-time arrangement will fund an additional NRIS post. These matters were all fully discussed with the Scottish Executive which approved the actions taken by Glasgow Caledonian.</p>

  <p>The principal grant-holder and host institution for NRIS is, and remains, Glasgow Caledonian University, and there has been no relocation from that institution. However the initiative had always been conceived as serving the whole of the nursing research community in Scotland. The arrangement whereby Professor Niven combines her professorial role at Stirling University with a part-time directorship at NRIS, (together with two NRIS posts to be based at Stirling), is evidence of the commitment to spreading expertise to a wider audience.</p>

  <p>NRIS was founded in 1994. It is one of seven research units which receives core funding from the Chief Scientist Office. The seven core funded units are diverse and cover areas including health economics, dental research, health services research, and research into behavioural change.</p>

  <p>The current remit of NRIS is to develop a high quality research programme which is useful and relevant to direct patient care; to provide a strong national focus for patient care research which is not provided by other organisations, and to involve nurses and other direct care staff as appropriate in its research.</p>

  <p>The Unit is formally reviewed on a four-year cycle, by a panel of independent experts chaired by the Chief Scientist. In November 1998, the review team concluded that the Unit had fulfilled its original remit and that funding for the Unit should therefore continue. The next review will take place at the end of 2002.</p>

  <p>The report of a working group set up to devise a Scottish Needs Assessment Programme for multiple sclerosis will be published this month. The report, which includes input from the Multiple Sclerosis Society, will assess the total needs of people with MS. It will provide health boards with valuable information which will help them to devise local strategies.</p>

  <p>The Clinical Standards Board for Scotland which was established on 1 April 1999 will be responsible for developing and running a national system of quality assurance in healthcare for the NHS in Scotland. Its work will be complemented by the Health Technology Board for Scotland, established on 1 April 2000, whose task is to develop and run a system to provide advice on clinical and cost effectiveness of new health technologies including drugs in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Both boards are independent and will set their own programmes, but I can say that the Health Technology Board will be reviewing the use of beta interferon in the treatment of MS as one of its first tasks.</p>

  <p>We have no plans to change the current arrangements. It is for the courts to determine the sentence in any particular case. The Executive&#8217;s role is to ensure that the sentencer has a range of disposals available to ensure that offenders can be dealt with effectively.

  <p>I understand that, at this stage, Angus Council have the position of St Vigean&#8217;s Primary School under review, but that there is no formal proposal to close the school. If, after further consideration, they propose to close the school, there is a statutory requirement, which applies to all school closure proposals, for consultation with parents and school boards. The statutory consultation process ensures that there is an opportunity for those consulted to make their views known to the authority at the appropriate time.</p>

  <p>Decisions on school closures are generally for the local authorities, except in certain circumstances prescribed in statute where the consent of the Scottish Ministers is required. The main circumstances in which such consent is required are where the school concerned is more than 80% full, or where, in the case of a primary school, pupils would have to attend a different primary school which is 8.046720 kilometres (five miles) or more distant from the school proposed for closure. I have no information on whether such consent will be required in the event of a formal closure of St Vigean&#8217;s. Angus Council are aware of the relevant statutory requirements.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive believes that the dignity of the Saltire is best maintained by continuing high standards of production on the part of flagmakers. Statutory regulation would be inappropriate and enforcement impracticable - the colour and condition of flags flown outside, for example, is inevitably affected by exposure to weather and sunlight.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive ensure that flags flown from government buildings in Scotland are produced to a high standard and observe the necessary heraldic conventions.</p>
