  <p>The Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006 was a significant step in promoting the welfare of animals. The act increased the penalties for animal cruelty, imposed a duty of care on those responsible for animals, allowed animals in danger of suffering to be removed and gives Scottish ministers the power to make regulations to secure the welfare of animals.</p>

  <p>As part of the new concordat agreed between the Scottish Government and COSLA, each local authority will aim to reach a single outcome agreement (SOA) with the Scottish Government at the earliest opportunity, based on the national outcomes and, under a common framework, local outcomes to take account of local priorities. The SOA will cover all local government services in each local authority area as well as a significant range of the responsibilities of Community Planning Partnerships where local authorities have a significant part to play. The initial agreements would be with each of the 32 councils with the possibility of agreements with Community Planning Partnerships at some future date.</p>

  <p>Scottish Government budget provision for schools PPP revenue support offered to local authorities was initially &pound;100 million, &pound;80 million and &pound;100 million in 2005-06, 2006-07 and 2007-08 respectively. However, the funding requirements are dependent on progress on the PPP projects. Actual spend on schools PPP revenue support was &pound;5.02 million in 2005-06, &pound;17.585 million in 2006-07 and is estimated to be &pound;41.979 million in 2007-08.</p>

  <p>Funding support increases as PPP schools are completed. For the next three years, following discussion with COSLA, the Government are allocating that element of the funding associated with schools PPP projects according to the forecasts of spending which each Council has provided. To that extent, although schools PPP support will be rolled up within an overall total grant figure, the funding which each Council which is due support will receive over the three years 2008-11 will take direct account of the expenditure they have indicated they will expect to make.</p>

  <p>Government PPP revenue support relates to a proportion of the capital value of projects. It is for local authorities to decide how they will fund the rest, and any other elements of the unitary charge payable to PPP consortia, from within the overall resources available to them.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not collect information on the number of pupils relocated as a result of school closures.</p>

  <p>Information on the school rolls from 1996 to 2006 of all primary, secondary and special schools in each local authority area is available on the Scottish Government website at: <br /> <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/Browse/School-Education/HistoricalRolls2006" target="_blank"> http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/Browse/School-Education/HistoricalRolls2006</a>.</p>

  <p>Information is derived from the annual school census in September of each year. Both local authority and independent schools are included. In general, a school roll dropping to zero would signify that the school has closed in the year in question, and the roll in the preceding year would indicate the approximate number of pupils who may have been relocated.</p>

  <p>Information on primary, secondary and special schools which have opened and closed since 1996-97 is also available on the Scottish Government website at:<br /> <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/Browse/School-Education/openingsnarrative07" target="_blank"> http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/Browse/School-Education/openingsnarrative07</a>.</p>

  <p>The information has been derived from information collected annually by the Scottish Government on the opening and closing of schools. Both local authority and independent schools are included.</p>

  <p>Schools which may have closed can be identified from this data set and then compared with the school roll information contained in the historical school rolls in the data set referred to above.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that the schools listed in both data sets are those identified as separate institutions for administrative purposes. Schools which may appear to have closed (or opened) may have done so only in administrative terms, for example, where a school has merged with another school under a new name while education provision continues on the same campus. This may particularly be the case with units for pupils with additional support needs which may have separated from or joined with mainstream schools in administrative terms without any change in provision.</p>

  <p>If the member wishes to make a formal allegation about me in relation to the Scottish Ministerial Code then he should write to the First Minister.</p>

  <p>The circumstances surrounding my attendance at the Globalscot reception at the Trump National Golf Club have been presented, in full, to the Parliament, in response to a number of other parliamentary questions.</p>

  <p>Section 6.11 of the Ministerial Code advises that ministers should not act in a way that might be viewed as being prejudicial to the planning process, citing as particular examples: (i) taking a decision, or being part of the decision-making process, in respect of an application which falls within the minister&rsquo;s constituency; (ii) expressing an opinion publicly on a particular case which is, or may subsequently come, before the minister for decision; (iii) meeting the developer or objectors to discuss the proposal, but not meeting all parties with an interest in the decision; or (iv) commenting on decisions once they have been issued, other than in terms of what has appeared in the decision letter or, in the case of structure plan approvals, any accompanying explanatory annexes.</p>

  <p>In the course of my attendance at the event held at the Trump National Golf Club, I took no decisions about the Trump Organization&rsquo;s planning application regarding the Menie estate; expressed no public opinion on the application; met no members of the Trump Organization, which was not, in any case, represented at the event; met no objectors to the application, and made no comment on any decision relating to the application, as none had been taken at that time.</p>

  <p>For the avoidance of doubt, and contrary to media reports, I did not receive any hospitality from the Trump Organization whilst attending this event, nor did I play a round of golf, a sport in which I have not participated since approximately 1975.</p>

  <p>It is Scottish Government policy that goods and services are procured through competition that demonstrate fairness, openness and transparency at all stages of the process. Decisions are based on value for money, without discrimination on the basis of nationality or locality. All Saltires used by the Scottish Government for promotional purposes are sourced through RR Donnelley (Astron), who were appointed in October 2004, for a three-year contract, after a comprehensive procurement process in line with Government Procurement Policy and the EU Procurement Directives. This contract was awarded with an option of two further one-year extensions and currently operates on a one-year extension. Flags sourced through this supplier are from a variety of manufacturers and include sources in Scotland, other UK countries and overseas. The flags sent out to pre schools and universities and colleges were from existing stock.</p>

  <p>No meetings have yet been held with organisations representing disabled or older people about the removal of the ring fence on Supporting People, but discussions with a wide range of stakeholders are planned between now and March 2008. Local authorities will continue to have a responsibility to support the most vulnerable people in their communities, ensuring for example that their needs are reflected in local housing strategies. We expect housing support services to have an important role to play in helping to achieve several of the new national indicators, and removing the ring fencing will allow more flexible construction of support packages for individuals.</p>

  <p>However, we recognise concerns exist in any transition period. We therefore look forward to discussing with COSLA, local authorities, providers and others how to best ensure that vulnerable people continue to be effectively supported, looking for example at how the interests of the most vulnerable in our society can be appropriately reflected in single outcome agreements with local authorities.</p>

  <p>I am pleased that we have reached this agreement, which is worth over 7% to teachers over the next three years (2.25% for 2008-09, 2.5% for 2009-10 and 2.4% for 2010-11).</p>

  <p>The deal struck by all three parties within the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers - the teachers organisations, COSLA and the Scottish Government - demonstrates the benefits of our shared commitment to improving the lives of Scotland&rsquo;s children.</p>

  <p>The deal is a fair one with real benefits for pupils and schools as well as teachers and will provide the stability to allow a focus on improving educational outcomes for our children.</p>

  <p>Welcome to Scotland is not a slogan or a logo &ndash; it is a simple and straightforward welcome to those arriving in our country. No money was used to develop the &quot;Welcome to Scotland&quot; message. The message reflects recommendations from customer research and evaluation undertaken in March 2006 and 2007.

  <p>As a result of the unusual amount of public interest in the First Minister&rsquo;s travel to this meeting, the Permanent Secretary has personally considered what use was made of the Government Car Service on this occasion. He has noted that it is commonplace for civil servants, including special advisors, to travel with ministers in government cars, in order to assist ministers to use time spent travelling to progress government business; and that it is also common for the minister&rsquo;s government car to convey such civil servants to their destination, where it is different from the minister&rsquo;s destination. He is satisfied that the use made of the Government Car Service in this case was consistent with such general practice and was both appropriate and pragmatic.</p>

  <p>The Chief Planner made two telephone calls to the Chief Executive of Aberdeenshire Council on the afternoon of 4 December 2007. David Ferguson, Head of Planning Decisions was present during both conversations. The first of these calls was to request an update on the status of the council&rsquo;s consideration of the application. The Chief Planner advised the Chief Executive that representatives from the Trump Organization were present in the room. At the request of the Chief Executive those representatives of the Trump Organization left the room for the duration of the call. The second call to the Chief Executive was to advise that the planning application was to be called in by the Scottish ministers. The Chief Planner and the Head of Planning Decisions were the only people in the room during that telephone call.</p>

Mr Salmond sought advice from the Chief Planner on whether it would still be permissible for the officials of the Scottish Government Planning Directorate to meet representatives of the Trump Organization.

  <p>As a result of the unusual amount of public interest in the First Minister&rsquo;s travel to this meeting, the Permanent Secretary has personally considered what use was made of the Government Car Service on this occasion. He has noted that it is commonplace for civil servants, including special advisors, to travel with ministers in government cars, in order to assist ministers to use time spent travelling to progress government business, and that it is also common for the minister&rsquo;s government car to convey such civil servants to their destination, where it is different from the minister&rsquo;s destination. He is satisfied that the use made of the Government Car Service in this case was consistent with such general practice and was both appropriate and pragmatic.</p>

  <p>Special advisers did not brief factual inaccuracies to the media.</p>

  <p>All information given to Parliament on this issue has been correct.</p>

  <p>The BBC approached Scottish Government officials on 12 December 2007 with questions relating to the Chief Planner&rsquo;s telephone contacts with Aberdeenshire Council. Those questions were answered correctly on December 12. On December 13, the BBC refined its question by changing a limited number of words. During the course of a busy day in which we fielded a large number of questions from a range of parties about the Trump application, officials did not realise the question had been changed slightly and repeated an answer given the previous evening. Once the mistake was identified officials clarified the position to the media at the earliest opportunity. We always strive to supply full and accurate answers to media enquiries and I regret that this unfortunate but easily understood error occurred on this occasion.</p>
