  <p>Further detailed consideration has been undertaken on practical issues arising from the new policy, including the issue of attendance allowance and the detailed work required of local authorities. We are now able to move ahead.</p>

  <p>The Chair of the steering group which was established to advise on implementation has advised that a slight delay in implementation would allow an orderly introduction of the new arrangements, in the light of all the preparatory work required. After considering the impact of this proposal carefully, the Executive has decided that full implementation of free nursing and personal care for those assessed as needing it will take place from 1 July 2002.</p>

  <p>The amounts to be paid from 1 July 2002 for those in care homes will be &#163;145 per week for those assessed as needing personal care and a further &#163;65 per week for those assessed as needing nursing care. Those who accept such a payment towards their nursing and personal care costs will cease to be eligible for Attendance Allowance under Department of Work and Pensions rules, but are of course being fully compensated by the amounts set out above.</p>

  <p>Those who currently pay charges for the personal care provided to them in their own homes will not be charged for that type of care after 1 July 2002. Nursing care is already provided free of charge by the NHS for those at home through the community nursing and health visitor services.</p>

  <p>Those types of care defined by the Care Development Group as personal care will be included in the Community Care and Health Bill currently before Parliament, subject to parliamentary approval.</p>

  <p>The Social Justice Annual Report 2001 and its annex, entitled &quot;Indicators of progress: definitions, data, baselines and trends information&quot;, were both published on 26 November 2001. They provide the latest data on the range of milestones used to measure child poverty.</p>

  <p>We are making improvements in data collection in a number of areas relating to the Social Justice Strategy. As I noted during the debate on the Social Justice Annual Report on 29 November 2001, we are not in a position to give numbers regarding children living in low income households because of technical difficulties with the Department for Work and Pensions&#146; Family Resources Survey data. We are investing &#163;230,000 to double the size of the sample in Scotland and have agreed a programme to change the way they generate Scottish information, in order that we can produce more detailed income data.</p>

  <p>A detailed description of the methodology used in calculating the low income figures is available in the Department for Work and Pensions&#146; annual publication <i>Households Below Average Income</i>. The 1999-2000 publication was published on 13 July 2001 and a copy is available from the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 14722).</p>

  <p>Development of broadband technology is largely a matter for the suppliers. However, the Executive is beginning to look at broadband demand stimulation measures as we are keen to see higher bandwidth services deployed as widely as possible in Scotland. As a first step, we are proposing a programme of measures which will support trials and pilot projects of the new technologies which are becoming available. These will utilise the DTI &#163;30 million fund for innovative projects to extend broadband networks, &#163;4.4 million of which has been allocated to Scotland.</p>

  <p>Telecommunications regulation is reserved to the UK Government. The Scottish Executive is in regular contact with the Department of Trade &amp; Industry and OFTEL regarding the impact of UK policies on Scotland.</p>

  <p>Within the context of its economic development remit, Scottish Enterprise is developing the Accessing Telecoms Links Across Scotland (ATLAS) project which aims to increase choice within the wholesale telecoms market in Scotland.

  <p>I refer the member to the reply given to question S1W-18044 on 11 September 2001. The Rough Sleepers Initiative (RSI) has made &#163;42 million available to local authorities over five years, 1997-98 to 2001-02 to tackle rough sleeping. Further funding has been made available in 2002-03 and 2003-04 linked to Local Outcome Agreements, which will ensure the continued focus on the overarching target to end the need to sleep rough by 2003. East and West Dunbartonshire first bid for RSI funding in 1998-99 and received joint funding of &#163;45,500 from 1998-99 to 1999-2000. They bid separately in 2000-01 and in the last two years East Dunbartonshire has received total funding of &#163;75,675. The council will receive &#163;29,675 in each of the next two years, which will continue support for its outreach work and rent deposit scheme.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not forecast new housebuilding by local authority area. Edinburgh, West Lothian, Midlothian and East Lothian Councils are currently consulting on a draft structure plan covering the period 2000-15. The plan considers the need for new housebuilding in Edinburgh and the Lothians and how much of these might be built in Edinburgh. Copies of the draft can be obtained from any of the councils. The Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 provides for Scottish ministers to require local authorities to prepare local housing strategies. These will be based on an assessment of housing need and will set out local authorities' strategies for meeting this need over the following five-year period.</p>

  <p>Part of the solution must lie in addressing people&#146;s attitudes to mental health and to those with mental health problems. We need to tackle the stigma which many associate with mental illness. The Scottish Executive is already committed to this.</p>

  <p>I announced in October 2001 that I am establishing a National Advisory Group, consisting of a range of stakeholders from health, education, social justice, business and other areas, to be responsible for developing a national programme to promote mental health and well-being and to address stigma. The Executive will invest over &#163;4 million over three years in this programme.</p>

  <p>Behaviour which might be described as harassment can be prosecuted as a breach of the peace (which can cover all behaviour which causes or is likely to cause, fear, alarm, upset or annoyance). The Protection from Harassment Act 1997 provides further protection to victims of harassment. Under the act victims can take action in the civil courts to obtain damages for the harassment and can also obtain a non-harassment order (NHO) to prevent further harassment. This year&#146;s criminal justice legislation will provide for the introduction of a specific power of arrest for breach of an NHO.</p>

  <p>The Chief Scientist Office (CSO) within the Scottish Executive Health Department has responsibility for encouraging and supporting research into health services and patient care within the NHS in Scotland.</p>

  <p>CSO directly funds three projects on child and adolescent mental health research. Details are as follows:</p>

  <p>Adolescents with psychosis in Scotland: prevalence, health service use and disabilities. Cost: &#163;116,134.</p>

  <p>A pilot study using fMRI to image imitation in autistic spectrum disorders. Cost: &#163;66,165.</p>

  <p>Prosodic skills in children with autism. Cost: &#163;135,438.</p>

  <p>In addition, information provided to CSO by NHS Trusts suggests that the NHS R &amp; D Support Fund indirectly supported 359 research projects into mental health, at a total cost of &#163;2,729,260 in the last financial year. It is not known what proportion of these projects deal specifically with child and adolescent mental health. Details of all current and recently completed research projects can be found in the <i>National Research Register</i>, a copy of which is available in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 17404).</p>

  <p>The unit will be an integral part of the Scottish Executive Health Department rather than an external body, and its staff will be drawn from NHSScotland and the Health Department. Set up and running costs will be met from existing resources.</p>

  <p>On 8 January 2002, I announced details of the new National Waiting Times Unit, which has been established to reduce delays for patients by ensuring better and more efficient use of capacity and by co-ordinating a regional or national response to local bottlenecks or pressures. Initially it will focus its efforts on tackling delays in the clinical priorities of cancer and heart disease, as well as working to reduce the longest waits experienced by patients.</p>

  <p>The unit will seek to ensure that the most effective use is made of Scotland&#146;s collective health resources, and its work will be of significant benefit to a substantial number of patients across the country.</p>

  <p>The planning system is intended to control &quot;development&quot; of the built environment, not the growth of trees and hedges, and we have no plans to change the system in that respect.</p>

  <p>The Executive issued a consultation paper in January 2000 to try to gauge the extent of problems with high boundary trees and hedges. Having considered the responses, I announced the Executive's intention on 31 January 2001 to introduce a statutory remedy of last resort in relation to nuisance high hedges. The remedy would involve complaints to the local authority and enforcement action in appropriate cases, where other avenues had been exhausted. It was made clear, however, that no commitment could be given at that stage as to when legislation might be brought forward. In view of its substantial legislative programme, the Executive cannot at present give a commitment on when legislation on high boundary trees and hedges might be brought forward.</p>

  <p>The Registrar General for Scotland&#146;s 1998 based population projections assume that net migration (the balance between inflows and outflows) into Edinburgh City for the years 2000-01 to 2015-16 will be 950 people per year. Assumptions for the 2000 based population projections are currently under consideration with a view to publication in February 2002. It is likely that the assumed level of net migration into Edinburgh City in these projections will be higher than the 1998 based projections.</p>

  <p>The Registrar General&#146;s population projections are trend based projections rather than forecasts. They give an indication of how the population of Scotland will change if recent past trends continue. They cannot take account of the uncertain effects of future decisions on employment and housing.</p>

  <p>The Performance Audit Group&#146;s (PAG) role is to monitor and report on the technical, financial and quality management performance of the new trunk road Operating Companies. This is very similar to the role which PAG performed in respect of the previous trunk road maintenance operators. PAG consists of personnel drawn from the Halcrow Group Ltd and PricewaterhouseCoopers. The estimated outturn cost of PAG for 2001-02 is &#163;1.8 million. No contractors have been employed by PAG over the past year. Sub-consultants have been employed for short, specialist assignments at a cost of around &#163;3000.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what funding support it has allocated to the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council to meet its objectives of promoting access for poorer Scots and those living in rural areas identified in the annual guidance letter of 10 December 2001.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-01-15.26.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80131" speakername="Ms Wendy Alexander" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0115.htm#19">

  <p>Our overall aim must be that widening access becomes embedded as a mainstream activity for higher education institutions. I am therefore pleased that as part of its consideration of a new condition of grant the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council is currently considering how to achieve this, in a way which recognises the specific circumstances of individual institutions. Overall funding for the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council for the period 2001-02 to 2003-04 was set out in the guidance letter I sent to the council on 23 November 2000. This noted that overall planned funding for 2001-02 was 5.6% higher in real terms than in the previous year, with the value of the settlement maintained in real terms over the following two years.</p>

  <p>Over the period, &#163;18 million was specifically earmarked within the council&#146;s financial settlement for widening access. In particular, the council was asked to:</p>

  <p>provide a further 800 fully funded FTE places by academic year 2003, in addition to the 2,000 already allocated in the 1998 review, with these to be targeted in such a way as to maximise their take-up by those from currently under-represented groups;</p>

  <p>devise a mechanism to provide additional support to institutions which reflects the extent to which they provide for students from under-represented groups, and</p>

  <p>devise a scheme to incentivise private sector investment in access initiatives.</p>

  <p>On 11 December 2000, I subsequently announced that an additional &#163;0.5 million would be made available to the council during 2000-01, which it should use to encourage collaborative development projects to increase the uptake of higher education and Continuing Professional Development in the rural south west.</p>

  <p>In addition, funding of &#163;21 million has transferred to the council for over the period 2000-01 and 2001-02 in respect of funding for the higher education in the Highlands and Islands via UHI Millennium Institute, designated as a higher education institution on 1 April 2001, and the Open University in Scotland, which has a strong track-record of providing higher education to those in remote rural areas, and whose funding was transferred during 2000-01 to the council. This figure is largely comprised of funds transferred from the Scottish Further Education Funding Council, which previously funded higher education provided by further education colleges in the Highlands, and from the UK Government, which previously funded the Open University in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Publication and timing of publication of the Report and Accounts for both Scottish Transport Group pension schemes, which detail the scheme balances, are matters for the trustees. The Scottish Transport Group Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2001, which will include a reference to the net surplus in the pension schemes, were presented to the Scottish Parliament on 14 December 2001. No estimates have been made by the Executive of the funds as at 31 March 2002.</p>

  <p>Under the rules of the schemes the sums remaining in the pension schemes on wind-up fall to the UK Exchequer. As I announced in the Parliament on 29 November, Scottish ministers have secured for distribution the full amount of the estimated increase in the net surplus between 31 March 2000 and 31 March 2001, an additional &#163;18 million, by agreement with Treasury Ministers.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive's Standard Terms and Conditions of Grant for the Social Inclusion Fund sets out our requirements in relation to grants made under this funding package and in particular the obligations of the grant recipient for Social Inclusion Partnership (SIP) funding.</p>

  <p>Under these conditions all land and buildings and all moveable property with a value of &#163;50,000 or more purchased with the aid of Social Inclusion Partnership Fund funding shall be owned by the grant recipient and shall not be disposed of during the grant funding period without the consent of Scottish ministers.</p>

  <p>In the event of a SIP funded project closing down what would happen to the monies allocated to the project and any equipment purchased by the project using public funds will depend on the specific terms and conditions under which the grant had been allocated by the grant recipient, which at present will be the local authority, to the SIP. The terms and conditions of grant adopted by grant recipients are formulated by themselves, not the Executive and therefore vary across Scotland.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive when it received the report by Steer Davies Gleave, <i>Evaluation of the Rural Transport Fund</i> ; what action has been taken to implement any of the report&#146;s recommendations, and, in particular, what action it has taken, or proposes to take, regarding the Rural Petrol Station Grant Scheme.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive received the Steer Davies Gleave evaluation of the Rural Transport Fund in January 2001.</p>

  <p>The evaluation made a number of recommendations across a range of issues, and the Scottish Executive has responded by implementing a number of these. In particular the distance criterion for support to Rural Petrol Stations for installation of LPG tanks and dispensers has been reduced from 30 to 15 miles.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is also co-operating with the work of the Scottish National Rural Partnership to improve a number of aspects of life in rural areas including those that are transport related.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer, further to his answer to question S1W-20307 on 12 December 2001, when, or within what timescale, Flour City Architectural Metals (UK) Ltd should have provided a Performance Bond; what specific obligations the bond was to cover; what attempts were made to secure compliance with the contractual requirement to provide a bond, and when, and by whom, any such attempts were made.</p>

  <p>The contract with Flour City Architectural Metals (UK) Ltd <strong> </strong> specified that <strong> </strong> a Performance Bond should be provided within 10 working days of the contract being completed as a deed. The contract was signed on 1 August 2001 and the Performance Bond was therefore requested by 15 August 2001.</p>

  <p>The Performance Bond should have covered 10% of the full contract value in the event that Flour City Architectural Metals (UK) Ltd were unable to fulfil their contract obligations.</p>

  <p>Verbal requests to the contractor for provision of a Performance Bond were made, initially, by the Construction Managers, Bovis Lend Lease (Scotland) Limited, by telephone and at package meetings. This was followed by the issue of a Notice Of Failure, specifically referring to the failure to provide a Performance Bond, on 30 August 2001 by the Holyrood Project Team. Ultimately, stipulations were also made at meetings with the President and Chairman of Flour City International Inc. by the Holyrood Project Team. This activity all took place between June and October 2001.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer what mechanisms the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body has to review the performance of tenderers for Parliament contracts.</p>

  <p>The tendering procedures followed by the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body are documented in the Parliament's <i>Procurement Procedures Manual</i> . The performance of tenderers is routinely evaluated, as part of the selection process, following receipt of completed tender documentation, and may involve taking up references and other reports, site visits and financial viability checks. The extent of this evaluation will be dependent on the nature, value and risk of the contract.</p>

  <p>In certain circumstances potential tenderers for Parliament contracts might be asked to complete a pre-qualification questionnaire, which requests information on a wide range of a company's operations, including their financial and technical capability. Companies may be excluded from the bidding process after evaluation of the results. Applications that do not reach the minimum acceptable score set, or not received before pre-set deadlines, are automatically deemed to be ineligible to tender.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body routinely excludes bidders from the tendering process to ensure that the quality of prospective contractors fully meets the requirements of the Parliament. Grounds for exclusion vary according to the nature and value of each particular contract; examples are inadequate management structures, staffing levels, financial and technical capabilities or quality of systems in place. A lack of similar previous experience or the capacity required to carry out the terms of the contract generally, would also be grounds for exclusion. The Parliament would not normally identify individual companies and release the specific reasons for their exclusion, for reasons of commercial confidentiality.</p>
