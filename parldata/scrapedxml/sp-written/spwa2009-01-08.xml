In April 2008, the average capacity of publicly funded mainstream schools was 360. Information on the capacity of special schools was not collected.

  <p>The &pound;1 million of additional funding has been included in the allocations to community justice authorities (CJAs) for 2009-10 to achieve the desired outcome that offenders start their community service orders more quickly, and for orders to be completed in a shorter timeframe.

  <p>SIGN Guideline 108, on the management of patients with stroke or TIA: assessment, investigation, immediate management and secondary prevention, published on 16 December 2008 deals with the early management of stroke or TIA, and focuses on aspects of immediate management, such as early assessment and imaging, thrombolysis and access to a stroke unit. It includes guidance on vision assessment immediately after stroke. NHS Quality Improvement Scotland is currently consulting on bringing its clinical standards for stroke services into line with SIGN guideline 108.</p>

  <p>We are also in the process of revising our CHD and stroke strategy, and received a number of consultation comments dealing with sensory impairments. There has been a particular emphasis on all aspects of rehabilitation following stroke, and the services people need to support them through the process of recovery once they are back in the community. We are considering how best to reflect these concerns in the revised strategy, which is due for publication in early this year.</p>

  <p>SIGN Guideline 64, on stroke rehabilitation, prevention and management of complications, and discharge planning, is being updated and is due to be published in November 2009. Guidance on vision rehabilitation is expected to be included and the evidence is currently being considered by the guideline development group.</p>

  <p>The revision of SIGN Guideline 46, on the early management of head injury, which is expected to be published in May 2009, does not include guidance on vision rehabilitation. A proposal for a SIGN guideline on rehabilitation after head injury has been accepted, but SIGN has not allocated a start date yet.</p>

  <p>&pound;1.2 million funding has been provided to appoint rehabilitation co-ordinators in each NHS board. The co-ordinators will work across health and social care to support the implementation of the Delivery Framework for Adult Rehabilitation. The framework will change the way that rehabilitation services, including services for those with visual impairment, are delivered; improve accessibility, ensure that services are delivered locally, where possible, and that services are integrated, co-ordinated and provide a seamless patient journey that respects people&rsquo;s potential to overcome barriers to independent living.</p>

  <p>The Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 (Scheme of Assistance) Regulations 2008 were approved by the Parliament in November 2008. Statutory guidance for local authorities on those regulations and related duties under part 2 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 is expected to be issued shortly, with guidance on other aspects of part 2 and on local authority powers and duties in part 1 of the act expected to follow soon thereafter. All the relevant provisions in parts 1 and 2 of the act come into force on 1 April 2009, with the powers in the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 that they replace being repealed at 31 March 2010 so that local authorities have a transitional year in which they can choose the point at which they adopt the new powers.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to the conservation of seal populations in Scotland&rsquo;s marine environment.</p>

  <p>The common seal survey of 2006 first revealed a significant reduction in common seal numbers in the Northern Isles (i.e. Orkney and Shetland) and in the Firth of Tay. There was no comparable reduction in common seal numbers in the Outer Hebrides or in the Moray Firth. The Scottish Government is awaiting the results of the common seal survey for 2007.</p>

  <p>In March 2007, in light of our concerns about the decline in common seal numbers, Scottish ministers introduced seal conservation orders covering Shetland, Orkney and most of the east coast of Scotland to provide additional protection for common seals in the affected areas.</p>

  <p>I understand that preliminary scientific analyses suggest it is unlikely that any single factor is responsible for the reduction in common seal numbers. The Scottish Government has instituted a major research programme to establish the proximate causes of the reduction in common seal numbers.</p>

  <p>Surveys of grey seal numbers have not identified any declines in the national population. The Scottish Government is awaiting the results of the survey for 2007.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government continues to address best practice in consulting with service users.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Procurement Directorate issued guidance in August 2008 which stated that, prior to tendering, &quot;Contracting authorities should have a strategy for the procurement of social care services which recognises the need to maintain the quality and continuity of services and addresses the concerns of vulnerable service users and their relatives&quot;. The guidance is available on the Scottish Government&rsquo;s website at:</p>

  <p>Community pharmacists have already requested that they are given the authority to access their patient&rsquo;s electronic emergency care summary records. Work is underway to give careful consideration to the possibilities around extending both the users of this system, and the information it contains. While community pharmacists will be considered within this exercise, it should be pointed out that there is already a facility in place for when patients are not known to a community pharmacy and therefore have no medication record to hand. An example would be a patient on holiday who has forgotten to bring their medication. The facility involves a special phone line to NHS 24 pharmacists, who are already authorised to consult the emergency care summary and are able to discuss the case with their community pharmacist colleagues.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Planning Policy (SPP) sets out the government&rsquo;s priorities for planning and key policy issues rather than performance. The government intends to promote the use of processing agreements for major or national planning applications made under the Planning etc. (Scotland) Act which will link the period for determination more closely to the circumstances of each case. Where no processing agreement is in place, statutory periods for determining planning applications will remain. Accordingly, the reference to performance targets, previously set out in SPP1, was not included in the recent SPP.</p>

  <p>From March this year, and annually thereafter, planning authorities will prepare improvement plans as part of their commitment to delivering planning reform. Following the Crerar review, and in line with the government&rsquo;s commitment to the simplification of the public sector, the government wishes to see a more proportionate and coherent approach to the scrutiny of public services, involving fewer organisations, less duplication and less bureaucracy.</p>

  <p>The Strategic Transport Projects Review has recommended 29 transport interventions over the next 20 years that will let us plan for the delivery of an efficient, integrated transport network fit for the 21st century.</p>

  <p>Included in the scheme to upgrade the A96 to dual carriageway between Inverness and Nairn is a new link connecting the A96 and the A9 (south of Inverness). This new link would provide relief by allowing traffic travelling between the A9 and A96 to avoid the Raigmore Interchange. Economic analysis suggests that it offers good value for money and would contribute significantly towards the strategic objectives of the National Transport Strategy.</p>

  <p>Upgrading the A9 remains a priority for the Scottish Government and is clearly identified as such within the Strategic Transport Projects Review (STPR) and current design work is progressing to dual the Birnam to Luncarty section.</p>

  <p>The STPR provides a robust framework of prioritised schemes, the delivery of which will be prioritised in each spending review.</p>

  <p>A timetable for undertaking the phase 1 work on the A9 upgrade from Dunblane to Inverness will therefore be developed as part of this prioritisation process.</p>

  <p>The Strategic Transport Projects Review has recommended 29 transport interventions over the next 20 years that will let us plan for the delivery of an efficient, integrated transport network fit for the 21st century.</p>

  <p>Delivering the Forth Replacement Crossing is the key strategic priority for Scotland. Alongside this, we will also deliver further rail interventions such as the Edinburgh to Glasgow Improvements Programme and improvements to the Highland Main Line.</p>

  <p>These and the remaining interventions represent the clear priorities for this government over the next 20 years and will be delivered subject to subsequent spending reviews.</p>

  <p>However, other interventions, including upgrading the Redhouse roundabout, could be delivered by interested parties such as regional transport partnerships, local authorities or developers, if they consider them to be viable and the proposals are consistent with strategic priorities for this trunk road route.</p>

  <p>While the Scottish Government is aware that road works can have a financial impact on businesses, no estimate of the possible loss of revenue to businesses throughout Scotland has been made. This is because such an estimate could not be afforded any degree of accuracy as there could be a number of factors affecting the trading volumes of businesses of which road works is only one. In addition, road works on local roads are a matter for the appropriate local road authority.</p>

  <p>Spending on new projects under Rural Priorities could not begin until after the Scotland Rural Development Programme 2007-13 was approved by the European Commission earlier this year. The programme as approved fixes budgets by measure, for example those for supporting new entrants or for agri-environment payments and not by the delivery mechanism, such as Rural Priorities or Land Manager&rsquo;s Options.

  <p>The Scottish Government currently has no plans to make other child care funding available through the discretionary funds a legal right for college and university students.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government published on 10 December 2008 its <i>Early Years and Early Intervention Framework</i> which recognises that the cost and accessibility of child care is a major concern for parents in Scotland. At present, child care support for parents is a reserved matter, and is provided via the child care vouchers and child tax credit schemes. In the framework, we set out a desire for a single, accessible and more progressive system of supporting the costs of child care.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Borders is marketed by VisitScotland using the fantastic assets which it can offer its visitors. These include mountain biking and adventure sports, golf, touring, walking and other outdoors pursuits, food and drink, nature, local events, festivals and history and heritage &ndash; the list goes on and on. These great assets are promoted across the UK and overseas by VisitScotland in a number of ways, such as websites, print, direct mail and PR activity. Some of this focuses entirely on the Borders, e.g. the Borders Visitor Guide, and the dedicated visit borders website, while others feature the Borders as part of the wider promotion of Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Borders also features in the Homecoming Scotland 2009 celebrations. The &quot;Return to the Ridings&quot;; &quot;Clan Scott Society Gathering&quot; and &quot;In the Footsteps of Reivers&quot; are examples of events which are receiving funding support and being publicised globally as part of the Homecoming Initiative.</p>

  <p>The member will be particularly pleased to know that Homecoming has been the subject of our largest ever mailshot in the USA, letting 140,000 potential visitors know about the many events and excellent welcome they will receive in all parts of Scotland.</p>

  <p>In STPR Report 4, the first phase of the A9 upgrading from Dunblane to Inverness is expected to have a cost in the range &pound;500 million to &pound;1bn. This is broken down as Dunblane &ndash; Perth &pound;100 million to &pound;250 million, Broxden and Inveralmond junctions &pound;50 million to &pound;100 million, partial dualling (Perth &ndash; Blair Atholl) and 2+1 sections &pound;500 million to &pound;1 billion.</p>

  <p>Additionally, a survey of the garden lobby lighting has been carried out. This has shown that the light levels in some areas are marginally below the desired level.</p>

  <p>It is intended to address this during a planned improvement of the lighting for energy efficiency which we expect will take place during the summer recess.</p>
