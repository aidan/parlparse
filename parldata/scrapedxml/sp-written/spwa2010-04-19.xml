  <p><strong>Frank Mulholland: </strong>Information about the capacity in which an accused is prosecuted is not available and it is therefore not possible to identify the number of licence holders who have been reported to procurators fiscal.</p>

  <p>In 2007-08, 1,858 charges under the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976 were reported to procurators fiscal and no action was taken in respect of 312 of those charges.</p>

  <p>In 2008-09, 1,924 charges were reported and no action was taken in respect of 317.</p>

  <p>Procurators fiscal will take no action for a variety of reasons, including insufficient admissible evidence, mitigating circumstances and lack of jurisdiction or where it would be disproportionate, in the public interest, to take action. Full details of the considerations taken into account by prosecutors when considering whether to take action are available in the COPFS Prosecution Code which is available on the COPFS website, <a href="http://www.copfs.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.copfs.gov.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to reliably determine from centrally available NHS discharge records whether the reason for admission to an acute hospital is for a crime-related incident. However, a diagnosis of &quot;Assault by sharp object&quot; can be determined from hospital discharge records.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that a small proportion of injuries caused by a sharp object will be coded as accident, self-harm or undetermined intent yet may be related to a criminal incident. Such cases are not included in the table below.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Occupied Bed Days are calculated using the length of stay variable (i.e. date of discharge minus date of admission).</p>

  <p>2. Data are taken from the national Scottish Morbidity Record Scheme 01 (SMR01), which records all inpatient and day case discharges from non-obstetric and non-psychiatric specialties in NHS hospitals in Scotland. An SMR01 episode is generated when a patient is discharged from hospital, but also when a patient is transferred between hospitals, specialties or to the care of a different consultant. The date of discharge was used to extract the data.</p>

  <p>3. Discharges connected to assault by a sharp object have been defined using the International Classification of Disease codes ICD10 (X99) and episodes have been selected on all secondary diagnosis positions.</p>

  <p>4. In order to minimize the risk of disclosure due to small numbers, figures for ages 0-19 and 50+ have been aggregated.</p>

  <p>For information; the numbers of admissions connected to assault by a sharp object in NHS Lothian was provided in the answer to S3W-32124 on 15 March 2010. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="../../../Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx</a>.</p>

  <p>Clinicians in Scotland will follow national and local clinical guidelines to ensure the most appropriate management of people with musculoskeletal conditions whether in primary care or in secondary care. GPs should follow these protocols in relation to referral of patients to specialised hospital services.</p>

  <p>The current waiting time standard for a first outpatient consultation is that no patient should wait more than 12 weeks following a referral. Should the patient then require to receive inpatient and day case treatment they should wait no longer than 12 weeks.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are currently working on patient pathways to ensure patients get appropriate access to secondary care services swiftly. Protocols and guidelines are currently being revised between primary and secondary care sectors to ensure the delivery of the 18 weeks referral to treatment time target by the end of December 2011. These protocols should ensure the patients journey from GP to any specialised services is seamless.</p>

  <p>We have set milestone targets towards delivery of the 18 weeks referral to treatment time target. The current standards are 12 weeks for both a first outpatient consultation and for inpatient and day case treatment. The inpatient and day case treatment will reduce to nine weeks from the end of March 2011.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government are currently working with NHS boards on the development of integrated care pathways for musculoskeletal services and on re-designing services to remove delays or blockages in the patients journey through hospital services. This will ensure that the most efficient and effective good practice is also spread across the whole of NHSScotland. For example the Golden Jubilee National Hospital has developed an enhanced recovery programme for orthopaedics which has resulted in the length of stay for patients being reduced from six days to four days at the hospital.</p>

  <p>The hospital is now helping lead the development of the enhanced recovery programme in hip and knee replacements across Scotland, working alongside all other boards. The sharing of such good practice will deliver equitable and high-quality driven care through services across Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Economic Recovery Plan sets out a number of priorities to accelerate economic recovery and increase sustainable economic growth across Scotland. The plan contains measures that will support urban regeneration in Lanarkshire and elsewhere; including our joint working with European partners aimed at establishing a JESSICA fund in Scotland, and our support for town centres.</p>

  <p>In 2009-10, the Scottish Government allocated &pound;3.59 million from the Town Centre Regeneration Fund to four projects in Lanarkshire. In addition, it has also invested over &pound;40 million to date in Clyde Gateway Urban Regeneration Company, with further investment planned, and allocated a total of &pound;13.35 million from the Vacant and Derelict Land Fund to North and South Lanarkshire Councils over the period 2008-11.</p>
