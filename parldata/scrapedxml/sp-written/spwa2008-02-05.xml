  <p>There has been 1 major conference for cultural co-ordinators - Diverse Elements was held on 31 May 2004. The total cost was &pound;26,150.58 including publication of conference report and DVD.</p>

  <p>There have also been a number of smaller scale specialist training and networking events for cultural co-ordinators, as well as guidance resources and the availability of a &quot;go and see&quot; fund.

  <p>Treatment of teeth whitening is the practice of dentistry and therefore should not be carried out by unqualified people.</p>

  <p>There is no national information that reports on the number of people registered on a methadone programme in Scotland who are receiving methadone hydrochloride mixture for opiate dependence. However, the links below provide estimates of the number of people receiving methadone as part of their treatment for illicit drug misuse. This information is available by Scotland and by NHS boards only.</p>

  <p>1. In July 2005, National Services Scotland published estimates of the number of people receiving methadone as part of their treatment for illicit drug misuse in June-July 2002, 2003 and 2004, copies of which are available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 44592): <a href="http://www.drugmisuse.isdscotland.org/publications/local/isd_methadone.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.drugmisuse.isdscotland.org/publications/local/isd_methadone.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p>2. In 2006, the Scottish Government conducted a review of the place of methadone in drug treatment. As part of this review, information was collected from NHS boards and others on the number of people receiving methadone treatment for drug misuse. The findings were published by the Scottish Government in July 2007, copies of which are available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 43242) <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/06/22094632" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/06/22094632.</a></p>

  <p>The available information is given in the tables for the years for which data is available. The statistics dealing with recorded crime and court proceedings are not directly comparable for a number of reasons. A single crime or offence recorded by the police may have more than one perpetrator, or alternatively, an individual may be convicted of several cases of the same crime. There is the possibility that the crime or offence recorded by the police may be altered in the course of judicial proceedings, while a crime or offence may be recorded by the police in one year and court proceedings not concluded until a later year. Crimes and offences alleged to have been committed by children under 16 years old are also generally dealt with through the children&rsquo;s hearings system rather than through the courts.</p>

  <p>I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that in July 2007, the FSA Board agreed a stepped approach to achieve a risk-based audit and inspection regime for Specified Risk Materials (SRM) that reflects the widely accepted reduced risk to humans resulting from the reduced prevalence of BSE in cattle in the UK.</p>

  <p>In parallel, the FSA Board agreed to work towards adopting a more risk and evidence-based approach to the regulation of meat hygiene, meat inspection activities and enforcement, and for the Meat Hygiene Service (MHS) to be transformed into a leaner, more efficient organisation that will carry out its role at less cost.</p>

  <p>As the FSA Board&rsquo;s view is that, where possible, a business should pay for the official controls that are needed, the MHS will develop a new charging system that will move towards full cost recovery. This will include the costs of applying SRM controls, which have been met by central government since they were first introduced in 1989. Reducing the costs of the controls and progressively increasing charging to industry will encourage businesses to make more efficient use of the MHS, and enable the FSA to target any continuing subsidy to plants most in need. There is on-going extensive consultation with stakeholders as this work progresses.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government and equivalents in the other UK countries are also working with the European Commission to raise the age threshold at which adult bovines are subject to BSE testing before the carcase can be released into the food chain. Once this increase is agreed in Brussels and implemented here, it will help to further reduce the compliance costs for meat plants processing older cattle.</p>

  <p>Scots is a valuable part of our cultural life. I am keen to see its use promoted in education, the arts and literature. For this reason I have asked for an audit of what measures are currently in place to promote the Scots language, and what opportunities exist to make further progress.</p>

  <p>The cycle of reporting for the Third Periodic Report on the Council of Europe Charter for Regional and Minority Languages has commenced and the Scottish Government will be providing information to the Council of Europe in connection with the undertakings which have been agreed for Gaelic and Scots.</p>

  <p>In connection with the Scots language, the Scottish Government will be writing to authorities and public bodies to remind them of the Charter undertakings and to ask what provision is in place in their areas. At a later stage we will be informing the Council of Europe of the terms of our proposed audit of Scots language provision and the progress we hope to make with this in connection with our Charter undertakings.</p>

  <p>My colleague, the Minister for Schools and Skills, and I have both met and corresponded with a range of Scots language organisations. This includes groups supported by the Scottish Arts Council and others.</p>

  <p>The fundamental aim behind the United Nation&rsquo;s International Year of Languages, 2008, is the preservation and promotion of linguistic diversity. We share this aim, welcome this initiative and will encourage local authorities and schools to engage with national and international initiatives such as this.</p>

  <p>The proposals in the previous administration&rsquo;s report, <em>A Strategy for Scotland&rsquo;s Languages</em>, are being taken forward by a range of business areas within the Scottish Government.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is taking a holistic approach to tackling all forms of religious intolerance and the development of interfaith dialogue. Our priorities are to focus on community and grassroots initiatives, as well as high-profile national events such as <em>Football for All&rsquo;s Kick-Out Bigotry</em> campaign which was launched on 20 November 2007 at Hampden Park by the First Minister, and we do not have any plans to convene a third Summit on Sectarianism.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is determined to eradicate all forms of religious bigotry, and tackling sectarianism is an important element of this. Our work in this area also includes the promotion of interfaith dialogue and we do not believe that a further strategy specifically on tackling sectarianism is needed at this time.</p>

The review will identify any gaps in the implementation of the Strategy and recommendations will be made on how it should be best progressed.</p>

  <p>Sex and Relationships Education in schools includes specific teaching around HIV and how it is transmitted.</p>

  <p>Information on sexual health and HIV is also available through a wide range of sexual health services who make condoms available free of charge. The use of condoms is essential to reduce the levels of sexually transmitted infections in Scotland.</p>
