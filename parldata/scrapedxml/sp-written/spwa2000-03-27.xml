  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will examine the proposal to create a site of special scientific interest on 75% of the arable land on the Isle of Berneray, Western Isles and whether it will list the 28 restrictive conditions to be imposed on crofting activity on the island.</p>

  <p>Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) is statutorily responsible for the notification of areas as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs). The SSSI on Berneray is being notified to underpin the North Uist, Machair &amp; Islands Special Protection Area, which is required to deliver the Government&#8217;s international responsibilities under the EC Wild Birds Directive.</p>

  <p>As part of the SSSI notification, SNH has listed those operations which it considers could risk damaging the conservation interest for which the site has been notified. The list does not impose a general prohibition on any of these operations. Its purpose is to provide for consultation with SNH in advance, if an owner or occupier within the SSSI intends to carry out a listed operation. This process gives SNH the opportunity to appraise proposals for changes in the management of the land to ensure that they are consistent with its special interest.</p>

  <p>I understand from SNH that the designation of the area as a SSSI should not significantly restrict crofting activity on Berneray</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-3568 by Susan Deacon on 11 February 2000, why the waiting times for coronary artery bypass grafts and other cardiac surgery vary widely between health boards and what it will do to reduce both waiting times and the level of variance.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-03-27.6.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80146" speakername="Susan Deacon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa0327.htm#4469">

  <p>The variations between health boards in waiting times for coronary artery bypass surgery and other cardiac surgery are the result of a number of different factors, of which the severity of disease in individual patients is a key factor.</p>

  <p>It is for clinicians to determine the priority to be assigned in any given case. Those who need surgery on an emergency or urgent basis may never be on the waiting list at all. The Coronary Heart Disease Task Force has drawn up standard criteria for the management of patients awaiting cardiac surgery, based on clinical need. These will ensure that patients on the waiting list are managed actively and the system will respond appropriately, especially if there is any deterioration in a patient&#8217;s condition.</p>

  <p>The task force is working with cardiologists throughout Scotland to draw up common referral practices and is developing the concept of a national Managed Clinical Network for cardiac surgery. These initiatives, together with the work to establish national maximum waiting times for cardiac surgery, will help to overcome any geographical bias, while enhancing equity of access to services.</p>

  <p>Hormonal emergency contraception is at present available through community pharmacies but only on prescription.</p>

  <p>The Medicines Control Agency is currently considering applications to re-classify hormonal emergency contraception from prescription-only to pharmacy availability, so that it can be obtained from a pharmacy without a prescription. Careful consideration will be given to risks and benefits on the basis of a thorough evaluation of evidence, to ensure safe use without medical supervision. Expert advice will be sought from the Committee on Safety of Medicines, and there will be a period of public consultation before the Medicines Control Agency reaches a decision.</p>

  <p>I accompanied the First Minister, the Deputy First Minister, and the Minister for Finance to a lunchtime meeting with the Governor and other representatives of the Bank of England during their recent visit to Scotland. A number of issues of mutual interest were discussed.</p>

  <p>Decisions on interest rates are a reserved issue, taken independently by the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee to meet the UK Government's inflation target. The UK Government does not have an exchange rate target. The Bank of England Act 1998 provides that regional and sectoral information should feed into the Monetary Policy Committee&#8217;s decisions. The Bank has a well-established agency in Scotland, which gives it a first-hand, up-to-date account of economic conditions here. The Scottish Executive has regular contacts with the agency.</p>

  <p>Question S1W-3658 explained the base formula used from 1997-98. With the full agreement of CoSLA, the formula was adjusted from 1999-2000 to account for anticipated capital receipts as the Scottish Executive had abolished the requirement to use 50% of such receipts for debt redemption. The new approach increased Argyll and Bute&#8217;s base allocation from 3.9% to 4.3% of the total.</p>

  <p>Copies of the detailed calculations are available to councils on request.</p>

  <p>The GAE allowances for individual services are not spending targets or limits, but contribute towards the calculation of councils&#8217; total grant allocations. The factors determining that calculation in respect of school transport did not change between 1999-2000 and 2000-01. In 2000-01 Government Supported Expenditure will rise by 3.7% to &pound;6,746 million. Within that, provision for education will increase by 4.3%. It is a matter for local authorities to determine their spending priorities and allocate resources accordingly.</p>

  <p>Grant-aided expenditure for school transport was allocated in 1999-2000 on the basis of school age population adjusted by a secondary indicator of rural settlement pattern. For 2000-01 CoSLA agreed the use of a new secondary indicator, population dispersion as a more plausible measure of councils&#8217; relative school transport costs, which has resulted in a different distribution. &quot;Damping&quot; arrangements have been introduced to give extra support to councils facing a reduction in GAE as a result of the change in indicator.</p>

  <p>Indicators used for GAE distribution are set out in the Grant Aided Expenditure 2000-01 <i>Green Book</i>, copies of which are available from the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe).</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive introduced a Safety and Statutory Standards Action Plan in December 1999. The Action Plan was agreed with the Health and Safety Executive. The Action Plan commits the Scottish Executive to the monitoring of compliance. Where there is cause for concern, the Department will carry out an investigation by calling for further information from the body and considering that alongside the body&#8217;s Property Strategy and any other relevant documentation, e.g. their health and safety action plan. If the Scottish Executive&#8217;s concerns cannot be satisfactorily addressed, then the Department and/or the NHS body may seek advice from HSE.</p>

  <p>NHS in Scotland bodies will be asked shortly to provide details of the performance of their property as at April 2000. This will include compliance with statutory standards. Bodies will also be asked to identify the year-on-year targets they have agreed and included in their Property Strategies for 2000-05 for improvements in the performance of their essential building area, including statutory standards.</p>

  <p>Based on information provided by NHS Trusts and other NHS in Scotland bodies last year the percentage of essential building area fully compliant with safety and statutory standards has increased from 71% in 1997 to 77% in 1999.</p>

  <p>Road <strong> </strong> congestion imposes costs on business and the wider economy but, as the SACTRA report <i>Transport and the Economy</i> states, the linkages between transport and the economy are far from straightforward.

  <p>The Scottish Executive has made no recent changes in the way its responsibilities for trunk roads in Dumfries and Galloway are administered. At present the management of the operation and maintenance of these roads are undertaken by the South West Partnership, a managing agent consortia of local authorities including Dumfries and Galloway, South Ayrshire, East Ayrshire, North Ayrshire, Inverclyde and Renfrewshire. The existing contract under which this work is undertaken will end on 31 March 2001, along with all other maintenance contracts across the Scottish motorway and trunk road network.</p>

  <p>The arrangements for the future stand to be re-tendered within the scope of European procurement rules. I have announced in my answer to Karen Gillon on 24 December 1999 (question S1W-3538) that the new arrangement will involve the appointment of four operating companies covering the full Scottish motorway and trunk road network. These operating companies will provide a more comprehensive range of services than the managing agents, including the responsibility for undertaking works. I was informed in this decision by responses to <i>The Road Ahead</i> consultation document, which was published by the Scottish Office on 14 April 1999.</p>

  <p>In December the Scottish Executive published guidance on <i>Safer Routes to School</i> . Copies of the guidance have been sent to each local authority and every school in Scotland. The purpose of the guidance is to provide a toolkit of measures which can be used to remove barriers to children walking and cycling to and from school.</p>

  <p>I intend to commence shortly the Road Traffic Reduction Act 1997 in Scotland. Once commenced, local authorities will be required to produce a report to assess existing levels of traffic on their roads, forecast expected growth in these levels and set targets for reducing levels of road traffic.</p>

  <p>I am in the process of commissioning a pilot study of Home Zones in Scotland. One of the aims of the study will be to assess the effectiveness of a range of techniques, including speed reducing and traffic calming measures, that roads authorities may use to implement Home Zones. Another aim of the research is to evaluate the extent to which the broad quality of life aims of Home Zones can be achieved within existing legislation.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is currently evaluating the effectiveness of 20mph pilot projects implemented in a number of local authority areas throughout Scotland in 1998. The pilot projects are testing the effectiveness of 20mph schemes which do not include the use of relatively expensive engineering measures to force down the speed of traffic. The final results will be available in September and the final report published soon after.</p>

  <p>On 1 March the Scottish Executive and the UK Government published a GB strategy to reduce road traffic casualties. Among other things, the strategy includes measures to protect vulnerable road users such as children, pedestrians and cyclists.</p>

This paper describes the standards the three water authorities will work towards between 2000 and 2002. The Scottish Executive is committed to timely implementation of all EU legislation. The water authorities have responsibility for managing and implementing the projects, in line with the timescales in the Directive. The Scottish Executive is keeping this matter under review, and is satisfied that the authorities are taking all practicable steps to comply with the deadlines specified in the Directive.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive <a name="QuestionText">whether it intends to review the structure of Scotland&#8217;s water authorities, in the light of the recent announcement regarding the water industry regulator&#8217;s willingness to consider mergers of water companies in England and Wales.</a></p>

  <p>The Executive is aware of the possibility of mergers among the privatised water companies in England and Wales and has no plans for a review of the structure of the publicly-owned water authorities in Scotland.</p>
