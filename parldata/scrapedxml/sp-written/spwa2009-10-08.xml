  <p>Skills Development Scotland&rsquo;s database shows that since February this year 397 apprentices have been registered as redundant. One hundred and thirty-seven of those were made redundant since 10 June, the date the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Adopt an Apprentice scheme was implemented.</p>

  <p>Since February 208 apprentices have been re-employed as apprentices following redundancy, including 149 through the Adopt an Apprentice Scheme.</p>

  <p>Training providers have a contractual obligation to try to secure alternative employment for trainees who lose their jobs. I know that, between March and September this year, ConstructionSkills matched over 200 redundant apprentices with alternative employers.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many government-funded needle-exchange programmes operate in pharmacies in the east end of Glasgow compared with September 2008.</p>

  <p>Information on the number of government-funded injecting equipment provision services operating in pharmacies in the east end of Glasgow is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>On 30 June 2009, the Information Services Division of NHS Scotland published its report <em>Provision of Injecting Equipment in Scotland 2007-08, </em>which detailed the findings of a survey of injecting equipment provision in Scotland in 2007-08. This survey, which was commissioned as part of the Hepatitis C Phase 2 Action Plan, does report on provision of services on a health board basis. The survey found that there were a total of 44 pharmacy-based needle exchange services in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde in 2007-08. However, this figure reflects only those pharmacies that responded to the survey and gaps in the data does exist. Therefore, the actual number of pharmacy-based injecting equipment provision services may be higher.</p>

  <p>The information from 2007-08 survey provides a baseline of injecting equipment provision in Scotland at the start of the Hepatitis C Phase 2 Action Plan. A follow-up survey covering the period 2008-09 is planned to run in February 2010, with the results being published in November 2010.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what recommendations have been agreed following the review of Learning and Teaching Scotland.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-10-08.S3W-28071.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80289" speakername="Keith Brown" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa1008.htm#6">

  <p>I am pleased to be able to announce to Parliament the outcome of the review of Learning and Teaching Scotland (LTS).</p>

  <p>The review has taken place as part of the simplification of the public sector landscape. A fundamental review of LTS was undertaken and, more importantly, the tasks and functions that the education community requires from national bodies and from government.</p>

  <p>The findings of the review clearly indicate that there is a need for a national body that provides guidance, support and advice on matters related to learning and teaching, the curriculum, Glow and ICT in schools, and that Learning and Teaching Scotland should undertake this role, in conjunction with other organisations where appropriate.</p>

  <p>Having considered the findings I have agreed the following recommendations. These are that:</p>

  <p>LTS should be retained as an non-departmental public body,</p>

  <p>LTS should have a core remit of areas for which it has lead responsibility (see below for further details),</p>

  <p>LTS should make contributions to a number of other areas where it is important that it is involved,</p>

  <p>LTS and the Scottish Government to agree additional areas where it may make a contribution,</p>

  <p>A process should be established to ensure that the annual work plan of LTS is formally agreed with COSLA as well as the Scottish Government,</p>

  <p>LTS should have a single budget allocation from the Scottish Government that is negotiated annually although it is recognised that amount may need to be revised in year if circumstances change.</p>

  <p>COSLA has agreed to be involved in an annual discussion with LTS about setting of the priorities for the organisation. In addition, COSLA will nominate a representative as observer to provide advice to the LTS board.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will now work with Learning and Teaching Scotland to implement the recommendations, involving other key stakeholders.</p>

  <p>Learning and Teaching Scotland (LTS) Core Remit:</p>

  <p>Curriculum &ndash; to keep the curriculum 3-18 under review and provide advice and support, including quality assured resources, on the curriculum 3-18 to ministers and the education system;</p>

  <p>Assessment &ndash; to provide advice and support to ministers and the education system on assessment to support learning, with support from SQA as appropriate, and to work with SQA to ensure the availability of quality assured resources to support assessment;</p>

  <p>Glow and ICT in Schools &ndash; to provide advice and support to ministers and the education system on the use of ICT to support education, to establish and maintain technology standards for education, to ensure practitioners have easy online access to advice and support, including digital resources and to manage the provision of the national ICT infrastructure to support education, currently Glow, the LTS online service and the local authority Interconnect;</p>

  <p>As a public body, LTS will have a number of generic core responsibilities (in addition to its various legal duties), including:</p>

  <p>Ensuring the services it provides are high quality, continually improving, efficient and responsive to need (National Outcome 15 in the National Performance Framework),</p>

  <p>Ensuring that everything it does contributes to creating a more successful country with opportunities for all of Scotland to flourish through sustainable economic growth (the National Purpose in the Government Economic Strategy),</p>

  <p>Ensuring it works with other public bodies to make a planned contribution to the achievement of the National Outcomes that maximises outcomes and minimises net public sector costs.</p>

  <p>The Energy Assistance Package offers insulation and heating measures for eligible households living in residential mobile homes. These will proceed once technical development of the most appropriate measures for mobile homes has been completed in the near future.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government also funds a number of schemes managed by the Energy Saving Trust which provide support for permanently sited mobile homes.</p>

  <p>These steps reflect Scottish Government research on mobile homes which highlighted affordable warmth and fuel poverty as significant issues.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-25590 by Alex Neil on 23 July 2009, whether it is now in a position to provide a breakdown of how the funding under the Home Insulation Scheme will be spent.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-10-08.S3W-27661.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80370" speakername="Alex Neil" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa1008.htm#8">

  <p>The Energy Saving Trust (EST), as managing agent for the Home Insulation Scheme, is grant funded by the Scottish Government up to a maximum of &pound;14.95 million to directly deliver a range of services in 2009-10 and to procure the delivery of energy efficiency measures, with related additional financial leverage, by third parties.</p>

  <p>The first part of funding within an agreed range of between &pound;5.26 million and &pound;5.8 million (average &pound;5.5 million) directly delivers services to up to 100,000 households in 10 council areas. The services comprise awareness raising, doorstep visits, tailored energy advice, and onward referral of suitable properties for the fitting of insulation measures. The information gathered in this phase will also support better data collection and help councils, government and others to plan future developments.</p>

  <p>That leaves a balance of at least &pound;9.15 million within the Scottish Government contribution to the scheme. The sum is larger than anticipated and has allowed ministers to expand the range of free or discounted measures provided beyond those originally foreseen in the budget to include top-up loft insulation and a range of support through an enabling fund.</p>

  <p>The Energy Saving Trust will procure the delivery of all insulation measures by third parties. This will include a combination of energy efficiency measures provided under the UK Carbon Emission Reduction Target (CERT) programme, which will be part paid for by able-to-pay households and additional measures, either free or discounted, which are not normally available under CERT, directly funded by the Scottish Government.</p>

  <p>&pound;750,000, within the &pound;9.15 million, has been provisionally allocated for an enabling fund to facilitate the uptake of energy efficiency measures in remote rural and island areas, and to support the cost of a list of defined items that enable the provision of energy efficiency measures, for example scaffolding and loft hatches.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government committed &pound;15 million to the scheme and the grant covers &pound;14.95 million. The remaining &pound;50,000 will be used for evaluation of the scheme.</p>

  <p>Full details of how the arrangements work is set out in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Grant Offer Letter to the EST and I have arranged for a copy of that to be placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 49351).</p>

  <p>EST is already the grant-funded provider of the Energy Assistance Programme. The decision to run EAP and HIS through the same provider minimised the funds associated with a national delivery infrastructure and shortened the learning curve of how to establish a scheme as well as simplifying the customer journey.</p>

  <p>The Energy Saving Trust has been grant funded &pound;14.95 million to deliver a range of services to benefit up to 100,000 households in 10 council areas. Councils have already committed &pound;750,000 in complementary investment. In addition the process of fitting insulation measures should lever funding from the UK Carbon Energy Reduction Target scheme and from households. That means the total funding spent during 2009-10 will not be known until the end of the financial year. Most funds will be spent on direct services to benefit up to 100,000 households. Funds spent by Energy Savings Trust in centrally-based staff and IT are estimated to be &pound;623,000. (a) That figure represents 4% of government grant but will be a much lower percentage of the total scheme funds once the additional contributions have been included. (b) The central overheads represent a little over &pound;6 per home visited.</p>

  <p>Indicative targets set for Energy Saving Trust were to achieve 75,000 individual contacts from potentially fuel-poor clients for the Energy Assistance Package (EAP) in 2009-10. It was expected that 50,000 referrals would be made under stage 2, 30,000 at stage 3 and 10,000 at stage 4. The indicative targets are for a 12 month period and it was expected that numbers would build over the year in response to colder weather, awareness of the new package and marketing activity.</p>

  <p>The Fuel Poverty Forum recommended the Scottish Government replace the Central Heating Programme with an Energy Assistance Package that addresses both the home and the householder, and includes tariff advice, welfare benefit and tax credit advice and energy audit with access to grants and loans to improve energy efficiency. Intended outcomes of the EAP are improved energy efficiency, income maximisation and reduction of fuel bills. Installation of central heating systems is only one of the outputs contributing to these outcomes.</p>

  <p>Stage 4 offers eligible households a menu of enhanced physical measures to improve the energy efficiency of the home. Each individual household receives a package of measures tailored to their home and these can include central heating systems, insulation and draught proofing.</p>

  <p>The applications referred to in the answer to question S3W-26888 were all at different stages of the process, but we would expect most to follow through to successful installation of measures. A minority of applications will be found not to be eligible at survey, or the applicant will decide to withdraw their application before completion. Under previous programmes it usually took an average of around six months from application to successful implementation of measures, though in 2008-09 the average time taken to successfully process applications was reduced to an average of five months.</p>

  <p>The Energy Assistance Package (EAP) is delivered through a Scottish Government partnership with 10 primary delivery partners. These are: Energy Saving Trust; managing agent for stage 4 (currently Scottish Gas); Citizens Advice Direct; Pensions Service; Scottish Gas (CERT provider); Scottish Power (CERT provider); Scottish and Southern (CERT provider); EDF (Cert Provider); Eon (CERT provider), and nPower (CERT provider).</p>

  <p>Energy Saving Trust manage the overall EAP programme and deliver energy efficiency advice through the Energy Saving Scotland Advice Network. Stage 2 is delivered through referrals by EST to the Pensions Service and Citizens Advice Direct. EST refer stage 3 work to CERT providers and stage 4 to the managing agent. It is a matter for CERT providers and the managing agent whether they carry out work themselves or subcontract to other companies; however we understand that a number of large and small companies are used. The Scottish Government believes that all work should be tendered in a fair and transparent way that complies with EU procurement guidance and supports small businesses to be able to compete for work.</p>

  <p>The Energy Assistance Package offers a range of services and products to help tackle fuel poverty through improving energy efficiency, reducing fuel bills and maximising incomes. The package is not intended to bring properties up to a benchmark standard of energy efficiency as in the case of the Scottish Housing Quality Standard. The package directs government resources to helping those most likely to be in fuel poverty, targeting enhanced physical measures at those on the lowest incomes living in the least energy efficient homes (sap 38 or below). The sap rating of homes receiving stage four measures to date have increased by an average of 49 points.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the &pound;7.2 million balance of the &pound;15 million for the Home Insulation Scheme will fund, in light of the <em>Official Journal of the European Union</em> advert inviting tenders for the Home Insulation Scheme at &pound;7.8 million.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to the answer to question S3W-27661 on 8 October 2009 which sets out how the total grant funding for the scheme is allocated. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="../../../Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx</a> .</p>

  <p>A minimum of &pound;9.1 million of government funding will be available for those Home Insulation Scheme measures which need to be the subject of a procurement exercise. That exercise will also be how the bulk of additional contributions to the scheme over and above the government&rsquo;s &pound;15 million contribution are levered.</p>

  <p>The <em>Official Journal of the European Union </em>(OJEU) advert excludes VAT as required by OJEU procedures, which is why the figure included in the advert differs from that in the grant offer letter.</p>

  <p>The number of applicants between 6 April and 31 August 2009 who have been referred for different types of help under the Energy Assistance Package within each local authority are shown in the following table. It is expected that the number of applicants will increase during autumn and winter and in response to marketing activity, including the television advertisement campaign launched on 18 September.</p>

  <p>Information on the household characteristics of all those who apply to the Energy Assistance Package is not available. Those applicants that are referred for Stage 4 will be required to provide details of age and receipt of qualifying benefits to establish their eligibility for measures at Stage 4, but this information will not be held for all applicants to other stages of the package.</p>

  <p>As one of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s 10 Energy Pledges, energy efficiency is a key element of both our economic recovery programme and our climate change response. The Scottish Government is taking action across all sectors, aimed at reducing energy demand, cutting carbon emissions and contributing to sustainable economic growth.</p>

  <p>The Climate Change (Scotland) Act commits us to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 42% by 2020 and by 80% by 2050, and includes a mandatory provision to publish an Energy Efficiency Action Plan and report on its progress annually to parliament.</p>

  <p>The Energy Efficiency Action Plan consultation paper will be released this month, with the plan being published following the consultation. The consultation paper will outline action that we have taken to date on energy efficiency and microgeneration, and seek feedback on what more we all could be doing.</p>

  <p>We are also working with the energy companies to leverage more delivery of the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT), the main mechanism we have for improving domestic energy efficiency, and the insulation work that goes with this. CERT measures in Scotland are being delivered in a way that is complementary to our Energy Assistance Package. We continue to fund the Energy Saving Trust and Carbon Trust to provide energy efficiency advice to all sectors and have now introduced our area-based Home Insulation Scheme.</p>

  <p>As a challenge-based prize it is difficult to predict the exact date of the &pound;10 million award. However, the Saltire Prize has been allocated within the current spending review period with the &pound;10 million committed in period 2010-11.</p>

  <p>Any death from fire is a tragedy. I recognise the vital work of our Fire and Rescue Services across Scotland, particularly on fire safety and prevention. The good work done has contributed to the long term downward trend in fire deaths. The latest figures show that the total number of primary fires &ndash; including house fires &ndash; were down for the eighth consecutive year.</p>

  <p>But I recognise that more needs to be done. This was why I, with the support of COSLA, asked Brian Sweeney, Chief Officer for Strathclyde Fire and Rescue to establish a group to examine the root causes of fire deaths and injuries.</p>

  <p>I expect Mr Sweeney to publish his report next month. Due to the seriousness of this issue, I have requested a debate to give members the opportunity to fully discuss the report in Parliament.</p>

  <p>The independent Scottish Fuel Poverty Forum meets quarterly. The Minister for Housing and Communities has not met the forum as a collective group but has met with individual member organisations at a number of different events. For example, the minister addressed a stakeholder event on 27 February 2009, chaired by the chair of the forum on the subject of the Energy Assistance Package and CERT delivery was discussed at the CERT Strategy Steering Group, chaired by the minister, on 27 May 2009.</p>

  <p>In considering the Draft Budget for 2010-11, the Scottish Government had to take into account the significant pressures that had arisen in 2010-11, including budget reductions imposed upon us by the UK Government, and the expectation that this pressure would grow, in line with the Treasury&rsquo;s forecasts (in the Chancellor&rsquo;s Red Book) of major capital scarcity in the medium term.</p>

  <p>As a responsible administration, the Scottish Government has had to begin planning for this period of scarcity, to help ensure that available funding continues to be directed toward front line services, and one of the steps we reluctantly decided to take was to cancel the branch line element of Glasgow Airport Rail Link, because this project required significant capital in the next three years.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many patients contracted the winter vomiting virus in NHS Ayrshire and Arran hospitals in each of the last five years, broken down by hospital.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-10-08.S3W-27273.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80396" speakername="Nicola Sturgeon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa1008.htm#13">

  <p>It is not possible to specifically identify the numbers of patients contracting norovirus (the pathogen responsible for winter vomiting) in NHS hospitals in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The following table shows (a) the number of confirmed and suspected outbreaks of norovirus (b) the total number of cases ill (i.e. displaying symptoms typical of norovirus infection) and (c) the total number of cases ill who tested positive for norovirus, as reported by hospitals in NHS Ayrshire and Arran between 2004 and 2008.</p>

  <p>The figures are derived from Health Protection Scotland&rsquo;s ObSurv surveillance system for general outbreaks of infectious intestinal diseases.</p>

  <p>For the purpose of ObSurv an outbreak is defined as an incident in which two or more linked cases experience the same illness, or when the observed number of cases unaccountably exceeds the expected number. The system seeks information on general outbreaks, defined as outbreaks affecting members of more than one household or residents of an institution.</p>

  <p>Outbreaks of Norovirus are reported as confirmed or suspected. Confirmed outbreaks are outbreaks in which one or more positive laboratory samples are obtained from cases in the outbreak. Suspected outbreaks are based on the judgement of the local infection teams/public health teams.</p>

  <p>The figures presented below are indicative and should be interpreted with caution. In particular, please note:</p>

  <p>The apparent increase in the numbers of outbreaks, cases ill and cases ill who test positive in 2008 is due to a combination of improved reporting to ObSurv and elevated UK-wide community norovirus activity in the winter of 2007-08.</p>

  <p>For further information please refer to the Health Protection Scotland website:</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The contract for the &pound;130 million HMP Low Moss was signed in July 2009. This has not been included in table (a) as subject to full planning permission being granted, construction will not commence until February 2010.</p>

  <p>2. Edinburgh Waverley Main Station Infrastructure works are complete. The last element of the project to improve accessibility of &lsquo;&lsquo;Waverley Steps&rsquo;&rsquo; continues as a stand alone project.</p>

  <p>3. Following a Parliamentary announcement on 17 September 2009, the branchline element of Glasgow Airport Rail Link/PCR has been cancelled. However, the mainline works on the Paisley corridor are being undertaken by Network Rail and funded through Regulatory Asset Base. This continues on time and budget. The current value is &pound;182 million with full passenger service expected in Q1 2012.</p>

  <p>4. Edinburgh to Glasgow Rail Improvement Programme is currently at Outline Design Stage with outline design work progressing to schedule.</p>

  <p>The member will know from my response to his recent written question, S3W-27346, that to estimate the cost of any such junction requires thorough investigation and design. As there are no current plans to construct a grade separated junction at Laurencekirk, no detailed cost information is available. However, a grade separated junction with a dual carriageway such as the A90 is typically in the range &pound;4.3 million to &pound;22 million (2002-03 prices).</p>

  <p>The development of the Scottish Investment Bank is a complex task with a wide range of issues to consider. However, good progress has been made to date, with the Scottish Investment Bank Ltd now incorporated as a legal entity by Scottish Enterprise. In addition to the &pound;150 million already earmarked for Scottish growth small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the First Minister&rsquo;s announcement of the Scottish Investment Bank, a further &pound;2 million in European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), supported by &pound;3 million matched funding from Scottish Enterprise, has been allocated to enhance the Scottish Co-investment Fund in the Highlands and Islands area. Work is continuing to consider what further resources might allow the Scottish Investment Bank to offer a wider range of financial products to Scottish growth SMEs. We will continue to keep the Parliament informed as this work progresses.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what percentage of municipal waste was sent to energy from waste (EFW) plants in each of the last five years, broken down by (a) local authority area and (b) type of EFW facility.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-10-08.S3W-27745.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80340" speakername="Richard Lochhead" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa1008.htm#27">

  <p>The following table gives a break down of the percentage of municipal waste sent to energy from waste (EFW) plants in the last five years, broken down by local authority. Historically there have been two plants in Scotland; one in Dundee (Fluidised Bed incinerator) and the other on Shetland (Moving Grate incinerator). The Shetland incinerator handles waste from Shetland Islands and Orkney Islands Councils and the Dundee incinerator waste from Dundee, Angus and Perth and Kinross Councils.</p>

  <p>In the last two years, Dumfries and Galloway Council has started to produce refuse derived fuel (RDF) from Mechanical Biological Treatment plant which they use to process their municipal waste. There are currently plans underway to send the RDF produced by the facility to be burned at the nearby Scotgen gasification facility.</p>
